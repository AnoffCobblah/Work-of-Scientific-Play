   The following Communications              were read    : —
   1 .  Description and Analysis of Gurolite, a new Mineral
                     Species.    By Dr T. Anderson.
    The mineral described and analysed by the author           was found at
Stow, in Skye, where it occurs       associated   with apophyllite, stilbite,
and other zeolitic     minerals.   It  is found principally in a compact
basalt, different from that in which       these   minerals are most abun
dant, and which appears to have been produced by a different eruption
of basaltic matter.
    Gurolite occurs in the form of radiated crystalline       masses  with a
fine lustre.    It cleaves readily   parallel   to the plates  of which the
concretions are composed, and its hardness is about 3.            Before the
blow-pipe alone it swells up, loses water, and finally fuses with some
difficulty into an    opaque glass.     Its analysis  leads to the chemical
formula 2 (Ca 0 Si 03) + 3 HO.
    The author referred to the relations which this mineral bears to
the other silicates of lime,    of which   three are already known,       the
names and formulae of which are as follows         :—

             Dysclasite,                          3 Ca O 4 Si                Ho.

     It  thus appears that gurolite          is the   same    silicate of lime as the
  kalk-trisilicat,     in union     with    water,   and    that    its relation      with
  dysclasite is such that two equivalents of gurolite differ from one of
  dysclasite by a single equivalent of lime only.
 2.  On the Constitution of Bebeerine.                    By Dr A. Von Planta.
    The author       commenced        his paper by referring to the analyses of
 Maclagan and Tilley, which gave for the composition of bebeerine a
 formula     precisely the same as that of morphia, but as that formula
 appeared to require confirmation, he had undertaken the careful re
 investigation of bebeerine.
    In    the commencement of his experiments                  he had employed the
 same process       for the purification       of bebeerine   as that recommended
 by  Dr Maclagan.           He   soon    ascertained, however, that in this way
 it was impossible to obtain           it in  a state of absolute      purity,    as even
 when every care had been taken, it always retained a small quantity
 of a substance      resembling tannine, which          caused     it slowly      to gain
 weight in the process of drying the water bath.                  After several trials
he found the following process to yield pure bebeerine : — The sub
stance already partially purified by Maclagan' s process was dissolved
in acetic     acid, and mixed with a solution              of  acetate      of lead and
caustic potash gradually          added    as long as a precipitate         of bebeerine
mixed with oxide of lead was obtained.                  The precipitate          was then
washed and dried and extracted with absolute ether, and the filtered
ethereal soluti on distilled.         A   syrupy   residue was       obtained, which
was dissolved     in absolute alcohol,         and mixed with a large quantity
of water.
    Bebeerine      so prepared       is a perfectly     colourless     and     inodorous
powder persistent in the air and highly electrical.                   It  fuses at   356°
into a colourless glassy mass.             The quantity      employed for analysis
was    from    two     different    preparations,     and     gave      the     following
results   : —

 3.       On the Vibrations of Plane-Polarised Light.                                 By W.      J.
                            Macquorn Rankine, Esq.
      If the   plane of polarisation       is   normal to the direction of vibration,
according to the conjecture of Frcsnel, which seems to be supported
by the phenomena        of reflexion, the velocity of propagation of light
 in   a   crystalline medium       function of the direction
                                   is
                                   a                             vibration.       of

                                                          4
     If,on    the contrary, the plane               of polarisation        is parallel tothedirection
of vibration, the velocity of propagation is a function of the position
of the plane which includes the direction of vibration, and the direc
tion     of transmission.
     If the   velocity of polarised light in a crystalline substance depends
on the elasticity         of the luminiferous                    medium alone, the latter view
must be adopted,             and Fresnel's             supposition         rejected      ;   for a wave of
light is     a wave      of distortion          ;    and       the rigidity, or elasticity which
resists distortion,           is,   in all conceivable media,                 a   function of the posi
tion of the plane of distortion,                      being tho same for all directions of
distortion in       a   given plane.
     But     the    experiments            of   Mr     Stokes on diffracted                  light (Cambr.
Trans., Vol. ix., Part                1)   prove that Fresnel's conjecture                      is   correct,
the plane of polarisation                  being normal to the direction of vibration                         :
therefore the propagation of light in crystalline                                  media does not de
pend on elasticity alone.
     The author of this paper                   supposes,           according to the hypothesis            of
molecular vortices (Trans. Roy. Soc. Edin., Vol. xx., Part 1), that
the medium which transmits light and radiant heat consists of the
nuclei of the atoms of matter, of very small mass, but exerting in
tense      mutual forces,vibrating almost independently of the atmo
spheres which surround them.       Each nucleus, however, carries along
with    in its oscillations
        it                    small portion of atmosphere, which acts
                                         a
as   a   load, retarding            the velocity of propagation.                        In    tho celestial
space,     this load    is    insensible, and             it     is,   generally speaking, greater,
the more dense the substance.                        In       crystalline media, the atmosphere
of   each nucleus       is   distributed round                 it   symmetrically        with respect to
three axes, but not equally in all directions                             ;   so that the load upon
the nucleus, and consequently the velocity of propagation,                                      is   a func
tion    of   the direction          ofvibration, as conjectured                    by   Fresnel.
   The author further shews, that according to this hypothesis,      the                              if
range of variation of the velocity of propagation of luminiferous trans
verse vibrations   small (as
                         is       in all known media), that velocity
                                                it   is
must vary sensibly as the reciprocal of the diameter of an ellipsoid,
drawn parallel to the direction of vibration.                                 It   is   well known that
this law     is    the foundation of the whole of Fresnel's theory of double
refraction.

4.     On the Mechanical Action of Heat.                   By W. J. Macquorn
     Rankine, Esq. Note as to the Dynamical Equivalent of
     Temperature in Liquid Water, and the Specific Heat of
     Atmospheric      Air   and Steam.
     In the   author's paper on the Mechanical Action of Heat (Trans.
Roy. Soc. Edin., Vol. xx., Part 1), the calculations depending on
the dynamical equivalent of temperature in liquid water were founded
on    the experiments of De la Roche and BeVard on the ratio of the
apparent specific heat of atmospheric air under constant pressure to
that    of water.    The equivalent thus obtained was about one-tenth
part less than Mr Joule's.          Since then, the author, having become
acquainted with the details of Mr Joule's experiments, has come to
the conclusion that     Mr Joule's     equivalent is correct to about         3JT of
its amount, and that the discrepancy in question originates                   chiefly
in the experiments of De la Roche and Berard.                      The calculations
requiring correction from this circumstance are contained in the se
cond and third sections of the above-mentioned paper, articles 14
and 20, equations 28, 34, and 36.               The following      is a summary of
 the corrected results    :—

engine require no correction ; as the discrepancy in question has no
effect on the computation of the action of the steam at full pressure,
and no effect appreciable in practice on that of its expansive action.

    The following Communications            were read    : —
1.   Notice of a Roman Practitioner's Medicine Stamp, found
            near Tranent.         By Professor Simpson.
    At  several of the stations throughout     Western   Europe that were
formerly occupied by the colonists and soldiers of Rome,                  small
engraved stones have been found, the inscriptions upon which shew
them to have been used as medicine stamps by the Roman doctors
who, many centuries ago, practised in these localities.
    These medicine stones or stamps all agree in their general charac
ters.    They commonly consist of small quadrilateral or oblong pieces
of a greenish-coloured steatite, engraved with a legend on one or more
of their edges or borders.       The inscriptions or legends are in small
capital Roman letters, cut intagliate and retrograde, and consequently
reading on the stone itself from right to left, but making an im
pression, when stamped upon wax or any other similarly plastic ma
terial, which reads from left to right.
    The inscriptions themselves generally contain, and        have engraved
on each separate side, first the name of the medical practitioner              to
whom the stamp pertained, then the name of some special medicine
or medical formula out of Galen, Scribonius Largus, or            some    of the
more popular     medical authorities     of those times    ; and,   lastly, the
name of the disease or diseases       for which that medicine         was pre
scribed.
    In almost all,  if not all, of the Roman      medicine stamps hitherto
discovered, the medicines mentioned on them are drugs for affections
of the eye, and the    diseases,  when specified, are always ophthalmic
diseases.
    Above fifty such Roman         medicine or oculist stamps have now
been discovered on the continent       of Europe, at stations occupied of
 old by the colonists and soldiers of Rome, and particularly in France,
 Germany,    and Holland.        Only two    have  been   detected    in Italy.
 About ten or twelve    have been discovered among the old Roman sta

                                           10
  tions in England.        One was, some        years ago, found amid a quan
  tity of broken tiles, brick, and other debris of an old (and probably
  Roman) house near to the church of Tranent, and consequently not
 far from the old and extensive Roman town or station of Inveresk.
  This Roman medicine stamp,            now    deposited in the Scottish      Anti
 quarian Museum,       is remarkable both as being thus found on almost
 the very frontier of the ancient Roman Empire, and as being one of
 the most perfect yet discovered.
     The  stone   is of the figure      of a parallelogram about an inch and
 a-half in length, and a quarter of an inch in thickness, and with in
 scriptions cut upon two of its sides.           The two inscriptions read as
 follows when we separate the individual           words composing them from
 each other   :—
                        1.   L. VALLATINI EVODES AD CI

                             CODES AD DIATHESIS
     When the elisions       and   contractions   which exist      in these  (as in
 almost all other Roman          inscriptions)   are supplied, the two legends
 may be read as follows       :—
     1. lucii VALLATINI        EVODES    AD CICATRICES ET ASPeRITUDINCS.
 The Evodes     of Lucius Vallatinus for cicatrices and granulations.
     Several of the collyria described in the works of Galen, Celsus,
 Aetius, &c., and inscribed        on  the oculist-stamps,     derived their de
signation from some          special physical    character.     The present in
stance is an example in point, the appellation            Evodes (iutiSej) being
derived from the pleasant odour            (sO, well, and   o^u,   I smell) of the
composition.      Marcellus, in his work        " De Medicamentis," specially
praises the collyrium       known     under the name      of Evodes; and that
too in the    class   of   eye   diseases   mentioned    on   the Tranent seal.
For, in his collection of remedies for removing ulcers, cicatrices, &c.,
of the eyes and eyelids, he recommends (to use his own words)
" prsccipue hoc quod
                           quidam Diasmyrnon, nonnulli Evodes, quia boni
odoris est, nominant."          And   he directs the Evodes        to be dissolved
and diluted in water, and introduced into the eyes with a probe, or
after inverting the eyelid, when it was used with                the view of ex
tenuating recent cicatrices of the eyes, and removing granulations               of

                                             11
the eyelids,   — "     ex aqua autem ad cicatrices               recentes       extenuendas,
et palpebrarum        asperitudinem tollendam teri debet, et subjecto spe-
cillo aut inversa palpebra, oculis inseri."               *
     Scribonius Largus had previously described, in nearly the                            same
words, the collyrium, — " quod quidam                    ivu&is    vocant," and its uses
in recent cicatrices and granulations,               &c.      Both     these    authors give
the same recipe for the composition of the Evodes,                    — viz.,    pompholyx,
burnt copper, saffron, myrrh, opium, and other ingredients, rubbed
down in Chian wine.             Its agreeable odour was probably owing to a
considerable       quantity of spikenard           being used        in its composition. -f
Galen gives two other collyria, of                a different      composition,        and for
other     affections, as known          at his time         under     the same        name of
Evodes, — the       one termed the         "  Evodes of Zosimus," the other the
"                   Evodes of Syneros."

    2. L. VALLATINI APALOCROCODES                 AD DIATHESIS.             The mild CrO-
             codes   of L. Vallatinus, for           affections    of   the eyes.
      The term diathesis in this inscription               is used in a different         sense
 from that in which we now employ                   the same word in modern medi
 cine.     At  the present day, we apply the term diathesis to designate
 the tendency or predisposition              to   some     special disease, or class of
 diseases.     In   the times of the Roman physicians,                   it  was    often used
 as synonymous with disease             itself  ;  and in the Latin translations of
 the Greek texts of Galen, Aetius, &c.,                 it is hence rendered usually
  by the general       word     "  affectus,"     " affectio," &c. The first sen
  tence in   Paulus jEgineta's chapter              on Ophthalmic           Diseases, affords
  an instance in point      :
                                "  Quum dolores vehementiores in oculis fiunt,
  considera ex quarum affectione (iiafagu) oculum dolere contingit.1' §
  Thus, also, the Evodes of Zosimus (to which                    I   have before alluded)
  is  entered by Galen as a remedy simply against " dolores et recentes
  affectus," according to the        Latin translation of Kuehn, — "                irgo; <xigm
  ounag xai Tjoirparous       Siadtdei;,-" according to the original              Greek text.
  Galen uses in fact diathesis as a general term for eye diseases.                    "Scripsi

the common Roman                 accusative diathesES, or the Greek                        accusative
diathesEis.
      The collyrium mentioned in the prescription  (the Crocodes) de
rives its designation from its containing the crocus, or saffron, as one
of its principal ingredients.
      In     describing      the therapeutic effects of the crocus, Dioscorides
mentions as its first special use — its efficacy in                            " fluxions of the
eyes."f
   Pliny, in enumerating the qualities of the crocus, begins by ob
serving, that it has a discutient effect upon all inflammations, but
chiefly on those of the eyes (discutit inflammationes omnes quidem,
sed oculorum maxime) ; and in speaking of its combinations he tells
us that        it   has     given a name to one collyrium                 (collyrio uno etiam
nomen dedit).{   But it entered into the composition of very many
of the ancient eye medicines, and more than one of these passed
under the name of Crocodes, as in the inscription on the seal.                                 Galen,
in his list of eye remedies,              gives a recipe for the composition of a
Crocodes collyrium  for epiphorae, pains and affections (oWtrt/f) from
wounds of the eye.§    He discusses the composition also of the aro
matic Crocodes of Heraclides, and the oxydercic Crocodes of Ascle-
pius, &c.      ||    When describing, in another part,               the remedies          for ulcers
of the eyes, he mentions a collyrium                       containing crocus, and adds,
" habet autem
              plurimum in                 se crocum, unde etiam croceum (xgoxudts)
appellatur.''1T
   Celsus, Alexander Trallianus, and Paul us iEgineta, give recipes
for eye collyria, under the name of diacrocus (dia xgoxoe).**
   We have not yet alluded to the expression apalo, standing before
Crocodes.            This expression presents the only difficulty in reading

the       inscription   ;    and various suggestions        might be offered in regard
to its explanation.               But it   seems most probable that        it   was used as a
qualifying term               to the Crocodes.        Several of the collyria        have the
Latin adjective             :'
                              lene,"  and   " leve,"   placed before them, in order to
certify their mild nature.    Scribonius Largus gives a whole division
of collyria, headed " Collyria composite levia." Aetius has a chap
ter,      "   De Lenibus Collyriis."           The expression apalo,            as a part   and
prefix to Crocodes, would                  seem to indicate      the same quality in the
crocodes vended, of old, to the Roman                     colonists and inhabitants          of
the Lothians, by Vallatinus of Tranent, the term being in all likeli
hood derived from the Greek adjective aoraXos, or the corresponding
Latin adjective apalus (mild, soft). Homer frequently                           uses the word
as signifying soft, delicate, and especially as applied to different parts
of the body (See Iliad, book iii. 371 ; xvii. 123, &c.) ; and, indeed,
both Aetius and Paulus                  £gineta employ the Greek adjective thera
peutically        in the     sense     of mild, and    as applied to     collyria.     In   the
treatment of acute inflammatory                  ulcers of the eye, after inculcating
the usual antiphlogistic treatment, Aetius adds, " collyria vero tenera
                                      * When
(acraXa) ulcerato oculo infundantur."           speaking of carbuncles
and carcinoma of the eye, Paulus JEgineta observes that the affection
may be alleviated             "
                     by the injection of soothing (tenera, cta-aXa) col
lyria, such as the Spodiacum, Severianum, and the like."t
   Other Roman medicine stamps with analogous oculist legends and
collyria have, in England, been found at Colchester, Bath, Wroxeter,
Cirencester, Kenchester,                 Littleborough, St Albans, &c. &c.

      These Notices were chiefly derived from the ordinary correspond
ence of the Royal Observatory of Edinburgh, from the important
character of some of which Professor P. Smyth hoped that extracts
from the best of the letters might be of interest to the Society.
      Ho alluded first to the astronomers of the United States,                        a largo
and increasing              body, of no mean order of excellence already, and of
the richest promise.                 Professor Loomis' recent work, which was ex
hibited, gives sufficient facts to prove the above statements.

    Dr Locke's pamphlet        on   his electric observing      clock was also
shewn    ;  and mention was made of the discovery of the third ring of
Saturn, a faint ring interior       to the older ones, about one-fourth        of
their united breadth, but apparently thicker.
    The period of the new Bond and Lassel satellite of Saturn,
Hyperion, was given at 21-18 sidereal days.
    Attention was called to a map of the solar eclipse of July 28,
1851, sent from the Vienna Observatory, and the great importance
of having tho phenomenon extensively observed was pointed out.*
    The periods of the new planets, Victoria and Egeria, were given,
as well as their places for the month, together with that of Faye's
comet,     expected on its return to perihelion.
    The successful manufacture of      telescopes   in this country, especially
of reflecting ones, was then spoken of, and the attempt that had been
made, but unhappily       without success, by some scientific societies and
private individuals to persuade Government to establish one of these
instruments      in  some    more favourable      climate   than   that   of the
British Islands.
     It appears that we can make at home far better reflectors than
any other nation, but cannot use them on account of clouds              ; but wo
 possess colonies nearer the equator with         almost cloudless skies, and
 with high mountains, or table lands, on which the telescopes might be
 raised above all the grosser part of the atmosphere, and some of
 our astronomers are most anxious to go out in charge of such instru
 ments, confident of the rich results which they must yield under such
 favourable circumstances,     — but    yet the Government        refuses to do
 anything.

motion was watched by me during                     that summer, and          its annual
motion was ascertained by renewed observations                        in  1843, 1844,
1846, and again this year.             I  measured the distance along the ice
                                              '
from the original       position of the          Pierre platte'     on the 27th      June
1842 (ascertained by reference to fixed marks on the rocks) to its
position on the 12th July 1850, and found it to be 2520 feet.                         But,
of this distance, 1212        feet had been        travelled at my previous obser
vation on the 21st        July 1846, leaving 1308                feet   during    the last
four years against       1212     in the first four.          When more accurately
stated and compared, the mean annual and daily                      motions will stand
as follows    : —
                                      1843-8.         184S-4.      im-C          1846-50.

We cannot infer, with absolute certainty, that                 the slight    increase of
velocity here noticed since 1844 is due to a change in the conditions
of the glacier (although       I believe that      the recurrence of several snowy
seasons     and the very marked increase of the volume and extent of
the glacier during these years would produce such an effect), because
it has    moved   nearly half-a-mile from its position when first observed,
and the part       of the glacier on which it now lies may be subject to
different accelerating and retarding causes.

the centre of the      Mer   de Glace opposite            Les Ponts' with the letter
V   in 1846, and that       I  took angles for fixing its place with reference
to the adjacent rocks.          It  was then about         760 feet distant from the
west bank.        I had little difficulty       in recognizing the block in 1850,
although it had travelled a great distance, and was considerably lower
than the Montauvert.          It  had preserved its parallelism to the shore,
for  I   found it at almost the same distance from the west bank as at
first  ;  and by measuring carefully along the side                  of the glacier,      I
estimated its progress in four years, from 30th                   July   1846 to 13th
July     1850, at 3255 feet.         This gives, for the        mean     motion in 365
days, 822-8 feet, or the mean daily motion 27-05 inches, which is
remarkably      large.    Its position      is very near the point        of one   of the

                                           16
  '
    dirt-bands,'   but a little nearer the western bank.          It lies, however,
  on the band.
     "  I shall now give the sequel of my guide Auguste Balmat's obser
 vations on the motion of the Glacier des Bois (the outlet of the Mer
 de Glace), and of the       Glacier   des Bossons, since the period to which
 the table in my Fourteenth           Letter extends, which will        be found to
 embrace continuous observations, by periods of a few weeks from the
 2d October 1844 to the 21st November 1845.                 They were continued
 in like manner until the 19th February 1846, when they were in
 terrupted by Balmat's        illness, which was accompanied by inflamma
 tion of the eyes.        But in October of the        same   year they were re
 sumed,    and were      continued    without    intermission    until the   end  of
 June 1848, embracing altogether a period of nearly four years, with
 only eight months' intermission.           It is necessary   to observe that the
 station on the glacier        of Bossons    was altogether     changed after the
 above    mentioned interruption,      being transferred from the west to the
 east   side (in the same region of the glacier), and it was 340 feet
 from the bank. The station on the Glacier des Bois was almost un
 changed, and was about 280 feet from the north                bank, between the
 Cote du Piget and the acclivity of the Chapeau.                 I   have added   a
column giving the mean of the temperatures of the several periods of
 observation, carefully calculated from the published              observations at
 Geneva and the great St Bernard, on the same principle as                   I have
fully explained in my Fourteenth Letter above referred to. The
comparisons of the temperature and the rate of motion lead to con
clusions similar to those which         I  have drawn in that paper from the
earlier observations, the general observation always holding that the
acceleration in spring is in a greater proportion to the temperature
than at any other season of the year, on account of the great influence
of the melting snows in imparting fluidity            to the glacier masses.      I
do not mean that the comparison            leads always to consistent results.
I   do not   think that the    causes  of the comparative acceleration of       one
glacier and retardation of another have yet been clearly brought out,
though     I  conceive that accurate local observations,           combined with
such measurements, would gradually              but surely unveil them.        Nor
do   I  mean to affirm that measurements made with so much labour
and trouble, and under circumstances even of personal danger at cer
tain   seasons   of  the year, are irreproachable      in point of accuracy.      I
think it     even   probable that oversights        have occurred     ; but I have

                                                 17
   very strong        reason for confiding         in the absolute fidelity with which
   the observations have been made and transmitted                          to me.

        "  I have formerly taken occasion to mention experiments and ob
    servations which have occurred from time to time of a nature to con
    firm the fundamental hypothesis of the quasi                         fluidity of the       ice  of
    glaciers on the great scale, and             I  cannot doubt that these incidental
    remarks have tended to diminish the natural                        incredulity with which
    that theory was at first received in some quarters.                            I have now to
    cite a fact of the same kind established                   by a French experimenter,
    M. Person, who appears not to have had                       even    remotely in his mind
                          * Mean of Geneva and Great St Bernard.

                                           18
 the theory of glaciers when he announced the following fact, viz.               :,—
 That     ice  does not     pass abruptly from the solid to the fluid state.
 That it begins       to so/ten at a temperature      of 2° centigrade below its
 thawing point      :  that, consequently between 28-°4 and 32° of Fahren
 heit, ice is actually        passing through various degrees         of plasticity,
 within narrower limits, but in the            same   manner that wax, for ex
 ample, softens before          it melts.   M. Person     deduces    this from the
 examination       of the heat requisite to liquify ice at different tempera
 tures.      The following sentences contain his conclusions in his own
 words    : — " II  parait d'apres mes experiences que le ramollissement
qui precede la fusion, est circonscrit dans une intervalle d'environ 2
degres.       La glace est       done un des corps dont      la fusion   est la plus
nette   ;   mais cependant le passage de l'état solide a         l'ltat liquide s'y
fait encore par degres, et non par un saut brusque."*
    " Now it appears very clearly from M. Agassiz' thermometrical
experiments, and from my own observations, that from 28° to 32°
Fahr. is the habitual temperature             of the great    mass   of  a glacier ;
that the most rigorous nights propagate an intense cold to but a very
small depth      ;  and   I  am perfectly convinced that in the middle           and
lower regions of glaciers which           are  habitually   saturated with water
in summer, the interior is little,        if at all, reduced below tho freezing
point, even by the prolonged cold of winter ; it would be contrary to
all just theories of the propagation of heat if it were otherwise, when
 we recollect that the enormous mass          of snow which    such glaciers bear
during the coldest months of the year, is a covering sufficient to pre
vent any profound congelation in common earth ; and admitting that
ice is probably a better conductor          of heat than the ground, it is quite
incredible that a thickness of many hundred feet of ice, saturated with
fluid water, should         be   reduced much below the freezing           point, or
should even be frozen throughout.
    " It    thus appears quite certain that ice, under the circumstances
in which      we find   it in the great bulk of glaciers, is in a state more
or less softened even in winter ; and that, during nearly the whole
summer, whilst surrounded by air above 32°, and itself at that tem
perature,     it  has   acquired a still greater degree      of plasticity, due to
the latent heat which          it has then absorbed.
    " I have     mentioned that the observations of this and some previous
                         * Comptes Rendus, 29th April 1860.

                                        19
 summers have enabled me to extend the survey of the valley of Cha-
 mouni beyond the limits to which my Map was originally confined.
 I have also obtained a great number         of approximate altitudes of all
the highest summits of the chain of Mont Blanc, from the extended
base which the distance from the Mont Breven to the Croix de F1é-
g£re (above    15,400 feet) has afforded        me.      But the results    are  as
yet only partially calculated.        I  have   also   made    some additions to
our knowledge of the geography of the eastern part of the chain of
Mont Blanc, by examining the Glacier of La Tour in its whole ex
tent, which proved the configuration of the mountains to be different
from what has been represented on all the maps and models which                   I
have seen.     The Glaciers of Argentiere and La Tour are separated
throughout by a rocky ridge, but the Glaciers of La Tour and Trient
all but unite at their highest parts, and the main chain is prolonged
with scarcely a break in the north-east direction, sending off only a
spur towards the Col de Balme, which, perhaps from being the poli
tical boundary of Savoy and Switzerland, has been represented gene
rally on an exaggerated scale.          What surprised        mo   most, was the
great elevation of the axis of the chain at the head of the Glaciers of
La Tour and Trient.        I found  it barometrically to     be 4044    feet above
the chalet  of the Col    de Balme, which, from         five comparisons made
with the observatory       at Geneva,      is 7291     English    feet,  or 2220
metres above the sea, a result agreeing closely with the recent mea
surement by     M. Favre, which is 2222 metres.              Adding this result
to the former, we obtain 11,335 English feet for the height of the
granitic axis at the lowest point between the Glaciers of La Tour
and Salena on the side of the Swiss Val Ferret. By a single direct
barometrical    comparison     with Geneva,      I  obtained    11,284    English
feet above the sea, or 140       feet  higher    than the Col du Geant.           I
was successful     in traversing the Glacier of Salena to Orsieres the
same day, a pass which has not before been described, and which has
this interest, in addition to the singular wildness of the scenery, that
it includes  those   regions of beautiful     crystallized   protogine, here in
situ, which have been known to geologists hitherto chiefly from the
numerous moraines which they form in the valleys of Ferret and of
the  Rhone, and especially the majority of the blocks of Monthey,
which have been derived, according to         M.   de Buch, entirely from this
region  of the Alps."

   The following Communications                  were read      : —
1.  Notice of a Tertiary Fossiliferous Deposit, underlying
   Basalt, on the Island of Mull. By the Duke of Argyll.
   This paper,      in its perfect form,         appears in       the  Transactions

                                                         22
of the Geological                Society.               The abstract         read    by    His Grace
on    this      occasion        was    illustrated             by a number          of drawings and
specimens.
     The order of           beds shewn in the drawings,                    from above downwards,
was as follows          :   —
     1.     A   bed of basalt, rudely columnar.
     2.     A   bed containing impressions of leaves of dicotyledonous trees.
     3.     A   bed of tuff, or trap conglomerate, having the aspect of vol
canic ashes.
     4.     A   bed of leaves         similar      to   No. 2.
     5.     A   bed   of tuff similar         to   No.        3.
     6.     A   third   bed     of   leaves   similar          to the two former.
     7.     A   bed of amorphous basalt ending in basalt                           highly columnar.
2.   Analysis of the Mineral Waters of Baden Baden.                                                By
                    Dr Sheridan Muspratt.
     The author, after mentioning that                              no analysis   of this water is   to
be found in any             English work,               and    the great multitudes who resort
to    it,   described briefly the situation                         of the Ursprung or original
spring, the chief one at Baden, which was known to, and esteemed
by, the Romans.
     It   has    a   temperature of 153 5°                    F.,   and contains, in      the imperial
gallon, 181'120 grains of solid matter.                                 The predominating ingre
dient     is    chloride of sodium or common salt, which amounts to 132-6
grains in the gallon.                Next to this            comes carbonate        of lime, dissolved
no doubt as bicarbonate, which                          is   deposited as carbonate on boiling.
The other ingredients, which are in trifling quantity, aro detailed in
the first table given below as obtained in the analysis.   In the se
cond, they are arranged in the order of their probable occurrence                                    in
the water.

      Several lengthy extracts were read, to illustrate,      first, the relation
 which the author's historical views bear to those of previous inquirers
 in the same        field ;  and, secondly, the    theory,   on the origin    and
 progress of language, upon which his arguments are mainly rested.
  2.  The following Note was read on the recent frequent occur
         rence of the Lunar Rainbow, by George Buchanan, Esq.
      The frequent occurrence of this phenomenon lately suggests the
  idea, whether it be any way connected with the relation of the at
  mosphere     to an electric or other condition.

                                       26
    On Thursday evening last, at 7 o'clock,           I   observed   a very beau
tiful rainbow, from Duke Street, extending              in  a  brilliant and un
broken arch in a westerly direction       ;   the south end springing          from
the west end of Queen Street, and the north end                stretching    to the
eastern extremity of Abercromby Place, comprising a space in the
horizon of 60° or 70°, and rising 16° or 18° in altitude.
   The prevailing colour     was whitish,     but occasionally the prismatic
colours shone out very distinctly,      particularly the red and         the blue.
   The weather     was squally,   with showers, and the bow appeared for
at least half an hour.
   Last night (Sunday evening) the          same appearance was          seen  with
beautiful   effect at 11 p.m.,    and continued       for upwards of half an
hour.

     Sir T. M. BRISBANE, Bart., President, in the Chair.
    The following Communications               were read   : —
1.    On    some new        Marine Animals, discovered during a
        cruise among the Hebrides with Robert Macandrew,
       Esq., of Liverpool, in 1850.               By Professors Edward
       Forbes and J. Goodsir.              Communicated by Professor
       Goodsir.
    The animals either wholly      new,    or new to Britain,     described in
this communication, were taken during a yachting cruise with          Mr Mac
 andrew, of Liverpool, among the Hebrides, in the month of August
 1 850.   During this   voyage, which lasted three weeks, a series    of obser
 vations were conducted by means of the dredge and towing-net.              Not
a single new testaceous      Mollusk was procured ; but several remark
able Ascidians     and Badiata were discovered, some of them so curious
in themselves, and so important       in their zoological      bearings,    that
the authors     of this paper thought it desirable to lay an account of
them before the Boyal Society of Edinburgh.
    The   most remarkable of these      is the longest compound Ascidian
yet discovered      in the Atlantic.      Its nearest described ally is the
genus Diazona of Savigny, between which animal and Clavellina
it forms    a link.    The authors of this paper propose to designate
this animal Syntethys Hebridia, having found it necessary to esta
blish a genus for its reception.      The authors have also dredged up
the Holothuria       intestinalis of Ascanius      and Bathke,    which is the
second species of     Holothuria proper discovered in the British         seas ;
the first having being discovered by          Mr Peach under the name of
" Nigger," given to it by the Cornish fishermen.
    A  new species of the curious genus Sarcodictyon,        distinguished by
the polype cells being grouped in assemblages          of from three    to five,
was described under the designation         of S. agglomeratum.
    The Arachnactis albida of Sars         was found in the    Minch.      Por
tions of an animal      found by Professor Balfour in the same locality
in 1841, have now been recognised as belonging to this curious              Ac-
tinea.

                                       28
   The other animals described in this communication were,               a spe
cies of naked-eyed Medusa, for the reception of which              the authors
found it necessary to establish   a new genus, Planeia (Plancia gracilis.)
 Seven new species of Medusae, referable to the genera Oceanea, Slab-
beria, Hippocrene,   and Thaumantias,         were also described.
   The communication       was illustrated   by coloured drawings.
2.  Account of Experiments on the Thermotic Effect of the
   Compression of Air, with some practical applications.                    By
   Professor C. Piazzi Smyth.
3.  Theoretical investigations into the same by W. Petrie,
   Esq. Communicated by Professor C. Piazzi Smyth.
   Having brought before this Society in April 1849, a plan for
cooling the air of rooms in tropical climates, the author was anxious
to determine by actual experiment on a very large scale the practi
cability of the principle     involved, viz., the thermotic       effect of the
compression of air.     He had had       a small apparatus made in       1844,
which, though not sufficiently large to give exact numerical data, at
least showed that the plan was in the bounds of possibility.
   But in December 1849, Mr Wilson, of the Kinniel Ironworks,
having kindly allowed him to experiment            on the compressed     air in
the reservoir tubes  of the furnaces, Professor        P. S.  proceeded   there
in company with     Mr Stirling, C.E.,       and Capt. Gosset,      R.E., with
an apparatus which was exhibited on the table.
   Thirty-four different experiments wero         made,   in as varied a way
as possible to insure accuracy,      and the     mean   result was, that the
air being at 63° Fahr.,      and the barometer at        30- inches, and the
pressure guage indicating      7'2 inches of mercury,       the rise of tem
perature of the air on being made          to enter the compression-chest,
was 28°-9, and the    fall  on escaping therefrom was 260-9.
   Professor  W. Thomson, from Carnot's theory of              heat,   and  Mr
Macquorn    Rankino from his own,       deduced nearly the same quantity,
but with some uncertainty, as the specific heat of air was involved.
   Mr Petrie,   however, without      taking    up any theory of heat, but
merely the mechanical nature of a compressible fluid, and the well
known quantity of the expansion of air from heat, deduced a formula
which   represented the above        observations as well as could be ex
pected.   And pursuing his formula         to its ultimate consequences,     he

                                        29
arrived   at the interesting      result,   that beginning       with air at 60°
Fahr.,   unlimited expansion         would    only  lower     it 550°   ;  while by
sufficiently    increasing   the compression,      an infinite     degree of heat
could be produced.
    The practical     result   of the experiments         and conclusions from
theory    was    to make the proposed          method of cooling        the air of
rooms (viz., by compressing         the air, depriving it when compressed
of its extra heat, and then allowing it to         escape into the room to bo
cooled), — very     possible indeed.
    While, to get over the difficulty that might be experienced in the
colonies of managing the air pumps and coolers which would be re
quired according to Professor        P. S.'s plan, Mr Petrie proposed           some
simple    forms     of water-pressure        machines,     and    air-compressing
wheels.

 1.   Biographical Notice of the late Robert Stevenson,
    Esq., Civil Engineer. By his Son, Alan Stevenson, L.L.B.
    Communicated          by   Dr T. S. Traill.
    This memoir     commences        by stating    that Mr   Stevenson was born
at Glasgow on the 5th May 1772, and that he died at Edinburgh, in
the seventy-ninth       year of his age, on the 12th           July 1850. The
writer then notices the disadvantages under               which Mr Stevenson
laboured in infancy and youth, owing to the death of his father, who
was a partner     in  a  West India House in Glasgow, and died in the
Island of St Christophers soon after the birth of his only child.               In
spite of these, and by the prudence and energy of his mother, Ro
bert Stevenson had the benefit of a tolerably              full  course  of train
ing both in science and literature,         first at the Andersonian Institu
tion in Glasgow, and afterwards at the University of Edinburgh ;
and so great was his zeal in the pursuit              of knowledge, that, while
acting during the summer as a             superintendent of works, under Mr
 Smith, the engineer of the Lighthouse Board, his future father-in-
law, he regularly devoted the winter months to the study of mathe
matics, natural      philosophy,     chemistry,     and architectural    drawing.
Some pretty long extracts from some              MSS. memoranda, left by Mr
Stevenson himself,         and from his        "  Account of the Bell Rock
Lighthouse," next follows          ;   and in them an interesting         view   is
given of his early designs for the Bell Rock Lighthouse, and of the
difficulties with which he had to contend, and the encouragements he
met with in reference to        his great enterprise.     The writer then     goes
on   very briefly   to notice his father's        long service of about forty
years as engineer to         the Commissioners of the Northern Light
houses,   in which    office   he succeeded      his father-in-law,    Mr  Smith,
in 1806.     During that period,        he was the architect     of no fewer than

                                         31
twenty-three      lighthouses,    including    that of the Bell Rock           ; and
through his indefatigable       zeal and patient skill, the catoptric system
of lighthouse    illumination    was   in Scotland brought       to a state  of per
fection which has not elsewhere been equalled.                Many of those im
provements      he was the means         of extending to the lighthouses of
Ireland and of      some   of the colonies.     He   also invented two valuable
additions to the mode of distinguishing           lights on a coast, known as
the intermittent      and flashing lights, the latter of which, in parti
cular, has been generally approved by seamen                ;  and so much was
the late   King of the Netherlands pleased with the arrangement and
effect  of this distinction, of which       he  had read an account, that he
sent to  Mr    Stevenson a gold medal as a mark of his approbation.
The memoir next notices         Mr    Stevenson's career as a practitioner         in
his profession of a civil engineer, in the course of which it is not per
haps generally known         that   he   designed and executed the eastern
approach     to Edinburgh by the Calton            Hill  ;  and, after      alluding
to several    of his works in bridges and harbours, it mentions his
improvements in the construction of timber and suspension bridges,
and notices his connection with the first introduction              of the railway
system into Great Britain, and his contributions              to various scientific
journals, and to literature of his own profession.              In conclusion, the
writer briefly touches upon the private character of his father, and
the esteem in which he was held by all who knew him, and more
especially by the Commissioners of the Northern Lighthouses, who,
 in 1 824, ordered his bust to be placed in the Bell Rock Lighthouse,
and, on the occasion of his death, recorded in the Minutes of the
 Board their respect for his talents as a public officer and his virtues
 as a man.
 2.  Historical Notice of the Progress of the Ordnance Survey
       in Scotland. By Alexander Keith Johnston, Esq.
    There   are few places on the earth's surface which,            within such a
 limited area, combine      so many of the requisite         elements for charto-
graphic delineation      as are met with      in Scotland.       With mountains
 rising almost   to the   limit of the snow-line,        and an extensive        sea

                                       32
 board, broken up by firths and lochs into every conceivable form of
 promontory, cape, and headland, this portion of Great Britain com
 prises within itself such a variety of physical          features as is only
 found elsewhere distributed over much more extensive regions.                 It
 cannot be doubted, therefore,       that   a properly constructed         map of
 Scotland, on a scale sufficiently distinct,       if executed with fidelity,
 and with all the improvements       of modern art, would present at once
 a most pleasing and highly instructive         example of this species of
 design.     That we do not already possess such a map, is not owing
 to any want of interest in the subject on the part of our countrymen,
 for Scotland has produced more works of this class than perhaps any
other country of similar extent and means.            But  these efforts, how
ever creditable in themselves, could not be connected so as to pro
duce a perfect map, for want       of such a basis of union,         as   a com
plete system of triangulation     alone could supply.        Now, this     was  a
work which, from its vast extent and labour, required             the   resources
of Government      to accomplish, and hence the necessity     for the so-called
Ordnance or Government         Survey,    to trace the progress      of which is
the object of this Paper.
    The first map of Scotland on record is that attributed to Ptolemy,
the geographer of Alexandria, a. d. 140.            In this celebrated work,
it is well known the bearings are altogether wrong,              as the upper
part of Britain is represented bending to the east instead of stretch
ing to the north.       Nothing further of this kind worthy of notice
occurs   till the 14th century, when Richard of Cirencester compiled
a map, in which, though he generally follows Ptolemy,              he gives the
true bearings of the country, and greatly adds          to our knowledge       of
British geography.
    Timothy Pont was the first projector of an atlas of Scotland.
In 1608 he commenced a survey of all the counties and islands,
sketching in the features on the spot.         He died before his work       was
finished, and in 1646 his drafts and notes were put            into the hands
of Sir Robert Gordon of Straloch,         who completed his design.          All
the sketches and notes thus      collected were transmitted         to Bleau of
Amsterdam,       who published   his Atlas   Scotice  in 1654.       This atlas,
begun at the charge of      Sir John Scott, of Scotstarvet, director of the
Chancery in Scotland, was, probably,         carried on and completed at
the national expense.      These maps, which are wonderful productions

                                                     33
for the time, may, however, be regarded simply as literary curiosi
ties, interesting            chiefly to the antiquary.
   About the year 1688, Adair made a survey, and gave descrip
tions of the coasts of Scotland, which he published in a small atlas ;
but his       sketches,           of Sanson, Elphinstone, and Grier-
                              as well as those
son, who succeeded him, are very inaccurate.    The Rev. Alexander
Bryce surveyed  the northern coasts of Scotland about the year 1740 ;
his   map, published in 1744, made considerable advances in accuracy.
In    1750, John Dorret, laud-surveyor,                        published a map of Scotland,
in five      sheets, at the expense           of the Duke of Argyll.                  This   map had
more         pretension than any              that    preceded         it,   being     on    a   much
larger       scale, but in construction          it   is   still    very inaccurate.         Between
1751 and 1771,               Mr   Murdoch Mackenzie, who was employed by the
Admiralty, surveyed the western coasts of Britain, from the English
Channel to Cape Wrath, including the Hebrides from Lewis to
Islay, and extending to the Orkney Islands.                              His charts         were pub
lished      on   a   scale     of one inch to        a    mile, and were accompanied                   by
nautical descriptions.                These were considered, at the time, entitled
to credit, but the recent Admiralty Surveys                           have proved them to be
exceedingly erroneous.
     In     1789, John Ainslie, an eminent land-surveyor in Edinburgh,
constructed,          engraved,       and published            a    map of Scotland and its
islands in nine sheets.                This   was the       first   good map       of the country.
The author           had made an actual survey of several counties, when he
was employed            by    the Board    of Customs to survey the east                     coasts    of
North Britain         ;   he    also made       many rapid surveys and sketches in
remote districts.    Still, though superior to any that preceded     his                         it,
map      very faulty in construction.
        is                               In Ainslie's time the delinea
tion of the physical features of    country was little understood his

mountains and hills are represented as rising insulated from their
bases   ;    no indications are given           of the water-sheds dividing the river
basins, and little attention             is   paid to the subject of light and shade.
In    1792       Murdo Downie             published        a   chart of the east             coast     of
Scotland, in which the sea-board                 is      very inaccurate.
     The Government felt               so greatly         the want of        a   tolerable map of
Scotland, during the rebellion of 1745-6, that, on its suppression,                                    it
was resolved, at the suggestion of the Duke of Cumberland, to com
mence an actual              survey    of the whole country.                  This undertaking
     VOL.     III.                                                                C

was    confided  to   Colonel   Watson,      who   employed     in the service
several young officers of engineers,         among others,     Mr  (afterwards
Major-General) Roy.         The survey, which       was  limited to the main
land, was commenced in         1747,     and completed     in   1755.    It  was
conducted with considerable skill, and was the means of illustrating
many of the Roman        antiquities    of North Britain.       The field work
was carried     on   in summer,     and the drawings were prepared            in
Edinburgh Castle during the winter months.              Of this work, General
Roy himself says that,
                            " having been carried on with inferior instru
ments, and the sum allowed          having    been   very  inadequate    for its
proper execution, it is rather to be considered as a magnificent           mili
tary sketch than a very accurate map of a country."                   When the
drafts of this map were finished,         they were deposited in the Royal
 Library, where they lay totally forgotten till 1804, when being re
 quired for a new map of Scotland, undertaken by Arrowsmith, at
 the suggestion of the Commissioners          of Highland roads and bridges,
they were discovered after considerable search.
     Arrowsmith's map     was founded on       Roy's survey of the mainland,
 and many other materials which he deemed authentic.               It  was com
 menced in 1805 and finished in 1807, on a scale of           Jth of an inch to
 a mile or }th   of the scale  of the military survey. Since Arrowsmith's
 map appeared, many portions of the country have been surveyed and
 published,   some of these,      among which       may be specially      noted,
 Lanarkshire by Forrest, Mid- Lothian by Knox, Sutherlandshire                by
 Burnett and Scott, and Edinburgh, Fife, and Haddington by Green
 wood, have been deservedly reputed.            But, as must over be the case
 in private enterprises, these are confined to the wealthier          and more
 populous districts, no recent survey having been made of any of the
 more remote regions.        The latest effort of this kind, which is likely
 to prove the last, is the survey      of Edinburgh and Leith within the
  Parliamentary boundaries, on the          scale of 5 feet to a mile,    by  W.
  and  A. K. Johnston,     a reduction of which has recently appeared.
     The principal triangulation       for the Ordnance Survey of Britain
  commenced by General        Roy,    on Hounslow      Heath, near London, in
  1784,   was extended    to  Scotland     in 1809,    but the operations were
  discontinued   for the three     following     years, the persons employed
  having been removed to England.            In   1813   the Ordnance      zenith

                                          35
 sector was used on Kellie Law, Fife, and Cowhythe, Banffshire.                     In
 1814-15-16        the triangulation       proceeded    steadily.      In 1817 the
 zenith sector was used on Balta Island, Zetland,                    a new base   line
 was    measured      on    Belhelvie     Links,    near      Aberdeen,      and   the
 triangulation     again proceeded in 1818-19.                It was suspended in
 1820, but re-commenced in 1821-22, in Zetland, Orkney, and the
 Western Islands.         In   1823    the large     theodolite was removed to
 England     and    afterwards    to   Ireland, in     consequence      of which the
operations in Scotland        were   entirely    suspended       during   a period of
sixteen years.      In 1838-39-40        and 41, the triangulation for connect
ing the islands with each other, and with the mainland, proceeded with
out interruption.        The principal operations are now completed, with
the exception of certain observations that may be required for a few
stations, with a view to its publication          as a scientific work.
     In 1815      the Ordnance       department      appointed      Dr M'Culloch    to
make     a geological      examination      of Scotland     ;   his researches   were
continued    till 1821, but for want of an accurate topographical map,
his labours have unfortunately            done   much     less    service than they
otherwise would have done to the cause of science.
     In 1819    a  military detailed survey of part of Wigtonshire and
Ayrshire was commenced on a scale of 2 inches to a mile, by Capt.
Hobbsandtwo subalterns ; it was carried on, with diminishing num
bers, till 1827, and extended over a space of about 937 square miles.
But    a survey conducted       at so slow a rate, and on so small a scale,
afforded no proper ground         for commencing         a map      of Scotland, and
the plans will furnish       no aid whatever      for the general survey.
     In  1834     the   Ordnance      carried    forward      a   partial secondary
triangulation along the Scottish coast, from the Solway Firth                  to the
Firth of Clyde for the use of the Admiralty surveyors.

                                      38
     In 1840 the Board of Ordnance and the Treasury directed that the
 survey of Scotland should be laid down on a scale of 6 inches to a
 mile to correspond with that of Ireland.
     The secondary operations of the survey in Scotland have been
 carried on since 1841.         In the beginning of 1844 the detailed
 survey    of the county of Wigton       was  begun  ; it was completed   in
 1850 and is now engraved on the 6 inch scale, with contour lines, or
 lines of equal elevation, and published in 38 sheets.       The survey of
 the county of Kirkcudbright was commenced in 1845, and it is ex
 pected that it will be finished and portions of it published during
the present year.
     In July   1846 the survey of the island of Lewis was commenced,
 out of due course, in consequence of an arrangement with the pro
 prietor, by which he agreed to pay to the Government           the sum   of
 £1200,     and to purchase      100 copies   of the published  maps.    In
January 1851 about three-fifths of this survey were completed, some
 of the sheets will be published during the present year, and it is
 expected that the whole will be finished during 1852.
    In March     1850 the surveying     party  was  removed from Wigton
 and Kirkcudbright shires to Mid-Lothian       and the city of Edinburgh.
The survey of the city is now considerably advanced, and it is ex
pected that some of the sheets will be published in 1852.              It is
proposed to be engraved in outline, i. e., without      shading or distinc
tion of houses from streets, on a scale of 5 feet to a mile.
    The survey of the county of Edinburgh is going on, and has also
made considerable progress.         Plans of the towns of Wigton and
 Stranraer have been surveyed, on the scale of 5 feet to a mile.
 The town of Dumfries      is surveyed, and the drawing   plans are nearly
finished.
    This comprises all that has yet     been done   by the Ordnance Sur
veyors in North Britain.
    From    these statements we learn    that the survey of Scotland    was
begun in 1809, but its progress appears to have been considered of
so  little importance in comparison with the surveys of other portions
of the kingdom, that, whenever it was found convenient, the whole of
the men     and instruments     employed were unceremoniously     removed
to England     or Ireland ;  and that, in order to expedite the work in
the latter country, the operations in Scotland were on one occasion
altogether suspended     during a period of sixteen years.

                                         39
    It  will be seen from the preceding             table   that the total      sum
expended on the survey         in Scotland from its commencement to the
present time, has       been  only £66,000 ; while the sum expended in
England is £702,000 ; and in Ireland, £820,000                   ;   and that, in
June 1849, the number            of  men   employed in Ireland was           1210,
while in Scotland the number employed was only 257-
    The average annual expenditure on the survey of Scotland during
the forty-one years of its progress has been only           £1609, or, omitting
the sixteen years when the operations were suspended, £2640 ; while
on that of Ireland the average expenditure has been nearly £40,000
per annum.        In the Parliamentary     reports on this subject, it is stated
that, in   1843, the     sum voted    for the survey of the whole kingdom
was   £60,000, of which only £9000 was appropriated to Scotland ;
and, since 1843, the sum allotted to the survey of Scotland has ave
raged   little more than £10,000 per annum, the same amount which
is  voted annually for revising the maps of the northern counties of
Ireland already surveyed         !   Besides the sum of £820,000            already
expended      in Ireland, it  is proposed     to expend for the revisal      of the
northern counties above          alluded to,    £80,000   ;  and, for completing
the system      of contour lines (now in progress), the further sum of
£120,000, making in all £1,020,000, exclusive of the expense of
engraving plans of ninety-five towns, which are surveyed and
drawn.
    From these reports         we learn     further,  that the largest amount
hitherto granted for the purposes of the survey in Scotland in any one
year has been      £15,000, and      as admitted in evidence     although larger
 sums have       frequently been voted to Scotland, they have often been
 expended      in England and Ireland.          The consequence of this treat
 ment    has been, that, after a lingering progress extending over a
 period   of forty-one years, the survey of Scotland is still little more
 than begun, the map        of only one county, that of Wigton, forming
 about a    sixty- fourth part of the area of the country, being published,
 while  the survey of the whole of Ireland has been completed and
 published for several years, having been commenced                    in 1825 and
 finished in 1843, and that of        England    is now nearly    finished.
     A very general feeling exists in the public mind that, in this
 matter, Scotland has experienced most unmerited neglect, and since
 the expectation of immediate progress, occasioned by the fact that
 the Ordnance       surveyors have      occupied    the ground,     is   doomed   to

                                      40
certain   disappointment    if things     are allowed to continue as they
are, it is to be hoped that means may at once be devised for ensuring
a more satisfactory   result.
    The desired object might probably           be best attained      by such an
arrangement     as would   ensure the entry, in the annual              Ordnance
estimates, of a specific sum to be devoted to this special purpose.
    The amount needed depends of course on the time within which it is
required to finish the work.        It   is shown in the table that, at the
present rate of progress,  fifty years would       be necessary    for its accom
plishment.     Now, assuming that       the efficiency    of the force would    be
in direct proportion  to the numbers employed, and since the numbers
are dependent on the money grants,           it  is clear that    five times the
present force or five times      the amount granted           would finish the
survey in a fifth part of the time, or in ten years.                The sum at
present voted for the survey in all parts of the kingdom is £60,000,
but it is shown in evidence, that if the whole force of surveyors and
others capable of conducting the work are to be taken into pay, the
sum of £100,000 will bo required.            Now,    if the difference between
the amount     granted   and   that    required    —  £40,000 a year — were
voted to Scotland   (in addition to the average sum of £10,000), the
survey of this portion of the country would be completed in ten
years from this date, and that without prejudice to the surveys now
carried on in England and Ireland.            But if it should be objected
that the sum of £100,000 a year is more than could now be granted
for this   purpose,  the   question    remains      whether,   if  it cannot be
otherwise attained,    the speedy     completion      of the survey in Scot
land should not be secured by suspending for a time the opera
tions for contouring      the map of Ireland, and for revising the
survey of its northern    portion.
    Should the necessary funds be granted, it is satisfactory to know
that a sufficient number of competent and well-trained surveyors and
others formerly employed in Ireland, but whose services are not
now required there, may at once be engaged on the survey in Scot
land, and that the engraving of the maps can be carried on simul
taneously with the surveying,       so that      no delay in the publication
would be occasioned    on this account.
    Having recently had    an opportunity       of inspecting     the Ordnance
Survey Office at Southampton,        so   ably conducted under the direc
tion of Colonel   Hall and Captain Yolland,          I  have pleasure in bear

                                        41
ing testimony to the excellence of the methods there employed for
securing accuracy and expediting the work, the latter             especially, by
the extensive introduction       of mechanical processes of engraving, and
the masterly application       of the electrotype    for procuring duplicates
of the copperplates.
    Intimately connected with the survey of the interior, and of even
greater importance to the commerce of the country, is that of the sea-
coasts, carried on under the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty.
It   is not many years since attention was drawn by the late           Mr Gal-
braith    to the very erroneous character of     all the published charts and
sailing directions then available for the Firth of Clyde, in which it is
shown " that the master of a vessel, trusting to the charts then in
ordinary     use, would almost     certainly  be wrecked    if his reckonings
were right."
     It is gratifying to find that       danger from this cause       no longer
exists in that quarter, admirable surveys being now completed of the
River and Firth of Clyde, and of the lochs connected with them, many
of the sheets of which are already published, and the others are in
course of being engraved.          The whole of the north, south, and        east
coasts of Scotland, with the Shetland and Orkney           Islands, have been
surveyed, and most of the sheets are published.          The western coast of
 Sutherland is also surveyed, so that the portion of this great work
still remaining to be accomplished comprises the coasts of Ross, Inver
ness, Argyll, and the Hebrides.           All these surveys have been con
ducted by able and experienced officers under the enlightened and
 zealous    superintendence of the Hydrographer Royal, Admiral                Sir
 Francis Beaufort, who, in his anxiety       to insure the utmost attainable
 accuracy, revises and corrects with his own hand every sheet of the
 survey before it is sent to press.
     Mr Johnston      then exhibited a map, shewing by colours the pre
 sent state of the Ordnance and Hydrographical surveys in Scotland,
 and a comparative        table of the proportionate     scales    of maps   con
 structed from the surveys of different countries in Europe.

   The following Communications          were read   : —
   1.  On Iron and its Alloys.          Part I.   By   J. D. Morries
            Stirling, Esq.
   2.  On the Weight of Aqueous Vapour, condensed on a
            Cold Surface, under given conditions.           By James
            Dalmahoy, Esq.
   The paper    was accompanied by two tables, containing the results
of sixty-three experiments respecting the rate at which vapour con
denses on a cold surface.
   In planning the experiments, it was assumed that C^m    (/" — /"' ),
where   C is the weight of moisture condensed    on a surface of given
area in a given time ;   /" the tension of vapour at the dew-point       ;
/" the tension    at the temperature of the condensing surface    ;  m a
co-efficient varying with the velocity of the current of air.
   But, in the course of experiments, it was found that the co-efficient
m was not constant, even when there was no      sensible current   ; and
that under this state of the air, it  was necessary to change m into

             t") in which M     is constant,     / the temperature     of the air,
and t'" the temperature of the condensing surface.
   The principal object of the experiments was to determine mean
values of the co-efficients m and M. The data and results necessary
for this purpose were contained in the two tables before alluded to,
and the following small table merely exhibits the mean values.

   It  is to be remarked, that the value of            M,  as given above, is  only
applicable when the air in contact with                the cold surface is free to
descend      by its own weight, and that when, from any impediment to
its escape, the air is not changed, there is scarcely any sensible con
densation of vapour on the cold surface.
   The paper concluded        by examining,         in connection with the pre
ceding results, the theory proposed           by Professor    Phillips in explana
tion of the increment received         by  rain in the course of its     descent   to
the earth.       This theory,    as is well known, ascribes the increment to
to the continual condensation of vapour on the cold surfaces                 of the
drops   ;   and the author of this paper attempted to prove, that when
the data assumed       were the most favourable          to the theory which     the
case admitted of, the observed          increment of the rain was 635 times
greater than would be accounted for by the rate of the experiments.
3. On the       Poison of the Cobra da Capello. By Dr J. Ruther
            ford Russell.      Communicated by Dr Gregory.
   The     poison is of an amber colour, has         a faint animal odour and an
acrid taste.      When treated with alcohol or ether it separates into two
portions — the one soluble and the other insoluble. From some experi
ments     Dr Russell  made he concluded that both were poisonous,             but is
inclined to believe the soluble to be the more poisonous of the two.
   He gave      a detailed account     of  a series   of experiments made upon
some      rabbits and a dog.         The effect of the insertion of a small
portion of the poison into a wound in a rabbit was in almost every
case to produce death, generally           preceded     by stupor  and sometimes
by convulsions.       The lungs      were found gorged with blood in several

                                                     45
of the    cases,       and in some there was evidence                        of   a severe inflamma
tion of the plurte having taken place. The poison took from an
hour and a half to twenty-four hours to produce its fatal effect.
   It produced little effect upon the dog, probably from the quantity
being small.
  The following                   Gentlemen                  were     duly elected                 Ordinary

1. On a New Source of Capric Acid, with Remarks on some
    of its Salts. By Mr T. H. Rowney.   Communicated by
    Dr Anderson.
   The author  commences his paper by mentioning the different
sources from which capric acid has been obtained, and then proceeds
to point out a new source for obtaining       namely, the grain oil   it,
from the Scotch distilleries.
   The grain oil, he states, consists of water, alcohol, amylic alcohol,
and an oily residue, having a much higher
                                           boiling point than amylie
alcohol.  It this oily residue that contains the capric acid. He
obtained           by is
            it boiling the only residue with caustic potassa, which
renders        soluble in water, and                                   HO, SO, or HC1 to the

alkaline solution, the capric acid separated.                                    He then                  to
                                                                                               proceeds
detail the method he followed for obtaining                                 it   pure, and its most
characteristic   properties, viz., —      solid     it   is           at the ordinary tempera
ture, and   fuses at 81° F., —       insoluble
                                          it                        in
                                              cold water, and slightly
                                               is
soluble in hot water, — very soluble in cold alcohol and ether, — and
                                                                                           E   2

when a large quantity of cold water is added to the alcoholic solution,
the capric acid separates in crystals.             The numbers obtained by
analysis shewed the formula to be          C20  H]9 Os HO.
    The author then      describes the salts of capric acid that he examined,
—these    were the silver, baryta, magnesia, lime, copper, and soda.           He
also obtained capric ether and capramide.           The capric ether is an oily
liquid, lighter than water, its specific gravity being -862, insoluble in
cold water, but readily soluble in alcohol and ether. The capramide
he obtained by acting on the ether with a strong solution            of ammonia.
It  forms beautiful crystalline      scales,  insoluble in cold water, soluble
in  cold alcohol, and also in dilute      spirit, when warmed.        Its formula
he found to be C20 H21 O, N.
    2.  On Iron and its Alloys.            Part II.      By  J.  D. Morries
                                  Stirling, Esq.
    The following abstract contains a brief notice of this as
well as of the former part of Mr Stirling's paper, read at last
meeting     : —
    The author     gave a short description     of the various kinds of cast-
iron, and   a  statement respecting their strengths, and of the uses to
which they are more especially adapted,           pointing out the discrepan
cies which exist between chemists as to the quantity of carbon con
tained   in   each     sort.   That the author's       experience    led him     to
believe that the quantities of carbon were different            in the different
Nos. —greater       in No. 1, less in Nos. 2, 3, and 4.          Slow cooling of
large masses of iron renders them softer.            In making the mixtures
of wrought and        cast iron, different   proportions of wrought-iron are
used ; for soft iron containing        much carbon (or No. 1), more mal
leable-iron,   and for harder iron, less.       Welsh, Scotch, Staffordshire
iron differing much from each other — the Scotch being the softest,
the Welsh the hardest.          By  the proper proportioning      the addition of
malleable-iron,       the strength    of cast-iron    is nearly    doubled, both
transversely and tensilely.        By melting this mixture of wrought and
cast iron, and     then puddling the mixture, a very superior kind of
wrought-iron     is obtained, and the process      of refining is avoided.      By
the addition of calamine or zinc to common iron, without the admix
ture of wrought-iron, a very superior            malleable-iron     is produced,
equal in appearance, when twice rolled, to iron that has been               thrice

                                            47
  rolled,   and   very  much stronger,         or as 28 to 24£.        The increased
  strength in the mixture         of wrought and cast iron, called toughened
  cast-iron, renders it peculiarly        adapted for wheels, pinions, &c., and
  for girders, columns, and other architectural            uses.    Several govern
  ment works       so constructed     — the     Chelsea,   the Windsor, and the
  Yarmouth      Bridges  —also,      at various     iron-works,   all rolls,  pinions,
  and cog-wheels       are made       of it.     The wrought-iron        made   either
  from    the toughened cast, or by the admixture              of calamine,    is par
  ticularly useful for tension rods, chain-cables, &c.             The addition of
  antimony     and some other metals           to wrought-iron     in the puddling
  furnace gives a hard and crystalline iron, nearly               allied to steel   in
  some   of its properties, and     is adapted,    from its hardness and crystal
  line character, to form the upper part of railway rails and the outer
  surface of wheels.         When thus united        to the iron   containing    zinc,
  the best sort of rail results, combining strength, stiffness, and hardness
  with   anti-laminating properties, and being also cheaper than any
  other kind of hardened rail or tire.              Compounds of copper, iron,
  and zinc are found to be much closer in texture, and stronger                  than
  similar compounds of copper          and    zinc (the proportion of iron not
  usually exceeding 1£ per cent.), and can be advantageously used as
  substitutes for gun-metal, under          all circumstances,      for great guns,
 screws, propellers, mill brasses, and railway bearings ; small addi
 tions of tin and other metals alter the character of these compounds,
 and render      them extremely         manageable as regards hardness and
 stiffness.    The advantages which          these compounds possess        overgun-
 metal are cheapness        and increased     strength, being about one-fourth
 cheaper, and one-half stronger, and wearing much longer under fric
 tion.     On many railways, the alloys of zinc, iron, copper, tin, &c.,
 have superseded     gun-metal       for carriage     bearings.    An alloy equal
 in tono to bell-metal,      cheaper, and at the same time stronger, is
 made from the alloy of copper, zinc, and iron, a certain proportion
 of tin being added.         The addition of iron seems, under most, if not
all circumstances, to alter the texture of metallic alloys, rendering
it closer, and the alloys, therefore, more susceptible of a high polish,
and less liable to corrosion.          Other alloys of iron were exhibited,
some shewing the extreme             closeness    of texture,    others possessing
very great hardness, and suitable for tools, cutting instruments, &c.,
others possessing a high degree of sonorousness.                  A bell was ex
hibited, of fine tone     ;  its advantages being cheapness          (less than half

                                          .1R
the price    of common bell-metal)           and    superiority     of tone.      Other
alloys of iron, copper, zinc, manganese, and               nickel    were exhibited,
some      bearing    a near    resemblance      to   gold,  others     to  silver   ; the
latter being now most extensively made                in Birmingham, and gra
dually superseding German silver, or at least being largely used in
 stead of that alloy, which        it surpasses    in lustre,  closeness    of texture,
 and freedom        from   tarnish.     A  malleable bell was        also shown,      the
 tone of which was equal,         if  not superior, to that of a common bell
 of same size     :   a specimen    of this sort of metal was         shown crushed
 almost flat.       The author recommended its             use for ship and        light
house bells, &c.
 3.   On the Dynamical Theory of Heat, with Numerical Results
         deduced from Mr Joule's Equivalent of a Thermal
         Unit, and M. Regnault's Observations on Steam. By
         William Thomson, M.A., Fellow of St Peter's College,
         Cambridge,       and Professor of Natural Philosophy in the
         University of Glasgow.
     Sir Humphrey Davy, by his experiment of melting two                       pieces  of
ice by rubbing them together, established the following proposition                   :—
     " The   phenomena of repulsion           are   not dependent on a peculiar
elastic fluid for their existence, or caloric does not               exist;" and       he
concludes that heat consists of a motion excited among the particles
of bodies.      " To     distinguish   this   motion    from others, and to sig
 nify the cause of our sensation of heat,"               and of the expansion or
expansive pressure produced in matter by heat
                                                              " the name repulsive
motion has been adopted."*
     The Dynamical Theory of Heat, thus established                by  Sir Humphrey
Davy, is extended to radiant            heat by the discovery of phenomena,
especially those of the polarization           of radiant heat, which render it
excessively probable that heat propagated through vacant space, or
through diathermane substances, consists of waves of transverse
vibrations in an all-pervading          medium.
    *  From Davy's first work, entitled " An Essay on Heat, Light, and the Com
binations of Light," published in 1799 in " Contributions to Physical and Me
dical Knowledge, principally from the West of England ; collected by Thomas
Beddoes, M.D. ," and republished in Dr Davy's edition of his brother's collected
 works, vol. ii. London, 1836.

     The recent discoveries* of the generation of heat through the
friction of fluids in motion, and by the magneto-electric excitation
of galvanic currents would, either of them,                 be sufficient       to demon
strate the immateriality of heat, and would so afford,                      if required, a
perfect confirmation of Sir Humphrey Davy's views.
     Although Sir Humphrey Davy had established                      beyond      all doubt
the fact that heat may be created              by mechanical work,           the converse
proposition, that heat is lost when mechanical work is produced from
thermal agency, appears to have been first enunciated                       by  Mayer in
1841. In 1842 the same proposition was enunciated                          by  Joule, and
a number        of most admirable          experiments     illustrating the mutual
convertibility of heat and mechanical effect,                 and     the    constancy of
thermal      effects   through      the most varied means,         from given causes,
are described in his paper on Magneto-electricity, and adduced in it
from his former experimental researches by which the laws of the evo
lution of heat by the galvanic battery                had  been established.           The
same paper contains the first investigation on true principles that has
ever     been made     of the numerical        relations   which connect heat and
mechanical effect        ;  and numerical determinations of            "  the mechanical
equivalent       of  a     thermal    unit"    are given     as the results         of two
classes of experiments,            in each of which mechanical work is spent,
and no other final effect than the creation of heat is produced, in
one class by means of magneto-electric currents, and in the other, by
 means of the friction of fluids in motion.
      In   subsequent experimental           researches he has          made     more ac
curate determinations,          and, from his last set of experiments               on  the
 friction of fluids,       he  concludes    " that   the quantity        of   heat capable
of raising the temperature of a pound of water (weighed in vacuv
and taken at between 55° and 60°) by 1° Fahr., requires for its
 evolution the expenditure of a mechanical force represented by the
  fall of 772 lb. through the          space of one foot."
     *1In May    1842,   Mayer announced, in the Annalen        of Wohler and Liebig,
that he had raised the temperature of water from 12° to 13° cent., by agitating
 it.   In 1843, Joule announced in the Philosophical Magazine that " heat is
evolved by the passage of water through narrow tubes ;" and in the month of
 August of that year (1843), he announced to the British Association that heat
is generated when work is spent in turning a magneto-electric machine, or an
electro-magnetic engine.         (See his paper
                                                 " on the Calorific Effects of Magnetn-
lilectricity and on the Mechanical Value of Heat." Phil. Mag. vol. xxiii. 1843.)

   The object of the present paper is threefold —
   (1.) To show what modifications of the conclusions arrived at by
Carnot, and by others who have followed his peculiar mode of rea
soning regarding the motive power of heat, must be made when the
hypothesis      of the Dynamical       Theory, contrary     as  it   is to Carnofs
fundamental       hypothesis, is adopted.
    (2.) To point out the significance in the Dynamical Theory, of the
numerical results deduced from Regnault's observations on steam,
and    communicated       about two years ago to the           Society      with   an
Account of Carnot's Theory, by the author of the present paper                 ; and
to show    that, by taking these       numbers     (subject  to correction when
accurate experimental        data regarding the density of saturated steam
shall have been afforded), in connection with Joule's mechanical equi
valent of a thermal unit, a complete theory of the motive power of heat,
 within the temperature limits of the experimental data, is obtained.
    (3.) To point out some remarkable relations connecting the phy
sical properties of all substances,        established by reasoning analogous
to that of Carnot,      but founded on the contrary principle of the             Dy
namical Theory.
   In the first part of the paper Mr Joule's principle regarding the
mechanical equivalent of heat is shown to be in reality as certainly
true as Carnot's would be         if the hypothesis that heat is matter were
not false  ;   and it is therefore adopted by the author, not as Carnot's
principle    was   adopted    by   him temporarily     " as the most probable
basis for an investigation         of the motive power of heat" without a
belief in its rigorous exactness ; but, with implicit confidence, as a
true law of nature.
   The following axiom         is also adopted   : —
   It  is impossible by means        of inanimate material agency to derive
mechanical effect from any portion of matter by cooling it below the
temperature of the coldest of the surrounding objects.
   From Joule's principle, and from this axiom, the two following pro
positions, which constitute the foundation of the theory, are deduced.
   Prop. I. — When equal quantities of mechanical effect                   are   pro
duced by any means whatever from purely thermal sources, or lost
in purely     thermal    effects,  equal quantities    of heat     are put out     of
existence, or are generated.
   Prop.     II. — If  an engine be such that        when it is worked         back,
wards the       physical   and mechanical agencies in every part of its

                                            51
 motions are all reversed, it produces as much
                                                              mechanical effect as
 can be produced by any thermo-dynamic
                                                      engine with the same tem
peratures of source and refrigerator, from a given
                                                                 quantity of heat.
    The second of these propositions was first enunciated
                                                                               by Car
not, and demonstrated by him on the assumption of his
                                                                           principle of
the permanence of heat.           It was first enunciated and demonstrated,
without making that assumption, upon the true
                                                                   principles of the
dynamical theory, by Clausius, in the second part of his
                                                                                 paper*
 (published in May 1850), who founds it on an axiom
                                                                         substantially
equivalent to that quoted above.             The author of        the present paper
gives    the   demonstration,     which      is closely    analogous      to Carnot's
original demonstration, and the axiom             on which it is founded,
                                                                                just as
they occurred to him at a time when he was only
                                                                    acquainted with
 the first part (published in April                  of
                                            1850)        Clausius1   paper, and was
not aware that the proposition had been either
                                                                 enunciated or de
 monstrated except by Carnot.
    From the establishment of the second proposition,                  on the   princi
ples of the dynamical theory, and an axiom that
                                                                        cannot pro
 bably be denied, it is shown that all the conclusions
                                                                         obtained by
 Carnot and others who have followed him and
                                                               adopted his princi
ples, which depend merely on the fundamental equation
 " Carnot's function," in terms of                                         expressing
                                            certain physical properties of
                                                                                    any
substance whatever, require no modification.
    But the Theory of the motive power of              heat through     finite ranges
of temperature       requires most important          alterations    which form the
subject of the second part of the present paper.                 The following ex
pressions are given for the amount of work
                                                           (W) derivable from a
unit of heat     introduced     into an engine         at the temperature S,          if
the coldest part       of the engine      is   at the temperature        T;   in terms
of the portion (1— R) of the unit of             heat which      is   converted into
work, and for the remainder,           (R,) which       is emitted as waste        into
the refrigerator.

  Tables of the values of these quantities, for different ranges, ob
tained by using the values of it shown in Table                   I.   of the author's
Account of Carnot's Theory, are given.               An application to      the case of
the Fowey-Consols engine which, according to the data quoted in the
Appendix to that paper, appears to have worked at 76 per cent, of
the true duty for its range of temperature (which was assumed to be
from 30° to 140° cent.), instead of only 67 per cent, of the duty
according to Carnot's Theory ; and to have emitted into the con
denser only 82 per cent, of the heat taken in at the boiler, the re
maining 18 per cent, having been converted into mechanical effect.
  It   is shown that       the advantage originally pointed out by Carnot
may be still anticipated from the use of air instead of steam, as the
effective range of temperature of the air-engine can be made much
greater than is practicable in the case of the steam-engine.                 As an
example      of the economy attainable            by using a      large range, it is
shown that, with a range of from 0° to 600° cent., about three-fourths
of the full equivalent           is attainable by a perfect engine, while with
the range      from 30° to 140°, which             is about the greatest that is
practicable with steam-engines, even a perfect engine                    could not ob
tain more than 27, or about one-fourth of the full equivalent of the
heat used.
  The third part of the paper contains investigations of some for-
mulae with reference to the specific heats of substances of any kind,
derived from the equations which express the two fundamental pro
positions.      It    contains also an application       of    these equations to the
case   of   a medium consisting          of two parts, of     the same substance, at
the same temperature,             in different states.        The results   are    appli
cable both to the effects of pressure on the melting points of solids,
and to the conditions           of saturated vapours.         One of the conclusions
pointed out     is,   the very remarkable property of saturated steam, that
its " specific heat       is   negative," which    was   discovered      independently
 by   Rankine and Clausius.

       1. On the Geology         of the Eildon Hills.          By Professor
                                  J. D. Forbes.
    The author first refers to        a paper    by   Mr Milne,       in the     15th
Volume of the Edinburgh Transactions,                 on the   Geology       of Rox
burghshire, in which the general features of this district are accu
rately described.         The present paper contains a notice of some
 minuter particulars regarding the formation of the Eildon group and
their boundaries obtained        by detailed personal examination           in 1849.
    The remarkable general parallelism of the strata of greywacké
 which forms the basis of the geology of the neighbourhood, is first
 particularly insisted upon. The intrusive rocks, chiefly felspathic,
 which abound near Melrose, have but little, if at all, disturbed the
 general strike and inclination of the greywacke rocks, the former
 being in a direction nearly east and west, and the latter nearly ver
 tical.    The triple Eildon     Hill    is composed    principally of brownish
 red felspar porphyry,        sometimes resembling         clink-stone,     at other
 times containing quartz; the south-western          hill shews vertical columns
 of the   same substance.       The author      was able to trace the strata        of
 greywacke      to a great height on the north-western           face   of the two

                                                       54
 principal      Eildons     ;    to a level in fact within                two or three hundred
feet     of the col or neck which unites them                       ;   but the principal feature
which he insists upon                is,   that the highest summit of the group                            ap
pears to be composed                of   a   mass   of grey wacke rock, caught up in the
midst of the surrounding                   trap, and     so   metamorphosed               by   it   as to be
with difficulty         recognisable         ;   but the author           considers that he has
obtained       a   suite of specimens which                   leave no doubt as to the fact
of the gradation.
   The other important                     trap- rock    is    the trap-tufa of Melrose, of
which the nature and extent were carefully                              examined, although the
latter    is   still subject to doubt.              The formation appears                 to commence
close to the railway             station at Melrose,            and to extend in            a   westerly
direction towards               Cauldshiels       Loch, its breadth being in the                      Rhy
mer's Glen still considerable, but no section which shews                                  it   could be
obtained farther west. To the south of the trap-tufa behind Melrose,
there occurs a remarkable patch of red sandstone, horizontally de
posited, and evidently identical with that of Dryburgh, where trap-
tufa also occurs.           There can be little doubt but that the tufa                              is   pos
terior in date to this sandstone, whilst the Eildon porphyry                                    is   older.
     A   collection of specimens, illustrating the paper,                            is   deposited in

2.   On cert:. in Salts of Comenic                          Acid.        By Mr Henry How.
                          Communicated               by Dr Anderson.
     The author commenced his paper with                            a few    observations on the
comparative progress of the different departments of organic chemistry,
and remarked that the subject of the polybasic acids                                 is   not so com
pletely studied as could be wished, and that he had chosen his subject
for investigation in the hope of adding some information on that point.
   After giving a short history of comenic acid, he pointed out a
new method for the purification                     of the crude acid, which consisted in
the use of ammonia as               a    solvent, in place of potass.                     In this way
he got a salt readily deprived of colour, and whose impure                                          mother
liquors were of use             in subsequent experiments.
     He then       proceeded       to detail        the salts he          had examined.                   The
bicomenate of ammonia, just mentioned, was                              a   salt, crystallizing            in
beautiful brilliant colourless prisms, whose formula                            is
                          NH4 0, HO,             C12    H,     Og   +   2HO.
They     lose their water          of crystallization         at 212°.

    The corresponding        salts   of potass and soda crystallize in pris
matic groups      ; they are   anhydrous, and their respective formulae are
                              KO, HO,      C12   H2 Og,

    He proved the non-existence of neutral alkaline salt, — but shewed
that both neutral and acid salts are formed with all the alkaline
earths.
    The acid lime-salt crystallizes        from boiling water in transparent
rhombs, whose composition is expressed by the formula
                         CaO, HO,      C„ H,     08 + 7 aq.
 The    7 aq. are expelled at 250°      Fahr.    ;  the neutral    salt of lime is
 insoluble in water, and its constitution          is
                     2 CaO,   C„ H2 08,      2  HO     + 5 aq., or
                     2 CaO,   C12  H2 Og, 2     HO+        11 aq.,
 according as the fluids from which          it is deposited      are  more or less
 dilute  ;  the aq. is driven off at    250° Fahr.
     The bicomenate of baryta crystallizes from hot water in transpa
  rent rhombs ; their composition is
                      2 (BaO,    HO,   C12  H2 08)      +   13 aq.
  The 13     aq. are lost at   212° Fahr.     ; the neutral     barytic  salt is in
  soluble in water, and has the formula
                       2 BaO,    C12  H2  Og + 2      HO   + 8 aq.
  The 8    aq. are expelled at 250°      Fahr.
     The bicomenate of magnesia crystallizes from water in crystals
  very like ferrocyanide of potassium ; their composition is
                      MgO, HO,      Ci,  H2 08, 2      HO   + 6 aq.
  The   6 aq.    being driven     off at 240° Fahr., the neutral magnesia
  salt is insoluble in water, and has the constitution
                       2 MgO,    C12   Hs  Og, 3    HO    + 8 aq.
  The 8     aq. are lost at 212°    Fahr.
     After making      a few remarks on some other salts, the author pro

                                                  56
ceeded to discuss the products            of decomposition of comenic acid. He
first   shewed    that it readily       undergoes oxidation by nitric acid, and
by solution of persulphate of iron, with the production of carbonic
and oxalic acids in both cases, and elimination of hydrocyanic acid
in the former.
   No change       is produced         by       the action     of sulphurous acid, or of
sulphuretted       hydrogen.
   When chlorine acts upon comenic acid or solution of bicomenate
of ammonia, a new acid is produced, crystallizing in fine brilliant
square prismatic needles           :   analysis shewed the composition to be
                           2H0,C1S{J,                   jo8    +   3HO.
The three atoms of water are expelled at 212°; in the formula of
the anhydrous acid, we have that of comenic acid, in which an equiva
lent of hydrogen          is   replaced      by   chlorine.
      This   is
             a    strong and bibasic acid, forming two series of salts                            :     the
author, after detailing the properties and products of decomposition
of the acid itself, describes the appearance of some of these salts, and
 gives the analysis of those of silver, whose composition he shews to be
             For the acid,             AgO HO,           C12           ^1

                                                                   {        }
             For the neutral,           2    AgO,      C1S                       °8-

       The action of bromine           is   precisely    similar, and furnishes an acid
 of the same character, appearance, and properties                           :    its formula         is
                           2HO,C12{H                     }0g   +   3HO.

 author then goes on to examine the action of hydrochloric acid gas upon
 absolute alcohol holding comenic acid in suspension.                                  He details the
 process     by which he obtains            a   substance which             is   evidently comeno-
  vinic acid, analogous to tartrovinic,                 sulphovinic acid, and such bodies.
  It has     the composition
                                HO,     C4   H5 0,      C1S    Hs 08.
  It    has an acid reaction, coagulates white                 of   egg, &c., fuses and                 sub

limes unaltered       ; but, though stable per se, is readily decomposed           in
presence of fixed         bases   :  for this   reason     only  the ammonia salt
could be obtained, and that in a peculiar                 way  ; sufficient  evidence
was given, however, of its being a true salt of the constitution
                          NH4 0,      C4   H60, C„ H, 08.
     The author then gives          a description     of a curious change which
ensues when          an  alkaline    ammoniacal      solution of comenic acid is
 boiled,     and which results in the production of comenamic acid, which
 he shews to be constituted like osamic acid, it being an acid amide.
 It   is derived from     the bicomenate of ammonia by the elimination
 of two atoms of water           ;   consequently,     its formula,     as proved by
  analysis, is
                                  HO, C„ H4 N07.
  It  crystallizes    with four equivalents of water in beautiful micaceous
  scales   :   its most distinctive    property   is the magnificent purple colour
  it forms with persalts of iron.
      It  forms crystallizable      salts with a certain      proportion    of potass,
  soda, or ammonia,        which have an acid reaction.
      The formula of the ammonia salt is
                               NH4 O, C„ H4 N07.
   The corresponding salt of silver is transparent and jelly-like               ; that
   of baryta crystallizes readily ; its composition appears to be
                            BaO,     C„   H4 N07     + 2   HO.
       A  solution of the ammonia salt made alkaline gives with nitrate              of
   silver    a yellow precipitate,    which speedily becomes       black, — and   with
   chlorine of barium, an insoluble white precipitate, which may be con
   sidered as having the composition expressed in the formula
                           BaO,     C12  H4 N07 + BaO HO.
       The author concludes, by saying he believes he has observed in
   the behaviour of comenamic acid, under certain circumstances, phe
   nomena which will repay further investigation.

                     Spherical Masses.           By Dr G. Wilson.
        The author exhibited these spherical concretions, which had formed

                                          f18
 in a subliming chamber, where carbonate of ammonia from gas liquor
 was condensed   ; apparently in consequence        of a local whirl affecting the
condensing particles.      They were formed of acicular crystals, confusedly
grouped, without a     trace of radiation or of any regular arrangement.
  4. On the    Compressibility of Water.               By W.       J.  Macquorn
                             Rankine, Esq., C.E.
    The results of   the experiments of        M. Grassi    on the above subject
 (Comptes Rendus      XIX.)      follow sensibly this law.
    The   compressibility     of water is inversely proportional               to  the
density,   multiplied     by   the   temperature as measured from the ab
solute zero    of  a perfect-gas thermometer, viz. : — a point 274°-6
below the ordinary      zero of the centigrade scale, and 462°-28               below
that of Fahrenheit's scale.
    Hence the compressibility         of water follows sensibly the       same    law
with that of a gas.
    Let  & be the compressibility           of water per atmosphere         ;   D its
density, the maximum density being unity             ;  r the absolute tempera
ture, then
                                 b =
                                         kVd
where
          K  = 72 atmospheres per centigrade degree, or
                 40 atmospheres per degree of Fahrenheit.
D may    be  computed by the author's formula for the expansion of
liquids. — (Edinburgh       New Philosophical Journal, October 1849.)
   Dr Gregory read        a letter    from his Grace the Duke of            Argyll,
describing the locality of a white muddy deposit sent with the letter,
and exhibited in a dry state to the Society.              The deposit occurs in
what appears to be an old channel between              Loch Baa, at the foot of
Ben More in Mull, and         the sea, passing     through a dead flat.           The
lake discharges itself now by another channel.                Dr Gregory found
the deposit to be silicious, with a trace of organic               matter,    and to
consist entirely of the silicious cuirasses of infusoria,            like the berg-
mehl of Sweden.         Navicula viridis, and        some    bacillaria   had been
observed   in it by Dr Gregory,        and  Dr Douglas Maclagan, who under
took a microscopical       examination,       found, besides Navicula viridis,

                                         59
several species      of Eunotia, and     the  beautiful   rings of Gallionella
varians.      The deposit    occurs in the old channel to a very consider
able depth, a long stick having failed to reach the bottom of the
white mud.

1. On the Economy     of Single-acting Expansive Steam En
      gines, and Expansive Machines generally ; being Supple
      ments to a Paper on the Mechanical Action of Heat.
      By W. J. M. Rankine, Esq., C.E.
   The author, in the first place,           states       the equations, which, when
used in conjunction with the Tables in the                    Appendix            to the   original
paper referred to, serve to compute the action of Cornish                                 pumping
engines.      They are similar in form to those of M.                             de     Pambour,
but differ in the expressions for the pressure and volume of steam,
and for its expansive action, which the author in the original paper
deduced     from theory.

     R, the resistance per unit of area of piston arising from the
              useful load.

    The results of the last two formulae are compared with the expe
riments made by Mr Wicksteed on a large Cornish pumping-engine
at Old Ford at five different ratios of expansion ; and the agreement
is found to   be so close as to prove that the results    of the theory are
practically correct.
   The results of experiment generally shew a somewhat less expen
diture of steam for a given duty than theory indicates. This is con
ceived to arise from the cylinder       being heated   by a jacket commu
nicating with the boiler, in which the temperature is much higher
than the highest temperature in the cylinder.
   The theory is next applied to the solution of the problem of the
economy of Cornish engines.        The merit of first proposing this pro
blem is believed to belong to the Artizan Club, who have offered

    The problem in question          is this   ; given the following
                                                                       —

              interest of cost of boilers.
       k, the annual interest of the cost of the engine, per unit of area
              of piston.
    It is required to determine the ratio             of expansion   s

 the dimensions of the engine), such that the annual expense due to
 interest and fuel

    A  numerical example is added of the solution of this problem of
 economy.
    The next portion of this paper relates       to the proportion     of heat
converted into expansive power by machines.
    A  machine working by expansive power consists essentially of a
portion of some    substance which alternately        expands and contracts
under the influence       of heat ;  receiving heat and      expanding    at  a
higher temperature ; emitting heat and contracting at a lower.
    The quantity of heat emitted is less than the quantity received,
the difference being transformed        into expansive power.       To make
the proportion   of heat thus transformed        a maximum,     the tempera
tures of reception and emission should each be a constant quantity,
so  that none of the heat received or emitted          may   be employed     in
producing changes of temperature.           The temperature must     be raised
and lowered by compression and expansion only.
    Carnot  was the   first to assert the law, that when     a machine works
under these conditions, the ratio of the power evolved to the heat
originally received,   is a function of the temperatures of reception and
emission only, and independent of the nature of the working substance.
But his investigation       not  being   founded on the principle       of the
mutual conversion of heat and power, involves the fallacy that power
can be produced out      of nothing.
    The merit of combining Carnot's law with that of the converti
bility of heat and power, belongs to M. Clausius and Professor
William Thomson.
    The author, having applied        to this question the principles      laid
down in the introduction and first section     of  his paper on the Mechani
cal  Action of Heat, has arrived      at the following   conclusions : —
    First. — Carnot's    law is not an independent principle in the theory
 of heat, but is deducible as a consequence       from the equations of the
 mutual conversion of heat and expansive power given in the first
section.
    Secondly. — The     maximum value of the ratio of the quantity           of

                                            64
   heat converted into expansive power to the total quantity                   received
   by the body, is equal to that of the difference between               the tempera
   tures of reception and emission, to the absolute temperature of re
  ception diminished         by a certain    constant denoted        by x  = C    n ft b
   in the paper; which constant            must be the same        for all substances
   in nature, in order that molecular equilibrium may be possible.                 That
   is to say, let  rt  be the absolute temperature at which heat is received,
   and   r   that at which it is emitted      ;  then
            maximum of heat transformed            into power             —
                                                                  —
                                                                      rt     r0
                           total heat received                        r. —   x
       The value of      x is as yet unknown,        but as an approximation           it
  may be treated as small             enough    to be neglected        in comparison
  with p..
       Although this formula       is very different from Professor        Thomson's
  in appearance, the numerical results are nearly the same.
      The conditions of working          to which Carnot's     law is strictly appli
  cable are not attainable in the steam-engine, and                are different   from
 those on which the author's formulae             and tables in the fourth      section
 are based.        The proportion       of heat converted       into    power   in   the
 steam-engine is therefore found, both by experiment and by calcula
 tion,    to be less than     that indicated by Carnot's          law.    The author
 illustrates this fact by examples, theoretical and experimental.
 2. On the        Products of the Destructive Distillation of Animal
                 Substances.        Part II. By Dr Anderson.
      The author     commenced      by referring to the first part of his paper,
 in which       he  had determined the existence, among the products of
destructive distillation of animal substances,           of picoline, which     he had
before obtained from coal-tar, and of a new base to which he had
given the name of Petinine           ;  and had also indicated the existence          of
certain      other    bases.    On proceeding to the further investigation
of these       substances, he had been much impeded by deficiency in
materials, and had, at length, been compelled to operate on no less
than 250 gallons, or about a ton of bone oil.
      By separating the bases in a manner similar to that employed in
his first experiments, but with some                modifications detailed in the

paper, the author had succeeded in obtaining a great variety of pro
ducts which had escaped his notice when operating on a smaller scale.
Among the      most volatile products, and accompanying ammonia, he had
detected the presence of a base of the formula C2 H5 N, and which
had all the properties of mcthylamine.              He had also determined the
presence of propylamine       C6 H9     N,    and rendered probable the exist
ence of ethylamine C4 H7 N.
     In the examination of the bases boiling             at higher points great
difficulties  had been experienced, and even after many rectifications
the indications of fixed boiling points were extremely indistinct,
but, by the examination of the platinum salts, the author ascertained
the existence of      a base    boiling at about 250°, having        the formula
C10    Hj N,     for which he proposed the name             of Pyridine, and of
another boiling about 310°, which has the formula C14 H9 N, and
has the constitution of toluidino, but differs entirely from it in proper
ties. To this base the author gives the name of Lutidine.
    At   the  close  of the paper the author          also  refers shortly to the
existence of an entirely different          series of bases, to which he gives
the provisional name of Pyrrol Bases, which are distinguished by
the property of splitting up, under the action of strong acids, into a
red resinous matter, and one or other of the bases of the picoline
series.
   3. On Carmufellic Acid.              By Dr Sheridan Muspratt and
                                  Mr   Dan son.
     In this paper the authors, after mentioning the various           researches
hitherto     made on cloves and the         substances   therein  discovered, de
scribe the preparation of      the new acid.
    20 lb. of cloves are extracted by boiling water, and the decoctions,
after being concentrated to six gallons, were acted on by nitric acid,
first in the cold, afterwards with the aid of heat.                The action is
brisk, and irritating vapours are given off, which affect the eyes
strongly. Oxalic and carbonic acids are also formed.                     A white
deposit is separated by filtration,       and the filtered liquid, on evapora
tion, yields yellow     micaceous    scales    of the acid, which are obtained
colourless by combining        it with    lead   and separating    it by sulphu
retted hydrogen.
    The acid    is insoluble in alcohol, ether, and cold water, but soluble

                                            60
in hot ammonia, potash, and large quantities                   of boiling water.      It
forms gelatinous       salts    with   the solutions      of salts of baryta, stron-
tia, or lime, and also with those of lead             ;  green flakes with     salts of
copper; yellow flakes with sesquisalts of iron; white flakes with
salts of protoxide of iron and silver.                   These precipitates shrink
much in drying, feel like mica, and dissolve in nitric and hydrochlo
ric acids.
    The analyses of the acid yielded results indicating the formula
C24 H20
            0 32. The baryta and lead salts appear to contain the acid
entire, which is unusual, their formula               being  MO,    C24   H20 032, in
stead of the base replacing an equivalent               of water.
    The authors are       occupied     with eugenic acid and the neutral oil of
 cloves.
 4.  Farther Remarks on the Intermitting Brine Springs of
                   Kissingen.           By Professor Forbes.
    On the 7th of January               1839,     I  communicated       to  the Royal
 Society of Edinburgh a pretty detailed account of the singular mineral
 and gas springs of      Kissingen, in Bavaria, then much            less known than
 at present to English travellers.            I  refer to this paper, printed in the
 Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal, April 1839, for the details of
 the most curious of these, a saline spring called Kunde-Brunnen, which
 was   at that time regularly periodic;              a copious    and turbulent     dis
 charge of brine, mixed with torrents of carbonic acid gas, recurring
 six or eight times in the twenty-four                  hours.    This phenomenon,
 exactly as described        in   my paper, appears to have           continued with
 slight variation     ever since, that is, for a period of twelve years,
 subject, however, to      t he variation formerly         mentioned, that when the
 brine is actively withdrawn by pumps, for the                  manufacture of salt,
 the periods lengthen.          I  have no additional       observations of import
 ance to offer on this spring,         beyond the remarkable fact of the con
 tinuity   of these    variations,     surely the more remarkable             when we
 recollect   that  the spring        is entirely     artificial, rising through      an
 Artesian    bore 312 Bavarian         feet deep.
    Much greater changes have             taken    place in the Schonborn Quelle,
briefly referred     to  in my former         paper as having        a depth of 550
Bavarian     feet, as overflowing        once    in seven    or eight    minutes, and
yielding    a feeble    supply     of weak      brine, containing     only one and a

                                          67
 half per cent, of salt.         The boring       process    has     been     carried    on,
though     slowly,   nearly ever since, and it is at present one of the
deepest    Artesian bores       ever  made, being, at the time of my visits,
 1878     feet.     The    bore    passes   first   through       Bunter        Sandstein
 (which forms the bed        of the valley, the surrounding heights being
capped     by muschel kalk and keuper), to a depth of 1240 feet; the
only spring met with in that space being the small salt spring which
existed in 1838, which occurred at a depth of 222 feet, with a tem
perature     of  8° Reaumur ;      it yielded only      6 cubic       feet    per minute,
with   1 J  per cent, of salt.     On piercing the sandstone from between it
and the      gres vosgien rose a powerful            spring,      containing        2^ per
cent,  of salt, of a temperature of 15° Reaumur, or 66° Fahr., and
yielding from 93 to 100 cubic feet of water per minute, and proba
bly quite as much carbonic           acid gas.      These fluids were driven up
the shaft with enormous force by subterranean pressure.
    Not satisfied with       this considerable success,            the intelligent        in
spector,    Mr Knorr,       continued     the laborious       and      expensive        work
of boring,      in the confident      hope    of reaching,        if not the         bed   of
salt, at least the spring       of stronger brine.        At    1590 feet the upper
limit of the zechstein or magnesian limestone was reached, and at
1680 feet a source of carbonic acid gas appeared, which increased
the height to which the water could be driven up.                     At   last, at 1740
feet, the    limits  of  the rock salt     formation was attained, the boring
irons bringing up saliferous clay, mixed with gypsum and anhydrite,
which continued down to the depth of 1878 feet, and which is capa
ble  of impregnating      the salt water to saturation,           coming up charged
with between 27 and            28 per cent, of salt.            It   is to be observed,
however, that it is only that portion            of the spring         rising at 1240
feet which can descend to the bottom              and   then rise up in this state
of saturation.       The greater part retains its           old per-centage           of 2£.
 It is therefore of urgent        consequence      to continue the bore              until a
spring has been reached at a lower level than the salt, and of sufficient
power to rise through it to the surface, and in that way alone can
this mineral treasure be made available for use               ;  and as the thickness
of the rock salt formation is supposed to be 700 or 800 feet, it may
be  long yet before     this object is obtained.          At     present,      if I  under
stand    right, the spring    is not, properly     speaking, intermittent,             but it
 may easily be rendered so by a singular             artifice which         I  saw put in
practice.       When   the   workmen wish to stop the flow of water, in

                                          68
 order to proceed with the boring, they surround the rods with a plug
 of clay bandaged with cloth, so that by lowering it into the bore-
 hule, which contracts at a certain depth, they stop               it as when one
 corks a phial.      In  an instant all is   still, the turmoil of water        foam
 ing with gas is at an end;        and this tranquillity lasts for many days,
 and when the spring again rises, it may be stopped out in a similar
 way.     Inspector    Knorr thinks that     he has established a kind of law
 in these    remissions    to  this effect, that the number of days which
elapse    before the spontaneous         return    of the spring is thrice the
 number during which it had before flowed.                Thus, if the spring has
been    allowed    to rise    uninterruptedly     for five days,      and    is   then
stopped, it will remain fifteen days out.
    Under ordinary circumstances, the           gas   and water exhaust their
projectile    force in a cauldron       or shaft of considerable         depth and
width, in which the Artesian bore terminates               ; but  Mr Knorr       gave
us an opportunity       of witnessing its ascensional power, by fitting a
tube into the entrance of the bore, thus leading it up to the surface
of the ground; it then spouted from that level to a height of at least
50 feet in the free air, having at its emission a diameter equal to
that of a man's thigh.         When we consider that it           has  first to rise
 1240   feet through    the earth, and that it is impelled by a mysterious
and unseen, but apparently exhaustless, power beneath, and with this
astonishing force, the phenomenon is certainly              very surprising.
    I shall only add the temperatures            of  some    remarkable     springs,
taken in 1850 with        great care, and which        are   the very same with
those observed     by me twelve years previous, the results of which may
be found    in my former paper.

5.   On a    Method of Discovering Experimentally the Relation
           between the Mechanical Work spent and the Heat
           produced by the Compression of a Gaseous Fluid. By
           Professor William Thomson.
    The important      researches of Joule on the thermal circumstances
connected with the expansion and compression               of air, and the ad
                                                                         " On the
mirable    reasoning upon them expressed in his paper,*
Changes     of Temperature produced by the Rarefaction and Conden
sation  of   Air  ;" especially the way in which         he   takes into account
any mechanical effect that         may   be   externally     produced, or inter
nally lost   in fluid friction, have introduced an entirely          new    method
of treating     questions    regarding    the physical      properties    of fluids.
The object of the present paper is to show how, by the                 use  of this
new    method,     in connection with       the principles      explained   in the
author's preceding        paper on the Dynamical           Theory     of Heat, a
complete theoretical      view    may  be    obtained of the phenomena ex
perimented on by Joule,          and to point out some of the objects             to
bo   attained by a continuation         and extension of his experimental
researches.
    The formulae investigated in this paper are divided into three
classes  : —
    1.  Those which are       certainly true for all substances, or for all
fluids.
    2. Those     which    are   necessarily true    for any fluid       subject   to
Boyle's and Dalton's laws of density.
                   * Phil. Magazine,  1845.    Vol. xxvi., p. 369.

                                            70
   3. Those which         would     be   true for every fluid subject to those
laws of density,      if " Mayer's      hypothesis,"      that the heat evolved by
compression, when         the temperature          is kept constant, is the exact
equivalent of the work spent in the compression, were                       true for any
one such fluid.
    The principal formulae of the first class are two which express re
spectively the quantity of heat evolved by the compression, by uni
form pressure in all directions, of any substance                  whatever,     kept at
a constant temperature         ;  and the total quantity of heat evolved by
a given    quantity     of fluid forced through           a small     orifice, before    it
attains to precisely its primitive temperature.
   The former of        these formulae reduces         itself  to
                                            E
                               H=      —p.       r^W
where W is the        mechanical work spent in             the compression, and         H
the quantity of heat emitted, for any fluid subject to                      Boyle's   and
Dalton's laws.       This formula       was   first given in the Appendix to the
author's Account of Carnot's Theory, — where it was shown to fol
low from Regnault's observations on the pressure and latent heat                         of
saturated steam, that        —   (l1t-jLl^    cannot be nearly         constant for     all
temperatures,     if   the density of saturated steam fulfils                Boyle's  and
Dalton's laws    ;   but that      the value of this expression is very nearly
J,  the mechanical equivalent of a thermal unit,                  for ordinary      atmo
spheric temperatures.            Hence this theory, and the assumed density
of saturated    steam,     are in   full agreement with Joule's experiments
which establish as approximately             true for atmospheric          temperatures
the hypothesis      which     was    assumed      irrespectively      of experimental
verification, by Mayer.
    The other formula mentioned             above becomes,        for a fluid subject to
the "   gaseous"    laws, —
                                                                     p
where p is the uniform            pressure    in one portion         of a long tube        ;
p' the uniform         pressure in another           portion,    separated from        the
former by a piece of tube containing               a partition      with a very small
orifice  ; t the temperature of the           entering     fluid up to the locality

                                            71
where     the   rushing     commences, and           the pressure begins to vary,
which is also the temperature             to which the fluid is reduced          in the
other part     of the tube before it          reaches   the end   ; and  H   the quan
tity of heat which must be taken away to fulfil this condition, during
the passage      of  a  quantity of fluid of volume u', under               a pressure
equal to p', at the temperature t, through the apparatus.
    From this it follows, that the test of Mayer's hypothesis                   for any
particular temperature           is to   try whether,       when the air enters at
that temperature,        it  leaves    the  rapids at precisely the same tempe
rature.      Calorimetrical methods of experimenting upon this appa
ratus,   like those of Joule,            but susceptible       of being continuously
used   for any period of time, are suggested for determining,                  possibly
with very great accuracy, the value of
                                    1              E
                                    J       /x(l+Et)
for any temperature,          should it not be exactly zero for all           tempera
tures,    as it would be      if Mayer's hypothesis were true.              The value
of  J having      been determined         by Joule     with very remarkable        accu
racy,   it follows that such experimental researches, besides affording
the solution      of the problem which forms the subject of this paper,
would determine the values of Carnot's function, by an entirely new
method,      for the temperatures of the experiments.
    Dr Gregory         exhibited      a specimen       of a beautiful    fibrous silky
white salt, taken about thirteen                years ago,     by Donald     Campbell,
Esq., from the joinings of the slabs of limestone forming the roof of
the highest       of the chambers          of construction, discovered by Colonel
 Vyse above the King's Chamber                  in the great pyramid of Ghizeh.
 No other part is lined          with    limestone, and there only this salt ap
 peared.      Dr Gregory found it to         be absolutely pure chloride of sodium,
 so  pure, indeed, that it had           not   undergone the slightest change in
 thirteen     years, although         only    wrapped in paper.         Had lime or
 magnesia       been    present, it would have deliquesced.                 Under     the
 microscope,       the fibres      exhibited     oblique angles and fractures,       and
 they may possibly          be   regular     six-sided    prisms,   derived from the
cube.       Dissolved in water, the salt crystallized by evaporation in
 the usual form.         When      heated,    it  gave  off  a trace of water, but re

                                           72
  tained its form and aspect.           The origin of this salt  is obscure   ;   but
  it is probably      derived   from   the limestone,    which   is known to       be
  nummulite,      and believed    to be marine limestone.

   The following Communications            were read    : —
1.  On the Total Eclipse of the Sun on 28th July 1851, ob
       served at Goteborg ; with a description of a new Position
       Micrometer. By William Swan, Esq.
   I  observed the eclipse from a hill about a mile to the north of
Goteborg,     situated in latitude 57° 43' 5", longitude 0h 47m 49s, in
company with Mr Edward Lane, Advocate, who kindly rendered mo
his valuable assistance in making       the observations   for time.     The
telescope   I  used was furnished   by  Mr Adie   of Edinburgh.       It  has
a good object-glass, with an aperture of 2-1 inches, and about 31-5
inches focal length     ; and the eye-piece employed in observing the
eclipse magnified about 28 times. A dark glass, lent me by Professor
Chevallier,    consisting of a coloured prism achromatized by a prism
of colourless glass, slid in a groove before the eye-piece, so as to
admit of being instantly removed. This glass made the sun's image
 appear yellow, slightly tinged with green.
    As considerable discrepancies occur in     the  positions assigned by
different observers to the prominences       seen at the eclipse   of 1812,

                                           74
I   made     use of a position     micrometer,      devised for the purpose               of
rapidly determining their places on the sun's limb. A circular plate
of metal, 8 inches in diameter, was attached, by a collar passing
through      its centre, to the sliding     tube of the telescope, to which               it
was  firmly clamped, so as not to turn round.   This plate was
covered with a disc of card on the side next the eye-end of the
telescope. Inside the tube carrying the plate, another tube carrying
the eye-piece, slid smoothly, so as to admit of being freely turned
round.     The latter tube      was furnished with two springy arms, point
ing in opposite directions, in front of the plate, like the hands of a
clock, and     having   steel   points, by which holes could be pricked                   in
the card disc.      A   small level was attached at          right angles        to one   of
these arms, and parallel          to the card disc.        In    the eye-piece were
fixed three equidistant         parallel   spider lines,     the outer two being
placed at an interval      equal to the moon's apparent diameter calcu
lated for the time of the total phase of the eclipse             ; so   that when the
outer wires were made to embrace the moon's disc, the middle wire
would pass through        its centre.       The instrument         was      adjusted for
observation, by causing the middle              wire to coincide with a plumb-
line,   seen at a distance      through    the telescope     ;   while,     at the same
time, the bubble of the level was brought to the middle of its tube
by turning the arms, which were then securely clamped to the tube
carrying the eye-piece. It is evident that             if,
                                             after this adjustment,
the bubble were again brought to the middle of the tube, while the
outer wires were made to embrace the sun's disc, the middle wire
would pass through its vertex        ;     and two holes being pricked in the
card, the line joining them would represent the sun's vertical diameter
at the time of observation.         If next,    while the sun was kept between
the outer wires, the middle wiro was made to bisect any object at its
limb, and holes were again pricked in the card, the angles between
the lines joining the respective pairs of holes would measure the
angular distance of the object from the sun's vertex.                   In this manner
the positions of the red prominences, seen during the total phase of
the eclipse, could be rapidly registered on the card, without ever re
moving the eye from the telescope.
    The observations of time were            made   by means of         a   box chrono
meter by Adams of London, obligingly furnished by Lieutenant C.
A. Pettersson, of the Navigation School of Goteborg.                        It   was com
pared with his standard chronometer about 3h 15m before the com

                                         75
mencement       of the eclipse, and again, the following day, after an
 interval of 24 hours.
    The weather, which previously had              a very unfavourable      aspect,
improved     rapidly before the commencement of the eclipse.               An ex
tremely thin cirrous cloud, however, continued to overspread the sky ;
 but this did not sensibly impair the definition of the sun, which was
 remarkably good until some time after the total phase, when the
sky   became more     thickly clouded. During the progress of the eclipse
the   cusps  continued quite sharp, until the sun was reduced to an ex
tremely narrow crescent of about 90° or less, when they were sensibly
rounded.      This appearance became more and more decided, until at
length the moon's limb           was quickly    joined   to that   of the sun by
numerous thick lines, which occupied nearly all the remaining crescent
of  the sun.     The   spaces between the lines were at         first rudely rect
angular, but gradually       became    rounded so as to resemble a        string of
bright   beads, after which they finally disappeared.             The   same   phe
nomena were seen in a reverse order after the total                phase, but the
beads were not so numerous as before.
    The moment Baily's        beads were gone,      I looked at the   sun with the
naked    eye, and saw the corona        fully formed.      The darkness at first
seemed great, owing to        the contrast of the recent sunshine ; and Mr
Lane found it necessary        to use a candle     in reading the chronometer.
The horizon, chiefly towards the north, was filled with light of a mag
nificent orange-yellow, or amber-colour, by which             I  had no difficulty
in writing down the time of the commencement of the totality.                    It
was    a ghastly    spectacle    to behold — a     black sun surrounded        by a
pallid halo of light, and       suspended    in a sky of sombre leaden hue;
and there    was so much to observe        in the effects of the eclipse on the
appearance of the landscape, that probably about 15s elapsed before
I  looked again through the telescope, having previously removed the
dark glass.      The first object that attracted my attention            was a re
markable hook-shaped red prominence, situated 110° 30' to the west
of the sun's vertex       ; and immediately         afterwards    I  saw   another
prominence with a serrated top, resembling a chain              of peaked moun
tains, which    was   situated a little below the first,         132° 40' to the
west of the sun's vertex.           At   the risk of offering       what may be
deemed a whimsical comparision,           I can best describe the form of the
hook- shaped prominence          by saying    it resembled     the  Eddystone or
Bell Rock lighthouse, transferred          to the sun, with its top beginning
                                                                      O 2

 to fuse and    bend over, like a half-melted        rod of glass.     The pro
 minences increased very sensibly in height during the progress of
 the total phase, until at length the hook-shaped one had attained an
 altitude which    I estimated    at rather more than 2'.          Both   had re
 markably definite outlines, and       their forms were permanent so long
 as they remained visible    ;  the only change being, that they increased
in height,     and became wider at the base, evidently owing to the
 moon's motion gradually disclosing         those   parts of them which were
nearest to the sun's limb.        They were of a full rose-tint, and were
distinctly visible    to the naked eye        by the strong red tinge they
 imparted to the corona in their neighbourhood.
     The corona   cast no sensible shadow.      To the naked    eye, it appeared
slightly tinged with pale purple or lavender colour, which, perhaps,
was owing to the contrast of the strong yellow light in the horizon ;
for, when viewed through the telescope,         it  was  silvery white.    It was
distinctly   radiated, and shewed no trace of annular          structure.     The
most striking feature it presented was the appearance of brilliant
beams     of light, which shone out in various directions.            They were
sharply defined, and brighter than the rest of the corona            ;  and they
were visible to some distance beyond its general outline.              The most
remarkable of these objects was       a mass   of light of   a tolerably  regular
conoidal form, with its base     towards the sun, and the curvature of its
sides somewhat concave outwards, situated 28° 30' to the east of the
sun's vertex.
    The first of the following Tables contains the observations, by
means of the position micrometer, of the red prominences, and of the
only spots visible near the sun's limb on the day of the eclipse, with
the times of observation       ;  the second,     the times of the different
phases   of the eclipse as observed by me, and also Lieutenant Petters-
son's observations of time, which he has kindly placed at my dis
posal  ; and the third, a series     of therinometric       observations.     The
latter were made      by means    of two small thermometers by Adie of
Edinburgh, which were suspended           in the shade.      Their scales, by   a
recent comparison with his standard thermometer, were found cor
rect to the tenth of a degree.

 2. On the      Total Solar Eclipse of July 28, 1851, as seen on
       the west coast of Norway. By Professor C. Piazzi Smyth.
    The author, who       was  in the party    of Dr Robinson,    Mr Alan
 Stevenson, and others,       mentioned the very kind manner in which
the Hydrographical Department         had not only lent its instruments,
but even caused them to be altered and adapted for the occasion, and
also spoke    of the liberal conduct of the Board of Northern Lights in
conveying the observers to the station selected.     This was on the Bue
island, on the western coast of Norway, in lat. 61° 9' 42", and long.
E. 27m    0s.
    The arrangements were, however, defeated in a great measure by
the cloudy state of the sky, which prevented any thing being seen of
the sun or moon during or after the totality.
    The instant of the commencement of the phenomenon was, however,
observed, as well as an interesting case of an apparent repetition of it ;
and a good idea was obtained       of the amount of personal and instru
mental equation affecting the optical part only of the observations,
and reaching, in this instance, the large quantity of lm and 50s.
    The darkness which       came   on at the same moment, was much
more intense than would otherwise have been the case had the sky
been  clear.     The heavens appeared all cloudy and black, except
a  small strip on the north horizon, which became of a lurid-red

                                          79
 colour.     Except in that quarter, where some very distant mountain
 tops were visible out of the range of the moon's shadow, the land
 and sea were of a dark olive-green hue ; and the awful aspect of the
 whole    was felt to be quite capable of producing               those effects   on
 ignorant men which history records          ;  while the Norse peasants about
 confirmed such a conclusion by their sudden and terrified flight.
 3. On the Nature of the Red Prominences observed during
       a Total Solar Eclipse.             By Professor C. Piazzi Smyth.
    The author remarked, that the various observers who had seen
the eclipse of 1842, gave such generally similar testimony of the
place  and the size     of the rod prominences       as satisfactorily   established
them     to be some      celestial phenomenon.         Then    as to the question,
whether they belong          to the sun or the moon, the observers            them
selves were unanimous in the former view, and the red points then
became flaming masses of fire some 40,000 miles in height.
    The author, however,         was  by no means      satisfied with the exact
ness of the proofs alleged ; he had tried experiments, suggested by
Mr Nasmyth, for making the red points appear, if real, but without
success    ; and he further alluded to the different shapes given by the
various observers      to the same prominence, as rather        militating against
the idea of its being      a large body at the distance of the sun.
    On   the other hand,       if the red points     be merely the     light of the
sun diffracted somehow at the moon's              edge, the difference amongst
observers at small distances on the earth's surface would be much
more easily explained        ;   and he found that by introducing           a small
ball into the    telescope    when directed to the sun, and making it act
similarly    to the   moon during       the total eclipse, that very similar-
looking points and tongues of pink flame could             be produced.
    He had not, however, yet          been  able to make the eclipsing-ball
occult the artificial pink prominences, and, therefore, would only
attempt to establish that the solar existence of the points is only pro
bable ; and that those who hold it to be proved, should contrive
some means by which they may shew the said things in real being,
without getting      some moon, natural        as  in the   eclipse,  or artificial,
as in the experiment, to stand in front of the sun, and act on its light
by diffraction    or otherwise.

4.  Dr Traill then gave the following Notice of some of the
   recent Astronomical Discoveries of Mr Lassell, and exhibited
    an     accurate      lithograph by him of Saturn, with the re
    cently-detected Dark Ring, &c. &c.
    Mr William        Lassell, of Starfield,      near Liverpool, who has gained
a  high reputation by his admirable method of constructing                    large re
flecting telescopes,       has largely added to his scientific character         within
the present year (1851), by the discovery of an eighth satellite to
Saturn, and determining its period of revolution ; and also, by the
detection of two        new    satellites    of Uranus.     This last discovery is
thus annouueed by him in a letter in my possession                  : —
    "  I  have discovered two new satellites of            Uranus.      They are in
terior   to the innermost       of the two bright satellites discovered by Sir
William Herschel, and generally known as the second and fourth.
It  would appear, that they are also interior to                 Sir William Her-
schel's first satellite, to which he assigns a period of revolution of
about five days and twenty-one hours — (but which satellite                      I have
as yet been unable to recognise.)
    "  I  first saw these two, of which         I now communicate      the discovery,
on the 24th       of October,       and had then little doubt that they would
prove satellites.       I obtained     further observations of them        on the  28th
and 30th of October, and also last night               ; and find, that for so short
an interval,     the observations are well satisfied by          a period of revolu
tion of almost exactly four days for the outermost,                   and two and a
half days for the          closest.     They    are very faint    objects  — certainly
have not the brightness             of the two conspicuous ones,           but all four
were, last night, steadily visible,           in the quieter moments of the air,
with a magnifying power of 778 on my 20 feet reflector."                    — Novem
ber 3, 1851.
    It  is well known, that the noble instrument             here alluded to is the
work of the hands of this eminent astronomer.                   Its focal distance is
20 feet.       The great mirror           is 2 feet   in diameter,     2T8ff inches   in
thickness, and weighs 420 lb.               Mr Lassell's method of obviating the
flexure of the mirror by its own weight, when resting                     on  its edge,
is exceedingly       ingenious.       A  series of twenty-seven screws, arranged
in triplets in three-armed iron plates, thus                 press against the back
of tho mirror,       so as to keep      its true figure    unchanged by position.
Nothing      can exceed the perfection of the metallic             composition,     and

                                     81
the beauty of the polish.      I may add, that for attaining a true para
bolic figure in the grinding,    Mr Lassell    employs a beautiful mechan
ism of his own invention, which is put in motion by            a small    one-
horse-power steam-engine.          The powers which he         uses with this
fine instrument, are, —
    For planets, from 300 to 800.
    For fixed stars, from 600 to 1200.
    For double and triple stars, from 1200       to 1800.

1. On the       Centrifugal Theory of Elasticity, and its con
    nection with the Theory of Heat.               By W. J. M. Rankine,
    Esq., C.E.
   This paper contains       investigations    founded on the supposition,
that that part of the elasticity of bodies which depends upon heat,
arises from the centrifugal       force of the revolutions     of the particles
of elastic atmospheres surrounding         nuclei or atomic centres.       The
author    has laid   before   this   Society and the British       Association
several papers founded on this supposition,         which    he has elsewhere
termed the hypothesis of molecular vortices.
   The author's previous investigations          were confined to atoms in
which the particles of the elastic atmospheres might, without sensible
error, be treated in calculation as being distributed in concentric sphe
rical layers round their nuclei or centres, each layer being of equal
density throughout, and having its particles throughout in a similar

                                               87
state   of motion.       It   might be doubted, therefore, whether the con
clusions arrived       at were      applicable     to any substances      except gases,
or very limpid liquids, in which the mutual actions of the atoms are
similar in all directions.
    To remedy this defect the present paper has                      been prepared,    in
which no definite supposition is made respecting the arrangement                       of
the    atomic    centres, the distribution            of their atmospheres, or the
form    of the orbits which the particles of those atmospheres describe.
If   the hypothesis,       therefore,      is a sound one, the conclusions            are
applicable to all substances.             It   will   be seen that they are     all  con
sistent,   and for the most part identical with those deduced from the
more    limited supposition.           The most important are the following : —
    Let Q denote the mechanical value of the quantity of heat, that
is to  say, the mechanical power corresponding to the vis-viva of the
molecular revolutions, in unity of weight of a substance.                      Let h   be
the specific elasticity       of the atomic atmosphere of the substance ; k,
a  specific constant depending on the nature of the substance ; r, its
absolute temperature          as measured by a perfect-gas thermometer, and
reckoned     from a point 274°-6            centigrade = 494°"28 Fahrenheit, be
low the temperature          of melting      ice ; and x, a constant depending on
the thermometric         scale, and the same            for all substances    in nature.

    The expansive pressure              of any body       is composed     of two parts ;
one depending        jointly     on   density and heat, the other a function of
density    alone.      Let P      be the total       expansive pressure, p the part
 depending jointly        on   density and heat, and            V  the volume of unity

    This formula   was successfully applied in a previous paper, to the
representation    of M. Regnault's experiments        on the expansion    of
gases, the co-efficients being determined empirically.

   Let V0    be the volume   of unity of weight of any substance in the
state  of perfect gas, under unity of pressure, at some fixed absolute

   The foregoing are the principal conclusions arrived at in the first
section of the paper, which treats of the relations between heat and
expansive pressure.
   The   second section treats   of the relations    between  heat and ex
pansive power.
   Let the indefinitely small quantity of heat which must           be com
municated to unity of weight of a substance, to produce the variation
of temperature d r, simultaneously with the variation of volume d V,
be denoted   by
                            3 . Q=3 Q+a Q'
    J Q being the portion which remains in the body        as sensible heat,
being directly employed in increasing        the velocity of the molecular
revolutions, and   d Q', the variation of latent heat, being that which
is transformed into expansive power and molecular action, in alter
ing the form and sizes of the orbits of the revolving particles.       Then
                            +  »V.(V-.) iP    a r

                                          89
    The integral being         so taken   as to be   = 0 for the    state   of per
 fect gas.
    Those two equations comprehend the whole theory of the mecha
nical action of heat, and agree with those given in the author's pre
vious paper on that subject.          In that paper the assistance of Joule's
Law was used in investigating the second equation ; in the present
paper it is deduced directly from the hypothesis.              The following are
some   of its   consequences.
    Let P    d  V  be the expansive       power given out by the body while
the variations     6 r and   S V   take place.    Then
                         8Q +    3Q»-P3V=«Y(V,             r)
is the exact variation         of a function of    r and  V.     This  is the ma
thematical expression of Joule's         Law.
    Let unity of weight of a substance            be brought from the volume
V0, and absolute temperature r0, by the process              (a), to the volume
V,   and absolute temperature         rv and restored to the original volume
and   temperature        by the reverse of the process (6).        Let r„ and rb
be a  pair of temperatures in the two          processes, corresponding      to the
same value      of
the transformation
                   J* of      d V. The result of the pair of processes will
                            a certain quantity of heat into expansive power,
                                                                                 be
whose value is as follows        : —
         f\       dV   (a)-     /

                                     PdV(&) =     r" \r.-n)      p d V.
    This equation comprehends           as a particular    case,  Carnot's Law
of the effect of machines working by expansion.
    The following equation, hitherto known for perfect gases only, is
shewn to be true for all fluids.         Let a denote the velocity of sound

   2. On the Computation              of the Specific Heat of Liquid Water
            at various Temperatures, from the Experiments of
            M. Regnault. By W. J. Macquorn Rankine.
   The experiments         of M. Regnault having been made by intro
ducing water at a     high temperature from a boiler into a calorimeter,
containing    water at a low temperature,                 and power     exercised by
the steam in the boiler in expelling               the water was converted into
heat by fluid    friction, thus producing a rise of temperature in the
calorimeter, for which allowance ought to be made in calculating
the specific heat of     liquid water from         each experiment.       Mr Joule's
determination    of the dynamical value of the specific heat of liquid
water at low temperatures affords the means of calculating the cor
rection required in each case.
   The author of this paper having thus corrected several of the re
sults computed by       M. Regnault, shews that they agree nearly with
this empirical formula        : —
   Where   K   is the specific        heat of liquid water at the temperature
T  of an air thermometer, K0 its specific heat at T0, the temperature
of its maximum density (which is 4-l° centigrade, or 39-4° Fahr.)
and a, a constant coefficient, whose values are               —
      For the centigrade scale,                .       .       0-000001
       For Fahrenheit's scale,                         .       0 000000309
   The paper      is illustrated       by three tables      : the first shewing the
correction of   M. Regnault's results          ;  the second exhibiting a compa
rison between    the experiments and the formula, and the third giving
the results of the formula          for every tenth degree of the centigrade
scale, from 0° to 260°.

            Fluid Mass, in different states, as to Temperature
             and Density.             By Professor William Thomson.
    Let p  be the pressure         of a  fluid   mass when its volume and tem
 perature are v and         t   respectively,     and   let   Miiti + Ni/l     be the

                                                         91
quantity of heat that must                     be supplied to it to augment its volume
by   d    v and its temperature           by d t.          The mechanical value of the work
done upon it to produce this change is the excess of the mechanical
value of the quantity of heat that has to be added above that of the
work done by the fluid in expanding, and is therefore
                                   J (M d      v    +   Nd     t) —p d v.
It   was shewn in the author's                          paper on the Dynamical Theory of
Heat, that this expression is the differential of a function of                                         v and t,
so that, if this function be denoted by     we have, —              <p,
                                         =J    {(JM-p) dv

                         <p   t)                                               +   TXdt}
This function would,           if    the constant of integration                      were properly as
signed, express the absolute quantity                          of   mechanical energy contained
in   the    fluid     mass.        Failing an absolute determination of the                                con
stant, we may regard the function                             <p   as expressing           the mechanical
value of the whole agency required to bring the fluid                                            mass from    a
specified zero state to the state of occupying the volume                                        v   and being
at the temperature            t.    In   the present paper some formulae are given,
by   means of which       it   is   shewn that nearly all the physical properties of
a fluid may be deduced from                   a     table of the values of                 <p   for all values
of v and    and experimental
             t;                                     methods connected with the experi
mental researches proposed in the author's last paper,                                          are suggested
for determining          values of       <p   for   a    gaseous          fluid mass.

               By Professor William Thomson.
     It    was discovered by         Peltier that heat                    is   absorbed at a surface of
contact of bismuth and antimony in                            a    compound metallic conductor,
when electricity traverses               it   from the bismuth to the antimony, and
that heat        is   generated when electricity                      traverses      it    in the contrary
direction.        This fact, taken in connection with Joule's law of the
electrical generation of heat in a homogeneous metallic conductor,
suggests the following assumption, which    the foundation of the          is
theory at present laid before the Royal Society.
     When electricity passes in a current       uniform strength through
                                                                   of                               y

the obtaining of mechanical effect from heat, by means of                                       a   perfectly
reversible arrangement, depends                           in a definite manner on the trans
mission of a certain quantity of heat from one body to another at a
lower temperature.               There         is a degree        of uncertainty in the present
application           of this principle,            on       account of the conduction of heat
that must necessarily go on from the hotter to the colder parts of
the circuit; an agency which is not reversed when the direction of
the current           is changed.          As it cannot            be shewn     that the thermal
effect     of this      agency    is infinitely small, compared with that of the
electric current, unless y be so large that the term B y2, expressing
the thermal effect   of another irreversible agency, cannot be neglected,
the    conditions required for the application of Carnot and Clausius's
principle,        according to the demonstrations                         of it which           have      been
already given, are not completely fulfilled                          :   the author therefore con
siders that at present this part of the theory requires experimental
verification.
      1.   A first    application of the theory is to the case of antimony and
bismuth ; and            it is shewn that the fact discovered                        by Seebeck             is,
according to equation (c),                 a   consequence        of the more recent discovery
of Peltier         referred      to   above,        —    a    partial verification of the only
doubtful part of the theory being thus afforded.

electromotive force produced in the same circuit by keeping the two
junctions         at temperatures          t   and            which differ from one another by
an infinitely small amount,                     the magnitude of this force                    is   given by

and its direction          is   such, that       a   current produced           by   it    would cause
the absorption of heat at the hotter junction,                              and the evolution               of
heat at the colder.               A    complete experimental                  verification            of this
conclusion would fully establish the theory.

effects, according                        as   it   passes        from   hot to cold,      or from cold to hot,

The quantities     denoted      by         and    F in        the preceding       equation

being both positive,     it is concluded that, when a thermo-electric current
passes through       a piece      of iron from       one end kept at about            240°
cent., to the other end kept cold, in a circuit                 of which the remainder
is copper, including a long resistance wire of uniform temperature
throughout      or an electro-magnetic engine raising weights,                     there is
heat evolved at the cold       junction of the copper and iron, and (no heat
being either absorbed or evolved at the hot junction) there must be a
quantity of heat absorbed on the whole in the rest of the circuit.
 When there is no engine raising weights, in the circuit, the sum                         of
the quantities     evolved,     at the cold junction, and generated                  in  the
 " resistance wire," is equal         to the   quantity absorbed on             the whole
 in  the other  parts of     the circuit.     When        there      is an engine    in  the
 circuit,  the sum   of   the heat evolved at            the    cold junction     and    the
 thermal equivalent of the weights raised, is equal to the quantity of
 heat absorbed on the whole in all the circuit except the cold junction.

 which expresses      a  proposition, the truth of which was first pointed
 out and experimentally          verified    by Becquerel.             A  curious experi
  mental verification of this proposition (so far as regards the signs of
 the terms of the preceding equation) was made by the author, with
 reference to certain specimens of platinum wire, and iron and copper
 wires.     He had      observed    that the platinum             wire, with iron wires
  bent round its ends, constituted a less powerful                    thermo-electric   ele
  ment than an iron wire with copper wires bent round its ends,                          for
 temperatures within atmospheric             limits.       He tried, in consequence,
 the platinum wire with copper wires bent round its ends, and con
  nected with the ends of a galvanometer coil ; and he found that,
 with temperatures within atmospheric limits, a current passed from
 the copper to the platinum          through the hot junction,              and concluded
 that, in the thermo-electric         series

this .platinum wire must, at ordinary temperatures, be between                  iron
and copper.       Ho found that the platinum wire retained the                 same
properties after having been          heated   to redness in a spirit-lamp and
cooled again    ; but with temperatures above some limit itself consider
ably below that of boiling water, he found that the iron and platinum
constituted a more powerful thermo-electric              element than the iron
and copper    ; and he verified that for such temperatures, in the pla
tinum    and copper      element the current was from the platinum to
the copper through the hot junction, and therefore that the copper
now lay between the iron and the platinum                of the  series,   or in the
position in which other observers have generally found copper to lie
with reference     to platinum.       A  second somewhat       thinner platinum
wire  was found to lie invariably        on the negative side of copper,          for
all temperatures       above the freezing point     ;  but a third, still thinner,
possessed   the same      property as the first, although in a less marked
degree, as the superior limit of the range of temperatures for which
it was positive towards copper was lower than in the case                of the first
wire.     By making an element of the first and third platinum wire,
it was found that the former was positive towards the latter,                 as was
to  be expected.
    In  conclusion, various objects of experimental           research    regarding
thermo-electric      forces and currents are pointed out, and methods of
experimenting      are suggested.       It  is pointed   out that, failing direct
data, the absolute value of the electromotive force in an element of
copper and bismuth, with its two junctions kept at the temperatures
 0° and 100° cent., may be estimated indirectly from Pouillet's com
parison of the strength         of the current it      sends   through     a copper
wire 20    metres    long and   1  millimetre    in diameter, with the strength
of   a current    decomposing water at an observed rate            ;  by means     of
determinations      by Weber, and of others, of the specific resistance            of
copper and the electro-chemical equivalent of water, in absolute units.
The specific    resistances    of different specimens of copper having          been
found to differ considerably from one another, it is impossible, with
out experiments        on the individual wire used by      M. Pouillet,    to deter
mine with much accuracy the absolute resistance of his circuit,                  but
the author has estimated it on the hypothesis that the specific resist
ance of its substance is 2 J- British units.          Taking -02    as the electro
chemical equivalent of water in British absolute units, the author has
thus found 16300         as the electromotive force       of an element of cop
per and bismuth, with the two junctions at 0"and 100" respectively.

 About 154 of such elements would be required to produce the                                       same
 electromotive force as a single cell of Daniell's                       ;   if,   in Daniell's     bat

engine,     if    the resistance in the whole circuit                    be equivalent to that
of   a    copper wire of about          100      feet long and about one-eighth                         of
 an inch     in diameter, and         if   the engine be allowed to move at such
a    rate as       by    inductive    reaction       to    diminish the strength of                 the
current      to     the half of what            it   is    when      the engine         is   at    rest,

     The author commenced his paper by observing that it formed a
sequel to one communicated to the Society last                  Session on comenic
acid ;   his object in the present instance having been partly to ascer
tain whether some of the substances described in his former                      paper
could not be derived from meconic acid, which is the parent acid of
comenic acid.       This   he shewed to be the case ; but before detailing
these experiments,       he gave     his process      for purifying meconic acid,
which is that of Gregory, modified              by  the use of ammonia instead
of potass.      Some grounds for preference of this plan were offered,
and the composition of the salt obtained               in the process    was    shewn
to be
                            2   NH40, HO, Cu HOn.
It   is a salt crystallising     from hot water in groupes of needles              ; is
not decomposed        at   the heat of boiling          water by itself, but when
kept long at this temperature,             in presence     of ammonia, it    produces

                                  HO,   C12   H4 N07,
 formerly described by the author as a product of the decomposition
 of comenate     of ammonia in the same manner.
     The action of chlorine on this salt gave rise, in the first place, to
 another    acid salt of ammonia and meconic acid,
                              2  HO, NH40,         C14  HOu,
 and, as a    further product, chlorocomenic acid            was isolated.   Bromine
 gave   with meconic acid bromocomenic acid              ; three experiments shew
 ing that meconic acid        itself yields    no substitution    products, its mole
 cule   splitting into carbonic acid,        and the above-mentioned derivatives
 of comenic acid.
     The action of hydrochloric acid            gas   on solution    of meconic acid
 in alcohol was next gone into           ;   and it appears that three products
 are formed,     their relative proportions depending on the amount of
 gas   employed, and the strength of the alcohol. They are all ethers.
 The first is the ethylomeconic acid, represented by the formula
                           2    HO,   C4    H50   C14  HOu.
  It  is a crystalline    substance, soluble in water, alcohol, and ether               ;
  fusible at 316°    Fahr.     to a yellow fluid.       It  is possessed of  acid pro
  perties,   and is indeed bibasic, forming two series of salts            ;  this whs

                                          100
 shewn by the description and analyses of two acid salts, the baryta
  and silver salts, whose composition is thus expressed,
                          BaO, HO,      C4  H80 C14 HOn
                          AgO, HO,      C4  H50 Cu HOu,
 and a neutral baryta salt, of the constitution,
                           2 BaO, C4     HsO,     C14  HOn.
 It  was shewn that ethylomeconic            acid undergoes a curious         decom
 position in contact with ammonia.           It  appears very complex     ; and   Mr
 How gave,       as representing the composition         of the products      he ob
 tained, an ammonia salt of an amide acid, and the acid itself, the
 following    formulae,
              Ammonia salt      9  NH40,     Cg4   H,4 N?063     + 3 aq.
      Acid of         ...        9   HO,     C84   H*4 N70,,3 + 3 aq.
 The   acid appears to be formed by the grouping            together of six atoms
 of normal amidomeconic acid and one of ammonia.
     The   second product of the action       of hydrochloric acid gas upon me-
conic acid in alcohol was shewn to be an uncrystalline body, to which the
formula,     C32 012    028, was assigned     ; and it was considered as formed
from the coupling together of equivalents              of meconic    and ethylome
conic acids,
      c» Hi2 0M = 3 HO,            Cl4 HOn      + 2  HO,   C4   HsO   C14 HOn
Want of      substance    prevented a complete study          of this body  ;  but it
seems, from a few reactions tried, to be            certainly more than a mere
mixture of the two acids.
    The third ether described         was obtained from        the mother liquors
of the preceding two.         The formula of this substance, biethylome-
conic acid, is
                           HO,    2 C4  HflO    C14  HOu,
it being meconic acid in which two atoms of basic water are replaced
by two equivalents of ether.           It is a crystalline substance, fusible in
boiling     water, in which it also dissolves         on agitation.     In  the dry
state   it fuses at about 230°       Fahr.
    It   is an acid, monobasic ; an analysis was given             of its ammonia
and its baryta salt, their respective formulae           are
                         NH40,     2 C4  H50, C14 HOu
                         BaO, 2    C4  H50, C14 HOn.
    Biothylomeconic       acid is not decomposed       by ammonia in the cold       ;
but  Mr How       believes it undergoes a change when heated with this

                                       101
alkali   ; want of material, however, prevented him arriving at         a satis
factory conclusion on this point.
           3. On the Place of the Poles of the Atmosphere.
                       By Professor C. Piazzi Smyth.
      This was merely      a note on    some  of the recent discoveries and
generalizations,      by Lieut. Maury,     U.S.N.,  on the motions of the at
mosphere.         It had been clearly proved by the extensive researches
of Lieut.      M., that the trade-winds when rising at the equator,             do
 not, as previously      held, return   to their own poles, but cross over to
 the opposite ones ; and thus        traverse the extent of the whole earth
 from pole to pole, in a      curvilinear direction, on account of the effect
 of the rotation of the earth.         The whole atmosphere thus partakes
 of   a general    movement, the upper half moving towards the poles,
 and the lower towards         the equator, or vice versa, according to the
  latitude of the place    ; the former occurring     between  the parallels of
 0° and 30°, and the latter         between 30° and 90°.        At   0° and 30°
  two nodes, so to speak,    of the upper and lower currents take place      ;   at
  the former ascending, and indicated by a low barometer ; at the latter
  descending, and marked by increased barometric pressure.               At    the
  point of 90°, the polo, or thereabouts, the revolution of the currents
  and their change of direction for       N. and S., and vice versa, with an
  other node, takes place, and marked,          Lieut. Maury thought, by          a
   calm region, as the two nodal zones of 0° and 30° most undoubtedly
  are.
       As  to the place  of this calm polar point, which we shall probably
   long want observations to determine, Lieut. Maury did not place it
   over the poles of rotation of the world, but over the magnetical poles,
   without, however, as the present author thought,          sufficient  reason.
   Indeed, he much lamented that after the admirable              developments
   made     by   Lieut.   Maury     of the motions of the atmosphere, he
   should have thus brought in merely the name of magnetism to clear
   up one obscure point.        Meteorology pursued on the system of strict
   mechanical and scientific inquiry was now disclosing a most interest
   ing and understandable series of phenomena, and promised a legitimate
    harvest of more.     But the history of this  science in times past, points
    to so many occasions when rational trains     of observation  were impeded
    by the gratuitous   introduction   of a magnetic or electric element, and
    thought to be needless thereafter, that the author        supposed    that it
    might be of some service to shew that there was no probability               in

                                               102
the present case, either from actual observation or natural consider
ations, that such a force should be looked to for explanation.
     1st,    Of actual observation.         The poles of any force should bear a
certain known relation to              the equator thereof ; and if we find the
magnetic equator coincident with that of the atmosphere, which may
be considered         as marked        out by the line of equatorial             calms, we
might       reasonably suppose          a connection         between    their poles.       But
we do not.        The         mean positions   of    these equators are     very different
from each other, and are subject to such totally different movements
through       the year, that we cannot legitimately                    expect any nearer
coincidence in their polar points.
     2d,    Of natural considerations.              Mechanical     force may always be
taken as the cause, and not as the consequence,                        of the magnetic or
electric currents by which it is accompanied.                      Certainly in the case
of an electrical machine, the electric spark may be made to produce
mechanical energy, as shewn in knocking small light pith balls about                             ;
but how incomparably less is this force to that employed to turn the
machine round in the first instance to produce the electricity.
     Now, the atmosphere enveloping and rubbing over the world, may
be   taken as a large electrical machine, and does produce electric and
magnetic        forces    ;    but these,   although       startling   enough when wit
nessed       by us,   little pigmies of men,         are of infinitely small moment
compared to the force required                 to    keep the whole atmosphere in
motion, and to overcome its friction and inertia.
     Again, with regard                          of terrestrial magnetism, it is
                                   to the intensity
found with one           of Gauss's large bars for determining the horizontal
force,     by being suspended by two wires separated in the direction                       of
its axis, that the whole magnetic force amounts to less than 100,000th
part of the weight               of the bar, that      is,   the force or attraction        of
gravity.
     Similar experiments might              be adduced,       to shew that when       a   body
is   heated, though electrical currents may be produced, and may have
a    certain mechanical power, that yet the quantity of this                     is   almost
infinitely     small compared to what might                  be produced    by   employing
the heat directly.
     Hence, there can be no reasonable doubt, that the principal move
ments of the atmosphere must be owing to mechanical and thermotic
causes, and only the smaller features to electric and magnetic currents.
     A   parallel case of the proneness of men to run for an explanation

                                        103
to magnetism,      occurred    in the early   history of the development           of
the    law of storms, and has not yet, so far as          I   am aware, been dis
tinctly   refuted   by   the public, or  withdrawn     by   its  promulgator.
      In Colonel Reid's first work (1838) on the revolving motion of
 the hurricanes,    after having,    in the earlier portion, detailed, in the
 most satisfactory manner, the laws          of the phenomena,         he gives,   in
 the latter portion, a glimpse of a theory of them, or at least, details
 an experiment      in which, on the surface of a magnetised iron shell
 representing     the earth, a rotation      in opposite directions was pro
 duced in helices in either hemisphere of the ball.               This was thought
 very interesting, as the hurricanes are found to revolve in opposite
 directions   in either half of the world        ;   and   it   was  further stated
 that in St Helena, where the magnetic intensity is small, hurricanes
 are unknown ; while in the West Indies, where hurricanes are so
  rife, the magnetic intensity is at a maximum.
       Here, it will be observed, is no attempt             to shew whether       the
  magnetic power is sufficient to cause the observed effect, or has any
  power in that way at all, nor even to trace whether this particular
  coincidence at two points, in the tropical belt of the earth, prevailed
  at all others  also  ;  and in the Colonel's      last publication (1848) the
  question and the experiment        are withdrawn altogether.
       When, however,     we examine the subject more extensively,          we find a
  pretty general rule to prevail all round the world, viz., that hurricanes
  are most frequent in the western parts of those seas where the trade-
  wind is suddenly stopped by the occurrence of land, and is unknown
  in the eastern parts of the seas where it begins. Thus, not only is
  the placid climate of St Helena fully accounted for by being in the
  eastern position of the South Atlantic, but equally the similar freedom
  from revolving storms of the Cape De Verde Islands, the NW. and
  SW. coast of Africa, with California and Peru on the eastern shores
  of the Pacific.
       And again, while the West Indies are pointed out              as likely places
  for hurricanes,     so   are   Rio Janeiro,      Canton,      the Mauritius,    and
  Madras, and, in fact, almost every place where hurricanes                      have
  been met with.
       The stoppage, then,     and interference     of the trade-wind,       a purely
   mechanical question, is the cause of the hurricanes, and, according
   to the greater or less force of the trade-wind,         and the greater quan
   tity of air struggling to get over the barrier, as observed in the case
   of water when a river is in a flood, or on a sea-coast at spring-tide,

                                            104
 so are more numerous            and more violent eddies found, and they re
 volve in different directions in either hemisphere, because the direc
 tion of the parent trade-wind           is also different     in each.*
     These mechanical causes, we may be certain, are acting, and must
 have the chief share          in  the  effects which        we observe, and       should
 therefore be followed out in all their consequences,                before we attempt
 to introduce       any problematical        forces which cannot possibly have
 much,     if they   have indeed any effect.

   *  I  have just met with an, at first sight, anomalous instance, in the account
of  a circular   storm experienced    by the American       exploring   expedition under
Captain Wilkes in       the neighbourhood    of  the Cape De     Verd Islands, a similar
latitude to the West Indies, but on the            " wrong" side of the Atlantic, and
moreover revolving with the hands of a watch, " wrong" also.               But the parent
wind in this case is described to have been SE., which explains everything ;
and shews that the whole phenomenon is an affair of mechanical conditions in the
currents of air at the place ; that these being reversed, the hurricane phenomena
are reversed also, and that there is no magnetic or other virtue residing in either
hemisphere, and compelling air to circulate in any particular direction by reason
of its place.

    1.   Defence    of the Doctrine of Vital Affinity, against the
            objections stated to it by Humboldt and Dr Daubeny.
            By Dr Alison.
    The object of this paper was to fix attention                        on the great physio
logical discovery which has been gradually effected                              during the pre
sent century,       of the     mode      in which certain of the elements contained
in the earth's atmosphere, under the influence of light and of a cer
tain temperature, are continually                 employed in maintaining that great
vital circulation,        of which           vegetable structures, animal structures,
the air, and the soil, are the successive                   links   ;   and to point out that
the most essential and fundamental                     of the changes here               effected,   —.
particularly the formation of the different organic compounds in the
cells of vegetables,          — are    strictly chemical changes,               at least as clearly
distinct from any chemical actions yet known to take place in inor
ganic matters, as the vital contractions                   of muscles    are distinct from any
merely mechanical causes                of motion      ;   and   justifying the statement of
Dr Daubeny, that there appears                              "    a power,
                                                 to be                          residing in living
matters" and producing                 chemical effects,         — in   fact manifesting itself
most unequivocally by the chemical changes                          which result from            it, —
"   distinct,    at least in its effects, from ordinary chemical and physical
forces.''
         vol. in.                                                                   i

                                       106
     But after having made this statement, Dr Daubeny, according to the
author of this paper, has thrown a degree of mystery over the subject
which     is  quite unnecessary and even        unphilosophical,      by refusing
to admit — and quoting       Humboldt, who has changed his opinion               on
the subject, and now likewise declines to admit —that these changes
are to be regarded as vital ; both authors (as well as several other
recent English authors) maintaining, that as we do not know all the
conditions under which ordinary chemical affinities act in living
 bodies,   we are not entitled to assert that these      affinities may not yet
 be   found adequate to the production          of all the chemical changes
which living bodies present      ; and that until this negative proposition
is proved, it is unphilosophical and delusive to suppose the existence of
any such power, as that to which the term            Vital Affinity has      been
applied, by the author of this paper and several other physiologists.
    In  answer to this, it is here stated, that as we cannot, strictly speak
 ing, define   Life or Vitality, we follow the strict rules     of philosophy, in
describing what we call living bodies, whether vegetable or animal, and
then applying the term        Vital or living,  as the general expression for
everything which is observed to take place only in them, and which
is inexplicable     by the physical laws, deduced       from the observation
of the other phenomena of nature ; that according to this, — the only
definition of which the term vital admits, or by which the objects of
Physiology      can be defined, — Dr Daubeny has already admitted, in
the expressions above quoted from him, that chemical as well as me
chanical changes in living bodies, fall under the denomination vital;
and as     the rule    of sound logic is " afirmantibus incumbit pro-
batio," — and      as it is just as probable a priori, that, with a view
to the great objects of the introduction       of living beings upon        earth,
the laws of chemistry, as those of mechanics, should be modified or
suspended     by Almighty Power, — this author maintains that              we are
as   fully justified in referring all great essential chemical       phenomena,
which are peculiar to living bodies, to peculiar affinities, which             we
term vital, as     Haller  was to ascribe the     peculiar   mechanical     move
ments of living bodies, to the vital property of          Irritability   ; and to
throw on the mechanical physiologists of his day the burden of prov
ing, if they could, that the laws of motion, perceived in dead matter,
were adequate to explain them.
    In illustration of the importance, both in Physiology and Patho
logy, of this principle being held to be established, Dr Alison ad

                                         107
 duced two examples, first, the utter failure of the very ingenious
 theory    of  Dr Murray      to explain,    on ordinary   chemical principles,
 the simplest and most essential phenomena of healthy Secretion ; and,
 secondly, the now generally admitted inadequacy of any theory of
 Inflammation, which         does not regard a modification      of the affinities
 peculiar to life, and here termed vital, as the primary and essen
 tial change, in the matter       concerned   in that process.

    The following Communications                were read    : —
1.   On the Function of the Spleen and other Lymphatic Glands,
        as originators of the Corpuscular Constituents of the
        Blood. By Dr Bennett.
    The author     had been enabled to study the blood corpuscles under
circumstances capable of extending our information               with regard to
their relations, mode of formation, and ultimate destination.                  In
1845, he had discovered a peculiar condition in human blood, in
which the colourless cells were greatly increased in number.                 This
condition     he had called leucocythemia, which was always associated
with enlargement of       the spleen    or other lymphatic glands,     a circum
stance which had induced him to form the opinion that the corpuscles
of the   blood originated in these organs.        This  view he sought to esta
blish   by discussing    at considerable length the following          questions,
viz.  : — 1st,  What relation     do the colourless and coloured corpuscles
bear to each other     ?    2d, Where     do they originate    ?    3d, What is
their ultimate destination      ?
    From the whole inquiry, which included numerous observations               on
                                                                  I  2

                                      108
the blood of vertebral animals, careful        investigations  into the struc
ture of the ductless glands, and several experiments, he deduced            the
following conclusions     : —
     1. That the blood corpuscles of vertebrate animals are originally
formed in the lymphatic        glandular    system, and that the great ma
jority of them    on joining the circulation,     become   coloured in a man
 ner that is as yet unexplained.       Hence, the blood may be considered
as a secretion from      the lymphatic     glands, although     in the higher
animals that secretion only becomes fully formed after it has received
colour by exposure to oxygen in the lungs.
     2. That in the mammalia, the lymphatic glandular system is com
posed   of the spleen, thymus, thyroid, supra-renal, pituitary, pineal,
 and lymphatic glands.
     3. That in fishes, reptiles, and birds, the coloured blood corpuscles
are nucleated cells originating in these glands, but that in mammals,
 they are free nuclei, sometimes derived as such from the glands, at
others, developed     within colourless cells.
     4. That in certain hypertrophies       of tho lymphatic      glands, their
cell elements are proportionally      increased in number, and under such
circumstances the colourless cells of the blood are also proportionally
 increased.    This is Leucocythemia.
     5. That the solution of the corpuscles of the blood, conjoined with
the effete matter derived        from   the tissues, which is not converted
 into albumen, constitute blood fibrin.
    2. On the     Mechanical action of Radiant Heat or Light :
             On the Power of Animated Creatures over Matter :
             On the Sources available to Man for the production
             of Mechanical Effect.               By Professor William
             Thomson.
          On the Mechanical Action       of Radiant Heat or Light.
    It  is assumed in this communication         that the undulatory theory
of radiant heat and light, according to which light is merely radiant
heat, of which the vibrations are performed in periods between cer
tain limits of duration, is true.      " The    chemical rays," beyond the
violet end of the spectrum, consist of undulations of which the            full
vibrations are executed      in periods shorter than those of the extreme
 visible violet light, or than about the eight hundred million millionth

                                           109
  of a second.      The periods of    the vibrations of visible    light lie  between
  this  limit and another, about double          as great, corresponding to the ex
  treme    visible red light.       The vibrations of the      obscure  radiant heat
  beyond the red end are executed in longer periods than this ; the
  longest which has yet been           experimentally      tested being about the
 eighty     million millionth of     a second.
     The elevation of temperature produced in a body by the incidence of
  radiant heat upon it is a mechanical effect of the dynamical kind, since
 the communication         of heat to    a body is merely the excitation        or the
 augmentation of certain motions among its particles.                   According     to
 Pouillet's estimate of heat radiated from the sun in any time, and
 Joule's mechanical equivalent of a thermal unit, it appears that the
 mechanical value of the solar heat incident perpendicularly              on a square
 foot above the earth's         atmosphere is about        eighty-four foot-pounds
 per second.
     Mechanical      effect of the statical kind might be produced from the
 solar    radiant heat, by using it as the source             of heat in a thermo
 dynamic engine.          It   is estimated     that about 556 foot-pounds per
 second    of ordinary mechanical effect, or about the work of " one horse
 power,'' might possibly be produced by such an engine exposing 1800
 square feet to receive       solar heat, during a warm summer day in this
country      ;  but the dimensions       of the moveable parts of the engine
 would necessarily be so great as to occasion practical difficulties in the
 way of    using it with economical advantage that might            be insurmount
able.
    The chemical       effects   of light belong to the class of mechanical
effects    of the statical kind ; and reasoning analogous to that intro
duced and experimentally           verified in the case of electrolysis by Joule,
leads to the conclusion that when such effects are produced there                 will
be   a loss      of heating     effect in the radiant      heat or light which is
absorbed by the body acted on, to an extent thermally                  equivalent to
the mechanical        value of the work done against forces of chemical
affinity.
    The deoxidation of carbon and hydrogen from carbon ic acid and
water, effected by the action        of solar light  on the green parts    of plants,
is (as the author recently found was              pointed out by Helmholz*          in
1847),     a   mechanical effect of radiant heat.         In  virtue of this action
   * " Ueber die Erhaltung der Kraft, von Dr H. Helmholz."            Berlin, 1847.

                                          no
combustible substances       are produced      by plants ; and    its mechanical
value is to be estimated by determining           the heat evolved by burning
them, and multiplying by the mechanical equivalent of the thermal
unit.      Taking, from Liebig's Agricultural Chemistry, the estimate
2600 pounds of dry fir wood for the annual produce of one Hessian
acre, or 26,910 square feet, of forest land, (which in mechanical
value appears not to differ much from estimates given in the same
treatise for produce of various kinds obtained from cultivated              land,)
and asuming, as a very rough estimate, 4000 thermal units centigrade
as the heat of combustion           of unity of     mass  of dry fir wood ; the
author finds 550,000 foot-pounds             (or the   work of a horse-power,
for 1000 seconds),      as the mechanical value of the mean annual pro
duce    of a square foot   of the land.     Taking 50° 34' (that of Giessen,)
as the latitude    of the locality, the author estimates the mechanical
value of the solar heat which, were none of it absorbed by the atmo
sphere,     would   fall annually     on   each  square foot of the land, at
530,000,000 foot-pounds         ;   and infers    that   probably    a good   deal
more,    j 5Va  of the solar heat, which actually falls on growing plants, is
converted into mechanical effect.
    When the vibrations of light thus act during the growth of plants,
to  separate, against forces of chemical affinity, combustible materials
from oxygen, they must lose vis viva to an extent equivalent to the
statical mechanical effect thus produced          ;  and therefore quantities of
solar heat are actually put out of existence by the growth of plants,
but an equivalent of statical mechanical effect is stored up in the or
ganic products, and may be reproduced as heat, by burning them.
All the heat of fires, obtained by burning wood grown from year to
year, is in fact solar heat reproduced.
    The actual convertibility       of radiant heat into statical mechanical
effect,   by  inanimate    material    agency, is considered in this paper
as subject to Carnot's      principle   ;  and a possible connection of this
principle with the circumstances regarding the quality of the radiant
heat (or the colour of the        light), required    to produce the growth     of
plants, is suggested.
            On the Power    of Animated Creatures over Matter.
    The question, " Can animated creatures            set matter     in motion  in
virtue of an inherent power of producing mechanical effect ?" must
be answered in the negative, according to the well-established theory

                                            Ill
of animal       heat    and motion, which ascribes             them to the chemical
action   (principally oxidation,         or a combustion at low temperatures),
experienced        by the food.       A   principal     object of the present com
munication is to point out the relation of this theory to the dynami
cal theory      of   heat.     It is  remarked,      in the first place,        that    both
animal     heat      and weights raised or resistance                 overcome, are me
chanical effects of the chemical forces which act during the combina
tion of food      with oxygen.        The former         is a dynamical        mechanical
effect, being       thermal      motions excited      ;  the latter      is a mechanical
effect of the statical kind.            The whole mechanical value of                  these
effects,  which are produced by means of the animal                            mechanism
in any time, must           be equal to the mechanical               value of the work
done by the chemical forces.              Hence, when an animal              is going up-      .
hill or working against resisting force, there is less                     heat generated
than the amount due to the oxidation                  of   the   food,    by the thermal
equivalent of the mechanical               effect produced.            From   an   estimate
made   by    Mr     Joule, it appears that from              J to   J of the mechanical
equivalent       of the complete oxidation of all the                food consumed      by a
horse may be produced,             from day to day, as weights raised.                  The
oxidation       of  the    whole   food   consumed being, in reality, far from
complete,       it follows that a       less    proportion      than        perhaps     even
less  than       §, of   the    heat due     to   the whole chemical           action    that
actually   goes      on   in the   body    of the animal,         is given   out as heat.
 An estimate, according to the same principle,                       upon very imperfect
data, however, is made by the author, regarding                     the relation between
 the thermal and the nonthermal mechanical effects produced by a man
at  work   ;    by which      it appears that probably             as much as     J of    the
 whole work of the chemical forces arising from the oxidation                        of his
 food during the 24 hours, may              be directed to raising his own weight,
 by a  man walking up-hill for 8 hours a-day                    ;   and   perhaps even as
 much as     J   of the work of the chemical forces, may be directed to the
 overcoming        of external     resistances by a man exerting himself                   for
 6  hours a-day in such operations as pumping.                       In  the  former     case
 there would        be not more than $ , and in the latter not more than                     f
 of the thermal        equivalent    of the chemical action emitted as animal
 heat, on the whole,         during the 24 hours, and the quantities of heat
 emitted     during     the times of working         would bear much smaller pro
 portions    respectively than these,          to the     thermal      equivalents of the
 chemical      forces actually operating during those times.

                                               112
       A  curious inference is pointed out, that an animal would be sen
   sibly less warm in going up-hill than in going down-hill, were the
   breathing not greater in the former case than in the latter.
       The application of Carnot's principle, and of Joule's discoveries re
  garding the heat of electrolysis and the calorific effects of magneto-
   electricity, is pointed out      ;  according to which it appears nearly certain
   that, when an animal works against resisting force, there is not a con
   version   of heat into external mechanical           effect, but the  full thermal
   equivalent of the chemical forces is never produced ; in other words
   that the animal body does not act as a thcrmo-dynamic                 engine;   and
   very probable that the chemical forces produce the external mechani
   cal effects through electrical means.
       Certainty regarding the means in the animal                body by which ex-
*
  tcrnal mechanical effects are produced              from chemical     forces  acting
  internally, cannot be arrived              at without   more experiment and ob
  servation than has yet been applied; but the relation of mechanical
  equivalence, between         the work done by the chemical forces, and the
   final  mechanical      effects     produced,    whether solely heat, or partly
  heat and      partly resistance overcome,           may be asserted     with   confi
  dence.      Whatever      be    tho     nature   of  these   means,   consciousness
  teaches every individual         that they are, to some extent, subject to the
  direction of his will.        It    appears, therefore, that animated creatures
  have the power of immediately applying,               to certain moving particles
  of matter within their bodies, forces by which the motions of these
  particles are directed to produce desired mechanical effects.
          On the Sources available to           Man for    the  Production of
                                    Mechanical Effect.
      Men    can obtain     mechanical effect for their own purposes either
  by working mechanically themselves, and directing                 other animals to
   work for them, or by using natural heat, the gravitation of descend
  ing solid masses, the natural motions of water and air, and the heat,
  or galvanic currents, or other mechanical effects produced by chemical
  combination, but in no other way at present known.                Hence the stores
  from which mechanical effect may be drawn by man belong to one or
  other of the following classes           : —
       I. The   food  of animals.
     II.  Natural    heat.

                                             113
III.      Solid matter found in elevated positions.
IV.       The natural motions of water and air.
  V. Natural      combustibles (as wood, coal, coal-gas, oils, marsh gas,
            diamond, native sulphur, native metals, meteoric iron.)
VI. ArtiScial       combustibles (as smelted or electrolytically-deposited
            metals, hydrogen, phosphorus.;
   In     the present communication,             known facts in natural history and
physical     science,   with    reference to the sources from which these
stores have derived        their mechanical energies, are             adduced to establish
the    following general conclusions : —
      1. Heat radiated from the sun (sunlight                    being included in this
term) is the principal source of mechanical effect available to man.*
From it is derived the whole mechanical effect obtained by means
of animals working,         water-wheels worked by rivers,                 steam-engines,
and  galvanic engines, and part at least of the mechanical effect ob
tained by means of windmills and the sails of ships not driven by
the trade-winds.
      2. The motions of the earth,               moon, and sun, and their            mutual
attractions,     constitute an important            source      of available mechanical
effect. From them all, but chiefly, no doubt, from the earth's
motion of rotation, is derived the mechanical effect of water-wheels
driven by the tides.           The mechanical          effect    so largely used     in the
sailing of ships by the trade-winds is derived partly, perhaps prin
cipally, from the earth's motion of rotation, and partly from solar heat.
   3. The other known sources of mechanical effect available to man
are either terrestrial      — that    is,   belonging to the earth, and available
without the influence of any external body, — or meteoric, — that is,
belonging      to bodies     deposited      on    the earth from          external   space.
Terrestrial     sources,    including mountain quarries and mines, the heat
of hot springs, and the combustion of native sulphur,                        perhaps also
the combustion      of all inorganic native combustibles,               are actually used,
but the mechanical effect obtained from them                     is   very inconsiderable,
compared with that which             is   obtained from sources belonging to the
two classes     mentioned above.            Meteoric     sources, including only the
heat    of newly-fallen meteoric bodies,            and the combustion of meteoric
iron, need not be reckoned among those available to man for practical
purposes.

    The following Communications                  were read      : —
   1. On some improvements                in the instruments          of Nautical
            Astronomy.           By   Professor     C. Piazzi      Smyth.
    The   excessive   motion of a ship at sea renders the use of the ordi
nary    instruments      employed on land impossible,              and restricts the
sailors to the use of one on the principle of the duplication of images
discovered by Hadly.
    The favourite form is at present, and has always been, that of a
quadrant or sextant, i.e., a part of a circle, rather than a whole one,
 though this has often been           brought    forward by scientific men, and
 proved to be the most accurate          :  but the construction of these circles
 was generally too complicated, and practically           unsuited to the circum
 stances usually met with at sea.
     Taking the best of the sextants, then, as the form generally found
 in actual use, the author shewed that it laboured under many disad

                                        115
Tantagea, some peculiarly its own, others shared in common with the
circular variety      of doubly-reflecting instruments ; and that, in a
word, they were all, though convenient enough for day observations
of the sun and moon, extremely            inconvenient    for, if  not altogether
incapable of, observations of the stars at night.
    The author then pointed out, in          some instruments exhibited, their
various imperfections,       explaining the     cause,  and giving the mode of
removing them      ;  and   finally produced a     new description    of circle, in
which he had had all the above-mentioned imperfections corrected.
    The execution of the        idea had    been   entrusted to   Mr John Adie,
and had been performed so efficiently, that the author considered that
his best thanks were due to         Mr Adie,    who had thus most materially
assisted the carrying out of the original ideas.
   2.  Notice of an Antique Marble Bust (with Photographs).
                        By Andrew Coventry, Esq.
     Mr Coventry     read a short notice of an antique marble bust which
he had had the good fortune to purchase from a gentleman                 in West
 moreland, last autumn,        and had reason to believe had been brought
 from   Italy.
     The bust, of which       some   very fine photographs        were exhibited
(executed by Mr        Tunny of Newington, and Captain Scott,               R.N.),
 Mr Coventry considered to be a portrait,            and a work of high Greek
art.     On various grounds, but chiefly from its great resemblance to
the busts of the young Augustus         : — from   the hair being treated in the
 method in use in his day and soon after abandoned              ;  and from the
accordance of the features with the known history and character of
 Octavia, the sister of Augustus,           Mr  Coventry was disposed at first
to think it the bust of that celebrated personage.               But  he deferred
to an opinion     which     he had received       by that day's post from       Mr
 Burgon of the British         Museum,      that it was the bust of Antonia
 Augusta, Octavia's       second daughter by       Marc Antony, in honour of
whom coins      had been      struck   by her son Claudius.         Mr   Burgon's
opinion rested on the authority         of those coins, which were       inscribed
with her name and          bore   the strongest resemblance to the photo
graphs    Mr   Coventry had forwarded to him from his bust.

    3.   Note on a Method of procuring very rapid Photographs
                (with Specimens).            By John Stuart, Esq.
      The following method of taking collodion portraits and                   views,   is
  so  easy in manipulation, and so rapid in its results, that it              is worthy
  of the notice of every lover of photography.                   By  means   of   an ap
  paratus adjusted       to the lens of the camera, so as to open and close it
  instantaneously,       views    can be taken with sufficient rapidity to deli
  neate vehicles in motion,          assemblies of people,        and even the waves
  of the   sea.
      It also produces      a picture combining both the positive and nega
 tive on the same plate           ;   the positive being shewn by a reflected,
 and the negative by a transmitted              light.     Copies on paper can         be
 thrown     off from these        plates to any extent       ;  but this is a difficult
 operation, as any daylight,           unless very carefully subdued, proves          too
 strong.      The   process is as follows     : —A     plate of glass perfectly clean
 on the surface, and free from moisture, is coated with collodion, made
 as under.       It  is then plunged into a bath          of nitrate of silver in     so
 lution (distilled water), 45 grs. to the oz. for sunlight, (100 grs. to
 the oz. for portraits to be taken instantaneously in a room), and al
 lowed to remain        till an oily appearance on the plate disappears.            The
plate is then fit for the camera, and will remain sensitive for twelve
hours, or probably           longer.     After the view        is taken, develop      the
picture with      a  solution of the sulphate of iron            (20 grs.  to the oz.)
slightly heated, and fix it (after washing) with a saturated solution
of hyposulphate of soda.               The plate when dry, must be kept some
days, and then varnished with a very thin solution of Canada varnish
in spirits of turpentine.           Previous to varnishing,        the picture should
be brushed       over with a camel-hair         brush, which adds much to its
beauty and clearness.            In   a very dull light (but out of doors),          the
above proportion,         45 grs. nitrate silver, will take portraits and views,
under ten seconds         most distinctly, and unless the opening and shut
ting of the      camera      be very quick, better pictures          can be produced
thus than those taken instantaneously in strong sunlight.                     The   col
lodion found best to suit this process is made as under. —By weight
sixty parts of pounded          nitre, forty of rectified sulphuric acid, and two
of   sea island cotton.        The cotton must remain three minutes in              the
mixture, and then be dried and dissolved in ether along with                   as much

                                      117
of the precipitate of nitrate of silver by iodide of potassium as it will
absorb.     The collodian should     be very   thin and as transparent        as
water.

     The following Communications             were read    : —
    1.   On some Salts and products of Decomposition of Pyro-
          meconic Acid.        By Mr James F. Brown. Communi
          cated by Dr Anderson.
     The pyromeconic acid employed in the following experiments was
 obtained by distilling impure meconic acid at a temperature of about
 500° or 600° Fahr., when there is obtained a highly crystalline sub
 limate of a dark colour    and empyreumatic        odour.     Its purification
 was effected    by pressing the crystals     so procured     between folds of
 filtering paper, and finally subliming       them at a moderate heat in
 cylindrical glass vessels provided with paper diaphragms.             As thus

                                        118
 obtained, it is in the form of beautiful          large transparent      plates, of
 ready solubility in water and alcohol.            It  is also soluble in ether,
 reddens    litmus faintly, and is completely volatile at 212°,         a property
 which may serve as a test of its purity from paracotnenic acid,                that
 acid requiring     a much higher     temperature for its sublimation.            Se
 veral attempts were made to prepare the ammonia and potash salts of
 this acid, but without success.
     The  acid gave on analysis      per-centage results agreeing with            the
 formula C10 H3 06 + H O, which is that hitherto adopted.
     Pyromeconate of baryta, Ba O, C10 H3 06 + H 0, precipitates                    as
 small colourless silky needles,      when a warm ammoniacal            solution of
 pyromeconic acid is mixed with acetate of baryta.                By  evaporation
 in   vacuo,   it crystallises in four-sided prisms of a yellow colour.             It
 is the most soluble in water of all the earthy salts of this acid,              100
 parts of water at 60° dissolving 2-50 parts of the salt.
    Pyromeconate of strontia, Sr O, C10 H3 0B + H O. This salt may
 be obtained by mixing alcoholic solutions of the acid with ammonia
 and nitrate of strontia,      when there ensues an immediate precipitate
of   the salt in small colourless crystals,      of sparing solubility in water
and alcohol, 100 parts of the former at 68° dissolving 1-3 parts.
    Pyromeconate of lime, Ca O        C10  Hs 08    + H 0.     This salt  was pre
pared in a manner similar to that              of the    two preceding.        It    is
soluble in water and alcohol to a small extent, 100 parts of the                 for
mer at 68°, dissolving 0-31 of the salt.
    Pyromeconate        of magnesia,   Mg 0     C10  H3 06, falls    as an amor
phous powder, when acetate of magnesia is added to an ammoniacal
solution of pyromeconic acid.
    The pyromeconates of lead, copper, and iron,              have  already     been
examined, and I merely repeated their analysis,              to confirm    the   for
mulae which have been given for them.
    The products of decomposition of this acid were next examined,
cold nitric acid of sp. gr. 1-4 decomposes it with the evolution of
nitrous acid gas, and production of oxalic and hydrocyanic acids.
Sulphuric in the cold has no action on pyromeconic               acid, but     when
gently warmed, it dissolves to a colourless fluid, which, upon                 cool
ing, deposits      the acid again.     I  failed,   however, in procuring         an
ether or a chlorine substitution product of this acid.
    Bromopyromeconic acid, C10 H2 Br O, + H O,                    is obtained      in
the form of beautiful small colourless prisms, when bromine                   water

                                         119
 is made to react on excess       of pyromeconic acid.         These crystals are
 slightly soluble in water, but readily so in boiling alcohol, they red
 den litmus faintly, and impart to persalts of iron a deep purple co
 lour, quite distinct from the red produced by the original acid. Nitrate
of silver causes no precipitate in solutions of this acid ; neither when
boiled does     it reduce the oxide to the metallic state.            Submitted to
destructive distillation     it fuses, and then blackens       ; hydrobromic acid
is evolved    in large quantity    ; and after some time a white crystalline
sublimate makes its appearance, but in quantity too small to admit
of examination.
    Bromopyromeconate         of lead, Pb O       C10 H2 Br. 05     + H O,   is pre
cipitated   as small dense crystalline      grains, when warm alcoholic solu
tions  of the acid and    acetate    of lead are mixed together.
    2. On the      Organs in which Lead accumulates in the Horse,
          in cases of slow poisoning by that Metal.                        By Dr
          George      Wilson.
    The chief object of this paper was to state the result of a careful
analysis of the viscera of a mare, which had died after receiving
daily, for six weeks or more, carbonate of lead in its food and drink.
Portions of the lungs, the heart, the large intestine and its contents,
the stomach      and duodenum, the spleen, the kidney, and the liver,
were subjected to analysis        by the author, assisted        by  Mr  Stevenson
Macadam.
    As the quantity of animal matter             was large, it became    a question
what preliminary process should be followed, with a view to facili
tate the   final charring to which       each organ must be subjected.          Sul
phuric acid was rejected on account of its liability to contain lead,
and the certainty       of its forming      an    insoluble  compound with the
lead  it might encounter in the tissues.             Nitric acid had    been found
in previous trials     to act too slowly       ;  and a mixture of chlorate of
potass and hydrochloric        acid left too large a residue of saline matter,
to seem    applicable.     Aqua regia, accordingly, which has been                re
commended in such cases by the French chemists, was tried, and                   was
found to answer every expectation.
    Each of the organs      was digested     in a mixture of one part of nitric
acid   and two of hydrochloric         acid, which dissolved everything          but
the fat.     The resulting solution       was evaporated to dryness, the resi

                                         120
  due charred,  digested in nitric acid, and the acid             solution    filtered
  and exposed to a stream of sulphuretted hydrogen.               A dark precipi
 tate was obtained which was dissolved in dtlute nitric acid, evapo
 rated to dryness and redissolved in water, acidulated with hydro
 chloric acid.    This solution      was tested   with sulphuretted      hydrogen,
 sulphuric   acid, iodide of potassium, and bichromate              of  potass, and
  acted characteristically    with all the tests.      The spleen yielded the
 fullest indications of the presence of lead, the liver came next in
 shewing indications of the metal, then the lungs, afterwards the kid
 neys, and lowest of all, the intestinal canal.
     It would thus appear, that, in the case under notice, the spleen and
 not the liver was the organ in which lead occurred most abundantly.
 The author, accordingly,      suggests that the spleen rather than the           liver
 should be the organ subjected to analysis          in cases   of  suspected      slow
 poisoning with lead     ;  at least, where a single organ only is analysed.
  3.  Notice regarding the occurrence of Pumice in the Island
                 of Tyree. By The Duke of Argyll.
     The Duke of Argyll (in connection with other           evidences    of  a more
 conclusive kind, that, during some portion of the tertiary ages, there
 had been some subaerial volcanic action in the Hebrides) explained
 the mode in which pumice occurred in the Island of Tyree.                        The
 pumice was found to form a bed or layer along the line of an ancient
sea-beach, and was in the shape          of balls more or    less closely packed
together.    These appearances seemed to indicate that they had come
in on the   waters  of   a tide or current     in large numbers at          a time.
They    were manifestly sea-borne;        and the only question was as to
the most probable      source.      The bay     and  general line of coast           on
which they are found is not that which is opposed                 to the modern
current of the Gulf Stream         ;  but, on the contrary, looks eastward,
that is to say, towards the trap Islands of          Mull, Staffa, &c.
    The author considered it improbable that the origin of the pumice
could have been very distant, inasmuch as the greater               the distance,
the greater would be the dispersion          of  such   light floating   bodies by
winds and currents     ;   and it was difficult to suppose      that either from
the West Indies or from Iceland, pumice could have concentrated in
such quantities   on such a spot.         Its presence, however, and its            de
position, in the manner described, could be easily accounted for,                     if

                                       121
any portion of the traps of       Mull, Staffa, or the adjacent       islets,  were
poured out by a subaerial volcano        ;  and these    the author considered
as placed almost beyond dispute, by the facts              brought   to   light in
connection    with the tertiary      leaf-beds, overflown by lavas, at the
opposite headland of Ardtan, in Mull.
    4.  Recent Observations on the direction of the Striae on
           Rocks and Boulders.             By James Smith, Esq.
   Mr Smith       of Jordanhill    next read     a paper on the direction of
the striae on rocks and boulders in the West of Scotland.
   It  had generally been supposed         that the cause, whatever it was,
which lodged the erratic block          beds   in their present position had
proceeded from the north and west.
   This   was true with respect to the basin of the Clyde and the east
coast of Scotland     ;  but on the western coast of Argyllshire, at Loch
Crinan   and  Appin     he had observed    that the strike side (stoss seite) of
the rocks pointed to the east, and the lee side (lee seite) to the
west, shewing that, in these cases, the direction of the moving force
was from east to west.          Mr Hopkins' recent observations             on the
direction from which boulders near Oban have been derived, shewed
that they also must have come in the same direction.
   Mr Smith     then observed    the occurrence    of a large angular granite
block on the shore at Helensburgh,             which apparently       must have
been transported over ice.         He  had also   observed    at the    Island of
Cumbra an angular         mass  of trap, resting    on a scratched rock, and
split vertically into several    pieces  ;  he had observed      blocks split     in
the same manner, which had fallen from the terminus of the glacier
of Grindelwald.

          1.   On the Analysis of some Scottish Minerals.
                        By Dr A. J. Scott, H.E.I.C.S.
    In this paper, the author detailed the analysis of some minerals
which were placed at his disposal through the kindness of Dr Ander
son,  in whose laboratory        they were examined by him.
    Pectolite.  — The     first of the series   was   a mineral found     at Storr,
 in the Island of Skye.         It  bears a great resemblance to dysclasite

in its external characters, but differs in appearance from that mi
neral, in possessing a much higher lustre.            Its quantitative analysis
gave the following results.

 which approximates much more closely to the experimental                 results,
 than the complicated formula proposed by Berzelius,

 noticed.

 and associated    with stilbite.    It was    supposed      by some to be hypo-
 stilbite, but   a quantitative examination gave the following results,

    2. On a necessary        Correction in the Height of the Baro
          meter depending on the Force of the Wind.                       By Cap
          tain Henry James, R.E. Communicated by Professor
           Piazzi Smyth.
    During the frequent violent gales of last autumn, the author                 had
remarked the excessive       fluctuation of the barometer          ; and following
up this phenomenon by means of the portable aneroid barometer,
he found that not only was this fluctuation              dependent on the wind
and on the barometer being in a screened position               ; but that   accom
panying     the fluctuation     was   a  constant       depression   increasing   in
amount with the velocity of the air, and that this depression amounted
in strong    gales to a larger quantity than         all the other usual     correc
tions applied to a barometrical            reading    ; and must be applicable
to all the ordinary positions where barometers are observed, whether
by sea or land.
   The reason of this depression            was    then entered into,      and the
amount     of numerical     correction     was  given,     as depending on the
velocity of the wind, and the peculiarity of the exposure.

    Some observations           on the Charr (Salmo umbla,) relating
          chiefly    to its Generation and Early Stage of Life.
         By John Davy, M.D., F.R.S. Lond. &Edin., Inspector-
          General of Army Hospitals.
   The observations contained in this paper are given under several
heads :    1st, on the roe and milt of the ,Charr ; 2dly, on the time
required for hatching the ova, and on the young fish in progress
after exclusion    ;  3dly, on some agencies       and circumstances supposed
likely to exert an influence on both.
   The principal      facts which     the author   considers as established by
his observations are the following         : —
    1st, That the time required for hatching the ova is variable, rang
ing from about forty to ninety days, according to the temperature of
the water.
    2d, That after exclusion the young fish can live at least sixty days
without taking food, deriving the material required for its support
and  growth from itself, and chiefly from the store contained in its
yolk.
    3d, That under favourable circumstances it attains its perfect form
in from about sixty to seventy days, when it becomes dependent
for its subsistence chiefly        on   food  which it has to seek or procure
from without.
   4th, That running water is not essential to the hatching of its ova ;
and in consequence of its breeding place being distinct from that of
the trout,   it is exposed   to  little risk of being lost  as a species by re
peated    crossings with the trout.
    5th, That saltwater, even of greater saltness than sea water, is not
immediately fatal to the embryo ; that a partial development of the
ovum     may take place in brackish water           ; and that young fish can
exist some days in such water, rendering it probable that the adult may
be capable     of living in  a tidal stream, or even in the sea, where      it is
stated   that the Welsh Charr has been caught.
    6th, That the young charr can endure confinement for several days
in water of small bulk, such as may be used for transporting it from
place to place, especially       if oxygen     gas be supplied  in the place   of
 common air.
    7th, That the young fish can bear without any immediate apparent
injury, a temperature removed only a degree or two from the freezing

                                          126
  point of water    ; and also a higher temperature,     ranging from 60° to
  70°   ;  but not above 83°, a temperature which in the single instance
  tried was almost immediately fatal to it.
      In   conclusion the author briefly adverts to the application of the
  results obtained to the breeding and transporting         of the fish, adding
  some remarks on the quality      of water essential  to its healthy condition
  and preservation.

      The following Communications             were read     : —,
 1.    On a modification       of the Process for the determination
          of Nitrogen in Organic Compounds.                    By Alexander
          Kemp, Esq.
      Two    methods  are at present followed by chemists for the analysis
 of organic bodies      containing   nitrogen.    In  the first of these     the
 nitrogen is directly separated from the substance, and measured in a
 pure state    ; while in the second method it is converted into ammonia,
 collected    and weighed, its amount being calculated          from the known
 composition of this latter substance.
     In   accordance  with the first-named      mode of proceeding, the sub
 stance is burned at a high temperature, in contact with oxide of
 copper, chromate of lead, or some other body capable of yielding
 oxygen, when the carbon of the organic substance becomes converted
 into carbonic acid, and its hydrogen        into water, while all the nitro
gen is given off in a free state.        Two   methods  may now be adopted
 for ascertaining its quantity.      In  that recommended by         M. Dumas,
the evolved gases are collected in a series of graduated glass tubes,
previously filled with      mercury, and containing      some      potash ley in
the upper part, which serves to absorb the carbonic acid, leaving the
nitrogen, which may then be measured, and its weight calculated
from its known volume and          density, due allowance being made for
the temperature, pressure, and the presence of aqueous vapour.
     According to Liebig, the same object may be more easily and
rapidly attained, by comparing        the volume    of the carbonic acid gas
produced with that of the nitrogen given out in the operation.              This

                                       127
 method, however, is only applicable when the amount of carbon con
 tained in the substance      is known, and would not apply to those ana
 lysis in which the nitrogen alone required to be determined.             Hav
 ing, as in the previously described operation, collected the mixed
gases in graduated tubes, their united volume is read off and noted.
 After this has     been done, caustic potash ley is introduced      to absorb
the carbonic acid. The residual        gas, which is nitrogen,   is then mea
sured, and the proportion between the volumes of           the two gases is at
once ascertained.         Now,  as  each  atom  of carbon produces one of
carbonic acid, occupying the same space         as an atom of nitrogen, the
proportion between the number of atoms and the volumes of the
two gases will be the same ; and as the number of atoms of carbon
is known, that of the nitrogen can          be very easily calculated.     The
principal advantage of Baron Liebeg's method consists in this, that
it   is not requisite to make corrections     for temperature, pressure, or
watery vapour contained in the         gases, as they are both subjected     to
the    same influences in these respects.
     Either of    these   methods will, in careful and experienced hands,
yield very accurate results       ; but the time required, as well as the
necessity of using a somewhat complicated apparatus, renders their
application     to common analyses almost impracticable.
     A   much more easily      and quickly performed      mode   of operating
was proposed a          few years ago by Varrentrapp and        Will.   These
chemists      ascertained, by a series   of very carefully-conducted     expe
riments, that all organic bodies containing nitrogen, unless in the
form of nitric acid, when heated in contact with a mixture of the
hydrates of lime and         soda,  give off that nitrogen     in the form of
ammonia       ; and   this  being collected in a solution of hydrochloric
acid,    is converted into the double chloride  of platinum   and ammonium
by the addition of bichloride of platinum        ;  and this latter substance
being carefully      washed, dried, and weighed, gives, by a simple calcu
lation, the amount of nitrogen in the analysed substance.
     The method of Varrentrapp and Will, just mentioned, has the
great advantage of being much more easily performed than either of
the two previously referred to, and at the same time a much less
complex form of apparatus may be used in the operation ; neverthe
less, from      the necessity    ef performing     several operations   before
finally weighing       the ammonio-chloride     of platinum,    several  hours
must always elapse before the result can be obtained.

                                          128
   An improvement on this            process was      suggested        by       M. Peligot,
who conveys the evolved          ammonia into a quantity of sulphuric acid
of known strength, and then ascertains how much of it                                 has been
neutralised, by saturating it after the operation with an alkali, a solu
tion of lime and sugar being used for this purpose           ;    or, as        Mr Mitchell
since then proposed,        caustic soda solution may be substituted for the
lime with advantage, as it is not apt to change by being kept, either
from spontaneous decomposition, or the absorption of carbonic acid,
which indeed    would not alter its neutralising power, nor affect the
delicacy of the operation, unless it took place to a very great extent.
This last-named method          has the very great advantage           of being quickly
performed, so that as many as six or eight analyses can be easily
made in the time required for one, according to the method                            of Var-
rentrapp and       Will. The only difficulty lies in the preparation of the
solution of sulphuric         acid, which must be done            by guess, and the
proportion     then ascertained      by    a baryta    analysis,      which is not a
very easy operation, from the finely-divided sulphate of baryta passing
readily through the filter.
   From      these circumstances     I    was    induced to try       if   the sulphuric
acid could not be replaced by some substance                easily obtainable,                    of
definite compositions, in the solid form, not hygroscopic, and of which
the quantity could be easily determined             by weighing,           without being
liable to those sources of error which apply to sulphuric                         and most
other acids.       The substance     I    have   found to fulfil these conditions
                          of potash, a salt described by Jacquelain
is the anhydrous bisulphate
in the Annates de Chimie et de Physique for 1839, but the exist
ence    of which    seems     to be doubted       by many chemists.               Into this
point   I   shall not at present enter particularly,             as   I    have       not yet
completed some observations upon this subject with                         which       I        have
lately been engaged     ;   but this has been ascertained, that             if more             than
two equivalents of sulphuric acid be added to any salt of potash con
taining a volatile acid, and the mixture be exposed to heat at a certain
temperature,       hydrated    bisulphate of potash is formed               ;    and       if    the
temperature be now raised to incipient redness, in the dark, vapours
escape, and the anhydrous bisulphate,             of perfectly definite composi
tion, remains, which suffers no farther alteration, even when the heat
is continued for so long a period as three hours — that                    is,   ifit   be not
carried beyond incipient        redness    in the dark.
  In order     to ascertain this latter point,     I   have had eight specimens

 prepared and analysed in several different               ways.     1st, 10 grains,
  precipitated    by nitrate of baryta, gave 18-31 grains             of sulphate of
  baryta, theory requires 18-33 grains; while, for the hydrated bisul-
  phate, 17'12 grains would be the quantity.               2d, 12-72 grains in a
  second experiment gave 23-24 baryta salt, theory 23-32.
      2d, 12-72 grains of the salt were carefully introduced into a hard
 glass tube, and an excess of freshly-ignited oxide of lead added, but
  so as not to come in contact with the salt, the tube with its contents
  was then carefully      weighed, and heated to redness so as to fuse both
  substances, but no loss of weight         could be detected       ;  the hydrated
 salt would     have lost about 0-8 grains.
      3d, 12 72 grains       of the salt were      dissolved in hot water, and
 slightly coloured with litmus ; to this was added a solution of 5-32
 grains of recently-ignited carbonate of soda in a measured quantity
 of water   ;  the whole of this, being the calculated quantity,              was  re
 quired to restore the blue colour to the hot solution coloured by the
 litmus.
      4th, The whole of the eight specimens were                tested   as to their
  neutralising   powers    by means    of the   same    solution of caustic soda,
 and found to agree      ;  there can therefore be little doubt that the an
 hydrous bisulphate of potash can be easily got, and of definite com
 position.
     Having thus endeavoured to shew that the anhydrous bisulphate
 of potash can be obtained of definite neutralising power, little need
 be said   with regard     to its application,   as  it is intended     merely as a
 substitute -for the sulphuric      acid used in Peligot's process,         and that
 entirely on account of the ease with which its quantity may be deter
 mined by weighing alone, without the necessity of having recourse
 to any mode of analysis, as is indispensable when any acid solution
 is made use of.      One other advantage may be mentioned — the salt
 is neither deliquescent nor hygroscopic,          for when 10 grains in fine
 powder were exposed in the laboratory during the night                  in an open
 watch-glass, they had not gained -001 grain by the morning.
     In  employing the salt in an analysis,         any convenient       quantity is
weighed out and dissolved in warm water in a beaker-glass, and
 slightly coloured with litmus; a part of this solution is then intro
 duced into the bulb-tube,        and made     use  of in the analysis       ; after
 wards it is returned to the beaker-glass, and neutralised with solution
 of caustic soda ; the difference between the quantity of soda required,

                                      130
 and what would have been required before the combustion,              gives us
 one of the elements for calculating     the analysis.
    In   order to neutralise the acid reaction    of one equivalent of the
 bisulphate, one equivalent of ammonia         will be required;      therefore
  127-2 grains of the salt will correspond to 17 grains        of ammonia,
 or to 14 grains of nitrogen.
    I  may add, that the high atomic weight of the bisulphate (127-2)
 tends to diminish any errors from inaccurate weighing, or the pre
 sence of impurities.
     5th, Two comparative analyses of pure uric acid were made at the
 same    time  ; 6 grains   gave, by Varrentrapp and Will's method,
 31-90 of the platinum salt, = 33-4 per cent, of nitrogen; theory
 gives 33-33; 5 grains uric acid gave, by the bisulphate                process,
 33-376 per cent, of nitrogen ; theory, 33-333.
    Many other analyses      have been made by this process      in the Uni
 versity laboratory, and with the most satisfactory results, approach
 ing in general more closely     to the calculated quantities than by the
 method with bichloride of platinum.
    It  is obvious that the bisulphate of potash may be employed with
 advantage    as a substitute for sulphuric   acid in common alkalimetry,
 since it is easier to prepare a solution of the anhydrous bisulphate of
 any given strength than to obtain a standard dilute sulphuric acid.
 2.  An account of      some   Experiments on the Diet of Prisoners.
                        By Professor Christison.
    From careful experiments made, under direction of the Board of
Directors of Prisons in Scotland, on 1624 prisoners confined in eight
of the principal     prisons, for periods not exceeding sixty days ; and
from an analysis of numerous observations on their weight and gene
ral health, the author arrives at the following conclusions        : —
    1.  For tho   average  of people whose occupation involves moderate
muscular effort and no great exercise, a simple, well-selected sort of
food, supplying seventeen     ounces   of daily real nutriment,      of which
four ounces are nitrogenous principles,      constitutes  a  sufficient     diet
for maintaining health, strength, weight, and general condition;            but
less is not sufficient.
    2. The proportion of nitrogenous nutriment        in such a  diet cannot

                                         131
 be very sensibly      reduced below      four ounces     a-day without risk of
 injury.
    3.   This amount of nutriment, though in general              adequate   for the
 average in the supposed circumstances, is not always so.
    4.   It is probably inadequate for those who have been accustomed
 to a vigorous occupation      in   the open air, and a liberal dietary,        even
 when their employment         is changed for one involving         no great mus
 cular effort or exercise.
    5.   It is inadequate for a      fair proportion of persons considerably
 exceeding the average in bulk.
    6.   It is inadequate for a considerable proportion           of growing     lads
 between sixteen and twenty.
    7.   It is more generally adequate for females than for males.
    8.   It is rendered occasionally inadequate by other causes not dis
 tinctly indicated by the observations in the Scottish prisons, but
 certainly independent of any increase in habitual muscular exertion.
    9. Hence the economical regulation of the diet of bodies of men
 must always be a matter of great difficulty           ;  and  if  deviations from
 the standard dietary be not allowed with a liberal discretion,               injury
 will  be apt   to ensue.     And here it should          be  added    from    other
 observations,    that suspicion may be lulled by no very perceptible
 injury except loss of weight occurring in ordinary seasons ; while,
 nevertheless, manifest injury will arise in periods of epidemic dis
 ease.
    10. The prison dietary         in Scotland    has    been   very successfully
 adjusted by long experience in most of the prisons, so far as regards
 the class of prisoners who formed the subject of the preceding ob
 servations and experiments,       — viz.,  those imprisoned for terms not
exceeding two months.          But in that dietary treacle-water cannot be
 substituted for milk without a reduction of flesh, the forerunner of
 probable   ill health, unless   some compensation be made           in other arti
cles of food.       It  has, in   fact, been   disallowed    by the Board since
these experiments       were made.
    11.   In adjusting dietaries, and in all practical inquiries into the
subject, reliance ought never to be put on practical observation alone              ;
but scientific    analysis   should be likewise brought into requisition.
Numberless      errors committed by merely practical men might easily
be quoted, which could scarcely have escaped notice had they united
scientific knowledge to practical skill.

3.   Researches           on     some    of the Crystalline Constituents of
                       Opium.         By Dr Thomas Anderson.
     The author            his paper by referring to the numerous
                        commenced
researches on opium which had already appeared, and stated that not
withstanding their number and extent, our information on the pro
perties and composition of its various bases and indifferent con
stituents was still extremely imperfect.                He       had therefore submitted
some      of them      to a renewed examination,             employing          as the    source
from which they were obtained the mother liquor of the manufacturers
of muriate of morphia.     By treatment of this liquor in a manner
detailed in full in the paper, he obtained from it a large quantity of
narcotine, and a certain proportion of thebaine and narceine.
     Narceine was obtained in the form of extremely delicate needles,
which mat together into a silky mass.                       It   is soluble in water and
alcohol, but not in ether.              Potash and ammonia in moderately dilute
solutions        dissolve it more readily than water, but the addition of                         a
large quantity of caustic potash causes                 its precipitation            in shining
scales.         Concentrated sulphuric acid dissolves it in the cold, with an
intense red colour, passing into green on the application                              of   heat.
Hydrochloric                 it entirely, but without producing the
                       acid dissolves
blue colour which, according to Pelletier, is characteristic of nar
ceine.   Narceine, though incapable of restoring tho colour of red
dened litmus,          possesses feebly basic properties, and forms salts with
the strong acids.           Its analysis      gave   results corresponding with the
formula            NOl8, which was confirmed by the analysis of
                C16 H29
its platinum salt. The hydrochlorate, platinochloride, sulphate, and
nitrate, are also described.
     Thebaine crystallises           in fine silvery    plates.          It   is   insoluble      in
water, but very soluble              in alcohol and ether.          It   forms salts which
cannot be obtained              in crystals   from their aqueous              solution.      It   is
insoluble        in potash and         ammonia.      Strong       sulphuric acid            reacts
upon      it,   and produces an intense       blood-red colour even when entirely
free from          nitric acid.       Sulphuric acid of specific gravity                    l-3O0
dissolves       it   in the cold, but on heating        a    resinous semisolid mass              is
thrown down, which slowly dissolves in boiling                       water, and deposits
on cooling         a   rather    sparingly    soluble   salt in microscopic needles,
which appears to be             a   product of decomposition.

                                          133
    Analysis     shewed     the   composition of thebaine to be represented
by the formula        C3g  H21   N06.
     The Hydrochlorate        of Thebaine       is obtained by adding to thebaine
an alcoholic solution of hydrochloric             acid until the base is dissolved,
excess   being carefully avoided.            On standing, the salt is deposited
in fine rhomboidal crystals, often of considerable size.                     Their for
mula, when dried at 212°, is C38 H21 N06 H CI + 2 HO.
    PlatinocMoride         of Thebaine       is   obtained    as  a    yellow   powder,
slightly soluble in boiling           water.      The formula       is   C3g H21   N06
HC1 PtCl2 + 2HO.
     The author then        proceeds    to detail   the phenomena attendant on
the action of nitric acid on narcotine.                 When concentrated nitric
acid is added        to narcotine, very violent          action takes place, and a
fluid is obtained which, on evaporation, yields an amorphous orange
residue.       When the acid         is employed       in  a dilute    state, and  at a
temperature not exceeding 120°, the narcotine slowly dissolves, and
when the solution is complete, the fluid deposits a small quantity of
a  substance to which the author gives the name of teropiammon,
and which is represented by the formula C60 H29 NO20, and is de
rived from three equivalents of opianic acid and one of ammonia,
minus the elements of four equivalents of water.                     The fluid which
has deposited      this substance      contains cotarnine, which is precipitated
by potash    ;  and the potash solution contains, according to the extent
to which the oxidation has gone, either opianic or hemipinic                    acid, or
a   third substance, to which the author gives the                 name     of opianyl,
and which is represented by the formula C20 H1(> Og.                        The author
describes the properties of this substance and its hydrate.                    He then
details the properties of certain compounds of opianic and hemipinic
aicds, from which         he comes      to the conclusion that the latter is           a
bibasic acid, and is correctly represented by the formula                  C20 H10 012.
An acid potash salt, and an acid ether, hemipinovinic acid, are                      de
scribed.
     The cotarnine, which        is formed by the action         of dilute nitric acid
 on narcotine, when treated with stronger                 acid,  undergoes a further
 decomposition, and yields         a  variety of products, which are obviously
 the result     of   several    different     decompositions      occurring    simulta
 neously.      The most abundant product of this action is a crystallis-
 able acid possessing all the characters of Wohler's apophyllic acid.
  It  is best   obtained by treating           cotarnine     with moderately strong

                                         134
 nitric acid, and then     adding alcohol and ether, which throws down
 the new acid in small crystals.          It   is soluble in water, and by eva
 poration   yields fine crystals.        In alcohol      and  ether it is quite in
 soluble.    It fuses at 401°, and dissolves readily in potash and soda.
 The composition      was found to be represented by the formula
                                                                            C16  H;
NOg, differing from that of anthranilic acid              by the elements of two
equivalents of carbonic acid.
    Its salts are all highly soluble in water, and are with difficulty
obtained in the crystalline         form.      Its silver salt   can only be pre
pared by digesting       the acid with     oxide of silver, as when a neutral
apophyllate is added        to nitrate    of silver    a   precipitate of a double
nitrate and apophyllate        of silver is obtained, which explodes when
heated.
    When the solution containing alcohol and ether, from which                  the
apophyllic acid has been thrown down, is evaporated, and then dis
tilled with potash,      a volatile   base is obtained, which        possesses  the
composition     and properties of methylamine,             and under certain cir
cumstances ethylamine also appears to be formed.

 4.   On the Red Prominences                 seen during Total Eclipses of
           the Sun.        Part I.      By William Swan, FH.S.E.
    The object of this           communication         is to discuss     the  evidence
 afforded by various observations          of the eclipse which occurred on the
 28th   July     1851, as to    the nature of the rose-coloured prominences
 which     are   seen   round     the
                                       moon during the
                                                                total  phase   of solar
 eclipses.
    In order to render the inquiry into the nature of the red promi
 nences    as  complete as possible, the author has not confined himself
 to the  consideration of such hypotheses only as have                  been formally
 stated regarding        them   ;   but has also included        in his examination
such   other views as he thought           might      probably be entertained       re
garding those remarkable objects.
    The observations of the eclipse discussed             by the author are chiefly
contained       in the Royal Astronomical Society's Notice                for January
 1852, and the following            are the conclusions       to which   he has been
led by the examination            of those observations     : —
    1.   The red prominences were not caused by the telescopes                    used
in viewing the eclipse ; for they were seen by the naked eye.
    2.  The red prominences cannot             be regarded as optical phenomena,
produced       either by unequally heated           air, as supposed     by  M. Faye,
or by the action of the            moon's limb on the sun's light          ; for these
hypotheses        are inconsistent     both with the permanency of form dis
played     by the prominences, and with the general                similarity of their
appearance,        as seen from stations       differently    situated with reference
to the    line of central eclipse.
    3.   While the optical hypotheses thus labour under difficulties
peculiar to themselves, the objections to the opinion                    that the red
prominences are material objects existing in the sun, founded on the
discrepancies        in the observations, as to their number, forms, and
positions,     are found to apply with          equal force to the optical hypo
theses.
    4.  Little care      seems,    in some instances, to have been taken in
ascertaining the positions of the red prominences, and accordingly
great discrepancies         occur among the observations            ; while in certain
cases they agreed remarkably             well.    Mr    Dawes and the author, who
both used        means    for obtaining an accurate estimation of angles of

                                        136
 position, differ  by less than a degree       in the place they assign        to the
most    conspicuous prominence seen at the late eclipse, and they also
assign to it almost exactly the same form.             This, and other coinci
dences    between    observations   made at distant       stations, are    strongly
in favour of the idea that the prominences are material objects.
    5.  The   observed   differences in the numbers and          positions of     the
red prominences,       as seen   from     stations differently situated      in   the
moon's shadow, are, upon           the whole,      accordant     with the     effects
which parallax      would produce,      if  the prominences       actually  existed
in the sun.
    6.  The hypothesis that the prominences exist in the                sun   seems
to afford the only explanation of the fact, that the moon                gradually
occulted them on the side towards which                it moved,     and   exposed
them on the other, while         at the same       time the outlines of        those
portions of the prominences which continued visible, as well               as their
relative positions, remained unaltered.
    7.  On these grounds it is inferred         that the red prominences          are
material    objects existing   on the sun.

1.   On the Red Prominences seen during Total Eclipses of
        the Sun.       Part II. By William Swan, F.R.S.E.
   In the first part of this paper,        the author endeavoured        to sheWi

                                         137
from a comparison of various observations of the red prominences
seen at the eclipse of the 28th July 1851, that those objects were
not mere optical phenomena, but that they actually existed in the sun.
    The object of the present communication is to offer some conjec
tures regarding the nature of the red prominences, and their pos
sible connection with other solar phenomena.
    The comparatively faint light reflected            by the    prominences, their
overhanging          forms, and    the appearance at the late eclipse, of a
prominence completely detached            from the moon's limb, all conspire
to prove        that they are cloudy masses         floating    in the sun's atmo
sphere    ;    while the existence of a long range of red prominences,
which, at certain stations, was seen extending over nearly a third part
of the moon's limb, together with their tolerably uniform distribution
all round        the rest of the moon's edge, prove          that the matter com
posing them is very copiously diffused through the sun's atmosphere.
    To account for the existence of          the   red prominences, the author
supposes       that the sun's luminous       atmosphere       is surrounded   by an
envelope       of cloudy matter, capable of absorbing part of his light,
and reflecting         chiefly the red rays of the spectrum — a conjecture
 which    is founded both on the observed general distribution               of the
 red prominences,          and on the appearance         of a band of red light
just    before      the end of the total phase of the eclipse, which was
 seen extending         round the moon's limb, about           the point where the
 sun emerged.          The serrated outline of the long range of prominences
 indicates that the surface of the stratum of cloud is exceedingly un
 even, and        its higher portions   seen   beyond the edge of the moon,
 may constitute red prominences.              It is also however supposed,      that
just   as the spots on the sun have been conceived to arise from upward
 currents in the solar atmosphere, removing portions of its luminous
 stratum    ;    the same, or similar currents, may penetrate the superin
 cumbent stratum of cloud, carry upwards the edges of the aperture it
 has formed, and detach            masses of cloud, so as to form        higher and
 more remarkable          prominences, like the more striking objects of that
 kind which were seen at the late eclipse.
     The author conceives that this view regarding                the nature of the
  red prominences, may also serve to explain other solar phenomena.
     1.  The darkness of the sun's         edge, compared with         his centre, is
 generally attributed         to the absorbent action of the solar atmosphere
 on  light   ;    but unless the thickness of the absorbent atmosphere be

                                                 138
small, when compared with the sun's diameter, the difference of its
action on the central and lateral rays would be insensible.                                         On the
other hand, the wide extension of the corona indicates that the                                         sun's
atmosphere          is of great thickness compared with his diameter;                                     and
there      is,   therefore, difficulty in supposing the darkness of the                                 sun's
edges to arise from the general absorption                        of light     by   his atmosphere.
That phenomenon, however,                  is    easily explained             by supposing              it   to
arise from the absorbent action of                    a    comparatively            thin    stratum          of
cloud surrounding            the sun.
      2. The faculae are generally understood                       to be ridges           in   the sun's
luminous atmosphere             ;    but tho author supposes             them to be apertures
in the envelope of cloud, through                     which his rays pass                  more         freely
than elsewhere.   The greater distinctness of the faculae when seen
near the sun's limb,  explained is                    by
                                      the light shining through the
apertures         being     there     contrasted     light which has suffered
                                                       with
absorption         by    passing obliquely through the envelope of cloud while                      ;
towards the centre the contrast                  is    not   so   great, as the light                   passes
nearly perpendicularly               through     the      envelope, and         is    therefore           less
absorbed.
      3. The supposition that the larger prominences are situated on
the    edges of apertures in the envelope of cloud consistent with the   is
increased brightness of the corona in their neighbourhood, which                                           was
observed         at the late eclipse.
      4. The existence of an envelope of cloud surrounding                                      the sun,
capable of absorbing light, but penetrated by apertures, and there
fore transmitting light more freely at certain places than at others,
may serve to explain the great want of uniformity in the brightness
of    the corona, and the            brilliant    beams       of light which occur in                    it   at
certain points.
      The hypothesis that            an envelope of cloud surrounds the sun, thus
refers to one physical cause,             a     variety of solar phenomena, namely,
the darkness             of the sun's limb compared with his centre,                            the exist
ence       of faculae on his disc, the discontinuous                          illumination of                the
corona, the existence of the red prominences,                                 and the occasional
increased   brightness of the corona in their neighbourhood.                                    .
      The idea that   cloudy envelope surrounds the sun, occurred to
                            a
tho author immediately after witnessing                            the   eclipse of 28th                  July
 1851, when he reflected on the striking want of uniformity                                         he had
observed         in the illumination       of the corona.

                                             139
     That phenomenon strongly impressed on him the conviction, that
 something existed at the surface of the sun which intercepted his
 light, more at certain          points than at others     ;  and he conceived that
the matter composing             the red prominences, might         be the absorbent
medium which produced that effect.
2.    On a Universal Tendency in Nature to the Dissipation
   of Mechanical Energy. By Professor William Thomson.
    The object of the present communication                   is to call attention  to
the remarkable         consequences      which follow from Carnot's proposition,
established      as   it is  on   a new foundation, in the dynamical theory of
heat    ; that there is an absolute waste of mechanical energy available to
man, when heat is allowed to pass from one body to another at a lower
                     by any means          not fulfilling his criterion of a    " per
temperature,
fect thermo-dynamic             engine."      As it  is most certain    that Creative
Power alone        can either call       into existence or annihilate      mechanical
energy, the
                "   waste" referred to cannot be annihilation,           but must be
some transformation             of energy.*       To explain the nature of this
transformation,        it  is convenient,     in the first place, to divide stores
of mechanical energy into two classes — statical and dynamical.                     A
quantity of weights at a height, ready to descend and do work                    when
wanted,      an electrified       body, a quantity      of fuel, contain stores of
mechanical energy of the statical kind.                Masses of matter in motion,
a volume of space through which undulations                  of light or radiant heat
are passing,         a body having         thermal    motions among its particles
(that is, not infinitely cold), contain           stores  of mechanical energy of
the dynamical         kind.
     The following propositions           are laid down regarding the dissipation
of mechanical energy from a given store, and the restoration of it to
its primitive condition.               They are necessary consequences of the
axiom,      "It   is  impossible, by means of inanimate material agency,
to derive      mechanical        effect from any portion of matter by cooling
it below     the temperature of the coldest of the surrounding objects.,,
(Dynam. Th. of Heat, § 12.)

mechanical energy thus spent may be restored to its primitive con

                                                                       L 2

dition,) there is also a transference from a cold body to a hot body
of   a quantity         of   heat bearing           to the quantity created a definite pro
portion depending on the temperatures of the two bodies.
      II.     When         heat   is created        by any unreversible         process (such        as
friction,)        there      is a      dissipation of mechanical energy,               and    a full
restoration          of it to its primitive condition is impossible.
      III.       When heat            is diffused    by conduction,      there is a dissipation
of mechanical energy, and perfect restoration                           is impossible.
      IV.      When        radiant         heat   or light is absorbed, otherwise than in
vegetation, or in chemical action, there is a dissipation of mechanical
energy, and perfect restoration                      is impossible.
      In    connection with the second proposition, the question, How                             far
is the loss of power experienced by steam in rushing through narrow
steam-pipes compensated, as regards the economy of the engine, by
the       heat    (containing           an      exact equivalent      of mechanical         energy)
created by the             friction ? — is considered         ;   and    the following conclu
sion is arrived at            :   —
     Let S       the temperature of the steam, (which is nearly the
                  denote
same in the boiler and steam-pipe, and in the cylinder till the ex

Then (1              H)w expresses the greatest amount of mechanical                           effect
that can be economised, in the circumstances,                            from a quantity      J itu
of heat produced                  by
                       the expenditure of    quantity, w, of work a                                  in
friction, whether of the steam in the pipes and entrance-ports, or                                   of
any solids or fluids                  in    motion in any part of the engine; and                 the
remainder,           Sw,     is   absolutely and irrecoverably            wasted, unless         some
use    is     made    of    the   heat discharged from the condenser.                  The     value
of    1   —   R   has   been      shewn to be not more than about one-fourth for
the best steam-engines, and we may infer that in them at least three-
fourths of the work spent in any kind of friction                         is   utterly wasted.
     In connection with the third proposition,                          the quantity of work
that could be got by equalising the temperature of all parts of                              a   solid
body possessing initially                   a   given non-uniform       distribution   of    heat,   if
this could be done                     by   means    of perfect thermo-dynamic              engines

without          any conduction of heat, is investigated.                         If t   be the   initial
temperature (estimated according to any arbitrary system) at any
point xy z of the solid, T the final uniform temperature, and o the
thermal capacity of unity of volume of the solid, the required mecha
nical effect is          of course equal        to
                                    J

out of existence.               Hence     the problem             becomes      reduced      to that     of

3. On     Rifle Cannon.        By Captain Davidson, Bombay Army-
           Communicated by Professor C. Piazzi Smyth.
    This paper   was   written in India as far back as 1839, but          many
of its suggestions were still untried, and present circumstances           seem
to urge their importance.
    The recent improvements         in the hand-rifle have    so  greatly     in
creased   the practical range of that instrument, as to have passed          and
left far behind, in point of range and precision, the heavy field        pieces
which heretofore have done accurate execution at distances imprac
ticable to small arms.      The large guns therefore imperatively       require
to undergo the same alteration which, by converting the musket into
a rifle,   has so greatly    increased the directness and accuracy of         the
flight of its ball.
    Rifling  has already been     tried on cannon, but not with       success ;
and Captain      Davidson's    paper merely     professed to    give an      im
proved method of applying the principle.           This he   effected    by in
serting into the sides of the shot or shell, ribs of wood, to fit into        the
rifle grooves of the bore.       In this way he considered that the       neces
sary rotation would be given to the ball, without the usual error               of
tearing and destroying      the figure of the interior of the gun          ; the
soft wooden ribs, and not the hard cast-iron of the Captain's projec
tiles, alone coming into contact with the bore,
    To this method of rifles he proposed also to join the conical form
for the projectile, fired with the small end first, and to make the

by this means       acquire    a superiority     which    will almost equal any
thing that has been done          at any time by the particular excellence

4. On     two New Processes for the detection of Fluorine when
           accompanied by Silica, and on the presence of Fluorine
           in Granite, Trap, and other Igneous Rocks, and in the
           Ashes of Recent and Fossil Plants. By Dr George
           Wilson.
    The author, after alluding to his previous communications to the
 Society in reference to fluorine, stated that he had always attri
buted the slight indications       of the presence     of this element in plants,
which his own investigations and those of others had yielded, to the
amount     of silica which    was contained     in vegetable     ashes.     The pre
sence    of silica, which throws special difficulties          in the way of de
tecting fluorine, had also prevented him from seeking for it in trap
rocks and other mineral masses.             Recently, however,        he had put in
practice    two processes, which were applicable to all bodies containing
silica and a metallic fluoride, which are decomposed               by boiling oil of
vitriol.   When this acid    is heated along with a silicated fluoride,       it occa
sions an evolution      of the fluorine in combination with silicon,            as the
 well-known      gaseous  fluoride of silicon    (Si F3).     In the first process,
this gas is conducted into a solution of caustic potash,                 in which it
                                                                                 (2 Si
occasions     a precipitate  of the fluoride of silicon and potassium
F,    + 3   K F).    This   precipitate is heated in a metallic crucible with
potassium, so as to separate the silicon, and convert the double fluo
 ride into fluoride of potassium.       When      moistened   with oil of vitriol, it
evolves hydrofluoric      acid, the escape of which is easily recognised by
its etching glass.       This process gave good results, but was tedious,
 and sometimes unsuccessful.           It  was accordingly abandoned for the

                                             144
 second process,     in which ammonia            is substituted for potass,     and the
 use  of potassium is dispensed with.
     The following are the steps of the ammonia process.                        The   si-
 licated fluoride, such as trap-rock or the ashes of straw,                  is heated
 with oil of vitriol, and the fluoride of silicon which is given off                    is
 conducted by a bent tube into an aqueous solution of ammonia, with
 which it forms the fluoride           of silicon and ammonium           (2 Si Fi +
  3 NH4 F).        When this is evaporated to perfect dryness, the silicon
 becomes    insoluble     silica,  from which water dissolves out the pure
 fluoride of ammonium.            This ammonio-fluoride         is dried up in a pla-
 tina crucible, and after moistening the residue with sulphuric                    acid,
 a piece of waxed glass,        with lines traced through the wax              down to
 the glass, is laid as a cover on the crucible, so as to permit the hy
drofluoric acid evolved to etch the lines.
     This  process     has been tried         with Peterhead      and Aberdeen gra
nite, with basalt from Arthur's              Seat, greenstone from Corstorphine
Hill,   and clinkstone       from Blackford        Hill, all in   the  neighbourhood
of Edinburgh.         It  has also been tried with the ashes of barley-straw,
of hay, of   coal,   and of charcoal       ;  and in addition, with a fossil       bone
containing much carbonate of lime                ;  and with the deposit from        the
boiler of an ocean steamer.            To the bone, and       to the boiler deposit,
pounded glass was added.              Most of the specimens obtained in             this
way were shewn to the Society.                 These, the author stated, were        not
selected   successful ones, but represented the earliest trials.                Where
the rocks under examination had been weathered, or the substances,
such as plant-ashes, contained salts of volatile acids, as chlorides                and
carbonates, they were treated, first, with oil of vitriol, in the cold,                so
as to evolve hydrochloric         acid and carbonic acid.       On afterwards rais
ing the liquid to the boiling point, in a flask with a bent tube,                 a gas
was given off,     if fluorine were present, which deposited gelatinous               si
lica when passed         through     water, and produced with           it a   solution
which gave a gelatinous precipitate with potash.                   The whole of the
fluoride of silicon is given off as soon as the oil of vitriol has reached
its boiling point.       The author      is at present engaged in applying this
process   to a variety of substances, and              in ascertaining   its  applica
bility to the quantitative determination of fluorine.
    In conclusion, it     was noticed      that the discovery of fluorine       in trap
and granite, threw much light on the production of minerals, such as
fluor spar and crystallised silica, which are found in these rocks:

                                        145
and that the detection    of  the element under notice in marked quanti-
tity in plants,   prepares us for the recognition of fluorine as a con
stant ingredient   of the tissues of animals, who receive       it both in their
solid food, and in the water which they drank.              The author, how
ever, forbore to enlarge, upon the application          of his discovery of the
wide  distribution of fluorine, till     he   analysed an additional number
of substances for it.

     The following Communications                were read   :   —
1.   On a supposed Meteoric Stone, alleged to have fallen in
      Hampshire in September 1852.       By Dr George Wil
        son.
  The object of this communication was              to exhibit to the Society a
mineral which had been publicly described           as a meteoric stone, picked
up by a witness of its fall.          The author had      been   induced, by the
published account of the alleged fall of the stone, to make inquiry
concerning       it,   and had ascertained that no one had witnessed its de
scent ;    and that the only evidence in favour of its being         a   meteorite
was the fact of its having          been noticed for the   first time    in   a   gar
den-path,       the morning after    a   thunder-storm.
     The mineral                             of any known meteorite, being
                        had not the characters
simply     a   large nodule of iron pyrites or bisulphuret of iron, oxidised
at the surface into brown haematite.
     The author drew attention to the fact that such nodules             were      po
                                                                 " thunderbolts,"
pularly known, in the chalk districts of England, as
     VOL.   III.                                                         N

a title which seemed to him a recognition          of the fall of aerolites,     and
especially of meteoric iron, which, after oxidation, would closely                re
semble the oxidised pyrites.
     In   Scotland and the north of Europe,        the term     " thunderbolt"
had long been applied to ancient flint arrow-heads and stone celts                      ;
and throughout the island a well-known          fossil, the belemnite, had re
ceived the same appellation.         The author did not regard      those bodies
as named  primarily in reference to meteorites, but rather as repre
senting the popular idea of lightning as something shot like an arrow
from a thunder-cloud.
     The paper concluded with the suggestion that the art of working
iron had been learned by primitive nations from the manipulation of
metallic meteorites, the rusting of which further taught               them      that
brown and red haematite contain iron.
2.    On the Glacial       Phenomena          of Scotland,     and parts of
               England.       By Robert Chambers, Esq.
   This paper commenced with an account of Ancient Moraines con
nected with Corries or Small Valleys.    Sir Charles Lyell had de
scribed one as forming the retaining dam of Loch Brandy, on the
eastern skirts of the Grampians,        and   Mr   Charles Maclaren had dis
covered another      in Glenmessau, near the Firth of Clyde.               The   au
thor of the paper described a few others which            he had discovered.
At   Corryhashtel,     on the side   of Ben-Blaven, in the Isle of            Skye,
there are three distinct parallel lines of blocks along the right side of
the valley, which are presumed to mark the right skirt of a local                 gla
cier at three points in the history of its shrinking.         In   a   deep rough
valley at the opposite side of the mountain, there are several mounds
of rough    stones mingled with smaller detritus, which are presumed to
have been the terminal moraines of a glacier once filling that valley.
The author     has likewise found detrital heaps and ridges,       fully   answer
ing the character of moraines, in connection with various corries or
short valleys in the alpine districts of Applecross        in Ross-shire,        and
Assynt in Sutherlandshire,      and in some of these         instances he        has
found the rocks in the valleys presenting           smoothed and scratched
surfaces.
   The next section of the paper related to Proofs   Ancient Gla
                                                              of
ciers in limited Mountain Districts.   The author had recently as

                                         149
certained that the Lake District of Cumberland                and Westmoreland
bears incontestable traces of the former existence of glaciers origi
nating in its high grounds, and passing down the valleys.                In Bor-
rowdale, in Ulleswater, in Thirlmere, in Grasmere, and Windermere,
and in the vale of the Kent, rounded hummocks of rock, presenting
an exposed side up the valley, and a rough side             in the contrary di
rection, are abundantly       seen.     Flat surfaces of rock, finely smoothed
and striated  in the line of the valley, are presented at Grange in
Borrowdale, at Patterdale in Ulleswater, and at Staveley in Kent-
dale.   In  many places, detrital        accumulations    of precisely the cha
racter of the moraines of the Alps, and of a brown colour, are found;
but they have not been seen in any definite arrangement               suggesting
the idea of terminal      or lateral moraines, excepting in one instance
near the head of the Thirlmere valley, where a long mound of blocks
rests on the  hill-face, in the angle between the principal and            a side
valley, — a  form      exactly    resembling     the  ancient moraine of the
extended Glacier des Bois, at Tines in Chamouni.                   At Dunmail-
raise, which is a col or summit out of the range of any possible gla
cier of the district, there is a deep accumulation             of clayey matter
and blocks, which the author           thinks probably of greater antiquity
than the glaciers of the district, and referable to earlier phenomena
of a kindred character.
   The author adverted to Snowdonia, in North Wales,                  as an an
cient glacier district, of precisely the same character as that of the
Cumbrian    Lakes    ;  there being here seven       radiating valleys, all con
taining the usual proofs of the passage of ancient glaciers.               These
have been described several years ago, and now Professor                 Ramsay
discovers the remarkable fact that the northern drift, which abounds
in neighbouring     districts,   is here only found     in out-of-the-way    cor
ners, and in elevated situations.
   Mountain regions so limited and definite as those of North Wales
and Cumbria do not exist in Scotland ; but the author has never
theless found proofs of local systems          of glaciers almost equally well
defined.    He points      to   one    instance in Assynt, Sutherlandshire,
whore there is proof of one glacier passing along through the vale in
 which Loch Assynt lies, and out to sea at Storr ; while another,
 descending from the same           elevated ground     at Ben-Uie     and Ben-
 More,  moved along the valley which            contains the estuary of     Kyle
 Skow.
                                                                  N 2

       The paper next proceeds to bring forward Proofs of a                more Ge
  neral Glaciation in Scotland.
       Traces of glacial action in the smoothing and furrowing of rocks,
   and in the deposit of the appropriate detrital accumulations and
   blocks,   have heretofore been    detected     in various parts of Scotland.
   In   the southern and eastern skirts       of the Highlands,       the   direction
  indicated for the agent is southerly and easterly.              In   the valley   of
  the    Firth of Forth, both in the low grounds, and high              up the hills
  on both sides, are phenomena        of this kind, with      an indication of di
  rection from about       WSW.      Having found a few instances in the
  north of Argyllshire and       parts of Inverness-shire, where the agent
  appeared to have had a direction from the east,              Mr Maclaren        and
  M. Charles Martins        had become satisfied that there had been ordi
  nary glaciers in the group of mountains               between the Clyde         and
  Lochaber,     and that they had, as usual, radiated outwards.             Thus it
  was held as possible     to account for the whole phenomena which had
  been observed.
      The author of the present paper has extended his observations                 to
 the large Highland district to the northward of the great glen,                  and
 particularly     to the old red sandstone      district of western Ross          and
  Sutherland.        He   has  there found glacially-smoothed           rocks,   even
 more abundantly than in the southern region.                They occur in      many
 valleys, generally in the line of the valleys, and also on many elevated
 situations, even to 2000 feet above the level of the sea.          In all  elevated
 positions, and in all open regions free of valleys, the line of the stria-
 tion shews a marked tendency to observe one direction, and that                  be
 tween north-west and south-east.         This   is alike the case in   Mull   and in
 Skye, on Ben-Eay beside Loch Maree in Ross-shire, and on the moun
 tains of Cuineag and Canisp in Sutherlandshire,              in the wide-spread
 rocky plains of Lord Reay's country, and on the gentle undulations of
 Caithness.      The white quartz rocks of the Assynt mountains retain             the
striation over wide areas and with great clearness.             It is also remark--
able that some of these mountains are of a narrow lengthy form, with
the longitudinal      axis in the same direction as the striation, while          the
intermediate hollows, containing the long lakes for which the district
is remarkable,       observe  the same direction.       The whole     series of the
old red sandstone mountains of Ross and Sutherland,                  extending for
fifty    miles, observe a horizontal    stratification,    so that each separate
hill   looks like a pile of masonry resting on a gneissic platform.            Find

                                          151
ing the hills themselves, and the intermediate spaces, marked glacially,
and the glacial striae, and the lengths of the hills and intermediate
hollows,    all conformable in direction, the author of the paper thinks
it probable that ice, not water, will yet be concluded to have been the
cause of this notable example of the phenomenon of Denudation ; and,
consequently, of many others where its operations have not as yet
been   suspected.
    It  is in the midst    of this district of old red     sandstone    mountains,
that the author discovered        the traces of local glaciers passing through
the vale    of Loch Assynt, and that containing the estuary of Kyle
Skow.       These consisted of moraines damming up lakes in the high
grounds,   — smoothed        hummocks and ridges of rock in the valleys,
with the exposed       side towards the supposed       sources    of the glaciers,
and trains     of brown debris in the opposite        direction, — and    blocks of
the gneissic platform of the country carried             in the latter direction
over the crust      of  old red sandstone on the coast.          The direction    of
the striation in these instances, is different from that above described,
and at one place, on the skirts of Canisp            mountain,     above   a valley
containing many moraines, the normal striation from the north-west
is crossed,    like the chequers of cloth, by another         system   traceable to
an   agent which has passed right down hill.
    The author        considers   these    facts as indicating     that there has
been,   first,   a general sweeping of the surface in that district by some
 icy agent, which       has   come from     the north-west,      and been all but
 wholly indifferent      to the inequalities     of the ground      ; and, second,
systems     of local glaciers which      have passed over certain portions        of
 the ground, substituting       their own peculiar set of tracings and          me
 morials   for those of the previous movement.            And thus    he considers
 himself as having obtained a key to much that was perplexing                     in
 the glacial      phenomena of the southern portions           of the Highlands.
Having in Lochaber,— where            Mr Maclaren had found in the valleys
tracesof a westerly movement, — seen on the higher grounds the clearest
 memorials of one to the south-eastward and eastward, he believes that
 the former instances are merely results          of later and more local gla-
 ciation, the direction      of which   was   of course determined by the de
 scent   of the valleys    ;  while it remains true of this, as of the more
 northern    districts, that a general sweeping of the surface, irrespective
 of hill and valley, had taken place at an earlier period.             The author
conceives that the smoothings of valleys          still more    to the southward,

                                      152
 as those of the Gareloch,     discovered by   Mr  Maolaren,   and those of
  Loch Lomond and Loch Katrine, discovered by himself, as well as
  those of the valley of the Forth, may all be classed under the earlier
  and more general glaciation,      though  not perhaps    in any place    free
  from some interferences of the later and more local movements.            He
  asserts that every part of the Highlands, and much of the Lowlands,
  bear traces of this general glaciation, in the rounding and smoothing
  of rocks, though in many instances, the effects are comparatively ob
  scure, in consequence of weathering,        and the washing of the rock-
 surface by superficial    accumulations.     The author indicated      a new
 kind of memorial of these glacial operations, in what he described           as
 Mouldings,      seen on  the sides of many hills in Scotland,       generally
 nearly horizontal, resembling the mouldings produced in wood by            the
 use   of a curve-edged plane, and which he considers as connecting them
 selves on the one hand, with such longitudinal ridges as the Garleton
 Hills, all lying in the direction of the striation of the,district  ; and, on
  the other, with the rounded and flowing outlines of such larger hills      as
 the Pentlands, on which they are themselves marked.         The whole    phe
 nomena, in the opinion of the author, demand the passage, over large
 areas of unequal country, of some agent at once plastic and fitted
 to apply with keen abrading force to the surface       ; at the same time
 in such volume as to fill valleys several miles in breadth, and from
 one to two thousand feet in depth.        He contended that, as respects
 all  these glacial phenomena, Scotland is in precisely the same condi
 tion as Scandinavia,     where there are proofs of a general movement
 from the    north-west, though turning easterly in the southern district ;
 the valleys on the shores of the Northern Ocean, and White Sea, which
 shewed    proofs of glaciation in the seaward direction,     being seats of
 comparatively     modern and local glaciers.    The  same doctrine applied
 to North America.
     In  speculating on the nature of the agent, : the author       could not
profess to speak with much confidence       ;  but he thought that, in dis
missing the disproved Dilatation Theory of Charpentier and Agassiz,
it would be well to keep in view, that there was no theoretical objec
tion to a flow of glacier ice over wide areas of small inclination,     if the
latter circumstance were compensated by the volume of the mass                ;
and it even appeared that, on the hydrostatic principle, an accumu
lation of the materials in ono quarter,       would cause a movement       to
wards any other quarter offering sufficiently       small resistance.     The

                                                153
agent,    however, appeared to have been applied in different conditions
from a subaerial glacier,             at least as far as Scotland was concerned,
for the boulder clay of many districts of our country must be con
sidered                 of this general glaciation ; and that shewed, in
              as the detritus
the author's opinion, proofs of the presence of water, both in the com
pactness of the clay, and in the roundedness of the boulders.    Glacier
ice moving on a flat surface,             even supposing           no   sea present,      would
obviously be different from a glacier in a sloping valley, because                              it
would not undergo the same drainage of the included water.                            It would
be   in a comparatively         slushy condition         ;   and, by the way, so much
the more mobile.
     The latter part of the paper               was devoted     to a summary         of   ascer
tained    facts regarding the superficial accumulations of different coun
tries.     The Drift of the Silurian region, described by Sir Roderick
Murchison, answered to the Scottish Boulder Clay, in the local cha
racter of the included blocks, and the direction in which it had moved.
Over and posterior to           it,   was the   Northern Drift,          so widely spread       in
England.           This probably corresponded with                 a    second    boulder clay
or   Till, known to Scottish geologists, and which, differing in                     some re
spects  from the first, might be presumed to be owing to somewhat
different causes, or to similar agents operating under different cir
cumstances,        the sea being here undoubtedly                  concerned.       The local
glaciers of Wales have already been shewn to be later than this drift.
In clays and        sands below and above the second boulder clay, are found,
in   Scotland, deposits of shells of living species, but betraying an Arctic
character.

 On the supposed occurrence of                   Works of Arts in the Older
            Deposits.        By James Smith, Esq. of Jordanhill.
     The author, after mentioning various             cases   of this nature, in all
of which the evidence was very defective, exhibited a tool of wrought-
iron, said to have been found in the coal, but which was only proved
to have come out        of   a coal-pit.
     He then     shewed      an Indian arrow-head in a calcareous deposit in
situ from Canada, which, at first sight, might be supposed                       to   be
coeval      with the formation      of the deposit     ;   but on examination,        the
calcareous mass proved to be quite superficial,               so   that nothing could
be easier than for the arrow-head, which is of the usual                   Indian form,
to have fallen on the wet surface, and to have been thus apparently im
bedded.       The author concluded that       no evidence had yet been adduced
to prove the occurrence          of works of art in any of         the older deposits.

     The following Communications                 were read        :   —
1.    On the Optical Phenomena and Crystallization of Tour
       maline, Titanium, and Quartz, within Mica, Amethyst,
       and Topaz.     By Sir David Brewster, K.H., D.C.L.,
           F.R.S., and V.P.R.S. Edin.
     1 .   The first part   was on the distribution    of Tourmaline in Mica. —
When liquids or         gases have been      confined in mica, they have often
easily escaped and spread between                the plates.       Crystals,   both of
tourmaline and quartz, are found in mica, contemporaneous with                        it,
and of considerable size.           Such crystals generally have the faces of
the hexagonal prism parallel to the laminae of the mica.
   But other crystals of tourmaline formed subsequently, and between
the laminae, are very different.    They are hexagonal plates, with
faces perpendicular to  the  axis of the prism.  Some of the fluid
which deposited them has penetrated between the laminae, and there

                                        159
deposited hexagonal plates, often in circular groups round the cavity.
 The centre of the cavity is occupied by          a granular    opaque group    of
 crystals.     The hexagonal plates are commonly of a brownish yellow,
 and, if thicker, green ; but they are of extreme thinness.             Some of
 them exhibit dichroism by polarized light.
     The   effects of pressure    are detected  on the mica near the cavities,
 proving the force exerted.
     The plates of mica exhibit Newton's            rings   on certain circular
 spaces, indicating     the presence     of air or gas between     the laminae    ;
 and it is curious that wherever a cavity has projected liquid or gns,
 it is situated on the circumference of one        of these round spots.     This
 indicates that    a gas has been     projected between the laminae.
     The author then described        a remarkable specimen,      given him by
 Dr Fleming, in       which very thin hexagonal        crystals of tourmaline,
 in mica,    were almost opaque.        There are rectilineal cracks in them,
 however    ; and these, on looking at the sun through the crystals, ex
hibit very beautiful optical phenomena. These fissures prove that
the crystals were soft after they had their present form. No cavity
appears in this specimen.
     This specimen, as well as others, contained the filaments and
sporules of Penicillium glaucum between the lamina?.
     2.  On Titanium in Mica.        —Titanium    occurs   in mica, and often in
beautiful dendritic forms, mostly opaque, but when 7#Vstb. of an inch
thick, transparent. When only a very thin film of mica is left over
them, the most beautiful          colours are seen, due to the thin plate of
mica, and not to       a vacuity.
    3. On the occurrence        of Quartz in Mica. — The quartz      occurs with
its axis of double refraction parallel to the laminae, but it never
occurred in regular crystals.
    4. On Titanium in Amethyst. — The titanium was found in fine
pyramidal crystals, coating the faces as with a powder, but covered
again with amethyst faces parallel to those within.               The dust was
formed of spicular crystals crossing each other at angles of 60° and 30°.
    It  would appear that the crystals of amethyst must have grown
in   a solution which      at times contained titanium, and at other times
did not.       Hence the successive layers as the crystals grew.          In  one
case, the titanium formed the external surface in part of the faces
of the pyramid,      as if  the other part had lain in a  liquid protected from
the deposit, and no more amethyst had afterwards been deposited.
    6. On Titanium in Topaz. — A number of imperfect crystals of

                                           160
topaz contained titanium of a scarlet colour and transparent.            These had
seven different    forms, some of them very curious, which are figured.
    6. On Crystals and Cavities               in Garnet. — These are very fre
quent, and exhibit very singular phenomena by polarized light. The
cavities are sometimes surrounded by spaces or sectors of polarized
light, indicating that the garnets had             been soft after assuming   their
present forms.
    In  one case, a   liquid or     gas    had escaped from a cavity, and had
left circular crystals of singular beauty.
2. On the      Absolute Zero of the Perfect Gas Thermometer ;
       being a Note to a Paper on the Mechanical Action of
       Heat. By W. J. Macquorn Rankine, Esq.
    Temperature     being measured by the pressure of a perfect gas at
constant density, the absolute zero of temperature is that point on
the thermometric        scale  at which,       if it  were possible to maintain a
perfect gas at so low a temperature, the pressure would be null.
    As   no gas is entirely   devoid of cohesion, the immediate results of
experiment give only approximations                to the position of this absolute
zero.     These approximate         positions approach        nearer  to the true
position as the gas is rarefied.
    The author having       deduced      the true position of the absolute zero
from   M. Regnault's experiments on atmospheric air and carbonic
acid, soon after their publication,           announced the result in the Edin
burgh New Philosophical Journal for                 July  1849, and in the Trans
actions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, vol. xx.
    The present paper gives the details of the method of determina
tion which he adopted, and a copy of the diagram which he used.
    The following were the results arrived at : —
    The absolute zero of the perfect gas thermometer is
      274    6 centigrade, or    "1

    The coefficient of expansion of a perfect gas, in fractions of its
 volume at the temperature of melting ice, is consequently, —

    The following Communications                were read     : —
1. On a simplification of the Instruments employed in Geo
       graphical Astronomy. By Prof. C. Piazzi Smyth.
    These instruments include all of that smaller class employed by
travellers and navigators in determining latitudes and longitudes, and
in making surveys.
    At sea, the only instrument which can be employed, is some form
of the double-reflection instrument, as the sextant, or rather the re
flecting circle  ;  and as this is able to compass all the requirements
which may be     made   of it there, great advantage will result in economy,
portability, and despatch,       if it can  be made also to serve the purposes
of a traveller by land.
    Hitherto, however, this has           been  accomplished but very ineffi
ciently ;  for with all    the   assistance of artificial    reflecting  horizons

                                      162
and stands, —generally of a singularly unpractical character,      — the  re
flecting circle is only enabled to measure inclined        angles and alti
tudes within very circumscribed limits.
    Any traveller, therefore, who wishes       to be prepared for every   op
portunity    for observation, has further to load himself with a theodo
lite for horizontal angles, with a vertical circle for altitudes between
0° and 10°, and     between     60° and 90°; with a transit      instrument
for transit observations   ;  and with   an independent telescope for ob
servations of eclipses, occultations, &c.
    The author, however,    by employing his particular form  of the marine
reflecting circle, viz., the Edinburgh reflecting circle, — which is even
more efficient and convenient at sea than the ordinary form, —and by
placing it on a stand of peculiar        construction, converts  it at once
into an altitude and azimuth instrument         of  a most simple effective
character   ;  capable of being employed as any of the above instru
ments, and with some practical        advantages in facility   of observing
and reading off.
    To this combination, therefore, of the naval circle with         a stand
for land use, he proposed to give the name of the Edinburgh             Uni
versal Instrument,     and hoped that it might facilitate and promote
the observations of geographical astronomy amongst the explorers in
distant lands.
2. On the Mechanical Action of Heat, Section                 VI. : — A   re
       view of the Fundamental Principles of the Mechanical
       Theory of Heat ; with remarks on the Thermic Pheno
       mena of Currents of Elastic Fluids, as illustrating those
       Principles.     By W.      J. Macquorn Rankine, Esq.
     This section contains four sub-sections, the first three of which
constitute a review of the fundamental principles of the Mechanical
Theory of Heat, which        are investigated by a method different    from
any that has been       hitherto    employed  ;  while the fourth   contains
the application of those principles to the determination of the infer
ences    to be drawn    from the recent experiments of       Mr Joule and
Prof.    William Thomson       on  the thermic     phenomena exhibited    by
currents of air rushing through small openings.
    In the First Sub-Section, the author abstains not only from assum
ing any hypothesis respecting the nature of heat, or the constitution

                                            1C3
of matter, but also from taking into consideration the nature, or even
the existence, of any such functi in as temperature.              The theorems
and formulae obtained are simply the necessary consequences                 of the
following
                      Definition of Expansive Heat : —
     Let   the term   Expansive Heat be used to denote a kind of Physi
cal Energy convertible with, and measurable by, equivalent quan
 tities of Mechanical Power, and augmenting the Expansive Elasti
 city   of matter in which it is present.
     The conclusions arrived at are applicable to the mutual transfor
 mation, not merely of heat and expansive power, but, mutatis mu
 tandis, of any two forms of physical energy, known or unknown,                one
 of which is actual, and the other potential.
     Let   a body whose        volume is      V, possess the quantity of heat Q,
 and let its expansive pressure be P. Let it expand from V to V + d V,
 so that the total expansive power developed is P d V.                  Then the
 latent heat      of expansion during this operation, or the heat which
 disappears by being converted into expansive power, is
      The   excess   of this
                                         Ov
                               above the actual power developed, viz.    —
 is expended in overcoming cohesive force.
      When the total quantity of heat in the body increases by d Q, and
                                     ....
 its volume by d V, the amount of heat which it must receive is made
 up of    the following parts      : —
  Heat which remains in the body in its original form, increasing the
      total heat,          .                                     dQ

    If from   this be subtracted the power developed,          PdV,    there re
mains the expression of the energy received by the body on the whole             ;
that is, the difference between the energy received and the energy
given out, viz. —
           d'¥=d      .   Q-Pci V =
                  (1+/-.Q

                                     Q^),a+(QJ|-P),v
    This quantity       is a complete differential,   its integral being
        A.Y     =
                    A.(Q+/.Q
                                         +
                                             (Q^-l)/dv)
    When the expansive power P d V is wholly expended in moving
the particles of the expanding body itself, that motion being ulti
mately extinguished          and converted into heat by friction, the above
quantity,    d Y, represents the entire quantity of heat which the body
has consumed at the end of the process.
    In  a machine producing power by the alternate expansion and con
traction of a body under the influence of heat, let Qt and Q2 repre
sent the greatest and least quantities of heat possessed by the body.
Then,    to work to the best advantage, the body must receive heat and
convert it into expansive power at the constant heat Q1, and give
out heat by compression at the heat Q2, when the ratio of the heat
converted    into power to the total heat expended will be
                                      Q,  -%
                                          Q.
    In  the Second Sub-Section,         the author, still abstaining    from the
use  of any hypothesis, investigates such properties of temperature
as are deducible from the         following
                Definition of Equal Temperatures : —
    Two portions of matter           are said to have     Equal Temperatures,
when neither tends to communicate heat to the other.
    Hence immediately follows a
                                     COROLLARY.
    All   bodies absolutely destitute       of heat have equal temperatures.
    The ratio of the real specific heats of two substances being de
 fined to be the ratio of the quantities of heat which equal weights of
 them possess      at     equal  temperatures,     the following    Theorem    is
 proved   : —

                                           165
   The ratio    of the Real Specific Heats of any pair of                 substances  is
the same    at all temperatures.
   Symbolically,      let r  denote the temperature of a body              ; % the tem
perature of absolute privation of heat             :  ft,   a function of the nature,
and possibly    of the density of the body.             Then the quantity of heat
in unity   of weight may       be expressed       thus —
                             Q = ft         . t   -^      .
                                                            k)
   If this  notation be introduced into the expression for the greatest
proportion of heat convertible into mechanical power by an expansive
         it
                                                     - ^2

                          Qi       Q2    _   4-Ti
that is to say, this ratio is a function merely of the temperatures of
receiving heat,     rv  and   of emitting heat, r2, and independent of the
nature  of the body.      This is Carnot's Theorem, as modified by Messrs
Clausius and Thomson.              The expression for the latent             heat of ex
pansion   becomes
                 dQ                      ^/ .  t                d  r

   Hence, in Professor Thomson's              notation,
which, being introduced into the formula; of the first sub-section, re
produces    all his  formulae.
   In  the   Third Sub-Section, the author points                 out the consequences
peculiar to the Hypothesis          of Molecular Vortices            (that is to say, of
whirling eddies in elastic atmospheres surrounding atomic nuclei) ;
an hypothesis, the first outline          of which    was given by       Sir Humphry
Davy, and which the author adopted, with modifications and additions,
as the basis     of his investigations          in the first five sections of this
paper, in two papers on the Centrifugal Theory of Elasticity, and in
other papers, with a view to the deduction of the laws of heat and
elasticity from the principles          of mechanics.         After pointing out the
resemblances      and differences between this hypothesis and that of
Molecular     Collisions    proposed by Messrs           Herapath and Waterston,
and remarking that the Hypothesis of Molecular Vortices, besides re

                                           166
presenting    successfully     the theory of expansive heat, is consistent
with that of radiant heat and light, and well adapted to form a basis
for that of the elasticity of solids, the author shews, by a method
more simple than those formerly employed by him, that, according
to this hypothesis, the pressure of a perfect gas is represented by
                               P = (NQ         +   A)I
N    and h being specific coefficients.            Let V0  be the volume  of unity of
weight of a perfect gas at a standard pressure P0, and temperature r0 ;
then absolute temperature, as measured by a perfect gas thermome
ter, has this value —
                      r=r0/^=p\(NQA  T A

    The introduction of this value of heat in terms of temperature
into the equations of the first sub-section, reproduces all the formulae
which were deduced directly from the hypothesis in the author's pre
vious researches.     In   particular,       the greatest proportion of heat con
vertible into mechanical power in an expansive engine working                      be

to be drawn from the experiments                 of Messrs Joule and Thomson.

     The cooling effect of a given expansion in atmospheric air,— Ar,
   has been the subject of experiment.          The term
  which represents the heat expended in overcoming molecular attrac
  tion,  is calculated by means     of formulae   deduced      by the author from
  M. Regnault's experiments, with the aid of the hypothesis,                 as well
  as the function by which x is multiplied.          Thus      each   series of ex
  periments supplies data for computing           an approximate         value of x,
  the absolute temperature of total privation of heat. The values of x
  thus calculated from ten series of experiments, range from lo,08 to
  2"-345    centigrade.   The greatest discrepancy           is  therefore    l°-265
  centigrade, which would cause a maximum error of only one three-
  hundredth     part  in calculating    the power of any expansive engine.
  The values of      x are     both largest,   and   agree best together,          for
  those experiments in which        the quantity of air used was greatest,
  and therefore the risk of error least.        The author considers that          the
  experiments prove the formulae deduced from the Hypothesis                  of Mo
  lecular Vortices to be at least sufficiently correct for practical pur
  poses ;   that they afford a strong probability of the theoretical sound
  ness of the hypothesis   ;    and that the position of the absolute zero           of
  heat is nearly as follows     : —
                                                             Centigrade.    Fahren.

          Dr CHRISTISON,               Vice-President, in the Chair.
      The following Communications                  were read    : —
 1. On the Structural Characters                 of Rocks        By Dr Fleming.
      While the condition of the mineral             masses in the neighbourhood
  of Edinburgh furnish interesting illustrations of the structural cha
  racters of rocks, such as the columnar, the concretionary, and the
  fragmentary,      &c., the author proposed to confine his remarks                at
  present to what he denominated the            Flawed Structure.
      In the ordinary language of quarriers, the /laws are termed backs,
  while they are known to masons as dries, and to geologists, when re
 ferred to, as slicken-sides.     This last term, independent of its provincial
 character, refers to one peculiar form of the flaw only, and, although
 explicable according to the same views entertained respecting the
 origin of the others,      is far from being       a typical form.      The flaw of
 the lapidary,    in reference to crystals or gems, comes sufficiently near
 in character    to  justify its adoption.
     The   Flaw     is a crack   which is confined to the stratum or bed in
which it occurs, and is thus distinguished             from   fault or dislocation,
since these extend through             several beds.        It  occupies    all posi
tions in the bed, without an approach to parallelism,               the flaws being
variously    inclined to one another,         and not extending         continuously
throughout the thickness of the bed         ;  thus differing from the columnar
structure.
     These flaws are sometimes isolated           ;  in other cases two unite at

                                                                    5
                                     170
 angles more or less acute, and the junction edges are either sharp or
 rounded.    The surface of the  sides of the flaw  is frequently crumpled
 or waved, and in the granularly-constituted         beds, such as granite,
porphyry, or sandstone, is rough, while in slate-clay, bituminous
shale, and steatite, it often exhibits a specular polish.
     The circumstance of the flaws exhibiting        no approach to paral
 lelism, joined to the fact that they are not prolonged into the inferior
 or superior beds, nay, frequently not extending throughout the bed
containing them, furnish     a demonstration     that they were not       pro
duced by an external force.      The notion, too, is untenable, that the
 polishing was produced by      the faces of the flaw sliding backwards
 and forwards on one another, because       their limited extent,     mode   of
junction, and waved surfaces clearly indicate the absence of any          such
alternate shifting.
     The author then stated his opinion that the flaws had been pro
duced by shrinkage,     owing to the escape of volatile matter, aided       by
 molecular aggregation, ai.d that the polished surfaces were produced
 in comparatively soft plastic matter, like bituminous shale, by the
presence of water or gas in the cavity, so that the specular charac
ter was the casting or impression      of  a  liquid surface.    The    empty
 vesicles  of amygdaloid are occasionally found glossy on the            walls,
 or exhibiting an apparently vitrified film, while the rock itself      is dull
and earthy in fracture.      The smoothness in this instance is probably
produced as    the casting or impress of included vapour or gas. Some
 times the flaws in coarse materials, such as porphyry, have a specular
 aspect, owing to a film   of anhydrous peroxide of iron.        Illustrative
 examples were exhibited, and references to various localities around
Edinburgh, where the whole phenomena of flawed structure                   were
well displayed.
 2. Observations      on the   Speculations of the late Dr Brown,
        and of other recent Metaphysicians, regarding the exer
        cise of the Senses.      By Dr Alison                                 .
     The object of this paper was to recal attention to the celebrated
 controversies on this subject, carried on during the last century ;
 chiefly because some expressions used by     Dr Brown, by Lord Jeffrey,
 Sir James Mackintosh, and M. Morell, convey the impression that
 the doctrines of Reid and Stewart on this essential part of their
  system of Metaphysics, are now generally neglected or abandoned.

                                          171
    The author endeavoured        to shew, on the contrary,        that the existence
and   authority of what Reid called Principles of Common Sense, and
Stewart called Fundamental Laws of Belief, and Brown called Prin
ciples acquired by      Intuition,   as ultimate    facts in the constitution of the
human Mind ; and farther, the necessity of reference to such prin
ciples, in any account that can be given of the information acquir ed
by the     Senses, — is admitted        by all those authors, and must be re
garded as an established first principle in this science.                   He stated
that the only real addition made to our knowledge of this subject
by    Dr Brown,        consisted   in his pointing         out the province      of the
muscular sensations, as distinguished                from those     produced by im
pressions on the cutaneous nerves, in suggesting to us the notions
of the Primary qualities of Matter            ;   and that his doctrine as to the
 manner in which the idea of external                 independent existence is sug
gested to the mind, is substantially          the same as that previously          pro
 posed by     Turgot, and adopted by Stewart,                and strictly consistent
 with the statements of Reid.
     He maintained farther, that when Dr Brown and other more                        re
 cent authors, supposed that they had detected                  an error   in the rea
 sonings    of Reid and Stewart against the scepticism of Berkeley and
 Hume, they had deceived themselves                  ;  first, Because they stated
 the object of Reid to be, to prove, by argument, the independent ex
 istence    of   the material   world, which he had expressly              disclaimed   ;
 secondly, Because they stated the substance of the sceptical argu
  ment to     be merely the     negative proposition,         that that independent
 existence cannot be proved by reasoning ; whereas                 it was the positive
 proposition, that the idea of such independent existence involves an
  absurdity, or contradiction       in terms    ;  and, thirdly, Because they en
  tirely overlooked the fact, on which Reid and Stewart relied, as evi
  dence that the Perceptions,         or notions which the mind forms of the
  qualities    of external objects, can be referred            only to those funda
  mental    Laws of Belief, which all admit             as ultimate facts in this de
  partment of science; — viz., the utter dissimilarity of these Perceptions
  to the Sensations which introduce them                into the mind   ;  from which
  they argued, not that the objects of Perception                have been proved to
  exist by reasoning, but that there is no more absurdity,                or contradic
  tion in terms,     in believing    that they exist, than in believing          in our
  own identity, or in the suggestions           of Memory.
      Lastly, the author maintained, that when Reid's doctrine of Per

                                                                ^^^^^
                                               172
 ceptions, as distinct from Sensations, is duly reflected on, it will                   bfe
found to        involve all the theological           inferences, which Morell        and
others have supposed                to be suggested only by the view      of this     sub
ject which has been taken by some German metaphysicians                         ;   and to
be remarkably           in accordance with        all that has been recently ascer
tained in regard to the connection of the different Mental acts with
the living action of different parts of the Nervous System                  ;   and far
ther, to be quite compatible with the supposition (the evidence of
which he considered as still sub judice) of Perception taking place,
even in this state            of human existence, otherwise than by the ordi
nary exercise of the Senses.

                                     Monday, 2\st February 1853.
      Sir          T. M. BRISBANE, Bart., President, in the Chair.
     The following Communication                                      was read               :   —
On the Summation of                                  a Compound                 Series, and its applica
         tion to a Problem in Probabilities.                                        By the Right Rev.
         Bishop Terrot.
     The series proposed for summation is
              ro — q        .   m — q—         l...m     — g +   p+lxl               .   2       .   3...g
 + m—q—1                    .   m—q—2                    m—     q+p            x 2   .   3       .   4. . .5 + 1

In    which series each line or term is the product of two factorials, the
first consisting of p, the last of q factors of successive numbers. And
in each successive term the factors of the first factorial are dimi
nished each by unity, and the factors of the last increased.
   The method employed to sum this series is to multiply the sum
of all the left-hand factors into the first right-hand factor ; the sum
of all except the first, into the difference between the first and                                                           se
cond of the right-hand factors, and                                  so on ;     thus reducing the series
to the form
             X (m —         q+       1 .     ro— q              m—p+q+ 1) x                          1 .   2   .   3...g — 1

     If this       integration on the one side and differentiation on the other

   This problem gives four varieties, according                                                     as m, the possible
number of experiments, is finite or infinite, and according as results
effected      can or cannot be repeated.                             If we       take the common                             exam
ple of drawing balls, which must be either                                            black or white, from                               a
bag, then results effected                           may be repeated             if       the balls                are   replaced
after being drawn                  ;    if   the balls drawn             are not replaced, then                                    the
same result cannot be repeated.                                 The only     case  of the problem which
the author of this paper has been able to                                    find solved in any treatise
on probabilities,              though he must confess that his range of inquiry
has not been very large, is that where m is infinite,                                                          and the            balls
drawn are replaced.                          His object in his paper                          was to solve the                    case
where m is finite, and the balls are not replaced.
   In this        case        it is manifest that the number of white balls                                                       con

  As this expression                   does not involve m,                            it follows that when the
balls drawn are not replaced, the probability                                                      of drawing              a white
ball at the         p + q+ llth trial, depends entirely upon p and q,                                                       and     is
unaffected by the magnitude of m, whether finite or infinite.
  The last portion of the paper considers                                             the case where m is given,
and the balls drawn are replaced.
  It   is evident that in this case the main point must be to sum the

This was           effected       by a process similar to that used in the last case,

that the earth in question had been discovered                                               by the Duke of Ar
gyll at Knock, near Aros in Mull, and its geological position briefly
described by him to the Society, two years ago.    The author had
undertaken an examination                                   of   it,   and had found            it    to contain,          be
sides                Phytolitharia,          silicified          pollen of grasses and conifera,                          and
spicules and                    gemmules of fresh-water                            sponges, the unprecedented
number of about 60 species of Diatomaceae.                                               He had          consulted        the
Rev. W. Smith, who had                                  observed        in    it   the following 59 species, all
belonging to fresh water, which he named, the names being                                                          those    of
his forthcoming                    Synopsis, and one species which                              he cannot          at pre
sent refer to any known form.

In   has generally the form nearly of a narrow plano-convex lens,                      with
two notches         near the ends of the plane side.              It seems to approach
Eunotia arcus         (Kiitzing), but requires further investigation.                In  the
mean      time,    Mr Smith        proposes to call it Eunotia incisa.
    The       Mull earth      is characterised by the great abundance               of Pin-
nulariae,      Navicular,     and Stauroneides ; by that of Gomphonema co-
ronatum,         of the Cymbelke, of the Himantidia, Eunotiae, and Epi

 Its composition renders it probable that it may be useful as a ma
 nure.        It  may also be made to yield an excellent polishing powder.
     This earth occurs in a hollow,              formerly a small loch in winter
 and a pool in summer, now drained,                 lying in  a rough piece      of ground,
 a mile or a      mile-and-a-half in extent,         between     Loch Baa and the        sea,
 and about 30 or          40   feet above the sea-level.          It rests on gravel, and
 the gravel rests immediately on the granite of the district.                      It is im
 possible to       fix precisely the age of the deposit, but, from the species
 it contains, it is probable that it is not of very recent origin ; while
 yet its epoch must be supposed subsequent to that of the deposition
 of the gravel in which it is found.
     Specimens of the earth, and drawings of a number of the species
 were exhibited        ;  also specimens of polishing            powder made from the
 earth.

2. On the Production of Crystalline Structure in Crystallised
        Powders, by Compression and Traction. By Sir David
        Brewster, K.H., D.C.L., F.R.S., V.P.R.S. Edin.
   The author, after alluding                             of compression and
                                             to the influence                                  di
latation in producing the            doubly refracting structure in solids of                  all
kinds devoid of        it,   and in modifying      it   where    it   exists, mentioned       that
the phenomena to be described have no relation to those alluded to.
   In experimenting on the double reflexion and polarization light                       of
discovered    him in the chrysammates of potash, and magnesia,
                 by
murexide, and other crystals, he found that they could be spread out                            on
glass    by   hard pressure, like grease or soft wax; and that in the                         case
of dark powders,           he could thus obtain         a   transparent film, exhibiting
double reflexion and polarization from its surface, as well as                       if   it   had
been a large crystal.
   In studying        these phenomena under polarized                   light, he found       that
the streaks and lines had axes of double refraction, as well as the film
composed        of them, just      as   if   they were regular crystals.            When       the
substance possessed the new property in perfection, these lines, though
very minute, were not formed of insulated                        particles dragged into             a
line: but the lines of polarized light were continuous, and the crystallo-
graphic as well as the optical axis of the particles, were placed in that
line.      In   other cases, the insulation of the particles was easily                       seen.
   The     substance       may be subjected to pressure and traction, either                    on
smooth or on ground glass, the latter being preferable for hard                               sub
stances.        A   polished and elastic knife          is   used     to give the pressure.
The lines thus formed, examined in the polariscope, exhibit regular
neutral and depolarizing axes. With the chrysammate of magnesia,
the appearances            are   peculiarly     splendid    ;   its natural     colours, which
vary with the thickness, being combined with the tints depolarized                                  by
the streaks.          As     these crystals     are dichroitic,        and possess       unusual
reflexion, so also the streaks exhibit the same;                        the two pencils         be
ing carmine red and pale yellow.
   This property the author has found more or                            less   in the   follow
ing crystals      : —

  In many substances, when subjected to pressure and traction, the
particles exhibit no such arrangement into transparent streaks, as
in the above,        but are merely dragged into lines, and exhibit a qua-
quaversus     polarization.             But there is another class, which yields
transparent        streaks,         without   any trace of prismatic          arrangement.

question.
    On trying certain soft solids which                 possess double refraction, such
as bees' wax, oil of mace, almond soap, and tallow, remarkable results
were obtained.            Almond       soap, the particles      of which are not in        op
tical contact, may be drawn out into strings, and these strings                       possess
neutral and depolarizing axes like the streaks above described.                          This
is done by traction alone.                 Similar results   are obtained   in oil of    mace
and tallow, by compression and traction.                      In   bees' wax,    the    depo
larizing lines are even better displayed, especially                   if a little   common
resin be added.
    It    is not easy to explain            why, in these experiments,          the optical
and crystal lographic axes of the particles are placed in the same line.
Mechanical        force is the   primary agent, but it is possible that elec
tricity may       also   contribute, even in the case of almond soap, to the
result.      In   that case, however, by drawing it out into a thread,                     we
diminish all the lateral obstacles to a crystalline arrangement.                         Ele
mentary prisms, or crystals whose length much exceeds their breadth,
will then tend       to place their long axes            in the line of traction,       and as
the lateral obstructions are removed, the particles                     may follow their
natural tendency.
   We have reason                to suppose,      that in hard substances         the    same
principle acts, and that the particles, when drawn into narrow lines
and freed from lateral attractions, may more readily assume the crys
talline arrangement which is natural                   to them,    and is the result of
certain inherent polarities.
   In     some cases, where the crystalline               arrangement was imperfectly
produced, the author observed a tendency in the particles to quit their
position, as      if they were in          a state   of unnatural tension or      restraint.
This probably        depends on the non-homologous sides               of the   elementary
particles having been brought                 into contact, a condition         quite    com
patible with the existence of neutral and depolarizing axes, provided
the non-homologous sides deviate from their proper                        position either
90° or 180°.             In    that case, polarized         light, directly transmitted,
will exhibit the         same colours as        if   the sides were in the normal po
sition.  But if transmitted obliquely,                   the hemitropism      of the    com
bination, as we may call     will be at
                                     it,               once detected   by the difference
in colour of the two plates.

3.   On the Structure and Economy of Tethea, and on an
        undescribed species from the Spitzbergen Seas.                         By
        Professor Goodsir.
    The author, after     a  brief summary of     the observations     of Donati,
M. Edwards, Forbes, Johnston, and Huxley,                on   various species   of
Tethea, described the structure, and deduced            the probable economy
of a large species apparently        undescribed, some specimens        of which
he had     procured from the Spitzbergen        Seas.
    The following peculiarities of form and structure were minutely
detailed and illustrated     : —
    1.   The turbinated form of      the sponge.
    2.   The partial distribution of the rind.
    3.   The minute pores of the rind, arranged in threes; a pore in
each     of the angles, formed by the primary branches of the six-
radiate spicula.
    4.   The water, instead of passing out by oscula, drains through              a
perforated     or net-work membrane which           lines a number of irregu
larly tortuous grooves on the surface of the attached hemisphere            of the
sponge, — the     grooves   being continuous with deep fissures, which ex
tend    into the rind, and are apparently the result of distension           from
internal growth.
    5.   The silicious spicula are arranged according to the type of the
skeleton in the other Tetheae.       Elongated, slightly bent or twisted rod
like spicula, are combined in bundles by means              of fibrous substance,
and    a few boomerang-shaped spicula, laid crossways.             These bundles
are   arranged irregularly in the centre of the sponge, so as to form a
 nucleus from which radiating        masses extend outwards to the rind, or
 beyond the surface, where the rind is deficient.             The spicula of the
 rind are large and six-radiate.       Their shafts are deeply and firmly in
 serted   into the radiating bundles.       Their three primary branches are
 set at    angles of 120° to tho       shaft, and to one another.        The two
 secondary branches at the extremity         of each primary branch are long-
 pointed,    slightly concave towards the centre of the sponge, and set
 at an   angle of 90° to one another.
    6.   The fleshy mass which envelopes the spicular bundles in the
 interior of the sponge, consists of — 1. Ordinary sponge particles ; 2.
 Caudate particles, probably       similar   to the spermatozoa described      and
 figured by    Mr Huxley in     an  Australian Tethea     ;  3. Ova-like masses,
                                                                   P 2

                                     182
the largest of which envelope a radiating arrangement of anchor-lite
spicula  ;  4. Towards, and in the rind, elongated cellules, apparently
fibrous and muscular, the fibrous connecting            the spicula, and with
the nucleated muscular cellules arranged          transversely as figured by
Donati.
    7. From the structure of Tethea, as well as from the observations
of Donati and    M. Edwards, this group of          sponges  would appear to
possess considerable contractility.

    The following Communication was read : —
 On Circular Crystals. By Sir David Brewster K.H.,D.C.L.,
    F.R.S., V.P.R.S.E, Associate of the Institute of France.
    The author,       after mentioning    Mr Fox Talbot's      observation,       in
 1836, of circular crystals from      a solution of borax in phosphoric acid,
stated, that about twenty years before Mr Talbot's paper was pub
lished, he had obtained circular crystals from oil of mace, and from
a mixture of       that oil with tallow or rosin.     These   circular crystals
are groups of radiating prisms, in optical contact,        so as to appear like
individual crystals.       Viewed by polarized light, they exhibit four
luminous sectors, separated by a rectangular black cross, which
often has its arms so divergent, as to form four dark sectors.               The
arms of the cross are parallel and perpendicular to the plane of pri
mitive polarization.        When a bright disc of ordinary light was looked
at  through these circular spots, there was seen a halo, or two halos,
produced by the crystals of the oil of      mace.    In the case  of two halos,
polarized light     shewed   two sets of four luminous sectors, as far apart
as the halos.       The halos were, in fact, double, being the two images
produced     by the double refraction of the elementary crystals.               In
pursuing the inquiry, the author found that the phenomena were           caused
by circular crystals or groups, varying from invisibility to the         -Q o o  th
or      5 th of an inch in diameter, and when of this size, exhibiting
beautiful luminous sectors in polarized light. Circular crystals are
easily distinguished from those which exhibit true quaquavorsus polari
zation, by using a plate of selenite, which, with the circular crystals,
produces spots or sectors of two different colours,        one a  little lower,
the other    a little higher than the tint of the selenite.
    He next examined        a number    of substances which     yield circular
crystals, particularly the lithoxanthate of ammonia (a salt formed by
the action of ammonia on xanthic oxide), which yields them with more
facility and certainty than borax.        Out of more than 300 substances,
he found upwards of 70 which yielded circular crystals, about thirty

                                          184
being positive,      like zircon,    and forty negative,     like calcareous    spar.
The phenomena observed            are most splendid, and open up a wide field
of research.
    The author next detailed,        and illustrated   with minute and carefully
coloured drawings, these phenomena, as observed in the following
substances,    the most remarkable of the whole number.
    1.  Lithoxanthate of Ammonia. — Here, in the usual specimens,
the light polarized by the sectors is the blue of the first order,
often the white and the yellow of the same order.                  In separate cir
cular   crystals,     other   appearances occur.         In  one,   the three     first
orders of colours appeared exactly as in the coloured rings                  of   uni
axial crystals, proving that the elementary prisms or radii must                 have
increased in thickness from the centre outwards, according to New
ton's law of periodical         colours.      In  others, the second      and third
bands     were   of different      but uniform      colours throughout,     proving
uniform     thickness     all round      in  each  band.     These    colours   were
generally red and green, not at all related to the central tint, or
to one another.          In  some    cases,   the order of colours is inverted.
In   the most perfect crystals, the central tints are the blue and white
of the first order, in consequence of the great minuteness of the                 ele
mentary crystals, which form a more uniform disc, with an exceedingly
sharp black cross.         This central part is surrounded by a narrow black
ring, beyond which is an annulus of sectors, sometimes white, like
the inner ones.         This is terminated by a black circle, beyond which
is a third series of sectors, either white or blue of the first order. The
black cross starts into greater breadth as it passes from one annulus
to the other, from the        inferior degree of optical contact in the        outer
rings.    Various other singular modifications occur in this salt,            which
cannot be      detailed     here.     In   some   cases,  there are large radiant
prisms, all polarizing a golden yellow, and the black cross                 becomes
hardly visible.        In  others, its divergence is so great, that the yellow
sectors   assume     the appearance of a cross.
    In  some    still more complex crystals, there is           seen   one or more
narrow black rings, which arise from the absence                  of matter   where
they appear.
    2.  Salicine.   — This    substance yields splendid discs.         When of     the
 diameter of %\th to Jth of an inch, these tints are of the first and
second orders, and they form objects of singular splendour.                    Here
also, the smaller crystals polarize a bluish white.          The   discs of salicine

                                              185
 are composed       of prisms varying in thickness, and, of course, in tint,
 and have often rims, formed             of   one or two concentric bands, made up
 of radiant bunches, proceeding from the inner margin of the bands,
 and not from the centre of the discs. The large discs exhibit ten,
 twelve,      or more fine concentric lines, which               are lines of cleavage.
 Sometimes       the rim is as wide as the inclosed part, and these polarize
 a   bluish white.
       Asparagine. — This substance yields discs resembling those of
      3.
salicine, but are still more brilliant and beautiful. There are some
discs which       exhibit    no    circular polarization, and others which exhibit
a succession      of black and white narrow rings, like               those     seen round
the star      Capella, with annular apertures.
      4.   Manna.   — This        gives fine negative crystals, both by fusion and
solution.        There is great brilliancy and uniformity of the tints, and
the black cross is so sharp             that its intersection       is not easily seen.
The discs form a united hexagonal mosaic, and have no rims.
     5. Disulphate      of Mercury. — The solution of this salt in nitric acid,
gives, by slow cooling, square crystals             with circular polarization, which
undergo       singular modifications, for which we must refer to the paper.
     6. Parmeline, from alcohol, gives fine circular crystals.
     7.    Palmic Acid, by fusion, gives fine negative circular crystals,
like the mosaic of manna.
     8. Nitrate     of Uranium gives fine negative circular crystals, from
water, alcohol, ether, and oil.
     9. Palmine gives very minute circular crystals.
     10. Chromic Acid gives very peculiar circular crystals,                     composed
of concentric      rippled bands, generally of the blue of the first order.
    11. Berberine gives negative circular discs, resembling                       those     of
oil of mace.
     12.     Sulphuret of Cadmium, dissolved in nitric acid, that                is,   nitrate
of   cadmium, gives beautiful negative circular crystals.
     13.     Sulphate   of   Ammonia and Magnesia. — This salt yields fine
positive circular crystals.
     14. Hatchetine,             Butter, White Wax, Tallow, Adipocire,
                             Cacao
and       all Soaps, and different kinds of Fat, give circular crystals like
oil of mace.
     15.     Borax in Phosphoric Acid. — This salt yielded the circular
crystals described by             Mr Talbot.        This salt,    as well     as nitrate    of
uranium, yields hemispherical bells, under certain circumstances, which

                                                186
polarize light by refraction, and exhibit the black cross, with rings                             of
green and red alternately.                   The author observed these              bells to     be
formed of minute crystals, radiating from the apex of the bell.
      16. Mannite.       — This         substance the author           has   found, since       the
paper was read, to give circular crystals more easily and certainly
than any other.              Those from the solution               in acetic acid         are the
finest.      The black concentric circles, indicating                    absence     of matter,
are peculiarly marked              ;   and the sectors shade off so perfectly into              the
arms of the cross, as to give the discs the appearance of being                            formed
of four solid      cones.         The      discs are sometimes elongated into conical
forms, with the black cross at the summit.                         A   crust of opaque crys
talline matter, that             is,   not in optical contact, often covers them,               and
often breaks off, shewing the circular crystal below.                         The    cones have
frequently two, three, or four black arches crossing them.                               In   some
of the largerdiscs, each successive ring               is   formed of radiating branches,
radiating       from the margin of the ring within.
      17. Oxaturate      of  Ammonia (pure). — This salt, to which                  the author's
attention was called              by   Professor Gregory, gives beautiful                negative
circular crystals, and rarely fails to yield them.                      With weak solutions
the discs are small and exactly resemble those                         of the     lithoxanthate
of ammonia.          Professor Gregory thinks that the two salts are                          iden
tical, but that the lithoxanthate                 contains    a    little colouring       matter.
With strong solutions, the salt yields                  discs often nearly opaque,              but
surrounded by concentric rings                   of marginal       radiations,      of   different
tints.      In   some largo crystals, the central circle consists of green                        of
the second order, with             a    faint black   cross, descending to the white              of
the    first order   ;   the next ring, which          is   separated by      a   narrow      black
band from the first, exhibits the white, which rises to the yellow                                of
the second order, and again descends to the white of tho first, com
pleting the second ring. Three similar rings follow in succession,
and each of the five has               a   uniform tint throughout its circumference,
proving     a    uniform thickness in each band.                   These     crystals, when       a
number are seen in the dark field, are singularly beautiful.                             This   salt
yields cones like those of mannite, and these have, in the centre                                 of
the black cross,         a   second cross bisecting the luminous sectors.
      18.   Hippuric Acid gives fine circular crystals with                       alcohol.       In
these, the radial lines are often divided by black spaces as broad as
the luminous lines     and the whole disc
                             ;                covered with numerous
                                                              is
minute concentric circles, at equal distances from one another.                                 In

                                         187
some cases, the discs consist         of eight or ten sectors of uniform thick
ness, which become         black in the plane of primitive polarization.
   The following is the author's list of substances giving                  circular
crystals.

   In    conclusion, the author offered some observations on the                      forma
tion and destruction of these             discs.     He regarded them         as abnormal
crystallizations,        in which the particles are in unstable equilibrium,               and
have   a   constant tendency to arrange themselves according to their natu
ral polarities.        Hence, circular crystallizations        are apt, after   a   longer or
shorter time, to disappear, the particles either dissolving, or                     assuming
the form of ordinary crystals, lying in all directions, or accumulated
in radial or circular lines.                In oil    of mace, the decomposition             is
effected in      a    night;   in mannite, not for several years.
   The observations recorded in this paper, have occupied                        the author
during the last ten years, and must have an important                           bearing     on
many unsettled questions in molecular philosophy.

     The following Communications                         were read         :   —
1.   On   Nitric Acid             as a source of the Nitrogen found in Plants.
                                    By Dr George Wilson.
   The author, after referring to the opinions of those who contend
that plants derive their nitrogen only from ammonia, shewed, in
justification of the belief, that they also derive that element from
 nitric acid : —
     Firstly, That      nitrates are largely offered to plants, both as they
grow    wild, and      as they are        artificially cultivated.
     Secondly,    That plants            do not refuse the nitrates             thus offered to
them.
     Thirdly, That the nitrates which enter plants                          do not,     if   properly
diluted, do injury to any class of them.
     Fourthly, That nitrates largely promote the growth of the most
important plants.
     Fifthly, That      as chemists are at one            in regarding the chief function
of aplant, considered as a piece of chemical apparatus, to be the de-
oxidation of those oxides, such as water, carbonic acid, and sulphuric
acid,   which enter         it,   they cannot with any consistency deny that nitric
acid, which      is   of the most easily deoxidised of all oxides, must,
                      one
more      easily than the oxides referred to, part with its oxygen, and
give up nitrogen            to the plant.
  Sixthly, That although   would         it             be unwise to be dogmatic on the
phenomena which occur within the                        recesses   of   a   plant, or to affirm
that    it   cannot derive nitrogen                from many sources            ;    yet, according
to the present conclusions                of science,     it   may be reasonably urged,
that the   simplest chemical expression which we can give to our
belief regarding the source of the nitrogen which   so important                is
to plants, must be, that the inorganic                     or mineral representative and
parent of all the nitrogenous constituents of plants, and through them
of animals,     neither ammonia alone, nor nitric acid alone, but the
                 is
compound       of both,       •'.   e., nitrate   of ammonia.

 2.   Observations       on the Amount, Increase, and Distribution
         of Crime in Scotland.          By George Makgill, Esq. of Kem-
                                                            •
         back.
    The author read       some   "  Observations on the Amount, Increase,
 and    Distribution of Crime in Scotland,"          being the results of      an ana
 lysis of the Official Tables of criminal offenders for the ten years
 ending 1850, and of the Prison Board Returns, compared with                        va
 rious statistical data.
    The criminal tables of Scotland confirm,                  in many      important
 particulars,     the observations of       M. Guerry, M. Quetelet,           and   Mr
 Joseph Fletcher, as to the causes of the occasional fluctuations in the
amount of crime, the chief of which appear to be — 1st, Scarcity of
the chief articles      of subsistence      ;  2d, Disturbances      of  commercial
credit, ancTof the labour market          ;   3d, Political excitement.
    Among       the other results of the author's         inquiry are the      follow
ing:—
     1.  The ratio of crime    to population is apparently one-tenth higher
in England than in Scotland         ;  but, —
    2.   In England this ratio has for many years               been   gradually di
minishing, while in Scotland it is rapidly and steadily increasing.
    3. This increase shews itself chiefly in crimes accompanied by
violence, which in Scotland          constitute 40 per cent, of the total of
fences recorded, while in       England they are only 14 per             cent.
    4. This excess and increase are chiefly remarkable                  in the agri
cultural, pastoral,     and thinly-peopled       districts of the Border,        where
aggravated crimes against tho person are greatly more common                         in
proportion      to population,  than in the densely- crowded manufacturing
counties of the west.        In Berwick       and Roxburgh, crime of all         kinds
has increased more rapidly in the last ten years, than in any                     other
part    of the country     ;  while   in Lanarkshire the augmentation               has
been    trifling, and in Renfrew the number has actually diminished.
An analogous fact has        been observed in regard to England.
    5. Looking, however, not to the ratio of increase, but to the ab
solute amount        of crime in proportion to population, the highest
counties are still those in which mining industry is found in conjunc
tion with factory labour, with the exception of Ayr and Fifeshire.
    6.   There    does not appear to be any marked            coincidence between
the excess of crime and that of pauperism.

                                        191
     7.  The counties in which the number of licensed             spirit-shops is
greatest    in proportion to population,      are all distinguished for the fre
quency     of crime ; while those in which they are fewest are, with                a
single exception,     greatly below the average of crime.
    8.  Excess in the proportion        of real property     to population    is, in
general,    accompanied by excess of crime.
     9.  Eight out of the ten counties which stand highest in the list
of serious crime, exhibit a proportion of school attendance consider
ably above the average       of the country    ; while of the counties in which
crime is rarest, all but two are greatly below the general educational
standard.
     10.   The per-centage of female criminals         is much    larger in Scot
land than in any European country of which the records are pub
lished.      In  France, the number of females in           each 100    culprits is
 15; in England, 19; and in Scotland, 28.
     11. A marked decrease in the number of juvenile offenders in
the large towns has been        going    on for the last   six or  seven years.
     12. There is a remarkable        uniformity from year to year in the
 results of criminal proceedings      ;  the proportion of convictions to trials
 never    having varied in the last four years more than one per cent.
     13.   The number of sentences under the aggravation of previous
 conviction     has been   steadily   and rapidly increasing         for  the    last
 fifteen years ;   indicating either greater efficiency of the police, or
 insufficiency in the character of punishment.
      14. In the last half of the ten years under review, the number of
 cases   in which insanity has been successfully pleaded in bar of trial,
 is more    than double what     it was   in the first half ; and the number
 of accused who have been found insane on trial, has multiplied nearly
 to the same
                 extent.)
     The author concluded by regretting that the deficiency of statis
 tical materials    in Scotland, and in particular the total want of a sys
 tem of registration, prevented the extension of the inquiry to many
 subjects of great public interest.

            JOHN CAY, Esq.,            Advocate, in the Chair.
     The following Communications            were read     : —
 1.   Notice of recent Measures of the Ring of Saturn.                         By
                       Professor C. Piazzi Smyth.
     This communication chiefly described the observations             made     by
 W. S. Jacob, Esq., of the Madras Observatory, during the             last appa
 rition of the planet, with    a telescope  having a six-inch object-glass,
lately completed by Lerebours        and Secretan.
     Previous to its being sent to India, the object-glass had been tested
at the Edinburgh Observatory ; and its quality, which was then ap
proved, had been more conspicuously brought out in the subsequent
trial in   a clearer climate.
     Immediately    after the receipt of the object-glass, in September
 1852,   Mr   Jacob directed it to Saturn, then in the zenith, and im
mediately perceived the
                             " transparency"    of the dark ring      which    has
since been discovered independently        by Mr   Lassel    and others;       and
on very accurately adjusting       the focus, he saw a fine division in        the
outer dark ring.       This appears   to have escaped   all other      observers
at the same time, except perhaps         Mr Dawes, who had some            suspi
cions of such a phenomenon. But         Mr Jacob saw it clearly for        all the
rest of the apparition of the planet, could trace it
                                                          through more        than
half the circumference of tho ring, and was enabled to
                                                                       get    good
measures of it with the wire micrometer.
     Such  a fine division of the outer ring has not unfrequently             been
suspected    before, and even seen, but only on one or two special        nights,
by each observer, and then merely through a very small part of                  the
circumference at tho anste.
    Mr Jacob's    observations, therefore, establish the fact permanently
among the phenomena of the planet's appearance, and lead us to ex
pect more still from him, when, as will be the case in a few years,
the ring of Saturn is presented to our view at its maximum
                                                                            angle
of inclination.
    The author then concluded with an account of the most
                                                                        probable
theory with regard to the material and economy of the
                                                                            rings,
which he conceived      to be fluid and vaporous, and
                                                              indicating,     with

                                        193
a  certain variation, due, perhaps, to a magnetic or diamagnetic con
dition, the appearance       of the earth in what         Mr Nasmyth         calls its
"pre-oceanic"     state; when, still incandescent, the ocean could find no
resting-place    on its surface, but would have been compelled to form
a dense    vapour envelope in the atmosphere           ;  of frozen particles out
side, by reason of the coldness         of space, and    of watery vapour inside,
from    the radiation of heat from the hot internal globe.
           2. Chemical       Notices.       By Professor Gregory.
1.   On the new compounds         of Cobalt described       by  Fr4my and others.
     Claudet in London, and Genth in Germany,                 about the same time
observed a new compound           of cobalt, with the elements of ammonia
and chlorine.       Fremy, about the        same time, announced          a far more
extended     investigation, the result of which was the discovery of no
less than five series      of salts, in  some   of which     the base, with oxygen
acids, was formed of oxides         of cobalt along with more or         less ammo
nia, and, with hydrogen         acids, was formed of cobalt with             more or
less   ammonia.      In  other series, salts of oxides of cobalt, for the most
part previously unknown          oxides of this metal, seem to have combined
 with    more or less      ammonia.       I   shall not enter farther        into any
 details of the views       of Fremy,      in regard     to   many of these       salts,
 which are very complicated, and confessedly provisional.                 But   I have
 made some experiments          on the formation      and analysis of two of the
 most remarkable of the salts described by him, one of which belongs
 to the series   of Roseocobaltiak,      the other to that of Luteocobaltiak.
 Both are chlorides or hydrochlorates,           and the former,        or the pink
 salt, is the same      as was described by Claudet           and Genth.        I  find
 that both   this and the other — which is yellow, a very unexpected fact
  in compounds of cobalt — may easily be obtained by dissolving proto-
 chloride   of cobalt in water, adding sal-ammoniac               and an excess       of
 ammonia, and passing chlorine through the solution,                till the chlorine
 is in excess.     It  then deposits a mixed mass of pink and yellow salt,
 which may be separated by the greater              solubility   of the yellow salt
 in water very slightly acidulated with hydrochloric acid, in which the
 pink salt is almost insoluble.         The yellow salt may         bo obtained       in
 large and fine crystals        by spontaneous evaporation.            When large,
 the crystals are     of  a deep orange-red, but the powder and the small
 crystals   are bright orange-yellow.            The red salt is sparingly           so
 luble in hot water, which, on cooling, deposits              it in dark    red   crys

                                                 194
 tals of small size.           It  is generally obtained, however, as          a crystalline
 powder of a fine pink colour,                  as it is usually rapidly      formed, and
 deposited too quickly to form regular crystals.
    The chemists who             have analysed the red       or pink salt are not agreed
 as to its composition, for while Claudet found it to contain no oxy
 gen and no water, Fremy admits 1 eq. of water, and Genth con
 siders it as a compound of sesquioxide of cobalt, ammonia, and                          chlo
 rine.       I  have made a number of analyses of this salt,                   prepared       in
different ways, and when it has been slowly ignited in a current of
hydrogen, to determine the cobalt which is left in the metallic                         state,
I have       not in any case obtained a trace of water.                 Consequently        the
salt cannot have the formula given to it by either Genth or Fremy.

    It   is very difficult to form any distinct             idea of the rational for
mula, whichever empirical one we adopt.                     The  most interesting point
is this, that from this compound analogous ones with oxygen                              acids
may be formed, and that from these, by the action of alkalies,                         a base
may be        separated, although it         has not yet been isolated        in  a state of
purity, which appears             to consist   of ammonia plus some oxide of cobalt.
If such        bases  exist, they will probably, like other oxidised bases,
yield, with hydrochloric              acid, water and chlorides,       and thus our         red
salt would be the chloride of the radical, which, with oxygen, forms
the base in the oxidised salts.                  But we must not dwell on possibili
ties  ;  and my object is to shew, first, that the red compound                    does not,
as  Fremy        states, contain oxygen (at least that which          I  have examined),
and that        before  we    can   speak with confidence as to its true formula,
we must have more certainty                 as to the empirical     one.
    With regard         to the yellow salt, this, according to          Frémy,     contains

                                                        195
no oxygen,             and     1    eq.    of ammonia              more than the red salt.                     My
results lead to the same conclusion,                                so    that its empirical             formula
appears to be Co2 Cl3 Ne H18, or Co2 Cl3 + 6 NH3.     It also forms
salts with oxygen acids, and from these an oxidised base may be se
parated, but has not been fully studied.
     All the three            authors who have preceded me describe the crystals of
the red      salt   as regular octohedrons,and they must be very nearly so; but
Sir D. Brewster informs                       me that they do act to a small extent on po
larized light, in which case they cannot belong to the regular system.
     Fremy, differing from Genth,                            also    describes the yellow                salt as
forming regular octohedrons.                           But this           is,
                                                                           I       think,    a   mistake   ;   for,
as   far as  I      have examined them, they appear to be prismatic.                                       Genth
describes         the crystals as rhombic or klino-rhombic.
2. On the           Acid formed when Potash acts                            on   Oil    of   Bitter Almonds.
      When commercial oil of bitter almonds                                 is   mixed with an excess of
an alcoholic solution of potash, there                             is    formed, instead of benzoine,
a    salt, crystallising in scales, which are very soluble                                    in   alcohol. This
salt    is   said in books to be               benzoate of potash. And when                         decomposed
 by    acids,     it   yields an acid which, to all appearance,                               is   benzoic acid.
But     it   is   worthy of notice, that                  if      we form benzoate              of potash with
common            benzoic acid, the salt               is   hardly at all soluble in hot alcohol,
 and does not crystallise                     in the same way as the salt above mentioned                         ;
indeed can hardly be got to crystallise                                  at all.   I     have made         many
experiments to ascertain the cause                of this strange difference, but                               I
have as yet been                unable to detect it.  The salt    exhibit has been I
 three times recrystallised from alcohol, and                               is   as soluble as ever; while
 yet the acid extracted from                     it    appears identical                 with      benzoic acid.
 Its analysis, indeed,                  does not perfectly agree with that                     of benzoic acid,
 but the difference                is   so slight, as not to affect the formula.
      Is   it   possible that the presence of some foreign matter communi
 cates     to the potash salt the property of solubility                                 in alcohol, and that
 of crystallising             readily     ?    But   if     so,    the more        it   is   purified,   the less
 soluble      it   should become.                This  I      have not found to be the case.                    I
 rather suspect that the acid                     is   not truly benzoic acid, and that                   a    more
 minute investigation                   will   detect its true nature.                   Its resemblance         to
 benzoic acid   certainly very striking, but we know that homologous
                         is
 compounds, although different in composition, often resemble each
 other       in   as great      a   degree.

            3. On a spontaneous Metamorphosis             of Alloxan.
    I have found that alloxan forms two kinds of hydrated crystals.
Those, with six eqs. of water,         are large,    regular,   transparent,       and
do not readily effloresce in the     air, nor undergo any change        when kept.
But there     is another form much more frequent,           which,    according to
my analysis, contains seven or possibly eight eqs. of water.                It forms
large but irregular masses, with their sides graduated like steps,                 and
effloresces    on exposure to the    air very readily.      I  rather think this
kind forms in solutions which are slightly acid from free nitric                 acid,
which is likely to be the case in preparing alloxan.              When     placed in
stoppered    bottles, and exposed to the natural changes of temperature
in summer, these crystals became partially liquified, and after a year
or two    I found the contents of several bottles entirely changed.                    A
very large part had become nearly insoluble in cold water, and                       the
solution filtered from this part deposited, on evaporation,            first,   small
colourless crystals ; secondly, a crystalline and yellowish mass; and,              last
of all, the  little remaining liquid dried    up into a tough semi-crystalline
mass, which became        pink  on exposure to the      air of the laboratory.
    I find the insoluble, or sparingly       soluble matter, to be pure allox-
antine.     The next crystals are quite distinct, both in form and pro
perties, and the following portions exhibit also characters of their own.
No alloxan has appeared. But since the difference between alloxan
and alloxantine is simply that the latter contains one eq. of hydro
gen more than the former,          then the    other substances       must      either
contain less hydrogen than alloxan, or,          if the hydrogen has       been de
rived from water, they must contain more oxygen.              I regard    the latter
as the   probable case, and     I rather think that the new product or            pro
ducts are   of   an acid nature.     But   I have   not yet been able to obtain
them pure      ;  and if I had, the difference in composition is so small,
that analysis will hardly suffice to make sure of it.             We must      there
fore have recourse      to the difference   of properties, and here all           that
I  have as yet been able to do is to ascertain that besides alloxantine,
at least one, but probably two substances have been formed, different
both from alloxan and from alloxantine, as well as from all the allied
compounds with which         I am  acquainted    ;  and that one   if  not both of
these are acid compounds.          The investigation is one of          very great
difficulty,   from the   tendency of all these compounds to be          altered by
contact   with other substances,      or by heat,     and from the great simi
larity in the properties of many of them.

                                            197
     One useful     hint which the chemist may derive from these observa
tions is,   that if he wishes to preserve alloxan, it ought to be got in
the    anhydrous form, which            is done      by evaporating   its solution at
140° or 150°, when anhydrous crystals                   alone are deposited in the
warm solution, which is poured               off and further evaporated,     as long as
it yields    crystals.      It is apt to be decomposed       at higher temperatures.
       3.  Observations         on the    Structural Character of Rocks.
                            Part II.       By Dr Fleming.
     In proceeding       to consider    still farther the physiology of rocks,      the
author proposed           in this communication          to confine himself     to the
 illustration of
     1. The    Columnar Structure. — After enumerating examples of this
 structure,    as occurring in the neighbourhood of Edinburgh, in cannel
 coal,    sandstone, clay,        ironstone,     clinkstone,  claystone, greenstone,
 and basalt,     he exhibited examples of similar appearances in oven soles
 and    fragments of the walls of vitrified forts. The ordinary explana
 tion of this structure        as the result     of cooling from a state of fusion
 he pointed out as unsatisfactory, even in the case of basaltic pillars,
 and inapplicable to similar appearances               as occurring in sedimentary
 rocks.      He considered the whole phenomena explicable                 as connected
  with one cause, viz.,         shrinkage,      arising from the escape of aqueous
  or volatile    matter.
      2. The Cone      in Cone Structure. — Examples of this structure occur
 in impure      ferruginous limestone at Joppa, the Water of Leith, and
 other places,      in connection with the coal measures.             The author    re
 ferred the origin of this structure to shrinkage, conjoined with a cer
 tain    amount of molecular aggregation, or crystallising              influence.
          4. Some Observations              on   Fish, in relation to Diet.
                                   By Dr John Davy.
      In this communication the attention of the author                  is chiefly di
  rected to two subjects         of inquiry   : —
      lit,  The comparative nutritive power of fish, taking                the specific
  gravity of    their substance,      and the proportion      of solid matter left on
  thorough     drying,     as a measure         of the  same.    In illustration,  two
  tables   are given,     containing the results of trials on several kinds of
  fish   and other articles of animal food ; from which he deduces that

                                       198
the difference of nutritive power of these several articles,          has com
monly been overrated.
   Idly, The peculiar qualities of fish, if any,       as articles  of diet.    On
this head, excusing himself from entering into details from want                  of
sufficient data, he expresses     the opinion that fish, as diet,        are not
without specific power, conducive to health, and the prevention                   of
certain diseases,     especially   scrofula,   pulmonary    consumption,        and
goitre.    He    founds this opinion partly on      experience, — the    absence
or comparative       rarenesss of these      diseases  amongst people         using
such a diet   ;   and partly on the circumstance,       that iodine in minute
quantity enters into the composition of sea-fish, having found               traces
of it in every instance of these fish in which he has specially sought
for it ; an opinion, moreover, he thinks strengthened by the fact, that
the same element, iodine, exists in cod-liver oil, which has proved               so
serviceable,    if not in curing,   at least  in mitigating    pulmonary       con
sumption.

   The following Communications              were read   : —
   1.   Remarks on the Torbanehill Mineral.                By Dr Traill.
    The Torbanehill mineral is      so very peculiar  that  I cannot call it
either   a bituminous    shale or a coal, to both of which it has a con
siderable resemblance.
    After comparing it carefully with a great variety of English and
Scottish coals, and with many varieties of bituminous shale,         I con
clude that it is a mineral hitherto undescribed by systematic miner
alogists, and propose for     it the name of Bitumenite.
    It  appears to me to have been        formed by the impregnation      or
injection of shale with liquid        bitumen.    Its colour is blackish-
brown.      Its specific gravity = l-284.
    I  compared it carefully    with several specimens of English cannel
and common coal, and with thirteen varieties of Scottish         parrot or
cannel coal, and other coals of this kingdom,        from all of which     it
differed much in mineralogical characters.

     1. When its thin edges are examined by a strong light, or                  when
 very thin slices are inspected in the usual way,               it  is translucent,
 transmitting      a reddish-brown     light, whereas coal is      opaque on the
 thinnest edges.
     2.   Its fracture, though conchoidal, is perfectly dull              in every
 direction.
     3.   Its streak   is not shining,   but quite dull.
     4.   It changes    colour strongly in the streak, which exhibits          a dis
 tinct pale ochre yellow.
      5.  It breaks with some difficulty, especially in the cross          fracture,
 and exhibits some degree of elasticity.           It  is, therefore, not brittle.
     6.   It  ignites very readily,    and gives out much        light;   but when
 this expires,     as it  soon does, the remaining    mass with great difficulty
 affords the redness of ignition,       as observed   in coal under similar       cir
 cumstances;       and it retains its form, though it becomes white            by in
 cineration.
         It consists   of volatile matter from 72-5 to 84-1 per cent.
                           White solid residue, 27-5      to 15 9
 It  affords a large quantity of fine combustible gas, and also,              on dis
 tillation, yields much parajfine.
     It  occurs in a bed in the coal formation,       associated with shale       and
 ironstone, in the county of Linlithgow, near Bathgate.
     The Central Board of Customs of the German Zollvereuvassisted
 by the principal mineralogists of Berlin, have, since this paper was
written, decided that the Linlithgowshire mineral              is not a coal, and
 may be imported duty-free, which coal is not.
 2.   Notice of the Blind Animals which inhabit the Mammoth
             Cave of Kentucky.            By James Wilson, Esq.
     The author commenced with              a general    sketch of the natural
character and condition of the great cave, as it is the peculiarities               of
their local position which constitute the most remarkable                feature in
the history of the animals by which it is inhabited.                     The     cave
descends     through     the uppermost rocks of the        " Barrens "     to   those
which are nearly or quite upon             a  level with    the Ohio.       Though
called a cave, it is in fact a series of underground galleries,             branch
ing from and inosculating with each other in various directions,                  the

                                       201
  total length     of windings   being almost     incalculable,    and even the
  direct distance from the entrance to the       termination extending many
  miles.     The temperature of these inland galleries is uniformly 59°
  of Fahrenheit all the year round ; and a current of air is very per
  ceptible near the mouth,       proceeding outwards or inwards according
  as the  temperature of the external air is greater or less than that of
 the subterranean region.       The air within is uniformly pure,      even exhi
 larating   ;  and this is attributed in a large measure to the great beds
 of nitre which disengage oxygen during the formation of nitrate of
 lime.     The general boundaries of the caverns are of limestone.
     Of the mammiferous animals described as inhabitants of                  these
 caverns,     there are two species of bat and one species            of rat, the
 latter being confined to, and characteristic        of, the locality.     If  not
 blind, its organs    of vision are very defective.
     Two species of fish were noticed, of one of which, Amblyopsia
tpelaus of Dekay, specimens were exhibited.                It is totally blind,
possessing not      even rudimentary    organs of sight,       dissection having
shewn that the optic nerve, and other essential parts, are wanting.
    Of   the crustaceous tribes a blind cray-fish,       Astacus pellucidus of
Tellkampf, was exhibited.          The peduncle of the eye exists, but the
actual    organ of sight is absent.         The observance of this eyeless
peduncle had misled some observers          into the belief that the creature
was   not blind.
    Various kinds of arachnides,       of true insects, and of animalcular
species, the      majority of them quite blind, were then noticed in the
order   of their position in systematic arrangements.
    The author      concluded by referring to the difficulties which beset
the theoretic question, as to whether these creatures were blind from
their   creation,    or whether certain    species,   originally endowed with
sight, had wandered by some mischance into those darksome depths,
and in the course      of  ages had lost the organs of a sense,         the func
tions of which they could no longer exercise.

1.    Additional observations on the Diatomaceous Earth of
       Mull, with a notice of several new species occurring in
           it,
           and Remarks on the value of Generic and Specific
       Characters in the Classification of the Diatomaceaa.                                    By
       William Gregory, M.D., Professor of Chemistry.
   The author, after mentioning his previous communications on                                this
subject, stated, that continued investigations of the deposit                                 had
yielded the extraordinary                   number of about 150 species of Diatoma
ceae,   and that as several of these had been only recently observed,                          it
was nearly certain that more yet remained.
      Of    these species,          from 12 to 15 appear to be undescribed,                 and
there are also             7   or   8   new to Britain,         or not hitherto    admitted    as
British         species.
      The following list contains the                 names      of 118 known     and described
species occurring               in the    Mull deposit —    :

Eunotia bigibba           a number     of striking varieties were figured, and
compared with several varieties of Himantidium bidens, with which
it had hitherto been confounded.
     The author then          proceeded  to describe     and illustrate by figures
the following species, most of which are new to science                   : —

10.          „        tenuis, ». »p.                 some doubt, to this species, lately
                                                     established by Mr Smith.
     Having thus described about 140                    species    in the   above    three
categories, the author             stated, that some additional         forms,    not yet
precisely determined, would have to be added to each                     ;  and he next
proceeded        to make some          general remarks      on   the value of generic
and specific characters in the Diatomaceae.
     He    showed      that some genera had been established on apparently
insufficient grounds           ; thus, Eunotia is separated from Himantidium,
because the latter occurs in chains, the former solitary.                   But Eunotia
tetraodon is found in chains, both alive and in this deposit ; and if
we transfer         it to Himantidium, we separate it from Eunotia Dia-
dema, to        which it is so closely allied.          The author concluded that
these two genera should be united.
      Again, Cocconema is separated from Cymbella by the former
having a stipes, the latter not.                    But this seems a very slight
foundation for a genus where the frustules cannot otherwise be dis
tinguished,         as  in this   case ; and here      also the author would unite
the two genera.
     In   regard to specific characters,            the author showed that those
usually resorted to, such as form, size, number,                      and arrangement
of    striae, &c., are subject,          in certain species, to almost unlimited
variation,        of which he gave a striking example in Eunotia triodon,
and others in Pinnularia divergens, Eunotia bigibba,                       and Himanti
dium bidens.             In  other cases, again, the species never varies except
to a small         degree     in size.     This was shown       in Eunotia      tetraodon
and    E. Diadema, and mentioned                as occurring      in Epithemia gibba,
Navicula serians, Amphora ovalis, Pinnularia alpina,                         P. lata,  and
many others.             It  therefore    appears that the tendency in a species
to vary may be regarded as itself a specific character,                      as may also
 the absence of this tendency.
     With       regard     to the actually      admitted genera and species,            the

                                      207
author expressed the opinion,         that  so   long as new forms are daily
discovered     (and that this is the case he proved by many recent ex
amples), we are liable to err in establishing both genera and species.
He therefore recommended the collection and figuring of all such
forms as appear distinct, to which, of course, provisional names must
be   given, with a view to the future employment of these materials,
when new forms        shall have become       rare,   in ascertaining    the true
natural groups, whether generic or specific.
    The author took occasion, from the occurrence of the permanence
of characters above alluded to in many species, to combat the view
of Professor     Kiitzing, according to whom,        species, as natural groups,
do   not exist.
    Finally, he stated, that the remaining forms would               be described
in a future communication.
   2.  On the Physical Appearance of the Comet 3, of 1853.
                         By Prof. C. Piazzi Smyth.
     Referring to the general descriptions which had              been  published
in scientific journals and elsewhere of the appearance of this comet,
the author pointed out,      — 1st,  That the colour which had         been  attri
buted to    it  was merely the adventitious        tint  due  to the twilight at
mosphere through which          it was   seen.     2dfy, That what had        been
described as the nucleus of the comet, and of           so  many thousand miles
in diameter, nine days before the perihelion passage, was merely the
head, composed of the same light, vaporous transparent matter as the
tail ; and subject to the same remarkable compression                and conden
sation on approaching the sun.
     This condensation had not      been sufficiently attended to by comet-
ary observers     ;  but, nevertheless, rendered it absolutely necessary, in
giving the size of any comet,       to state    at what part of its orbit the
body might be at the time.          The now well recognized fact of           such
condensation,       combined,  of course,      with the stronger illumination
of the sun at     a less distance, also gave the best,      if not  the only, suf
 ficient explanation     of the remarkable increase in brightness of         some
comets about the time of their perihelia.
      Moreover, the accurate observation of the amount of such con
 densation, depending as it does mainly on the proportion between
 the aphelion      and perihelion   distances, might lead in many cases to

                                        20S
 an approximate knowledge of the former important               element,     which
 is generally indeterminable        from ordinary     observations at     a single
 apparition.
    No very careful measures appear to have            been made     of the   com
 pression experienced by the present comet          ;  but contrasting     such as
 have been procured      during a month before the perihelion            passage,
 with  Mr Hartnup's      important daylight observation on that occasion,
 a period may be anticipated       of certainly more than 180        years.
                        Tuesday, 3d January 1854.

 On the supposed Sea-Snake, cast on shore in the Orkneys in
    1808, and the animal seen from H.M.S. Daedalus, in 1848.
    By Dr Traill.
    The discussions which      arose about four years ago on the animal
reported     to   have   been   seen   on 6th    August     1848,    by Captain
M'Quhae, the officers and crew of H.M.S. Daedalus, in the                   South
ern Atlantic, between the Cape of Good Hope and St Helena, about
300 miles off       the African   shore,  recalled my attention      to the    ma
terials  I  had collected respecting the vast animal           cast ashore       on
 Stronsey, one of the Orkneys, in 1808.
    I was not there at the time, but copies          of the depositions       made
by those who had seen and measured it were transmitted to me by
order of Malcolm Laing, Esq., the historian of Scotland, on                  whose
property it was stranded      ;  and   I obtained other notes      from several
individuals resident in Orkney.
    The evidence of the most intelligent          persons who had seen          and
measured the animal was carefully           collected, and copies of it were
transmitted by      Mr Laing to Sir Joseph Bankes, and other             natural
ists.   Soon    afterwards Mr Laing sent, through his brother,            the late
Gilbert Laing Meason, to the museum of our university the skull
and several vertebrae.       The cartilaginous omoplates, to which a por
tion of the pectoral fin, or wing,        as  it was termed    by the natives,
were afterwards sent to      Edinburgh, where      I saw  and examined them.

                                                 209
      Two of the     vertebrae        were transmitted                to me, with portions             of
what was termed         the mane of the animal                    ;   which     I   now exhibit.
      The dead animal was             first   observed       by some fishermen                   lying on
a sunken     rock, about a quarter of a mile from Rothiesholm-head                                  ; but
in a few days a       violent gale from the S.E. cast it on shore in a creek
near the     headland, where it remained for some time tolerably entire                                   ;
and it was      subsequently broken up by the fury of the waves.                                   Before
it was thus        broken into several pieces                it       was   examined, and mea
sured by     several intelligent          inhabitants of the island                  ;    and their tes
timony,     collected as above            stated, was        forwarded to London, Edin
burgh, &c.          Their    declarations         were, however, accompanied by a
very absurd        suppositious drawing of the animal, which was thus pro
duced.       Many     days   elapsed ere the tempestuous weather allowed
any    communication with other islands                  ;   and when the storm abated,
a young man         was sent from             Kirkwall by Mr Laing, to collect what
information        he could on the subject.               But by this time the body of
the    animal      was completely broken                 up.  This lad, who was no
draughtsman,         and ignorant of Natural History, endeavoured, from the
descriptions       of those who had           seen the animal most entire, to delineate
with chalk on a table a figure                   of the animal.
                                                The rude figure so
produced was transferred  by pencil to paper, and copies of it were
handed about as real representations of the animal.
      That it had a general resemblance to the animal was admitted by
those who       had seen     it   ;   but from the accounts                 I   afterwards obtained,
it would appear that the        jointed legs, which the lad had attached                                to
it,   are creations    of his own imagination.
      The appendages, which gave                 rise to this strange representation,
were     never called legs by those who saw                           the animal, but were de
nominated        by them wings,               or fins,   or swimming                     paws.     " That
nearest the head was broader                    than the rest, about four-and-a-half
feet   in   length, and was edged all round with bristles or fibres, about
ten    inches    long."      The      "   lower jaw was wanting                     when     it   was cast
ashore, but        there remained cartilaginous                       teeth in portions             of the
jaws."       Before    it   was discovered putrefaction                         had commenced, es
peciallyin the fins. The animal had       long and slender neck, on
                                                             a
which there were two spiracles on each side.
      The wings would seem to have been the remains of fins, altered
by     incipient    decomposition.             The six may perhaps                        be remains    of
pectoral,     abdominal, and anal fins, and perhaps they may have been

                                                   210
placed, like those of some of the shark                               family, farther       from the
centre of the abdomen than in ordinary fishes.                               Indeed        one of the
witnesses       states that       "    the wings of the animal were jointed to                     the
body nearer the ridge of the back than they appear in the drawing."
   The portion of the anterior fin or wing, which                           was attached to the
omoplates, consisted of cartilaginous rays                        ;    and when such a struc
ture of fin is partially separated by commencing decomposition,                                    the
rays might easily, to the eyes of the uninitiated                            in natural       science,
seem like toes or fingers.
   Even the great Cuvier admits this resemblance, when                                     describing
the fins of fishes : —
   " Des rayons plus                   ou    moins nombreux soutenant de                    nageoires
membraneuses, representent grossierement                              les doigts, des       mains,   et
des pieds."
  As much of the value of the descriptions of the Orkney                                        animal
rests on the character and credibility                      of the individuals             who saw it
most     entire,       I    may be permitted             to state that        I personally        knew
the     three     principal           witnesses,      Thomas          Fotheringhame,            George
Sherar,      and William               Folsetter,   to    be men        of excellent       character,
and of remarkable intelligence.    They were not ignorant fishermen,
as the witnesses were represented to be ; but two of them were of
the better sort of farmers in that part of Orkney ; and the first and
the last of them were also very ingenious                              mechanics, much           accus
tomed to the use of the foot-rule,                          the       instrument      employed       in
measuring the animal.
   They were men of such honour, intelligence, and probity, that I
can have no doubt of the correctness of any statement they made of
their impressions of what they had                       so carefully      observed.
   It   was, therefore, not without                   surprise,        that some months           after
these accounts were sent to                    London,      I   read a paper by            Mr    Home
(afterwards        Sir       Everard),        in which       he       recklessly    sets    aside the
evidence     of the persons who                 saw      and measured the animal in                  its
most entire condition, as to its dimensions of length and thickness                                      ;
and maintains              that   it   was    nothing     but a Basking shark                (Selache
maximum         /),   which he supposes the love of the marvellous had                            mag
nified so enormously in the eyes of those whom he                              is   pleased to     call
" ignorant              Unfortunately for Home's hypothesis, the
           Jishermen."
Basking shark was probably far more familiar to those men than                                       to
himself  for
         ;      often captured among the Orkney islands and its
                   it   is                                                                  ;

                                            211
length and proportional thickness are so totally different from the
animal in question, that the two could scarcely bo confounded, by
the most      "                            " who had ever
                 ignorant fishermen                             seen them.
    These witnesses assert that the Stronsey animal (though a portion
towards the tail was broken off when they took its dimensions)
measured no less than fifty- five feet in length                ;  whereas that of the
largest Basking shark of which                 we    possess   any accurate account,
scarcely     exceeds    thirty-six    feet.
    The circumference of the two animals                   is no less widely different.
My    notes state the circumference at the thickest part of the body of the
Orkney animal         to be about ten feet         ; while it tapered much towards
the head and         the  tail  ;  whereas the circumference of a large Bask
ing shark, where thickest, is not less than twenty feet. Besides, the
shark-like figure of the latter could scarcely be confounded with the
eel-like form of       the Stronsey       animal.*
    The mane,         as  it  is   termed,     may perhaps be the remains of a
decomposed dorsal fin          ;  but the fibres do not seem to be the rays of
 a fin  ;  and the animal seen from the Dcedalus is stated to have had
 a mane, floating about like sea-weed                 ;  and a similar appendage has
 generally      been noticed      in  some     less   distinct accounts of a supposed
 sea-serpent.
     Supposing this       to be a dorsal        fin,   it extended from the anterior
 wings,     or pectoral fins, towards the tail for thirty-seven                 feet, and
 differs from the dorsal fin of any           species     of shark.     If the mane con
 sisted of detached fibres extending for thirty-seven feet on the back,
 it is analogous to no appendage of any known marine animal. That
 its rays or fibres are very peculiar, will appear from the specimen
 now exhibited.          These round fibres are fourteen               inches in length   ;
 and in the dried state, have           a yellow      colour and transparency, equal
 to that of isinglass.
     The vertebra, which have            been preserved in        spirit in our Museum,
 have     been     exceedingly well described by              Dr Barclay, in the Wer-
    *  The diameter of the animal is a little differently stated by different wit
 nesses.    But as we are told that its contour was more oval than round, we can
 easily explain the discrepancy. One witness, who had not measured it, speaks
 of it as equalling    a middle-sized    horse in thickness.      On measuring four horses
 of from   thirteen to fourteen hands in height,         I found their greatest circumfer
 ence to be from seventy-one to seventy-three inches, (or from five feet eleven
 inches to six feet one inch), or an average of six feet ; that is less than the
 thickest part of our animal, but seemingly near that of its average dimensions.

  nerian Transactions,      vol.   i. ; and undoubtedly,       in their want of         pro
  cesses and cartilaginous        structure,   have much resemblance              to those
  of chondropterygious       fishes.     One of the vertebrae        adherent to         the
  cranium, measured only two inches across ; while that of the                       Bask
  ing shark, in the     same situation,     is about seven inches in           diameter.
  Dr Barclay's paper      is accompanied by an engraving           of the    omoplates,
  and upper portion of the pectoral             fin, which are accurately            given,
  from a drawing made from the recent remains, by the late                     Mr John
  T. Urquhart,     an accomplished draughtsman,              and able naturalist.           I
  know the representation          to be   correct,    for I  saw and handled            the
 specimen.      The substance of this part was a firm, but flexible                   carti
 lage, and seemed to have been placed in the muscles                 ; just    as Cuvier
 describes the omoplates of sharks to be            :
                                                       " Leur   omoplates sout          sus-
 pendues dans le chair, en arriere des Branchies, sans articuler ni                       au
 crane ni a l'espine."
     The Orkney animal seems to have had two circular                     spiracles on
 each side of its neck, about
                                          1^ inch in diameter ;          whereas         the
 Basking shark has five linear spiracles              on each side, a foot or more
 in length.
     The cranium,      which    I also very carefully examined,            was far       too
 small   for  that   of a Basking shark          of    even   one-fourth      the usual
 length of that species.         It   measured in its dried state no more              than
 twelve   inches in length, and its greatest diameter was only                       seven
 inches.     A Basking shark of thirty-six feet long would have had a
 head of at least five feet in length ; and the diameter of the cranium,
 at the angles of the mouth, would have measured probably five                         feet.
These    proportions     positively     shew, that the Orkney animal                 could
not possibly be confounded by intelligent              men, accustomed to          see the
Basking shark, with that fish. There was a hole on the top of                            the
cranium, something similar to the blow-hole of the cetaceans ;                           but
its lateral   spiracles and cartilaginous         bones     forbid us to refer it         to
the order of cetacea.
     Everything proves      the   Orkney animal to have          been a chondropte
rygious fish,     different    from     any  described      by naturalists      ;   but it
has no pretensions to the denomination of Sea-serpent or Sea-snake,
although its general form, and probably its mode of progression                           in
the ocean, may give it some resemblance to the order of Serpentes.
Certainly, it cannot be confounded with any known shark                    ;   nor     does
it belong to the family of Squalidae.

                                         213
     The belief in the existence of       a huge marine animal,        of an enor
  mous    length, which has obtained the name of Sea-serpent, is still
  very general     among the Norwegian          fishermen, and is said      to have
  been seen lately in some       of their fiords.     A  singular notice of it was
  long ago published by Bishop Pontoppidan, in his History of Nor
  way ; but, unfortunately, in his pages, it was introduced in the sus
 picious company of        the  Kraken and the Mermaid; and therefore
 has been rejected by later naturalists.
     I am satisfied,    however, that the extravagant          descriptions which
 northern authors have given of the Sea-serpent, have                been founded
 on the rare appearance of some such animal as that driven on shore in
 Orkney ; which may also have been the prototype of the dark sublimity
 of the wondrous sea-snake of the Scandinavian Edda.                  That in the
 ocean such animals do exist, has been affirmed by persons worthy of
 credit.      I shall notice an unpublished       instance, related to me many
 years ago by my intelligent         friend, the late     Mr Andrew      Strang,  a
 gentleman of unblemished honour.
                                              "  Once, when on a deep-sea fish
 ing, he saw pass below his boat, at the depth of eight or ten feet, an
 enormously long fish, of an eel-shape.           It was swimming slowly, with
 a vermicular motion, and appeared to be at least sixty feet in length."
 It appeared to take no notice of them ; but they hastily removed
 from what they considered a dangerous neighbourhood.                    He stated
 that he was shy of mentioning this circumstance, "lest the sceptical
public should class him with the fable-loving                 Bishop of Bergen."
There is considerable reason           to  believe that a similar fish has ap
peared more than once on the western coasts of Scotland.
    I  shall not here discuss the notices we have, from time to time,
received      of late- years of a great Sea-serpent seen by mariners in
crossing the Atlantic to America.               Their accounts are generally
confused, sometimes evidently fabulous ; and, in some instances, it
would      seem   that the narrators      have mistaken a shoal of porpesses
or other delphinoid animals, for a huge sea monster.
    The bones exhibited by Koch, at New York and Boston, as those
of a fossil Sea-serpent, which were afterwards brought to Berlin,
have    been proved to be a most disingenuous           fraud of the finder, who
united the       bones  of different    individuals   of an extinct     species  of
whale    ;   bones now proved by Professor         Muller   to belong to animals
of very different      ages, and by    M. Agassiz "      to have been dug up at
different localities."        Several   diminutive     snake-like  animals    have

                                      214
been   killed on the shores    of America   ; as that taken at Cape Anne
in 1817, which is figured in the Illustrated London News of 28th
October 1848, from the original American memoir.                 Neither the
Saccopharynx      of Mitchell, nor the Ophignathus         of Harwood,        can
be considered as the animal we have described.           The   Saccopharynx
is said to be 4£ feet long ; the Ophignathus was six feet.            Neither
of them in size or form will, in the language of Mr Owen,             " satisfy
the conditions of the problem."
    I must  except from this category, however, the animal seen             from
H.M.S. Deedalus ; and the account of it given by Captain M'Quhae
and his officers.    In  their statements there are no suspicious affecta
tions of minute detail.       Their simple narrative appears       to deserve
more attention     than it has yet received from naturalists ; and                I
strongly incline to the belief, that the animal         seen  by the crew       of
the Deedalus was      an analogue of,    if not the very same      species,     as
the animal cast ashore in      Orkney in 1808.
    Considering the derision with which, in this country, the subject of
the Sea-serpent has been treated, and the ridicule attempted to be
thrown on all who were       bold enough to assert that they had             seen
such an animal,     nothing    but a consciousness   of his   unimpeachable
veracity could have tempted the gallant          Captain    M'Quhae       to   en
counter the sneers of his incredulous countrymen.           From all     I have
heard of his character for sagacity and veracity, from those who inti
mately knew him,      I have not the smallest doubt that he has faith
fully described what    ho and his crew saw      distinctly, and    at a short
distance from the ship.
    The animal seen     from H.M.S. Deedalus on 6th August 1848,
in lat. 24° 44' S., long. 9° 22' E. — " It was seen rapidly approach
ing before the beam."       Captain M'Quhae     says  :
                                                         " On our attention
being called to the object,     it was discovered to be an enormous          ser
pent, with head and shoulders kept about four feet constantly              above
the surface of the sea.         The diameter of the serpent was about
fifteen or sixteen inches behind the head ; its colour of a dark brown,
with yellowish- white about the throat."
    The Captain could discover no fins, but " something                like the
mane of a horse, or rather a bunch of sea-weed, washed               about its
back."     He thought that its hoad did certainly resemble           that of     a
snake   ; but the drawing which he transmitted to the Admiralty               has
not, to the eye of a naturalist,     the form of that of any snake.         The

                                              215
 figure published in The Illustrated                 London News for October 28,
  1848, is said     to be an accurate copy of that drawing.
    Captain     M'Quhae estimates the length of its                 body at the surface
 of the water,     "    a  fieur d'eau, at the very least equal             to sixty    feet,
 no  part of which         was to our perception used         in propelling it through
 the water, either by vertical              or horizontal     undulations.        It  passed
 rapidly, but    so close under          our quarter, that had it been a man of
 my acquaintance,           I  should easily have recognized his features with
 the naked eye       ;    and    it did not, either in approaching the ship, or
after   it had  passed our wake, deviate              in the slightest degree from its
course to the S.W., which it held on                 at the pace of twelve or fifteen
 miles an hour, apparently              on some determined purpose."
    If we   may judge from the engraving, the cranium is very convex,
of moderate size, with a short obtuse muzzle,                         a mouth      reaching
beyond     the eye      ;  which last organ is round, and of a moderate size.
The surface of the body is represented as smooth, and destitute of
scales— of which they were enabled to judge, because it passed close
under the quarter of the ship.                 It  was in sight for twenty minutes.
    The description certainly             does not belong      to any    Ophidian     ;  and
as  certainly militates against an opinion thrown out by Mr Owen,
that it might be a specimen of the Leonine seal, which has, it is
alleged,    occasionally         reached those       latitudes.     The     Leonine seal
never exceeds          twenty-five       feet  in   length, and such would have a
circumference at its shoulders of twenty feet, while this appears to
be eel-shaped,        with     a diameter of not more than fifteen or sixteen
inches behind the head.               The mane, too, of the male of the Leonine
seal extends only over the              head   and neck     ; but in the other, it ex
tended down the back.
    With all      deference         to so eminent        a naturalist    as  Mr Owen,       I
humbly conceive              that    his   conjecture     respecting     the    identity   of
Captain     M'Quhae's animal with the Leonine                    seal, is not more pro
bable than       Home's         identification     of the Basking shark           with the
Orkney animal.
    Both M'Quhae's             and     the Orkney        animal   would appear to be
cartilaginous     fish, totally different         from any genus known to natu
ralists.

                    What is Coal     ?     By Dr Fleming.
    Dr Fleming, after stating the circumstances which                 led him      to
bring   before the Royal Society the consideration             of this    question,
pointed out the distinction between a mineral species and a                 rock, a
circumstance which had been greatly overlooked in recent                     discus
sions on the subject.       He considered coal     as a rock, and capable           of
being traced, in its origin and history, from peat at the                beginning
of the series, to blind coal or anthracite at the termination.
   He illustrated the character of peat in reference           to the vegetables
from which it was derived — the changes of a mineralizing nature
which it had undergone — and the strata of sand, clay, and marl
with which it      is usually  associated.     He likewise pointed          out the
character    of the lustrous    streak and conchoidal        fracture     in   speci
mens exhibited.

                                     217
    The author next     proceeded  to the consideration    of wood    coal, or
lignite, and exhibited     specimens of this rock with and without         the
woody texture    — with a brown and black      streak — with  a lustrous and
dull   streak —  and with the ligneous structure,   and as cherry coal, un-
distinguishable     from  the same    rock in the older measures.          He
closed his remarks on the brown coals by adverting to the coal-money
of the Kimmeridge coal, and to the condition of amber          as belonging
 to this epoch.
    In   the third and concluding part of his paper, he pointed out the
characteristic    features of the four kinds of coals found in the coal
 measures.      The lustre, fracture, and streak, from exhibited        speci
 mens, he demonstrated to be variable        and unsatisfactory as charac
 ters ;  while chemical test indicated the absence of bitumen.         He  ad
 verted to the different    kinds of matter occurring in coal as indicated
 by   the   microscope,    and exhibited specimens of seeds dispersed
 through splint and cherry coal.        He concluded his remarks by         ad

        a uniform system of Meteorological Observations in the

     2. On certain      Vegetable Organisms found in Coal from
                        Fordel. By Professor Balfour.
    The author    stated that the coal to which he called           attention     was
found at Fordel collieries, near Inverkeithing, Fife, and that he                 was
indebted for specimens of it to -Mr Robert Daw, comptroller of                   cus
toms at Leith.       It  is a splint coal, and exhibits numerous vegetable
impressions, particularly of Sigillaria and Stigmaria.               These plants
appear, indeed, the author thought, to have formed the main                      sub
stance   of the coal,  as shown not only by its external appearance,              but
also by its microscopical structure.           Cellular and   woody    tissue    have
long been     recognised in coal      ;  but from what is now seen in              the
Fordel   and other varieties,    it would appear that scalariform        and dotted
tissue are often present, and, moreover, that in some instances peculiar
dotted vessels have been mistaken            for true punctated woody         tissue.
Elongated     cavities, containing yellow        and orange-coloured         matter,
also occur in   Fordel coal.      These cavities did not appear to be         woody
tubes, from which they differed in their form and arrangement, as well
as  in occasionally branching.         They seemed in this, as in many other
coals, to be more of the character of intercellular spaces or canals.
The coal from Fordel        also contains numerous specimens          of   seed-like
bodies, which appear to be sporangia, allied to those           of Lycopodiaceae.
These bodies have a rounded form           ;   their colour is dark-brown,        and
they seem to be formed by two valves, which are occasionally                   sepa
rated.    When    one   of the valves is removed, there is frequently             ob

                                       219
  served a black carbonaceous mass below         it ;  and when a transverse
   section  is made of an entire sporangium in situ, the cavity between
  the valves is often evidently seen.       At one part of the sporangium a
  stalk-like   process is sometimes observed.       These sporangia seem to
  resemble much those organs of fructification        in Lycopodiaceaa which
  contain the small spores, commonly known as vegetable sulphur or
  Lycopode powder, and it seems probable that the dark contents of
  the Fordel sporangia may be the altered spores.
      Large spore-like     bodies  are also met with      in coal, which     may
  perhaps be similar     to the larger    spores of Lycopods.       It  is by no
  means improbable,       the author   thought,   that the sporangia       in the
 Fordel and other coals may          be the fructification     of Sigillaria, — a
 genus which       occupies an intermediate     position   between   Oycadaceaj
 and Lycopodiaceae.        The Fordel   coal also contains abundance       of the
 inflammable      resinous organic matter called Middletonite, which, ac
 cording to the author, may perhaps         be in some way connected with
 the sporangia just noticed.
      Specimens were shown of Fordel coal formed by Sigillariae               and
 Stigmariae,     and of the same     coal containing sporangia and Middle
 tonite, while the communication was illustrated by magnified drawings
 of structure.

                         Monday, 6th March 1854.
     Sir T.     M. BRISBANE, Bart., President, in the Chair.
     The following Communications             were read     : —
 1.  On the Impregnation of the Ova of the Salmonidae. By
         John Davy, M.D., F.R.S. Lond. & Edin., Inspector-
         General of Army Hospitals.
     The author has     been induced, he states, to make       inquiry on this
subject,    in consequence of a recent averment, founded          on a reported
experiment, that the       ova of the  trout taken from the abdomen of
the parent fish, and not afterwards mixed with the milt, have proved
prolific.
     He first gives an account of many trials       made to test the accuracy

                                       220
of the conclusion that      the ova   of the Salmonidae may     be impregnated
06 externa, the results      of all which havo    been negative, and remark
ably contrasted with those        in which,   after exclusion,    the milt     and
roe have been    mixed, — impregnation        having   been   effected   and    the
eggs rendered    prolific.
    Secondly, he notices the generative organs of these fishes, and
points out how, anatomically, they are clearly unfit for performing
the reproductive function according to the hypothesis of impregna
tion ab extemo,     though perfectly adapted for it in accordance              with
the received doctrine.
    Thirdly, he adverts to the manner in which, during the             spawning
season,   the male and female fish approach each other, as being               also
in accordance    with the same doctrine, and opposed          to the    inference
of internal impregnation.
    In  conclusion, he observes, that even         admitting    the accuracy      of
the detail of the experiment         adduced   to prove such a mode of          im
 pregnation, the conclusion drawn is not a necessary           one, — inasmuch
as the ova included in a perforated box and placed in a stream, may
have been impregnated          by milt shed     in the adjoining     water, and
 by it in its flow conveyed to them.
 2. Account of a remarkable Meteor seen on 30th September
                   1853. By William Swan, Esq.
    On the 30th September 1853,            I was with my friend Mr David
 Wallace, in a field near his house,         Balgrummo,     in the    neighbour
 hood of Leven,    in Fifeshire.       The atmosphere was very clear, and
the sun was shining brightly.           The sky was covered in some quar
ters with thin cirrous clouds, and we had been watching the               changes
 in the appearance of the clouds nearly overhead, when Mr Wallace,
 who was still observing the sky, pointed suddenly upwards, and called
on me to look.      I  did so, and instantly saw a round body, apparently
as large as a star of the        first magnitude, moving rapidly         upwards,
 — roughly   speaking, towards the zenith, or more accurately,             towards
the sun.     This,  as  I  immediately     afterwards   ascertained, was      about
 llh   15™ Greenwich      mean time.
    The region of the sky which the meteor traversed               was   cloudless
 and serene, so that      I   had an extremely      favourable    opportunity     of
 observing it, and    I  continued to see it for about a second of          time.

                                               221
     As it      moved     upwards      through       the sky, its apparent magnitude
diminished with such perfect regularity     until it finally disappeared,
that at the time I had the impression that it had vanished, not by
dissolution of its parts, or extinction of its light, but only optically,
from the effect of increased distance.                        I   do not wish,   however, to
attach much importance to this nearly momentary feeling,                                 for the
observation was of too transitory a nature to make it deserving of
much confidence.
   The meteor appeared to me not like a self-luminous body; al
though, in the presence of so bright an object as the sun, negative
evidence on such a point cannot be regarded as decisive.                             Its colour
was perfectly white, and its apparent                        brightness was probably not
greater than that of the moon seen under similar circumstances, —
certainly it did not              exceed that of an ordinary            cloud illuminated      by
the sun.
     Mr        Wallace, as soon as he had time to recover from the surprise
excited by so unusual a spectacle                    described     what he had seen as one
of the most beautiful phenomena he had ever beheld. It will be re
collected that it was he who first pointed out the meteor to me ; and
having been the first to notice                it,
                                    he had thus also been able to ob
serve some interesting              changes    in its form which        I    was too     late to
witness.          By his kindness      I      am enabled to state what he saw in
his own words.
     "On        the forenoon of the 30th September last," he says,                     "
                                                                                       I     was
in   a   field distant about five hundred yards from Balgrummo                             house,
and about        a    mile and three quarters from Leven.                 The sky   was rather
free from clouds, and the sun was shining brightly.                          I   happened to
look in the direction of Lethem farm-house, when                         I   was startled      by
observing         a   remarkable object, apparently traversing the atmosphere
with       a steady motion resembling            that of     a    balloon, but much quicker.
It appeared to me to be not perfectly                round, but somewhat pear-shaped            ;
and    it  lustre like quicksilver, but seemed more transparent.
            had   a
Its movement was upwards like rising balloon, and not downwards
                                               a
like   a
           '
               falling star.'     I   only saw   it    for two, certainly not for more
than three seconds            ;   and its direction,       as nearly as    I     could judge,
was from         N.E.    to   S.W.      It
                           appeared to preserve its original shape
for about half the time during which     remained visible butit                      ;         it
then seemed to burst at the lower part into                        a   number of fragments,
which one by one disappeared, until                     it   finally vanished altogether.

                                            222
   Its size at first  seemed      to be about one-third       less than the apparent
   diameter of the moon         ;  and  I  could have supposed          it to   be  in our
   own atmosphere."
       From the apparent size of the meteor, and its perfectly round
   form as seen by me, contrasted with its much greater magnitude                       as
   estimated at first by      Mr Wallace, — its         train, — its     separation   into
   fragments, — and     its final round form as described by him, coupled
   with the fact that he saw it for some time before me, —               I conclude   that
   I  had only seen the meteor in the last of the phases which                     he de
  scribes.    It seemed to me to have a very             striking resemblance to the
  shooting stars so frequently visible          by night.        It   was    not, indeed,
  so luminous    as such objects usually appear to be,               but that was not
  to be expected    in the presence of the sun        ;  and,  I  have no doubt, had
  it  been seen by night,      it would have proved a very brilliant object
  indeed.
      I  may add, that the meteor was not accompanied                     by any sound,
  and that its path was sensibly rectilinear.
      As  I hoped to obtain accounts         of the meteor       as seen     from other
 stations,  I  deemed     it desirable    to ascertain, as far as was practicable,
 the positions of the points in the heavens where its most remarkable
 phases occurred.         In   the absence      of stars, which by night afford
 such convenient points of reference,            I   endeavoured, with         Mr Wal
 lace's assistance,    to estimate the altitudes and azimuths                of the prin
 cipal points in the path of the meteor            ; and as soon as        I  could com
 mand time     I  returned to the spot, in company with                   Mr    Wallace ;
 and by means       of a prismatic compass determined the azimuths of
 these   points, while their zenith distances were measured by means
 of   a  quadrant, which, although rude, was sufficiently accurate for
 my purpose.       The true azimuths were deduced from those which
 were observed, by subtracting            the variation     of the     compass,    which
 was found to be 25° 20'            W.    The variation       was    determined from
the azimuth of the sun, observed by the compass                    ;  the latitude and
longitude of the station deduced           from data kindly furnished by Cap
tain Henry James,         R.E.    ;  and the time given by a pocket chrono
meter, carried in its box, and compared with the Edinburgh time-
ball.
     The following    are the positions of the most remarkable                 points in
the meteor's path      :—

   The station where the meteor was seen is situated very nearly in
   latitude 56° 13' 5" N., longitude 12m 2<"6 W.
       It  is worthy   of remark, that      as the meteor was seen at     llh  15m,
  Greenwich mean time,         if    allowance is made for the longitude of the
  station and the equation of time, it follows that it appeared about 48m
  before apparent noon, or about that time of day when the sun shines
  most brightly. Now, while many accounts are extant of meteors which
  have appeared during the day, and have attracted attention by explod
 ing audibly, or have been accompanied by the descent of meteoric stones,
  I was not aware that any object like the meteor of the 30th           September,
  resembling so closely the more tranquil phenomena of shooting stars,
  had been described as being seen within an hour of noon, and in
  bright sunshine.      I was, therefore, desirous of obtaining other observa
  tions of the meteor, and for that purpose          I sent a short account of it to
  one of the Edinburgh newspapers, requesting the favour that any ob
  servations of it made elsewhere might be communicated                  to me, in
  order that they might be incorporated with this narrative.                 I have
  not, however, had a single communication on the subject, — a result
  which, although it is to be regretted, yet does not surprise me ; for,
 from the faint illumination of the meteor, it              was   an object which
 would scarcely attract observation, although it was easily perceptible
 to an eye which, like my friend's, was already directed to the region
 of    the sky where it appeared.

                Rankine, C.E., F.R.SS. Lond. & Edin., &c.
      Section   VI.   Subsection 4. — On the Thermic Phenomenon            of Cur
            rents of Elastic Fluids.
      Supplement. — Of a Correction applicable to the results of the
           previous reduction of the experiments of Messrs Thomson and
           Joule.
     In   investigating the phenomena of the free expansion of gases in
the    previous part of this paper, they had been considered as expand-

                                       224
ing, without receiving or giving out energy in any form              ; so that the
equation taken to represent their condition was
                                    4T=0.
This condition     was realized    in the early experiments of Mr Joule,
where, by the sudden         opening of a stopcock, air previously confined
in one vessel was allowed to fill another also          ;   but it is not    exactly
realized in the experiments         now in progress by Messrs Joule                and
Thomson, for which the correct equation is
                              4(?+PV)           = 0.
   Hence the approximate positions of the point of absolute                 cold cal
culated by means of the former equation, require a small               correction.
The author computes the values of this correction for two                   series of
experiments, made at a high          and a low temperature respectively;
and finds them to be    —
            + 0°-05       Centigrade for the high temperature,
            — 0o,002
                     Centigrade for the low temperature ;
so that for the experiments        now in question, the correction is          prac
tically inapplicable.     As it may, however,          have a sensible amount
for greater ranges of temperature            and pressure than those           which
occur in the particular      experiments referred to, and for gases           denser
than atmospheric air, the author explains how it is to be              calculated.

     The following Communications           were read      : —
  1. On the     Total Invisibility of Red to certain Colour-Blind
                      Eyes. By Dr George Wilson.
     After  some remarks     on the peculiar  difficulties which attend in
 vestigations into the functions of the eye, the author observed,         that
 by far the most remarkable variety of colour-blindness,       in a scientific
 point of view, is that which shows itself in the identification       of  red
 with black.      This appeared    to have been     overlooked by previous
 observers, or at least only cursorily described.       The probable causes
 of this neglect were noticed ;   and the author then proceeded to detail
 the experience of some twelve parties by whom various objects of a
 red, crimson, or scarlet colour were mistaken for black, and appeared,
from the testimony of those who committed the mistakes in question,
to have made neither a colorific nor a luminous impression on the re
tina.    It  was further shown, that though the fact had not attracted
attention, the published cases of colour-blindness supplied examples
of the  same blindness to red ; and that    Dalton, although     he  had ap
parently ascertained his own freedom from the blindness in question,
had incidentally     supplied proof that the red alike of the solar     spec
trum and of coloured objects frequently appeared to him as dark or
nearly black.
    Experiments were also recorded, which          had   been  made   by the
author, with the assistance of Professor Kelland, on the visibility of
prismatic    spectra to persons affected by colour-blindness,        one    of
whom was found unable to perceive from          Jth   to Jth of the red end
of the solar spectrum, whilst the other could not discern         jd  of the

                                          227
  Bed.   These parties showed a similar degree of blindness to the red of
 the lime-ball-light spectrum, and neither of them saw any other colour
 in place of the missing        one, or received   a luminous   impression from
 the less refrangible rays of solar or artificial light.
    From his entire observations, the author drew the conclusion, that
 the confusion of scarlet with green, and of pink, crimson, and pur
ple with blue, which characterises the colour-blind, is a phenomenon
of the same kind as the confusion of red with black — scarlet appear
ing as green, because it is          seen  as yellow    mixed with black — and
crimson as blue, because it         is seen as red mixed with black.
    The author referred, in conclusion,         to the observations  of Brewster
and Dove    on the     visibility of red to normal eyes, as proving that they
became blind to       this colour in dim or unfavourable light, much sooner
than to blue, not      to mention yellow ; so that, in the colour-blind,       we
only   see an exaggerated manifestation          of a limitation of vision which
belongs to all eyes.

               Dr CHRISTISON, V.P., in the Chair.
    The following Communications           were read     : —
     1.  On a New Hygrometer, or Dew Point Instrument.
                          By Professor Connell.
    This instrument consists essentially of a little spherical bottle of
thin brass, polished externally ; a small exhausting syringe ; a ther
mometer with ground brass stopper ; and a brass clamp. The bottle
has a diameter of     1 a\ inch, and is capable of holding half an     ounce.
Its neck   is attached to the syringe by means      of a lateral screw, and
is three-fourths   of an inch high, and about three-tenths       of an inch
wide.     The syringe is about five inches long, and has a diameter of
eight-tenths of an inch.      The stopper attached to the thermometer
fits air-tight into the upper part of the neck of the bottle.             The
clamp is intended for securing the instrument to the        sill of an   open
window, or to a table or other fixture      in a room.      Three drams of
ether are then slowly introduced into the little bottle, and the ther
mometer inserted.       The syringe    is worked    slowly at first, and the
speed gradually    increased, when the thermometer will immediately
begin to fall from the cold produced by the evaporation ; and the
exhausting process is continued until dew is seen to be deposited on
the external surface of the little bottle.     The temperature      indicated
by the thermometer is then noted, the process of exhaustion stopped,
and the temperature      again noted when the dew disappears from          the
brass surface.     The   mean  of these two observations may be taken as
the dew point.      To prevent the spreading of the heat produced           by
the friction of the piston, to the little bottle, the termination of       the
syringe which screws into the neck of the bottle is constructed of
ivory ; and as it is found that the vapour of the ether acts on valves
of the usual oiled silk, they are constructed of goldbeater's leaf, four
plies of it being used for each valve.      A reduction of temperature,
varying under different circumstances of temperature            from 20°     to
40", has been produced by the instrument          ;   and should it ever    be
found that extreme cases of united cold and dryness of atmosphere
shall occur, which are not within the power of the present size of
 the instrument,   there is little doubt that a sufficient  increase of re

                                    229
ducing energy    may be attained by a moderate increase        of the size of
the syringe.
    The amount of ether consumed in an observation rarely exceeds
half a dram, and frequently falls a good deal short of this, the cost
thus being from    a halfpenny to a   farthing.    The residual ether may
be repeatedly employed, making up its amount          each   time to three
drams from fresh ether.       It  ought to be kept for use in a separate
little bottle.   The leather    of the piston ought to be occasionally
rubbed with olive oil, and the washers of the connecting screws ought
not to be allowed to become too dry. The syringe must be of the
most approved construction, and all the apertures of the neck of the
bottle and of the valve-piece sufficiently wide. Comparative obser
vations have    been made regarding the indications     of this instrument,
of Daniell's hygrometer, and of Dalton's        mode  of transference of     a
cold liquid from one vessel to another, which last is usually admitted
as a kind of standard of compression.       Those of Daniell are usually
a very little in excess, and those of this instrument a very little in
deficiency   ; but the deviation   of both is   on  an average within 1°
 Fahrenheit.
     The instrument     is constructed by Messrs    Kemp of Edinburgh,
 with the proper accompaniments of measure, bottles for ether, &c.,
 all packed in a little box. It is thought that it will be found to
 offer  advantages   in point of considerable security from accidental
 fracture in travelling.
 2. On the Stability of the Instruments of the Royal Observa
                 tory.     By Professor Fiazzi Smyth.
     In an observatory where, as in that of the Calton      Hill,   the prin
 cipal object of pursuit is the determination of the exact places of the
 fixed stars, and the investigation of those exceedingly slow secular
 variations, which require many thousands of years to run their cycle,—
 the stability of the instruments, as a necessary element to the accu
 racy of the observations,   becomes of the extremest importance.
     To secure this quality much invention and no little ingenuity have
 been employed, but not yet with perfect success ; for invariably the
 more accuracy we demand, the more insuperable difficulties appear
 to arise. Even nature at last appears to be taxed beyond her powers,
 for we find when    we have passed    beyond a certain degree of magni
 fying power, that there are no bodies absolutely stiff and rigid — none
  constantly of the same dimensions ; but all are expanding and con

                                          230
   tracting, and giving and limiting with every change of temperature
   or application of small accidental pressures. All this takes place, it
   is true,  within limits which are perfectly inapplicable to ordinary
   observation, but are of the utmost importance to be attended to in
   astronomical    inquiries.     And   so certain  is it that changes and dis
   tances must exist in some shape and some            form in every case, that
   if  any one observer was hardily to declare that his telescopes             kept
   their adjustments perfectly, or had         no  error, the statement would
   only  be looked on     by astronomers as proving that         his observations
   were very rough and inaccurate.
       The most prejudicial      form in which the effects of instability can
  manifest themselves, is in any irregular motion of the stands whereon
  the instruments rests.
      This  is usually guarded      against by constructing      these   stands in
  the shape of large and heavy blocks of masonry, the heavier the
  better.     But   even    when    the greatest practicable       size has been
  reached, perfect immunity from disturbing influences is not obtained.
  This   was signally   experienced at Greenwich        some years ago, when a
  telescope   was  firmly built into a large stone pier, with the view of
  making such very exact observations of a certain star, as to be able
 to ascertain its annual parallax.           But long before the year was
 elapsed, it was found that the measures were absolutely vitiated, by
 the irresistible    swelling of the hill from rain, and the consequent
 heaving up of one end of the pier.
      Experience    therefore drew the rule, that in addition           to the ut
 most security which a large mass can give to the pier, it is proper to
 introduce some principle of reversal in the instrument               placed upon
 it.    For with such      a method, the exact state      of adjustment of the
 whole     can be ascertained for any instant.          Then it will probably
 be found that the structure,        the permanence of whose position could
not be depended       on  for a year, may be relied on from day to day,          if
 not implicitly, at least to within far less than the limits of the pro
 bable error of observation.
     In  the Edinburgh Observatory both these             principles   have been
long since introduced, and have lately been carried             further towards
perfection.
     The  stone piers, for instance, which were erected by our respected
member      Mr Jardine,     are models of excellent masonry, composed           of
peculiarly     dense material,    in the largest available blocks     ; and what
is more important,       they are founded on the hard porphyry rocks of

                                          231
 the  hill.    Had they     been    bedded    on gravel or      clay, or the softer
rocks that     the English Observatories are generally confined                to, they
might have been subject to dangerously irregular movements, owing
to the  infiltration of water in the soil.          But twenty years of careful
observation here have not detected any effect of this sort, though they
have shown, in the piers of the transit instrument, the existence of
 a small    annual    displacement of their tops, caused            apparently by     a
difference in the expansion from temperature of the two shafts,
though they were purposely cut out of the same bed in the quarry.
But as this displacement,           even   at its maximum,         reaches     only to
O-OOl    inch, and    proceeds    very regularly,     its effects on the observa
tions may easily be guarded against.
    The   second   principle   above    alluded to, viz., that of reversal, was
not introduced      into the Edinburgh transit           in  a perfectly unexcep
tionable manner.         At   the time of its construction it was certainly
thought well of.       But, with the usual unhappy tendency                 to run   to
extremes, men had no sooner discovered that mere weight in the
piers, and the telescopes        resting on them, was not a guarantee for
their perfectstability, and that the reversingwas           a necessary     adjunct —
than they began immediately to attend almost solely to this latter fea
ture, and to make the instruments so slight and delicate, as to require
constant reversing.          Especially    vicious, too, was the then plan of
making the metal bearings, through the intervention of which the
instrument rested on the pier ; for they were made so small, and so
weak, and of such a complicated construction, that the good qualities
of the masonry, such as they were, became                   neutralized,     and very
much larger and more uncertain errors were introduced.
    From this source       arose   those various fluctuations        in the position
of the transit instrument which            I  had the honour of describing to
the Society in 1847.         They had      been  first  detected   by my predeces
sor, and were finally traced up theoretically              by myself, to the un
equal expansion of certain adjusting screws in the                 Y   block.      Now
these adjustments should never have been there ; and was precisely a
reason why the       Y   block could not be firm.          They    were    introduced
with the vain idea of enabling the astronomer each day to screw up
the instrument to perfect truth before he began his observations.
But Professor Henderson knew very well, that after                   a screw is once
touched, it does not attain its true bearing for days, and sometimes
for weeks ; and he knew also that the quantity of any error can be
measured numerically         much more easily than           it   can   be corrected
    VOL.    III.                                                         T

                                           232
  mechanically.         He therefore adopted the very proper plan of leaving
  the adjusting screws untouched, but of measuring the amount of error
  each day, and calculating         the effect thereof on the observations.
      Still the adjustable      Y  could not be so firm as a plain block ; and
  being at last pretty plainly convicted of producing the bad effects al
  ready described, a necessity came            for introducing new and firmer
  bearings.       I  can   now describe the mode in which this was effected,
  and the astronomical results which have followed.             I   applied first to
 the German maker of the instrument,               but found him far too fearful
 of leaving the old beaten paths of instrument-making to attempt any
  improvement.          Next, therefore,     I applied to Mr John Adie of this
 city, and am happy to say that he carried out my designs in a per
 fectly satisfactory manner, and so caused             the Edinburgh transit to
 be the    first in which this signal improvement has         been made     ; for its
 advantage is now recognised, and has been adopted              elsewhere.
     The   new     Ys are   now large blocks of cast-iron,     of  the whole    area
 of the top of the pier, and weighing as many hundredweights as the
 old Ys did single pounds.             They have, moreover, no adjustments ;
 but the notches          in which the pivots of the instrument           rest were
 filed, by repeated trials, to within a certain           small quantity      of the
truth, and have         since  only been    subjected to examinations       for the
quantity of error.           The result, now    tested by many years, has been
highly satisfactory.          For, firstly, they  have never been so far out as
to require a second filing, or to be out of the limits of convenient
calculation     ;   and, secondly, what small amount of variation          of posi
tion they have been found liable to, has been               almost    entirely the
slow and regular expansion of the piers already alluded to.                   There
has been certainly a difference          in the amount of wear of either         Y  ;
but this has been exceedingly small, and has very regularly increased
with the time, while the large anomalous and irregular fluctuations,
which were         the dangerous features of former          years, seem      to be
effectually removed.           Even when labouring under this drawback,
the Edinburgh observations, though not all that they might have
been, were at least equal in accuracy to those            of any other observa
tory   ; so that     I trust  that they will still, through this alteration, be
enabled to keep up their comparative character, whatever improve

   But in addition to the stability of the instruments of an observa
tory being affected by the slow movements detailed above, it may
be injured        by quick            vibratory    motions,        not producing           permanent
change of place.                This     is,   moreover, precisely the sort of inconve
nience generally expected on a rocky                           foundation.          Under such a
prejudice too was             it,   that at the first meeting of the British Asso
ciation in Edinburgh, several of the members, somewhat                                    too hastily,
assumed, from their previous                      prejudices against rock, that the Cal-
ton    Hill   was by no means suitable for an observatory, and declared
that    good      observations           could never be made              there.        But though
this unfounded opinion was refuted publicly almost as soon as pub
lished, by Professor Wallace and others, good men of the day, and
has since been more formally put to the rout    Professor Hender         by
son's long and excellent series of published observations                             ;    yet the cry
having once been raised,      lingering echo seems still
                                          a                                               to exist       in
some     persons' minds, that                  the Calton       Hill,    because      it    is   rock,   is
always in such a              state    of tremor    as to preclude the efficient perform
ance of the instruments. And, worse still, only last summer, on a cer
tain public occasion, one of the very gentlemen who in 1834 showed
such want of discretion and judgment, again made a similar exhi
bition of himself.                  For putting         out   of sight    the facts         of all the
thousands of Edinburgh Observations, since printed and published, he
stated in a public place, that the British Association                          had declared that
the site of the Edinburgh Observatory                         was not a proper one           for     an as
tronomical establishment, and that no good observations could ever be
made there, leaving     of course to be inferred that no proof to the con
                               it
trary    had ever been since advanced, and that the dictum held still                                    ;
and    was that    of the Association              as   a   body   ;   which   it   never was.
                                                                                    t   2

                                         234
  With gentlemen who will adhere to a favourite theory of their
youth, in spite of all the myriads of facts contained in the volumes
since published by the Observatory,            I fear that the few additional      ones
which could be condensed            into this paper would make but small im
pression.       Some very peculiar instances, however, can now be brought
forward   ;   for there are at present in the neighbourhood far more power
ful shaking influences than in those former days, and the existing                  in
strumental means are more sensitive than ever to detect vibrations.
   These increased means of shaking are the introduction of railways
into the vicinity of the Observatory,              and the running along them
at high velocities of long and heavy trains,                creating   a far greater
disturbance in the soil than the rumbling of any number of carriages
along Waterloo         Place.
   The improved method of detecting the                effect   of this disturbance
is the recent adaptation of the collimating eyepiece, with modifica
tions allowing of unusually high magnifying power and with good
definition, and its employment in combination with a trough of                     fluid
mercury.
   Tested in this way, a vibration is undoubtedly perceived at times,
and nowhere could we expect to be entirely free; for such a univer
sal cause as the wind striking on the outside of a building would
produce some degree of tremor in the subjacent soil.                    But the ques
tion here      is,   Does the vibration take place to such an extent as to
vitiate the observations        ?
   In    answer to this    I    say, Certainly not    ;     for during the last five
years, the collimating apparatus has been in weekly,    not in daily,  if
use with the transit instrument, and on no single occasion was there
ever any impediment             to accuracy of measure caused               by vibration
transmitted through the ground from any of the neighbouring                       roads
or railroads    ;    — though   from the remarkable sensibility of the appa
ratus employed, the effects of the wind shaking the building, or per
sons walking         about, in, and even immediately            around       —circum
                                                                            it
stances not peculiar to the Calton            Hill — have    somet imes impeded the
 observations.
    But inasmuch         as on each day that the observations were made,           they
 lasted only about twenty minutes, the theoretical shakers may possibly
 suggest, that chance had always hit on the times of no railway trains
 being    on the move.  Recently, therefore,           I      made     a   more crucial
 experiment, and in this manner —         :
  I      stationed myself one day for three hours at the mural circle, to

                                                235
which a very powerful                 collimating    eyepiece     has been       applied, and,
having the telescope           pointed to the mercury trough, and the reflect
ed   wires in view,       I    noted carefully the times and the characters of
any defalcations          from        good    definition.       Meanwhile        the assistant
astronomer had gone to the part of the railroad nearest to the Ob
servatory        with a chronometer, and noted the times of any trains
passing,        their speed, and the number of carriages. On his return,
the lists        of times being compared, it                was found that no result          had
attended long         trains     moving slowly or short ones              moving quickly,
but that the long         trains moving quickly had produced a barely sen
sible     effect in spoiling somewhat of the definition of the reflected wires.
Never had this disturbance, however, amounted to a quantity that
need have prevented an observation                      being taken.        In    a word, the
disturbance         was   practically quite unimportant,               and this,       with    an
apparatus so sensitive that a slight                    tapping with the hand on the
great stone-pier,         containing about 120 cubic feet, produced so great
an   effect as to render the wires for a time altogether invisible.
     Moreover,       by comparing         the amount of railway vibration observed
here,     with that found at Greenwich and other observatories                        on    loose
and soft soils, we find          it   to be less than a    third of what is experienced
there.          This result,    so contrary to          the usual belief of the facility
with which rock conducts vibration,                      is perhaps attributable           to the
circumstance, that whatever vibration                       is produced in the hard, un
yielding material, is very small, while that in the softer, looser soil,
is very great and violent at the place.   In the rock, the wave, such
as   it   is,   may travel quicker and farther,              and with the characteristics
of   a    high musical     note, than one           of the   same   initial size in gravel      ;
but the wave produced in the gravel                      by the same      disturbing        cause
appears to be so much larger at the place, as to be able to travel to                           a
very great distance,            though with         a   slower motion and        a   lower note
(if   any bo audible) than in rock, and to be felt to                    a   greater extent
within a certain range.
  The whole result               is     thus highly satisfactory for the stability of
the Edinburgh instruments                 ;   since we have not only, by reason of
this rock foundation,                 an immunity       from the prejudicial action of
water penetrating the ground and heaving up the piers, but there                                is
also such a decided lessening in the amount of vibration, and the
disturbance of any optical image seen in the mercury.

       Iodine for Hydrogen in Organic Compounds, and on the
       properties of Iodo-Pyromeconic Acid.                 By Mr James
       Brown, assistant to Dr Thomas Anderson.
   Following      up   his researches   on  pyromeconic    acid,   read before
this Society in 1852, the author described a method which he had              re
cently discovered, through his experiments on iodo-pyromeconic acid,
of generally obtaining iodine substitution for hydrogen compounds.
   The mere digesting pyromeconic acid with tincture of iodine was
not successful    ;  because, as the author considered, there was no body
present, capable of drawing all the hydrogen in the compound to it
self, and so leaving, as it were, an open space which the iodine might
step into and occupy.
   This requisition, however, he found to        be perfectly complied with,
by introducing with the iodine a certain quantity of either bromine
or chlorine   ;  and the mode which he preferred of producing the iodo-
pyromeconic       acid   was,   by mixing a freshly-prepared        solution of
chloride of iodine with a cold saturated solution of pyromeconic            acid.
   The resulting       acid is monobasic, and   forms salts, of which      those
of baryta of    lead were described by the author at length.

2.    Notice of the Completion of the Time-Ball                                           Apparatus.
                 By Professor C. Piazzi Smyth.
     The electric time-ball,              erected on the Calton           Hill      last October by
the Government,           and placed under the author's charge, has now been
at work for five months.                   But the work             has necessarily been of an
experimental          or tentative character                ;   for before the accuracy of the
signals could be guaranteed, it was necessary                            to have experience of
the machinery in all weathers                     ;   and, moreover, the present strength
of the Observatory              establishment,              and the nature of pre-existing
occupations, prevented the experiments being made every day.
     There    have, however,               been       now upwards of 100 daily                    signals
made, four only of which                       have    proved defective, and from causes
which have since been remedied, so that there is now strong warrant
against future accidents.
     In   the course of the trial, the following questions presented them
selves, and,     if    not answered satisfactorily by the experiments, suit
able alterations were made in the machinery.
     1st,    Is the fall of the ball equally quick in windy                                as    in    calm
weather      1
     The answer         is,   that   it   is   so, owing to the great weight               of    the ball,
something near a ton,                overpowering any side pressure of the wind,
while all other friction             is   carefully relieved.

                                            239
      2d, Is it sufficiently         quick to make the commencement of the
  fall an accurate observation          ?
     It  is ; for     it falls through the first 4       feet in  less than 0-3   of a
 second ;       and as a separation       of the descending ball from the fixed
 cross staffs to       the extent of 6 inches would be abundantly visible to
 observers       all over the city, they should not err            to more than one
 second.
     3d,    Is the impetus of this falling            body sufficiently   broken and
 quieted     in fall,    so as not to endanger       the permanence of itself or
 the building       ?
     The concussion           is so completely    broken     by the cylinder     of air
 which receives and bears up the piston connected                 with the ball, that
 the ball       invariably     comes to rest on its bed block        without any sen
 sible shock or sound.
     4tA,   Is the dropping of so huge and cumbrous              a weight as the ton-
 heavy     ball managed by a trigger sufficiently delicate to insure ex
 actness of manipulation, and sufficiently certain, as not to be thrown
 out by accidental          causes   ?
     This     is the case to an eminent degree, through            the introduction  of
 a small      auxiliary ball to       do the labour   of dropping the big      one, so
 that it is      only the trigger of the small one that has to be pulled by
hand     or by the electric force, and it has to be pulled with a force of
 but a few grains, and through              about g^th of an inch.
     Excepting the variations of strength of a certain spring, depend
ing apparently            on    temperature,    and now compensated by adding
weights each morning, no other inconvenience has been experienced.
And the trigger has held its place firmly, even when during some
of the violent gales in the winter, the top of the monument was
rocking         about to such an        extent as to make the duty of attending
to the     ball somewhat unenviable.
     5th,      Is  there any loss of time or accuracy by the ball being on
Nelson's Monument, and not in the Observatory                     ?
     Practically,        none    ; for the trigger is pulled, and the ball dropped
by electro-magnets,              which are instantaneously animated by the gal
vanic circuit being completed in the Observatory.
     6th,      Is there any guarantee or permanent record of the time at
which the signal was, and must have been made ?
     There was not, as the ball was placed in my hands, for all the
exactness depended on the skill of the person making the signal ;

                                         240
 and, after it was made, nothing was left behind to shew when it               was
 made.     This has, however, lately         been    altered,  and the circuit   is
 now completed by a mean-time clock, which is compared every                   day
 with the transit clock, and adjusted to the true time                ; their com
 parisons being duly entered in a ledger on every occasion, shew in-
 contestibly the limit of error of the clock, and thereby of the fall of
 the ball each day.
     Referring  to these    entries,   I 6nd that, during the last fortnight,
 the correction of the clock at a quarter before one, were, on
                April    3, — 0-0              April    11, + 01
                   ...  4, —    01               ...    12, — 0-0
                   ...  5, —    00               ...    13, + 0-2
                   ...  6, + 0-1                 ...    14, — 01
                   ...  7, + 0-2                 .  .   15, — 01
                   ...  8, — 01                  ...    17, — 01
                   ... 10, — 0-0
And    as the greatest  daily rate of the clock during this period       was never
more than 0 3 seconds, the above must have been sensibly the errors of
the clock at one hour, and, therefore, of the drop of the ball, subject
only to a constant correction for the time necessary for the electricity
to pull the various triggers.        I have not been     able yet to observe this
quantity in any but an indirect manner, but suspect that it is under
0-1 second.
    7th, What     is the accuracy of the        approximate      signals afforded
by the half rise and the full rise of the ball at 5 minutes                 and at
2 minutes respectively before         1 ?
    As the clock is also      made to give a species        of electric signal   to
the raiser of the ball, he may and should have the windlass in mo
tion within 0-5 of a second of the even minute.                But, inasmuch as
the movement of the ball on the mast is very slow, by reason of the
number     of intervening wheels and pinions necessary to get up the
requisite power, the ball will not be seen to move visibly to persons
outside, until the crank has made several revolutions.
    From   a series of four    months' excellent observations of the time
ball by Sir T. Brisbane,         it appears that, to him in St Andrew
Square, the rises were seen on an average 2-5 seconds too late,               with
a probable error     of about  3 seconds.      While, from another series of
two months'      observations by      Mr  Swan, at a greater distance from
the  hill, as in Duke Street,      the retardation,       as might be expected,

                                      241
was greater,    or about 3-5, while    the probable error was about the
same.      By using   a telescope   with a cross   view, as he appears to
have done lately,    he has considerably    reduced both quantities.        But
each person should determine the amount of retardation             for himself,
as   depending    upon his distance from the hill,         peculiarity   of ob
servation, and other such causes.          This done, and the quantity
applied to one of the rises as a correction,          will give    a very near
approximation     to the   error of the observer's watch,      so that he   will
be  fully prepared to observe the instant of the drop           to the utmost
exactness.
    8.  Has the accuracy of the drop of the ball been independently
tested ?
    As   to absolute  time, not that    I am aware of    ;  but as to relative
time,   it has by the two very careful series of observations already
mentioned, by Sir T. M. Brisbane and Mr Swan. The results of these
are given below in the rates of their chronometers, for similar days.
And it will    be observed, that although one    of them did alter its rate
somewhat irregularly backwards and forwards, still as the other was
going on in a uniform march at the selfsame time, the anomalous
effect was   all owing   to the one    chronometer, and nothing        sensible
was due to any error     of the time-ball.
    In  conclusion, the author    observed that the arrangements which
were in the course     of being made, would give uninterrupted facility
to  the public for ascending to the top of the monument.

 5. On the Mechanical Energies of the Solar System.                         By
        Professor William Thomson.
     In this paper it is shown, that by the sun's heat there is an emis
sion   of mechanical     energy   from   the solar   system, amounting       in
 about 100 years to as much as the whole energy of the motions of
 all the planets.    The principal object of the paper is       to investigate
 the source  from which this vast development of energy         is drawn.    It
 is argued, that either a store    of primitive heat must     be drawn upon,

                                                    242
or heat must            be generated         by chemical action (combustion), or heat
must be generated by other forces than those of chemical action,
that   is,   by forces of moving              masses.          Any store of primitive           heat
that can be drawn upon in solar radiation, must be entirely within the
sun.      It   is   shown that such           a    store would almost certainly            be    in
sufficient for the supply of the heat which has certainly                          been emitted
during 6000 years,              and     it   is   also shown with about equally strong
probability, that chemical action among elements of the sun's                               mass,
would      be insufficient           to supply       the actual emission          for any such
period of time.            It   is   concluded that the source drawn upon in solar
radiation cannot be primitive heat, nor heat of intrinsic combustion.
If not    heat of combustion at all,                it   must clearly be heat derived from
the motion of bodies              coming to the sun (the utter insufficiency,                     in
point of duration,              of ordinary motions of matter within the sun,
being quite obvious)   or     be heat of combustion, fuel must be
                                ;        if   it
supplied from without.   But no matter can come to the sun from
external space, without generating, from its motion alone, thousands
of times       as much          heat as      it   could possibly give rise to either              by
combustion among elements of its own, or                             by   combination with sub
stances      primitively in the sun, unless                   it   were possessed of incompa
rably greater chemical                 affinities    than any known terrestrial or me
teoric substance.            It   is   inferred      that the source of solar heat must
be meteoric, and           is   the motion         of    meteors coming to the sun.             The
idea that solar heat              is   so produced, appears to have been                first pub
lished by      Mr       Waterston, who brought                it   forward at the late meeting
of the British Association at Hull.
   But    (as was assumed by Mr Waterston) enough of meteors to
           if
generate heat at the actual rate of solar radiation, were falling                                  in
from extra-planetary                 space, the earth in crossing             their path, would
be struck         much more copiously                   by   meteors than there      is   any pro
bability     it    is
                    ;    and the increase of matter round the centre of the
system, would within the last two or three thousand years, have
                   of the earth's motion, which history disproves.
caused an acceleration
Hence the meteors which supply the sun with heat must, at least
during historical periods, have been within the earth's orbit.  We
see them there in the sunshine (when the sun himself      below our                is
           tornado of dust, called " the Zodiacal Light

round the sun and carrying the inter-planetary    atmosphere with
them, probably             to     such an extent, as to cause centrifugal                    force

                                         243
enough very nearly to balance solar gravitation upon it everywhere,
except close to the sun's surface.          The meteors themselves probably
evaporate somewhere near the sun, merely on account of the high
temperature of that part of space, but ultimately losing their rotatory
motion   by intense resistance in entering the sun's atmosphere, be
come condensed into a liquid state          by solar gravitation, and come to
rest in the sun.       The quantity of heat thus generated in the region
of intense    resistance, by any quantity of matter falling in, will
exceed half the equivalent of the work done by solar gravitation                 on
an   equal   mass   moving      from    an infinite distance by (what must
probably   be quite insensible in comparison) the latent heat evolved
in condensation, together with the heat of any chemical combination
that may take place. The other half of the work done by solar gra
vitation on every meteor which has come from an infinite distance
(or from many times the sun's radius off),           goes to generate heat        in
inter-planetary air by friction.
    The meteoric matter thus           added  to the sun, to generate heat at
the present rate of emission as determined              by Pouillet,    if settling
at the surface with the same            as his mean    density, would cover it
about sixty feet    thick in    a year, and would not increase his apparent
dimensions by more than about 1" in 40,000 years              ; or in 2,000,000
years, by as much as he appears to grow from                July   to December.
It  must, therefore (whatever be the actual density of the deposit),
 be insensible from the earliest historical period of observation till
 the present time    ;   and for thousands     of years  to come,    if  continued
 only at the     same     rate, it must remain neither        demonstrated nor
 disproved by the most accurate measurements of the sun's apparent
 magnitude.
    The approximate equality of solar heat in all regions of his sur
 face is probably due to the distillation of the meteors, which if solid
 when entering the region of intense resistance, would probably give
 an immensely more copious supply in the equatorial than in the
 polar regions.      The dark spots are probably whirlwinds, analogous
 to  the hurricanes     in the tropical    regions of the earth's atmosphere,
 (although produced by           a  different  cause,*)   which by centrifugal

 on  limited portions of the sun's surface,          and allow    them to cool by
 radiation so much, as to become comparatively              black.

2. On the      Action of the Halogen Compounds of Ethyl and
        Amyl on some Vegetable Alkaloids. By Mr Henry How,
        Assistant to Professor Anderson of Glasgow.
    This paper contains some details of a continued investigation, of
which the first results were communicated to the Chemical Society
of London last year.*           It  was then shown that new bases are pro
duced by the action of iodide of methyl and              of ethyl upon morphia
and codeine,     which are closely analogous with the ammonium bases
of Hofmann,       so that these alkaloids should rank among         nitryle bases.
The fact    was also pointed out, that         although    one   of the  new salts
produced had precisely the centesimal composition of the correspond
ing compound of codeine, the base of the artificial product was widely
different from this alkaloid       ; and the conclusion was drawn that the
primary     molecules of these natural formations are of so peculiar a
constitution,    that chemists are not yet in the possession          of means of
imitating the     process   of their construction      ;  for  even  the attempt

    to convert   morphia into codeine fails, though the addition of the re
    quisite amount         of carbon and hydrogen to the former is readily
    effected.     It  was further remarked that the circumstance of both
   these   alkaloids furnishing the same results, under the given circum
   stances,    possibly arose from their similar origin             ;  and that it was in
   tended    to examine        other alkaloids of opium, and some from other
   sources,    in the   same way.         In   the present memoir it is shown that
   attempts to produce ammonium                 bases from other alkaloids        of opium
   have   not been      successful    ;  but this result has been          obtained from
   strychnine,     and the new products have admitted of more detailed ex
  amination,       from     their possessing       a  more stable nature          than the
  analogous derivatives from morphia and codeine.

       Hydriodate of Papaverine. — The next base from opium sub
  mitted to trial was papaverine, an alkaloid of well-marked characters,
  and the subject       of some recent researches of Dr T. Anderson.*                It was
  found that, by heating some              of this substance in        a sealed tube with
  spirit of wine and iodide of ethyl, it is converted into an hydriodate
  with great ease.           The salt proved      to be that    of the unchanged alka

 deposited,      which     assumes    a  crystalline solid form in the course of          a
 few hours.          It   is unaltered      in the air,     but decomposed,        at least
partially, at 212° Fahr.
      All  doubt as to the nature of the base in this salt was removed by
its analysis when set free, by the action of ammonia on the hydriodate.
The white         crystalline     deposit so obtained, gave, after one crystalli
zation from         dilute    spirit, analytical     results perfectly in accordance
with the formula,

those characteristic          of the alkaloid.

the preceding    ;  the hydriodate of narcotine resulting from the action
was an    oily substance of a brownish colour, which could not be           made
to crystallize ; it was soluble in hot water, and ammonia threw             down
from this solution      a precipitate easily recognised as narcotine         ; its
nature was fully substantiated by the quantitative analysis of its pla
tinum compound, which          gave results agreeing with the salt of nar
cotine, whose formula is this,

    The result of this experiment calls to mind a preliminary notice
of Wertheim,* in which he announced his detection in opium of two
new species of     "  narcotine,"  which   he terms     methylo and propylo-
narcotine, while the ordinary alkaloid he regards as ethylo-narcotine.
The proof of the existence of this series is desirable,             because    the
ordinary alkaloid, the material of the above experiment,             would then
seem to be a compound ammonium, and stand a solitary                 instance of
such a substance, unless papaverine         be   of the    same   nature.     The
details of Wertheim's      researches have not appeared, but the subject
is worthy of being made clear, as there is nothing in the characters
of papaverine and narcotine to distinguish them from other alkaloids
as a class of bodies.
                       Cotarnine and Iodide       of Ethyl.
    Hydriodate of Cotarnine.      — This   base, a derivative from narcotine
by oxidation, behaved quite like its parent under the same circum
 stances.     The hydriodate      of cotarnine     is  a   red-brown    oil,  very
 soluble in hot, insoluble     in cold, water  ;  the nature of its base       was
 ascertained by the formation       of its platinum salt, which was        a pale
 yellow substance, and gave numbers on analysis             in accordance with
 the true salt of cotarnine,
                         C26H18N06HCl,PtCl2.
    The formation of these hydriodates in the presence of water is
 possibly brought about by the change of iodide of ethyl and water
 into hydriodic acid and ether, observed by Franklandf to take place
 at 300° Fahr. ; the presence of bases may determine the change at
 a much lower temperature.
     Where water is absent, it is not     easy to see how they are formed,

   This     alkaloid,        as being          one    of      those    which contain two atoms
of nitrogen, was considered an interesting                                 object for examination.
Numerous speculations have been gone into as to the mode in which
this   element         exists in such substances, before the experiments                                        of
Hofmann          gave a point of comparison                      between            ammonia          and other
basic bodies.           These       are      now regarded, viewed                        from the volatile
type upwards, as nitrogen attached to basic hydrogen alone, or to                                                 it
with hydrocarbons, or              finally      to hydrocarbons alone, occupying                          all its
place.      In   the fixed vegetable alkaloids                         oxygen is included in the
system,     and here oxygenized hydrocarbons must act as hydrogen,                                              if,
as has been attempted to be shown in                             a     former paper on this sub
ject, these bodies are comparable with nitryle bases.                                           In the   case   of
one of these containing                 two atoms of nitrogen,                       it    is    possible that
this element performs, as                 it   were, two parts             ;    one being referable to
its function in any simple nitrogenous base,                                while the other may be
more analogous to its property                    when combined with oxygen as N04,
of replacing hydrogen in the carbohydrogen of the molecule —                                          a   specu
lative suggestion thrown out some few years ago by Fresenius.
  This question          it   is   attempted to decide                 by   means         of two     classes of
reagents    ;    the amount             of basic      hydrogen             in strychnine             should be
ascertained       by   the action of iodide                of ethyl, &c., while any oxidized
compound of nitrogen,               as    N04, should                 be reduced by sulphuretted
hydrogen, and hydrogen added while oxygen                                      is   removed.
   The former part of               the subject           is   gone into in some detail in this
paper, while mention               is   made     that strychnine                    undergoes        a   curious
change with sulphide of ammonium,                               resulting in the production                     of
hyposulphite of the base,                a   stable and beautiful salt, and some other
product as yet imperfectly studied                        ;    from what            is   at present known,
however,    it    is   thought          that the change               is   not of the nature above
spoken of.

 the insolubility of the base in this menstruum renders spirit a                 better

 170    parts at 60°;       and is deposited from tolerably dilute fluids
 in fine, white, four-sided prisms; it is unaltered in the air, and

    It   yields   no base      to  potass or ammonia,           but   is precipitated
 unchanged      from    its aqueous     solution     in   the cold by the former,
 more immediately in the heat by the latter.                 Oxide of silver readily
eliminates its iodine, and leaves the base in solution, from which it
 may be obtained in the crystalline state               as  a hydrate.     These re
actions assimilate the salt to an iodide, and the salts of the                base are
accordingly named in accordance, but the conventional nomenclature
of the    base is not altered.       Some of these salts          are described    and

to procure carbonates was made, and there exist two                   ;  but the mono-
carbonate cannot be obtained dry, as in the process                     of evaporation
it decomposes      into some basic       product and impure             bicarbonate — a
salt which may be produced not only of constant composition, but as
a beautiful crystalline substance.
    The monocarbonate         is  readily   produced by double decomposition
between     the iodide of ethylostrychnine       and moist carbonate of silver.
A    few minutes contact suffices to effect the change, the solution of
the carbonate is found to decompose           on simple evaporation              either in
vacuo or at 212°,         into impure      bicarbonate,     and     a substance, in
soluble in water, which          has the characters     of a base, quite distinct
from strychnine       or ethylostrychnine      ;  but material was wanting                to
establish its nature thoroughly.
    Bicarbonate of Ethylostrychnine. — This salt               is formed by passing

 at 212°, or in vacuo        ;  its solution undergoing           in a very slight          de
 gree the decomposition just mentioned.                    Prepared      by these       means
 it is a crystalline     mass, which is completely soluble                 in alcohol,     and
 is thrown down in very fine prismatic                  crystals,   by ether        added    in
 small quantity to this solution.             It  is not deliquescent, but is             very
 soluble in cold water; its reaction is strongly alkaline.                       Its compo
 sition is shown by analysis to be, as expressed in the formula,
  C46 H26 N2 04       HO C02, HO CO, = Ci7 H27 N2                      04 COs,       H CO,
 quite analogous to the corresponding               salt of potass.
      In  repeating some experiments mentioned in Liebig's Traite,* it
 was found that the statement there               made      as to the existence of a
solid carbonate of strychnine            is erroneous      ;   nor could carbonates          of
 morphia, codeine, papaverine, or narcotine be obtained.
     The notice of Langloisf having             succeeded     in forming carbonate of
quinine arrested the intended extension                   of  these   trials with       other
alkaloids.
     Hydrate      of Ethylostrychnine. — When moist oxide of silver                           is
added to the solid iodide,          a strongly      alkaline     fluid of a rich       purple
colour     is obtained which yields on evaporation                   in vacuo        a   crys
talline    residue, containing        some   little carbonic acid.           This is     com

certain precautions, occasions           the deposition of a substance in               beau

it differs from its        assumed      analogue,       the crystallized hydrate              of
potass, in containing an atom less of water.
    The    substance  cannot be freed of its water by heat, as its aqueous
solution is found, by evaporation at 212°, to undergo the same change
as the monocarbonate, and also to absorb carbonic acid to                          some ex
tent.     It  is not deliquescent, its aqueous solution has a red purple
colour,    and   an  extremely       bitter   taste   ;  it precipitates       barium and
calcium solutions partially in tho heat, and the heavy metallic oxides
at once from their salts.          It  yields products by the action of chlorine,

water, the salt was found to have the composition expressed in the
formula, —
                      CMHMNS         04 CI,  HO      +  Taq,
At    a temperature of 212° Fahr, the 7 aq. are expelled,               and the
dried compound is —
                      -
                           CM H8S N3 04 CI,       HO.
Its   characters    are generally analogous to the corresponding salt of
the ethyl base. It is of greater solubility in water and in spirit. Its
decomposition      by heat is attended by the final production         of fumes
of a most disgusting odour.
    In    contact with ammonia, it appears to undergo some decomposi
tion   ;  in the cold, long contact produces a crystalline substance, hav
ing the qualitative characters of strychnine ; the reproduction of this
alkaloid, and the formation of amylamine, appears possible under
the circumstances,      as  in the equation,
                                                                      N, HC1

                                         252
 but the proof of this decomposition was not attained, as much of tfit
 original salt remained unchanged.
     With strong ammonia in a heated sealed tube, a more                 complex
 change appears to take place       ; but its nature was also not made        out.
     Chloride of ethylostrychnine      also yields a small crystalline    deposit
 when left in contact with ammonia for some days.
     Nitrate of Amylostrychnine. —This is           a beautiful   salt, crystal
 lizing from water in groups of colourless prisms, which               have the
 composition,
                    CM  H„ N,     04  N08, HO, + 10 aq.        ;
 the salt is not obtained anhydrous at 212°, but when so dried, is
                         CH H33 N3 04 N06,         HO   ;
 it furnishes   a crystalline  double salt with mercurous nitrate.
    Bichromate      of Amylostrychnine. — This is a yellow crystalline
 salt, difficultly soluble in cold water    ; when dried at 212°, it is found
 to have the composition,
                      CH    H,sNs °4 Cr04,HCr           04,
 analogous    to the corresponding compound       of the ethyl   base.
    Chloride    of amylostrychnine,      when treated with oxide of silver,
yields an alkaline purple       solution, which agrees     in properties with
 solution of ethylostrychnine,      and leaves, on evaporation in vacuo, a
 crystalline   residue, whose characters are so like that left by the other
that there can be little doubt the crystals obtained by use of alcohol
and ether are the hydrate of amylostrychnine,          having a composition
closely corresponding with the ethyl product.
    It  is hoped to clear     up, in a future    paper, some     of the    points
touched upon in the present, and the following inferences are drawn
from the facts brought forward        j—
    That   the new basic compounds, ethylo and amylo strychnine,              are
analogous to Hofmanu's ammonium bases, and quite distinct from                the
natural alkaloids.
    That the already complex molecule of the vegetable alkaloid is
rendered more susceptible of change by association with additional
hydrocarbons.
    That strychnine appears to be made up of a complicated molecule
in which the one atom of nitrogen, as in ammonia, is associated with
a nitrogenous aggregate of elements, whose function is that of             three
atoms of hydrogen, and whose nitrogen           is in some distinct     form of

                                       253
combination,     as yet undetermined,        from that of the first, generic

 And the appropriation       of an alcohol hydrocarbon by this molecule
 causes the production     of an ammonium congener, which, in combina
tion with some electro-negative element, may be thus written             :—

3.    On the Mechanical Value of a Cubic                   Mile of Sunlight,
       and on the possible density of the Luminiferous Medium.
       By Professor William Thomson.
   The velocity of light being 192,000 miles per second, and the
mechanical value of sunlight incident perpendicularly on a square

                                        254
mile at the earth's distance being 83 x 5280 x 5280 foot pounds ;
the mechanical value of all the energy potential and actual, kept up in
                                                                83 x   5280x 5280
the space of a cubic mile by sunlight crossing it, is
                                                                       198 000
 = 1200 ft. lbs. at the earth's distance.                 Similarly the     mechani
cal value of a cubic mile of sunlight              near the sun is found to        be
 1200 x 46,000=55,000,000             foot pounds.
    If A   be the excursion   on each side of its position of equilibrium,
which any particle would have if the mean effect of the solar radia
tion at the earth's distance were produced by plane polarised vibra
tions of wave length X, the mass of a cubic foot of the luminiferous
medium, in pounds, is shown to be

 where g is the number      32- 2,   measuring the force of gravity, and            V
the velocity of light in feet per second.             Similarly,   if A  and X relate
 to sunlight near the sun, the mass of a cubic foot of the vibrating
medium in that locality is found to be
                                   166 xlO18
 The possibility of great variation     in density     of the luminiferous   medium
 at different distances from the sun, depending on solar gravitation, and
 heat, and centrifugal    force of the vortices kept up in it by planetary
 and meteoric motions, is indicated           ;  and it is suggested      that a re
 fraction of this inter-planetary       atmosphere may produce annual ap
 parent motions in the stars, which may be sensible, although not yet
 discovered. — As to the preceding expressions for the density of the
 vibrating medium, all that is known of the values of
                                                                     —   is that they
                                                                      A.
  must in all probability be large.           If   nothing    less  than 100 be   ad
  missible,  the mass of a cubic foot of the vibrating                 medium at the
  earth's distance could not be less than
                                         1  lb.
                                      77 x      1019

                                            255
 and near the sun          it could   be no less than
                                            1   lb.
                                         17xl018
 If the    earth's   velocity (being about               3   of the velocity of light)
 be    admitted as not too great for the maximum                  velocity of vibration
 of plane polarized        light, the mass of the luminiferous         medium within
 a sphere    concentric with the sun, with radius equal to that of the
 earth's    orbit, might      be not     more than      xj'gj of    the earth's mass,
 since the mechanical value           of light within that        space is about T5Vff
 of that   of the earth's motion.
 4.    Account of Experimental Investigations to answer ques
        tions originating in the Mechanical Theory of Thermo-
        Electric Currents. By Professor W. Thomson.
      In this communication the          mode     of experimenting was described
by which the experimental               results quoted in the theoretical paper
were      obtained ; and the principal parts of the special apparatus
which had been constructed and used in the investigation,                     were laid
before the Royal Society.
5.    Dynamical Theory of Heat, Part VI. continued.    A Me
       chanical Theory of Thermo-electric Currents in Crystal
       line Solids. By Professor W. Thomson.
      In this paper the Mechanical Theory of Thermo-electric Currents
in linear conductors         of non-crystalline       substance, first communicated
to the Royal Society December 15, 1851, is extended to solids of
any form and of crystalline substance.
  It is first proved, that if a solid be such that bars cut from it in
different directions have different thermo-electric powers relatively to
one another,       or to other linear conductors, forming part of a circuit,
there must, for every bar cut from               it,   except in certain particular
directions (principal thermo-electric            axes), be    a   new thermo-electric
quality, of    a   kind quite distinct from any hitherto              known  giving
                                                                              ;
rise to a reciprocal thermo-dynamic              action, which consists of a differ
ence   in temperature at        the sides   of   the bar causing a current to flow
longitudinally, when the two ends, being at the same temperature,
are connected      a uniformly heated conductor; and a current
                      by
through      the   bar causing an absorption and evolution               of  heat at its
two sides, when these are kept at the same temperature.
     VOL. III.                                                           x

   The most general conceivable thermo-electric relations of a crys
talline solid, or body possessing, inductively or structurally, different
physical properties in different         directions,   are next examined.           It
is shown how a metallic structure may be actually made up of pieces
of different     non-crystalline      metals, which, taken on a         large   scale
compared     with    the dimensions of the heterogeneous elements                   of
which it is composed,       will   be found to    exhibit the most     general type
of thermo-electric directional relations indicated            by the abstract      in
vestigation   ;  and  it is inferred that it would        be wrong to limit the
general expressions by any particular             assumption,     even   if we only
discover simpler types of thermo-electric relations in natural crystals.
   The general equations determining               the thermo-electric      currents
in any naturally, inductively, or structurally           crystalline solid ; result
ing either from a        completely specified distribution of temperature
through it; or from given external appliances of heat, on which, and
on the thermo-electric currents themselves, the distribution of heat
through the interior will depend          ; are investigated.
   Certain particular applications          of the general equations are          also
made ;  and the thermo-electric properties of metallic structures                (laid
before the Society as solids actually possessing the properties refer
red to), are investigated.
   The paper in which this extension of the theory is described,
includes a more developed account of the theory of thermo-electric
currents in non-crystalline         conductors, formerly communicated, than
has been hitherto printed        ;  with  a simplification    in the fundamental
equations introduced without hypothesis, by the adoption of a ther-
mometric assumption proposed as the foundation of an absolute scale
of temperature, in consequence of thermo-dynamic experiments on
air recently made by Mr Joule and the author.                  It also includes a
brief outline of    some experimental         investigations undertaken       to an
swer questions proposed in the former                theoretical   communication,
and   suggested     by   various     considerations     which     occurred    in the
course of the research, and by the new part of the theory now com
municated to the Royal Society.

    Some       of the     species    in this list    have      been described    as new to
 Britain by Mr Roper, in a late paper published in the Microscopi
 cal Journal.         The Coscinodiscus, not named, seems from the de
 scription to be the same with that found at the mouth of the Thames,
 and is an exceedingly           beautiful    disc.    The four       species  of Actinop-
tychus are those described by Ehrenberg, and are                     new British species.
 They exhibit the strong               siliceous cellular tissue underneath            the
 moniliform structure of the surface,             as in Actinocyclus.           The exam
ples   of Triceratium striolatum,              and also Zygocerus            rhombus, dif
fered    somewhat         from the figures and descriptions                given of them,
being provided with spines along the side, and with two spines placed
close to the projecting           terminations    or angles of the valve, and which
were always present in the examples that had come under observa
tion.      The surfaces of the valves were                also seen to be dotted over
with small nodules, giving them                a very remarkable appearance, and
which might be seen to project from the surface when the valve was
suitably placed ; these appearances might be attributable to a more
mature developing of the siliceous structure.

                                              258
     Among the remarkable forms found, although                          not considered         to
belong to the Diatomaceae, are the two varieties of Bacteriastrum,
the discs of which, it may be observed, were three or four times the
diameter of those described by                 Mr   Shadbolt, from Port Natal, and
the radiations more numerous.
     Attention was directed to the structure of the                      Diatomaceae         as af
fording some of the most beautiful examples of geometric arrange
ment with which we are acquainted.    It was pointed out that there
are only three of the regular             polygons      that can         be employed alone
to   fill up the     space about a    point in a plane surface, namely, the                   equi
lateral triangle, the square, and the hexagon                   ;   these forms and their
angles are accordingly found to prevail in the structure                            of   the tis
sues.      By constructing the polygons, it               was       shewn that           they ar
ranged themselves in straight             lines, determined by the shorter axis
of the figures, the quadrilaterals having two directions                         in which the
lines run, and the hexagons three.                   With the hexagonal structure,
when one set of the lines passing through                  the axis is referred to a
centre, the cells then appear to radiate                 in straight lines from the
centre, while the other two directions in which they appear to run will
be  spiral lines, having a definite character according to the size of the
cells.   Much of the character of the tissue depends on the position
of the axis of the polygon with respect                  to an axis         of the valve, —
that    is,   whether     the longer     or shorter      axis       is   parallel   to it.      Mr
Smith in his Synopsis has noticed this peculiarity,                            and in accord
ance with       it   has divided his genus Pleurosigma               into two sections.
     The   above arrangements          will    be found to prevail         in the structures
of the tissues of the valves, and the influence of the living principle
might generally be seen in the repetition of like spaces about                                   a
centre in each species, and always                  in the same numerical                relations
in each individual         of the   species,    multiples of the numbers
                                                                                         2,
                                                                                         3,    and
5,   and also     7,   seeming to prevail.
     These divisions are seen very conspicuously                     in Actinocyclus           and
Actinoptychus.            In   the large species of Coscinodiscus, the number                    of
sectors appeared to be twelve, from the groups                      of   rows at the centre,
and in     it   was shewn the very beautiful           arrangement             of the     cells in
radiating and intersecting spiral lines.                 Eupodiscus Balfsii was re
ferred to as affording an example of the division                         of    the circle into
sectors, within         which      the lines of cells are arranged                  symmetri
cally on each side of          a   single radiating row, to which the rest are

                                          259
all parallel.      In    Eupodiscus     maculatus,    the disc    is divided    into
ten, but   the rows of cells do not converge towards the centre, ex
cept one at the side        of  each sector, to which the others are parallel.
From this may          be derived      the very beautiful      and peculiar     con
struction    of the       Coscinodiscus    eccentricus,    in which the disc is
divided into seven         sectors, the rows of cells extending across           the
valve from each sector to meet similar rows from the second sector
beyond.

1.  Farther Experiments and Remarks                  on the     Measurement
      of Heights by the Boiling Point of Water. By Professor
      J. D. Forbes.
   This paper      is   in continuation   of one   printed    in vol. xv. of the
Royal Society's Transactions.          The object of it is to test the cor
rectness of the method of observation, and of calculating the re
sults, there proposed      ; and to compare both with those of more recent
authors,   particularly of M. Regnault of Paris, and of Dr Joseph
 Hooker.
   The author finds the results of his subsequent observations in 1846
in the Alps, up to heights considerably above 10,000 feet, to agree
well with those previously published, made in 1842.               They combine
in showing a sensibly uniform fall of the boiling point at the rate of
1° for  543    feet    of ascent,* which differs only 6 feet (in defect)
from his previous determination.           The average deviation of the in-

    The agreement with M. Regnault's table is also extremely close;
and considering the ordinary limits of error of such observations, the
writer considers it nearly indifferent for elevations under 13,000                    feet
which method of calculation be used.
    The consistency of the results          shows that the method          of   observa
tion (which differs in some respects from that commonly used)                         and
the graduation of the thermometers were satisfactory.
    On carefully      examining       Dr Joseph Hooker's             detailed     results
(obligingly communicated by him), which that naturalist                     considered
to be incompatible      with Professor Forbes's formula, it is shown                 that
the inconsistencies of observation           are so considerable, that        it is diffi
cult to give a decided      preference to one formula rather than another,
for the purpose of representing them              ;   but that up to heights of at
least 13,000 feet, a linear formula, or one which assumes the lower
ing of the boiling        point to be exactly proportional              to the height,
seems to express the observations as well as any other ; and the rate
of diminution       is almost the same as that deduced from Professor
Forbes's   observation, or a lowering of 1° for 538 feet of ascent.
    The author     has  little doubt that M. Regnault's table (which                   was
not published when he last wrote) does really represent the law ac
cording to which water boils more accurately than the simpler linear
formula, though the difference is in most cases insensible.                      For    all
ordinary heights (or up to 12,000 feet) Regnault's table                         may be
 more accurately represented by the formula
                                      /.  = 535   T.
    Where h is the height in English feet, T the lowering of the boil
 ing point in Fahrenheit's degrees, reckoning from 212°.                         But he

                                          263
 finds that Regnault's      table may be represented in every case which
 can occur in practice, and with almost perfect accuracy, by the fol
 lowing formula, which it is nearly as easy to use             : —
                                  h =   517  T + T*.

        Right Rev. Bishop TERROT, V.P.,                    in the Chair.
      The following Communications                were read    : —
  1.   Some Observations            on the Salmonidae.         By John Davy,
        M.D., F.R.S., Lond. and Edin., Inspector-General of
        Army Hospitals.
     These observations are given in seven sections          : —
     In the     1st, the author treats   of  the air-bladder     of these fish, and
 the contained        air, which   he found,   in every instance that       he exa
 mined    it, to   be chiefly azote.
     In the 2d,      he points out a mistake he had fallen         into in the in
stance of the female fish, as regards its abdominal aperture, which,
 in a former paper he had described as open             only for the passage of
the ova      ; on  further examination     made on the larger species,       he has
ascertained, that though virtually closed, except during the spawning
time, it is not absolutely, either by a membrane or adhesion.
     In  the 3d, on the breeding localities of the Salmonidae, he states
his opinion, that running water is not essential to the hatching of
the ova, and he adduces          instances in proof and illustration.
     In  the 4th, which is on the variable time of the hatching of the
ova, he describes examples of difference as to time of the production
of the young fish under circumstances apparently                  identical, or cir
cumstances only very slightly different, tending to show the influence
of a vis insita in the several ova.
     In  the 5th, on circumstances and agencies likely to take effect on
the young        fish,   he notices two   trials, — one  on keeping the young
fish in darkness after quitting the             egg, which  had no marked in
fluence    ;   the   other,  on   keeping them in the       smallest     portion  of
water capable of covering them, in relation to the position of young
fish during a time of drought ; in one experiment life was pro
tracted 52 hours, in another 74.
     In  the 6th, on the food of the young fish, he endeavours to prove
that the food most suitable for them, and for which they are best

                                        268
fitted,   is  the   infusoria.     Young charr, under his observation, at
tained their perfect form and became fit to be set at large, to which
no food had been given, and were, it is presumed, after the absorp
tion of the yolk,        fed and nourished      by these   microscopic     animal
cules.
     In the last section,     he submits    some remarks     on the vexed ques
tion of the Parr, viewed as a species, and comes to the conclusion that
till  a parr   is  found propagating      its kind, proof must be held to         be
wanting of the existence of such a fish, a true species              distinct from
the salmon or sea-trout fry.
2. On the        Structural Character of Rocks.                Part III., em
        bracing Remarks on the Stratified Traps of the neigh
        bourhood of Edinburgh.               By Dr Fleming.
     The author referred, in      the first instance, to the character of stra
tification, illustrating the subject by specimens displaying the inter
 mittent character of the carrying agent and of the supply of mate
rial, pointing out the Hailes Quarry as furnishing the best example
in the neighbourhood of the repetitions of strata.                 He then stated
the views of Townson,          Whitehurst, and Jameson,        as to  the relation
 of tho trap rocks to the sandstones          with which they are interstrati-
fied.    He then took notice of a statement in          vol.  xiii. of the Trans
actions of the Society, recorded by Lord Greenock, that Edinburgh
may be considered          as a valley    of elevation, the trap rocks in         the
neighbourhood dipping outwards as from a common centre.                         This
opinion, he stated, was true in           reference to the rocks on the          east
and west sides of the city, but not true as to those on the south and
north, or at Blackford and Burntisland.
     Dr Fleming then stated that there           were  nine   masses    of trap     in
 the neighbourhood,         included  in the sandstones, all of them         having
 some    peculiar     structural   characters — viz.   Calton    Hall,    Salisbury
 Crags, Arthur's Seat, Lochend, Hawkhill, Blackford,                Craiglockhart,
 Corstorphin, and Granton.           At  this part of the paper he made some
remarks      on   the so-called    " outburst of trap'' of Inchkeith, stating
 that the island consisted of at least a dozen          of   beds   of trap alter
 nating regularly with acknowledged sedimentary beds of sandstone,
 shale, and limestone, containing organic remains.
     The author then commenced his survey of the stratified traps of

                                         269
the neighbourhood,          by considering     particularly the structural cha
racter    of the Calton,       or, as  it was termed at an earlier period,
the Caldton.         This trappean      mass   he regarded as extending from
(rreenside    to Samson's Ribs, including Heriot Mount, St Leonard's,
and the      Echoing Rock. The Calton-hill had been described by
Townson, Faunas St Fond, Jameson, Webster, Boue, Saussure,
Cunningham, Milne, and Maclaren.
   Dr Fleming then illustrated his views of the sedimentary charac
ter of the whole       hill, by tracing   on the Ordinance       map the coloured
spaces occupied by the twelve beds           of which the hill consists, assisted
by a coloured section.          The peculiarities     of each    bed  in regard to
its structure     and mineral      contents were pointed out        ;  and he con
cluding by noticing the four concretionary             masses    of columnar      ba
salt distributed        in the    deposit, and the more interesting          of the
simple minerals of the hill, especially the Sarcite of Townson, first
characterized from Calton specimens and afterwards                  known as Cu-
bizite and Analcime, exhibiting a specimen which he had procured
from the     hill when     a student at the    University.

       Right Rev. Bishop TERROT, V.P.,                       in the Chair.
    The following Communications                 were read     : —
 1.  Notes on some of the Buddhist Opinions and Monuments
       of Asia, compared with the Symbols on the Ancient
       Sculptured
                        " Standing Stones" of Scotland. By Thomas
       A. Wise, M.D.
    The general identity, in       idea and design, of the ancient monuments
of southern and western Europe with those of Hindostan, was shown
and illustrated by drawings of cairns, barrows, kist-vaens, crom
lechs, circles of stones, and obelisks, or, as they are frequently called,
standing stones, as found in both regions.             The connection between
the inhabitants of these regions was further shown by the physical
conformation of the races, by the similarity of many of their manners,
customs, and observances,         and   by the decided and     extensive affinity
of the Celtic, and other languages of western Europe, with the San
scrit.    The early connection which thus appears to have existed

                                      273
was shown    to indicate a  line of inquiry, by following which much of
the  obscurity, resting over the earliest monuments and history of
western Europe,     may be cleared away.           In particular,      reasons were
adduced for believing that the widely different doctrines             of Buddhism,
originating    in Asia, at a period when              some    intercourse was still
maintained between the cognate             but widely separated races, were
carried  westward     by missionaries, who, finding             the people unpro
vided with a written language, had recourse to symbols, already used
in the  East,   to express their   fundamental          doctrines.     The deity or
spirit (Buddha) was designated, as in India, by a wheel or circle ;
inorganic matter (Dharma) by another circle, or by a monogram,
formed   of the initial letters of the elements             ;   and organic matter
(Sangha)     by some    embryotic       form of        animal    or vegetable    life,
or by   a circle,   or  an   imperfect     crescent.       The symbol of three
single  circles is found in both regions            :    This triad is found in
India in the temple of Ellora, and other Buddhist temples, and in
Scotland on the      Kineller  stone.      In    the    progress of advancement
of the arts these simple      forms of symbols were               changed for tem
ples, and    idols were added    by the rich and powerful              Buddhists     of
Asia.
    Among the ruder and more ignorant inhabitants                   of Scotland,   the
arrangement of the symbols required to be altered, to suit the people
for whom      they were intended      :   Spirit and Matter continued          to be
 represented by two circles,      but connected by a belt, and crossed
by a bar uniting the extremities              of two sceptres, to indicate the
supreme power of these (according             to the     Buddhist creed) co-ordi
 nate and all-originating principles        ;   while organised matter was re
 presented    by a crescent, flower, a dog-like           embryo, or some other
 rude representation of life.
    The modifications of the serpent figure, and the Buddhist cross or
 sacred labyrinth, as symbols of the spiritual deity                ; and the occur
 rence of lions, camels, centaurs, with the honour paid to trees, &c.,
 on the ancient sculptured obelisks of Scotland, were also adduced as
 proofs of an oriental origin, or connection.
    Reasons were given for the number of these stones in that part of
 Scotland forming the ancient Pictish kingdom ; of which the inha
 bitants, after a temporary profession of Christianity, seemed to have
 declined from the faith.

2.   Note on the extent of our knowledge respecting the Moon's
             Surface.     By Professor C. Piazzi Smyth.
    Taking advantage of the special attention           paid   at present to
certain astronomical     disquisitions,  the author    called attention      to a
particular point connected with the moon, which was first stated by
the author of " The Plurality of Worlds," and then made by him
to prove that    the moon must be uninhabited,        and thence to lead to
the conclusion     that all the other     planets  were uninhabited         also.
This point was, that " observations having        been   made on      the moon
abundantly sufficient to detect      the change caused      by the growth of
such cities as Manchester       and Birmingham, no such changes             hav
ing   been   perceived,   the   theory  of non-habitation       may      be    in
dulged   in."
    But after having indicated the sort of appearance that           those col
lections of human habitations would         make when transferred         to the
moon, Professor      Smyth    proceeded   to show that tho registered         and
published observations of the moon are by no means sufficiently ac
curate to be used to test this question : and that they do show
changes, and often to a far greater amount than the mere building
of  a lunar  Manchester would occasion       : but such changes bear           the
impress of error      of observation.     More powerfully      still   was this
brought out, on comparing even the best of the published documents
with some manuscript drawings of the Mare Crisium in the                  moon,
 recently made at the Edinburgh Observatory         ; and the author hoped
that this statement of the imperfection of existing         maps    would    lead
 to observers generally applying themselves to improve        this important
 and interesting field of astronomy.
  3. On the    Interest strictly Chargeable for Short Periods of
               Time. By the Rev. Professor Kelland.
     Considerable attention has of late been     bestowed    on the equitable
 mode   of computing the interest which ought to be charged for             frac
 tional portions of a year.      Various opinions have been offered         rela
 tive to the solution of the problem.       The basis on which they mutu
 ally rest, and on which it appears to me that every solution of the
 problem must rest, is this — That the interest chargeable for any
                                   "
 fractional part of a year shall at the end of the year amount                to a

                                         275
sum which bears the same             proportion    to  the whole annual interest
that the period bears to the whole           year."     But there are considera
tions affecting, not the interest, but the principal,             which enter largely
into the solution of the problem.             The   date   at which      both interest
and  principal   are due is the end       of the year    ;  it  is evident, therefore,
that not only ought a less         half-year's    interest to be paid at the end
of the first six months than at the end of the second, but also that
the  principal itself,   if  repaid at the end of the first six months, is
less valuable for the next period than            it would      have been     if  suffered
to complete its year.         The solution of the problem              has accordingly
been made to depend on             the following      assumption      —"     That both
principal   and interest      recommence a new year at the date of the
payment of the latter."          I   believe  I  am correct in saying that this
is the form    in which the problem is usually solved, and I have no
objections to make to it ; but         I  can conceive circumstances, in con
nection with life assurance payments, to which it is not strictly ap
plicable  ; and   I have    thought that it would not be unacceptable to
those who take an interest in the subject,             if  I   presented    the solution
of the problem in a new form, obtained by viewing                          it in another
light.    With   the   practical     bearing of any solution,          I have no con
cern ;  it is the province     of the actuary       to ascertain, in any case pre
sented to   him, whether the        one or the other hypothesis is applicable.
But   I do not think it would be difficult to point out examples of the
 operations of banks and life assurance companies where the interest
 must be regarded as simply the payment of a sum before it has be
come due, the capital out         of which that sum          has accrued       being con
tinued in its steady progress to the end of the year.                     However this
 may be, whether the problem have a practical                     bearing or not, it is
easy to see the propriety           of the following       hypothesis       as the basis
 of a theoretical solution of the                     "
                                         question — That           the interest charge
 able for short periods of time may be deduced                     from considerations
 which affect the interest alone."           This hypothesis obviously presents
 us with the following problem, which we have solved : —
    Problem. — To find the interest which must be paid at the end
 of a fractional portion of a year, so that, being presumed to accu
 mulate at the same rate and            in the same way in which it has itself
 been produced,     it shall, at    the end    of the year, amount           to the exact
 portion of the whole annual interest which would then have                            been
 payable.     For example,       to find the interest of          L.100 for      a quarter

                                      276
of a year at 4 per cent., so that, at the end        of the year, it shall,    by
accumulating     in the same way, amount to         L.l.
   Let the interest of      L.l   for  a year,   payable     at the end of    the
year, be   i;  and let the interest for the first xth portion of a year,
payable at the end of the period, be        I„   then, we ought to have —
                            I* (l+Ii-.)=*»
                    or,      Ix+lxIl-x     = xi          .      .     .
                                                                             (1.)
   To  solve  this equation, substitute     1 — x for x, and there results
                          +    Ii-* = (!-«)»
whence, by subtraction,
                        xi-Ix = (l-x)i-ll-x                .      .      .
                                                                             (2.)
This equation shows that        the excess  of the proportional      part of   the
year's interest above the sum payable is the same for complementary
portions of a year.
    Substituting    the value of        from equation (2), we get
                                                    =xi
                             +

   The following Communications               were read    : —
1.  Some additional Experiments on the Ethers and Amides
   of Meconic and Comenic Acids. By Henry How, Esq.
   Communicated          by  Dr Anderson.
   The author commenced by alluding to his analysis of amidome-
conic acid in a previous paper, and to the objections urged against the
formula he had assigned to it.
   By referring to his former analyses, and to a later one, he showed
that the empirical formula of the acid could not be that suggested
by Messrs      Wurtz and Gerhardt, but that his results could only          lead
to that which he had       formerly given, namely—
                               C8i H89 °78N7-
   VOL.   III.                                                    Z

                                       278
    The discovery of     a new ammonia      salt of this acid, differing    from
 the yellow one formerly described, has led him to modify the rational
 formula of the acid     ; and he now gives for the acid and its two am
 monia salts the formulae,
 Meconamidic      acid,     6 HOC84 H24 N7 Q63 + 9        HO.
 Yellow ammonia salt,       6
                              NH4 OCg4 H24 N7 063 +        3 NH„     + 6 HO.
White         do.      do., 6 NH40, C84 H24 N7 063.
    He   added, however, that these formulae deviated much from what
analogy would lead us to expect ; and that this want of analogy with
other compounds could only be cleared up by farther investigation.
    He then described       an  amide, biamidomeconic      acid, obtained by
the action of ammonia on biethylated meconic acid.           Its formula     is —
                           H0C14H5Ns0,         + Aq.
    He mentioned also the formation of a black oily substance,               pos
sibly the triethylated     meconic acid.
    The next section of the paper treated of the action of             iodide of
ethyle in comenic acid, which yields the substance formerly described
as comenamic or ethylocomenic acid,         —
                            HOC4 Hs OC12 H2 08.
This the author considers       to be the true comenic ether.        On trying
to obtain an analogous amyle compound, he obtained what                  seemed
to be the same ethyle compound.
    He next stated that comenic acid,         heated to 300°    F.  with water
for some days, undergoes entire          decomposition, the products being
carbonic acid, and a shining black solid, not yet examined.
    He then described the action of hydrochloric acid         on comenic acid
and alcohol, which       yield a curious compound, which       crystallizes     in
long silky needles,     and the formula of which is —
                    C4  H6  OC13 H4   N07, 2HO      + HC1.
It  is readily decomposed,     yielding comenamic ether.       It  is therefore
a compound of that ether       with hydrochloric    acid.
    Comenamic ether is readily obtained from it by the action of am
monia on its hot aqueous          solution.    The ether forms        colourless
prisms, the formula of which is—
                             C4H5    OCnH4NOT.

                                                 279
By nitric acid it           is converted       into binoxalate              of ammonia.         When
 heated, it melts at above               400°       F.,   and       on    cooling,   concretes to a
crystalline         mass,       or sometimes takes the form of a pillared solid
mass.
   The paper concludes with                  a tabular     list of       the compounds described
in    it,
      with their formulae.
2.     On a Revision of the Catalogue of Stars of the                                          British
      Association.  By Captain W. S. Jacob, H.E.I.C.,                                          Astro
      nomer at Madras.                   Communicated                by Professor C. Piazzi
      Smyth.
      Afterbrief allusion to the importance of catalogues of stars in
                a
general, as the foundation of exact astronomy, the circumstances
connected with the publication of the important Catalogue of Stars
 by   the British Association were mentioned.
   Many of the materials were well known to be imperfect at the
time of printing, but that step, was thought, would strongly induce
                                               it
all astronomers to improve the defective portions.
      This has       since been found to be the case extensively, and the pre
sent paper          is   an important       contribution        to that end.
      After mentioning his practical methods of ensuring the greatest
possible accuracy, Captain Jacob describes the result of an examina
tion of     1   503 out of the 8377 stars of which the Catalogue of the Asso
ciation consists, and states that the large number 55 are altogether
missing in the sky, that 71 differ from their computed places                                       by
more than           2    sec.    of time, or 10" of N.P.D.                  ;   but that   the rest
are    all very exact, seldom differing                   by more than 0-2 of a second
of time.
      Some of the above  of large difference, he thinks caused by
                                    cases
proper motion, and recommends further observations at       future                         a
period, to settle the question.
3.     Notice of Ancient Moraines in the Parishes of Strachur
      and Kilmun, Argyleshire.  By Charles Maclaren, F.R.S.E.
      The first of the moraines referred                       to    is   in Glensluan,    a    valley
near Strachur,            about two miles and             a   half in length, and two-thirds
of a mile in breadth.               It   is   bounded on the east, west, and south
                                                                                       z   2

                                     280
sides by mountains from 800 to       2000 feet in height.    At the north
or lower end, where it opens into Glen Eck, there            is a series of
mounds of clay and gravel, crossing the valley like         embankments,
and spread over a space of about 1800 feet in length, and from 350 to
600 in breadth.        They are from 20 to 100 feet in depth. These
mounds have turned the river Sluan from its direct course down the
 middle of the valley, and forced it to cut a passage     towards the   east
 side.    They consist of piles of incoherent clay and gravel, mixed with
 blocks, all derived from the rock (mica slate) which bounds the valley.
 In form, materials, and position, they exactly resemble the       terminal
 moraines found at the foot of valleys occupied by glaciers         ; and   if
 found in a similar situation in the Alps, would be at once recognised
 as    terminal moraines.
      The other moraines are in Glenmessan, about 10 miles southward
  from Glensluan.       They consist, first, of two mounds of clay and
  gravel, mingled with blocks, stretching across the foot of Glenmessan
  like embankments, and of the height of 40 and 77 feet respectively ;
               of four other detached mounds, from 25 to 30           feet in
  secondly,
  height, scattered over a small plain or meadow, half a mile
                                                                      farther
  south.     In the valley of Glenmessan, grooved rocks, and other     marks
  of glacial action, are also found, and strengthen the conclusion,       that
   a glacier once occupied the valley, and produced the mounds of clay
   and gravel.

           The Right Rev. Bishop TERROT in the Chair.
        The following communications         were read  : —
    1 .  On the Properties      of the Ordeal Bean of Old Calabar,
                   Western Africa.       By Dr Christison.
        In various parts of Western    Africa it appears to   be the practice
    to subject to the ordeal by poison persons who come under suspicion
    of having committed heinous crimes.       On the banks of the Gambia
    river the poison used for the purpose is the bark of a leguminous tree,
    the Fillcea suaveolens of MM. Guillemin and Perottet.       In the neigh
    bourhood of Sierra Leone it is the bark of Erythrophlcum yuineense,

                                          281
 which some botanists have considered identical with the                     former      spe
 cies.    On the Congo river, Captain Tuckey found that either this
 species,   or an allied species of the same genus, was in constant use
 for the same purpose.           These barks, when their active constituents
are swallowed in the form             of infusion, sometimes            cause vomiting ;
and then       the accused recovers, and in that case is pronounced inno
cent      More generally the        poison   is retained     ;   and then the evidence
of guilt      is at the same       time condemnation and punishment                    ;  for
death speedily ensues.
    In   the   district of Old Calabar, the poison               used for the      trial by
ordeal is a bean, called Esere,           which seems to possess extraordinary
energy      and    very peculiar     properties.      It     has      been  lately     made
known to the missionaries sent             by the United Presbyterian               Church
in Scotland        to  the native tribes of Calabar            j  and to the Rev.         Mr
Waddell, one of these gentlemen, the author was chiefly indebted for
the materials for his experiments,              as well   as for information           as to
its effects on man.          According     to what the missionaries often saw,
this poison is one        of great energy, as it sometimes proves fatal in
half   an hour,       and   a single    bean    has proved sufficient         to occasion
death.       None recover who        do not vomit       it.       The greater number
perish.       On one occasion forty individuals were subjected to trial,
when a       chief died in suspicious circumstances, and only two re
covered.
    The author found the bean to present generally the characters of
a  Dolichos.      It  has been grown at his request both by Professor Syme
and at the Botanic         Gardens     by Mr M'Nab         ;   and it proves to be a
perennial leguminous creeper, resembling                 a dolichos, but        it  has not
yet flowered.         The   seed weighs about forty or              fifty grains.      It is
neither bitter, nor aromatic, nor hot, and differs little in taste from a
haricot bean.        Alcohol removes its active constituent, in the former of
an extractiform matter, amounting              to 2-7 per cent, of the seed.             The
author could not obtain an alkaloid from it by any of the simpler
processes for detaching vegetable alkaloids.
    By experiment on animals, and from observation of its effects
on himself,       the   ordeal    bean   has    a double         action on the animal
body   :   it paralyses the heart's action, and it              suspends    the power of
the   will over the muscles, causing paralysis.             It is   a  potent poison, for
twelve grains        caused   severe symptoms       in his own person, although
the poison        was   promptly     evacuated     by   vomiting,        excited by hot

                                         282
  water.     The alcoholic extract has the         same effect and action with
  the seed itself.
  2.   Experiments on the Blood, showing the effect of a few
      Therapeutic Agents on that Fluid in a state of Health
      and of Disease.         By James Stark, M.D., F.R.C.P.
      The author    stated that when he commenced these experiments, in
  1832, his object was to ascertain,       first, what effect different   diseases
 had on the constitution of the blood         ;  and, secondly, what effect va
 rious therapeutic agents had on that fluid in a state of health and
  of disease.     As the experiments of Andral and others, published
 since these experiments were commenced, had done much to eluci
 date many points of the first subject of inquiry, the author limited
 this communication to a small portion of the latter inquiry.
     The effect of bloodletting on the constitution of the blood in pneu
 monia was first described.         It was shown that each successive blood
 letting increased the proportion of fibrin in the blood, which fibrin
 was already in excess in consequence           of the existence of the inflam
 matory disease.        Finding that bloodletting had always this effect          in
 inflammation,     the author made experiments on the healthy subject,
 to ascertain whether       bloodletting   had any effect on the constitution
 of the blood, and found that it produced an increase in the propor
tion of fibrin as compared with the other solids of the blood.                  On
 bleeding sheep rapidly to death, the suddenness of the death pre
 vented the increase being very marked ; but when the same animals
were bled slowly to death, the fibrin in the last drawn blood was
found to be nearly a third greater           relatively to the other solids of
the blood than in the first drawn blood.
     To illustrate this part of the subject, the author pointed out the
bearing of these experiments in the treatment of a few diseases, as
inflammations,       apoplexy,   haemoptysis,       purpura,  and   hemorrhage
from a divided blood-vessel       ; and also their bearing       on the pheno
mena of inflammation.
     The  effects of alkalies and alkaline carbonates      on the blood, and in
the treatment of inflammatory           affections,    was  next noticed  ;  after
which the author passed to the consideration              of another   important
therapeutic     agent — mercury.
     He   showed    that when mercury was administered             internally,   it

                                          283
   caused a reduction in the proportion           of the fibrin of the blood   ; pro
   duced   a state  exactly the opposite of that caused by inflammation          — in
   fact, caused a state    of the blood exactly analagous to that existing in
   scurvy.     He therefore inferred that mercury would prove the most
  valuable    remedy in the treatment of inflammatory diseases ; and ac
  cordingly, in trying its effects,        first in pneumonia, and afterwards
  in other inflammatory        diseases,  he found, that just in proportion         as
  the mercury was absorbed, the excess             of fibrin in the blood, which
  had been produced         by the inflammation,        diminished,    and with   this
  diminution all the inflammatory            symptoms       subsided, and the cure
  went on satisfactorily.      As the object in      these cases was to produce a
  rapid   absorption     of the mercury,        the calomel      was given   in such
 small doses as not to act on the bowels (generally               the fourth   or the
 sixth    of a grain every hour), and in no case was it conjoined with
 opium.
      The paper      was concluded    by pointing out that these experiments
 gave no countenance         whatever to the doctrines of Hahneman,               but
 confirmed     the truth of the adage          of Hippocrates,     " that contraries
 are the cure      of contraries."
 3.   Extracts from a Letter from E. Blackwell, Esq., con
     taining Observations on the Movement of Glaciers of Cha-
     mouni in Winter.            Communicated by Professor Forbes.
    " The accessibility of the
                                    glaciers, even up to a considerable height,
is   at this season a question of mere physical force.                I have made
within the last few days two excursions into the region of perpetual
snow.      The first of these     was on the 6th       of January, and    was to the
summit of the glacier of Blaitiere, several hundred feet above the point
where     I had    noted the line of the neve in September and October               ;
the second was on the 13th, when              I  succeeded    in reaching the junc
tion   of the glaciers of Bossons and Tacconaz, near the Grands Mu-
lets.    This junction is exactly at the commencement of the neve, as I
remarked between the months of August and October, on six different
occasions,     when   I  passed there on my way to and from            Mont Blanc,
the Dome de Gouté, &c.            In  both these expeditions       I was struck by
the excessive      power of the sun     ; the greater apparent warmth, even
in the shade, as compared to the valley of Chamouni ; and the sud
den    chill which followed sunset.          There    was also much less snow at

                                                        284
these heights than in the valley, and                           I   have no hesitation          in saying
that in winter very little snow falls upon the higher summits.                                           The
snow-falls        in       the valley are             invariably brought          by a low creeping
fog, which comes up from                         Sallanches.         It    seldom   overtops the Col
de   Voza, and the Aiguilles appear bright and sunny in the                                         gaps of
the cloud.            It   is in   spring and autumn that                  these higher         peaks     are
powdered          by every storm             ;    now     the dispersing          clouds leave           them
as dark as before                they gathered.            I    fancy this winter is unusually
cold     ;   every one is crying                 out, and complaining               that the potatoes
are frozen in deep cellars.                       I   have seen Reaumur's               thermometer        at
—   25° at 5£ in the afternoon, and                             I   think it may reasonably                be
supposed that it may have fallen to                             —    30° during the night            ;   wine
has frozen on my table before a fire.                               In the      woods the trees crack
with the intense frost, and there                        is from     1\    to 3 feet      of snow in      the
valley without drifts               ;    on the glacier of           Blaitiere there is only             from
1    to 2 feet.
     " In     spite of all this cold the glaciers advance steadily.                                 The gla
cier de Blaitiere, terminating above the line of trees,                                         pushes     its
moraine in front of                it,
                        and seems to be on the increase.                                        Now       this

whatever under such circumstances                          ?

     I       will here state        a    few results of careful observation, and                    I    hope
that, even should they appear strange, you will yet consider them
worthy        of confidence.             I       have no theodolite,              but
                                                                                    I      have      a   pris

stations should you deem                   it     advisable.
     " The       torrent of Bossons has been quite dry ever since the begin
ning of November,                  and   I       have profited by this circumstance to                    en
deavour to determine the motion of the ice within the vault, nearly
in contact with the ground.                        I      believe     it   is   usually supposed that
the reason why the termination                             of a glacier           seems    stationary       in
summer,          is   that there the waste predominates over the supply.                                   It
seemed         to me,        therefore,          that    in winter,        when there          is   actually
no       waste   — the torrent being perfectly dry, and its subglacial                                    bed
even dusty        — the       end       of the glacier ought              to be thrust forward            into
the valley            by   the pressure behind.            I        accordingly,        with   some little
difficulty, fixed a station on the ridge or back of the glacier, near
the lower extremity      the result;   that the ice there is,
                                                          nearly sta                      is

                                           285

                                         in winter ;' — they only looked at the

   that the glacier is stationary
 end.     What    becomes,     then, of the ice continually         descending from
 above ?     Does it not go to thicken           the whole mass, accumulating
 behind the more rigid          portion    below, as water behind a dam           1   I
 have   no space to add more at present, but                                   I

day) an intermediate         station, for the purpose of determining            where
this comparative immobility           begins.      I have   noted my observations,
and   kept a register of weather, &c.            I  give one observation to show
the difference between          the middle and lower glaciers         : —
    From December 28 to January 11 — 14 days.

     Observations on       Mr BlackweWs Letter            by Professor Forbes.
   The cold described (—25°           to  — 30°    of Reaumur—       24£D to
                                                                              — 35£°
of Fahrenheit) — appears so excessive as to be unlikely ;                I have there
fore written to enquire if the thermometer could be depended on.
    It  is highly satisfactory that the superficial velocity of the glacier
of Bossons — about a foot in twenty-four                  hours — coincides closely
with the measurements of my guide, Auguste Balmat, some years
since, on the same glacier, at the same season.
    With respect to the ice of the glacier of Blaitiere, which is above
the level of trees — probably at least 7000 feet above the sea — being
still in motion, it merely confirms the deductions long ago made                    by
me as to the continuity          of glacier motion      even in winter.       And   as
to the apparent         paradox    of water remaining          uncongealed in the
fissures   of  the ice    at this season, though        I  have    nowhere affirmed
the    presence    of liquid water to be a sine qua non to the plastic
motion     of glaciers, it would be difficult to assert positively that it is
everywhere frozen in the heart of a glacier even in the depth of win
ter.     Heat,   we know, penetrates          a glacier (up to 32° and no fur
ther), not only by conduction, but much more rapidly by the perco
lation of water ; but cold penetrates solely by conduction, and that
according to the same law as in solid earth, though it may be more

                                         28(1
  rapidly.     Now, it   is known that at a depth         of 24 or 25       feet in the
  ground, the greatest summer heat has only arrived at Christmas.                       A
  similar retardation in the     effects  of cold must occur in glaciers.            Not
  a particle of water detained in the capillary fissures can                 be solidi
  fied until its latent heat has been withdrawn.
     The contrast the writer draws between the glaciers of Blaitiere
 and Bossons, the latter of which is some thousand feet lower in point
 of level, is curious and instructive.            The former,       he   says, appears
 the more active, and is pushing           forwards    its moraine ; whilst the
 latter, at its lower extremity, and in contact with                   the ground,       is
 scarcely moving at all.
     There is nothing of which         we   know less     than the cause        of    the
 seemingly      capricious   advance     and    retreat    of the extremities           of
 glaciers at the same time and under, seemingly, the same circum
 stances.
     In  the present case,   I   will only mention        as  a possible      explana
 tion, that the     glacier of Blaitiere probably          possesses     a continuous
 slope, from its middle and higher           region down to its lower extre
 mity.     But the Bossons, after its        steep descent from          Mont Blanc,
 proceeds    a long way on a comparatively            level embankment, which
 at an early period it cast up of its own debris, and in which                   it   has
dug itself a hollow bed in which          it nestles.      The angular slope            of
the bottom in contact with the soil is very probably much less than
in the      case of   the glacier    of Blaitiere.      Now, when winter             has
dried up the percolating         water, the viscosity of the mass              may     be
insufficient to drag it over the less slope although              it carries it     over
the greater.      That the motion of the         ice close to the ground should
be nearly nothing,      whilst   the   more superficial       part of the glacier
over-rides    it by its plasticity,  is as a separate fact quite        in accordance
both with theory and previous observation.
     But  as the snout, or lower end of the glacier          of Bossons, is almost
stationary, whilst the middle region is moving at the rate of a foot
a day, Mr Blackwell very pertinently asks,
                                                         " What becomes, then,
of the ice continually descending from above ? Does it not go to
thicken     the whole mass, accumulating           behind the more rigid por
tion below, as water behind a dam ?"               I answer,     undoubtedly     ;  and
he   will find this explanation given       ten years     ago   in my Travels in
the   Alps (2d edit.,   p.  386.)     Speaking      of the superficial       waste of
the glaciers in summer and autumn, and the manner in which it                     is re

                                         287
  paired before the ensuing spring,        I  there observed,   " The main    cause
  of the restoration       of the surface    is the diminished     fluidity of the
  glacier in cold weather, which retards (as we know) the motion of all
  its parts, but especially of those parts which move most rapidly in
  summer.         The disproportion of velocity throughout the length           and
  breadth    of the glacier   is therefore less, the ice more pressed together,
 and less drawn         asunder  ; the crevasses    are consolidated, while the
 increased friction       and viscosity causes the whole to swell, and espe
 cially the      inferior  parts, which are the most wasted."         — (See   also

 1.   On the Mechanical Action of              Heat: — Supplement to the
         first Six Sections, and Section Seventh. By W. J. Mac-
          queen Rankine, Esq., C.E., F.R.SS. Lond. and Edinb.
     This paper is written in continuation of        a series of papers,  of which
six sections have already been published            in the Transactions of the
Royal Society of Edinburgh.
     It   commences      with some   articles supplementary to the first six
sections,    and intended to apply to the theoretical principles contained
in them to the extensive and precise experimental data which have
been obtained in the course         of the last two years.
     Article     65   relates to the Absolute      Thermometric      Scale and to
Thermodynamic           Functions.     The Absolute      Thermometric     Scale is
a scale,    the temperatures on which, according to one definition,             are
proportional to the actual quantity         of energy   possessed by any given
substance      in the form of heat, divided by the real specific heat of the

                                            288
substance, a constant co-efficient, and, according to another definition,
are proportional         to the tendencies of heat to disappear             in producing
mechanical effects.            These definitions      are   substantially    equivalent.
The recent experiments of Messrs Joule and Thomson have confirmed
the anticipation,        that absolute temperatures, as thus defined, agree
with those measured by the variation of pressure of a perfect                        gas ;
they have also proved, what could only be conjectured                       before, that
the absolute zeros of heat and of gaseous pressure sensibly coincide.
The author, from          a revision     of M. Regnault's       experiments         on the
elasticity of gases, concludes the most probable value of the absolute
temperature of melting ice to be —
                     274° Centigrade = 493°-2 Fahrenheit.
Messrs Joule and Thomson,                from their    experiments on the cooling
of   gases by free expansion, deduce the              value—
                    273° 7 Centigrade = 492°-66 Fahrenheit.
The difference between           those values is practically       inappreciable.
     A    Thermodynamic        Function     is a function      of the condition of          a
substance,     such that the heat absorbed         by the substance during            any
small variation         of condition     represented, in units of work, by             the
product of the corresponding             variation    of the thermodynamic           func
tion into the absolute temperature.               A   thermodynamic function          con
sists of two parts-         The first is connected with the heat stored             up as
actual heat in the substance, and is simply the product of the real
specific   heat by the hyperbolic logarithm of the absolute temperature.
The      second is what has been employed in the previous sections of the
paper, and in a paper on the centrifugal                theory of elasticity, under
the name of Heat-potcntial,              being a function the product of            whose
variation     into the absolute temperature             represents heat converted
into mechanical work.
     The complete value of the thermodynamic                   function     for a   given
substance     is,
where      ft
           is   the real specific heat,     r   the absolute temperature,        P    the
pressure, and       V   the volume   ;    and the fundamental equation of             the
mechanical action of heat, previously given in various forms, may                      be
expressed as follows —     :

where    d-H is the quantity of energy required, in the form of heat,
to produce    the variation   d.*.
    In article 65-a,     a new form       of the thermodynamic          function    is
pointed    out, in which    the pressure       and absolute temperature           are
taken as independent variables           instead of the volume and absolute
temperature.       It is as follows   :—
               *=(*+^)hyp.log.,-/^>,
and is useful in solving      a particular    class of questions.       P0 and V0
are respectively the pressure and volume of the given substance at
the   absolute temperature r0 in the state of perfect gas.
    In article 66, the constants in the formulae deduced                   from the
hypothesis     of molecular vortices for the elasticity of carbonic              acid
gas are revised, and adapted to the corrected               position of the abso
lute zero   ;  the result   being expressed by the following           very simple
law   : —
    The diminution      of the elasticity    of carbonic acid gas, produced
by the mutual attraction of its particles, varies directly as the square
of its density, and inversely as its absolute temperature.
    These constants are determined solely from the experiments of
M. Regnault on the increase of pressure between 0°and 100° Centi
grade of carbonic acid gas of constant density, and in the specific
gravity and specific heat of the gas.              The results of the formulae
are then compared, and found to agree most closely                with those of the
following sets of experiments        :—
     1. Those of   M. Regnault,       on the expansion        of carbonic    acid gas
at constant pressure.
     2. Those of    M. Regnault,      on the compressibility       of carbonic   acid
gas.
     3. Those    of Messrs Joule and Thomson, on the cooling of car
bonic    acid gas by free expansion.         The results of the last set of ex
periments were anticipated         by means of the formula.

     The Seventh Section of the paper follows, being              on the   Ther
 mic Properties of Vapours.
     Article 68 relates to a principle, the first idea of which          was im
 perfectly     suggested by      Carnot,  and more fully developed by M.
 Clausius.       By the aid of improved knowledge of the laws of              the
mechanical action of heat, it is now stated as follows : —
     The latent heat     of evaporation, in units of mechanical work, of
so much of a substance as fills, in the state of vapour, unity of
space more than it fills in the liquid state, is the differential co
efficient   of  the pressure    with respect   to the hyperbolic   logarithm of
the absolute temperature.
    In  article 69 the new form of the thermodynamic            function, given
in article 65 a, is employed to determine the precise law of variation,
with the boiling-point, of the total heat of evaporation from a fixed
temperature ; a law of which the approximate form, applicable to a
substance     whose vapour is a perfect gas, and very bulky as compared

                                          291
  with its liquid, was     first investigated by the author in          the   third  sec

      In article 70 there     is deduced from the new form          of the thermody
  namic function,      a law called    that of the      " Total Heat
                                                                           of  Gazefica-
  tion,"   which  includes,    as a  consequence,      the  law  of the   total  heat of
 evaporation.        The total heat of gazefication           of a given substance,
 under     constant     pressure, between        two given temperatures,          is the
 heat which must be communicated               to the substance      in order    to con
 vert   it from the liquid or solid state at the lower temperature, to
 the   state of perfect gas at the higher temperature, — evaporation
 taking place       at   the boiling point corresponding             to   the constant
 pressure under which the whole operation is performed.                     When the
 bulk of the substance (as is the case for all known substances) is very
 small in the liquid or solid state, as compared with its bulk in the
 state   of perfect   gas, the    total heat of gazefication, under constant
pressure, between         two given temperatures, does not sensibly vary
 with the pressure.
     This law is of great importance              in connection with the employ
 ment of super-heated vapours to drive machinery.
     In article 71 are given formulae, founded on the experiments                      of
M. Regnault, for computing the pressures of the vapours of aether,
bi-sulphuret of carbon, alcohol above 0°              c,  wator, essence of turpen
tine above 40° c., chloroform above             70°c., and mercury up to 358°c.
The table of constants for these fluids is extracted from a paper read
before the      British    Association    in September 1854, and published
in the Philosophical Magazine for December 1854.
     In article 72, it is shown how                these   formulae are applied        to
calculate     the latent heat     of evaporation for unity of         space.
     In article 73, it is    stated, that   if  the latent heat of evaporation of
unity of weight of a fluid be known by experiment for a given tem
perature of ebullition,        and the latent heat of evaporation for unity
of space be computed theoretically,            the volume of unity of weight of
the vapour at the given temperature               of ebullition may      be calculated
from these data.          This principle is applied to the latent heats of
evaporation, under atmospheric pressure, of aether, sulphuret of car
bon, and alcohol, as determined experimentally                 by Dr Andrews, and
of water, as determined             by  M. Regnault.          The results of       these
calculations are compared with those of computations founded on the
chemical composition          of   the fluids, and the supposition           that their

                                               292

    In       article   75, the      differences   between     the results of the             two
methods of computation for alcohol and water are considered                              as the

On an Inaccuracy (having its greatest value about 1") in the
       usual method of computing the Moon's Parallax. By
       Edward Sang.
     When,        as in the usual operation, the moon's observed                   zenith dis
tance is corrected for the effects              of atmospheric refraction,          the zenith
distance so obtained is that of the rectilineal part of the ray of light
between the planet and the upper surface of the air                       ;   and on apply
ing that correction, as at the Observatory, we do not obtain the direc
tion of the moon as it would have been seen                      if   there had been no
atmosphere, but that of a line drawn parallel to the first part of the
ray,      and therefore passing below the moon.                  The true direction            of
a straight line drawn from the observer to the planet, must differ

                                               293
   from this direction by the angle which               the curved part of the ray
   subtends at the moon's centre ; and the neglect of                  this angle may
   cause a     sensible error in estimating the parallax.
       It   is a well-known         property of refraction       by concentric    strata,
  that the perpendiculars           let fall from the centre of curvature           upon
  the   tangent to the path of light are inversely proportional                   to the
  indices      of refraction of the medium at the two points of contact.
      From this property it very easily follows that the sine of the
  true parallax is obtained by           multiplying the sine of the horizontal
  parallax by the sine of the observed zenith distance, and by the in
  dex of refraction          of the air at the Observatory.
      And       if  the   horizontal   parallax given in the almanac, instead of
  being the        half angle under which the earth would have                been   seen
  from the moon           if  there had been no atmosphere, had been the true
  horizontal parallax, or half the angle which, in the actual state                     of
 things, the          earth does subtend at the moon,          — the    true method of
 computing the parallax would only differ from the common one in
 the use       of the uncorrected instead of the corrected zenith distance.
      In the common formula, the multiplier is the sine of the zenith
 distance corrected for refraction           ;  in the true formula, it is the sine
 of the        uncorrected      zenith  distance, multiplied      by the index     of re
 fraction       of the air.
     For the purpose of obtaining the maximum error of the common
 formula,        it  is observed that when the moon           is in the     horizon, the
zenith distances being nearly 90°, have their sines sensibly equal to
each other, and that then the true multiplier                 must exceed the usual
one     in the ratio         of 3405 to   3404, — this     ratio   being the index of
refraction of air in its mean state                ; wherefore, at the horizon, the
parallax, as usually computed, must fall short of the true parallax
by one         3404th part of itself.
     This ratio holds good for all planets            ;  and it is only in the case
of the moon that the error becomes sensible, being then almost ex
actly one second of an arc.

    1 . On Annelid Tracks in the Exploration          of the Millstone
          Grits in the South-west of the County of Clare. By
          Robert Harkness, Esq., F.R.S.E., F.G.S., Professor of
          Geology, Queen's College, Cork.
    The author remarks that the existence of Annelida during          the
Palaeozoic formations is manifested in two conditions.       In the  one,
we have the shelly envelope which invests the order Tubicola,      in the
form of Seapolites ; and in the other, the tracks of the orders Abran-
chia and Dorsi-branchiata      are found impressed on deposits which
were, at one time, in a sufficiently  soft state to receive the impres
sions of the wanderings of these animals.
    Among the strata which have hitherto afforded annelid tracks,
those which, in the county of Clare, represent a portion of the equi
valents of the Millstone   Grit, contain such tracks, in their most  per
fect state of preservation in great abundance     ; and these strata also
furnish evidence concerning the circumstances which prevailed during
their deposition.
     The locality of these strata is the neighbourhood of Kilrush,     on
the banks of the Shannon,       in the southern  portion  of the  county.
Here the deposits consist of strata which have       a flaggy character   ;
and these have been extensively wrought at Money Point, about four
 miles east from Kilrush, and they supply the flags which are com
 monly used in the towns of the south of Ireland.         The  beds vary
 somewhat in their nature, and with this circumstance they present
 different phenomena.
     The annelid tracks occur in three conditions.     When they   are in
 their most perfect state, in the faces of the higher flags, which are
 of a greenish gray colour, they have the form of meandering tracks,
 about half an inch across, and their margins crenated.        A distinct
 raised line traverses the centre of these tracks, and the interval be
 tween this line and the crcnations is marked by a succession    of other

                                         205
    lines at right angles to the centre one      ;  and these     seem to have had
   their origin in the rings of the body of the annelid.
       The nature of the tracks as they occur in the lower flags, which
   are dark-coloured, is somewhat different.             On the upper surfaces of
   these they appear also in the form of sinuous furrows,                 about the
   same width as the more perfect tracks of the higher flags.                   Here,
  however, they rarely present crenations, being regular on their
  margin, and having, in many instances, the impression of the ventral
  arch distinct.
       The various appearances of the tracks, and the nature of the strata
  with which these are associated, furnish some important information
  concerning     the conditions which     obtained when this portion of the
  Millstone Grit series      was  being deposited.         The tracks, from their
  various states of perfection, indicate that, in some instances, the mud
  which    now constitutes     these  flags had been in different         states, as
 concerns     consolidation,   at the time when        it was  traversed by these
 animals.      It  sometimes appears to have been in a state           so saturated
 with water that it assumed a pasty condition, partly flowing in upon
 the tracks after these had impressed its surface, and obliterating the
 markings of the cirri.         At other times it seems to have been suffi
 ciently consolidated     to afford the requisite conditions for more perfect
 tracks,   as in the case of the higher greenish-gray          flags.
      The animals which impressed          these    Irish flags appear     to have
 been widely different from those which have burrowed in the deposits
which now form the flags of the lower portion of the Lancashire coal
field, since, in these latter, neither the entrance into the burrows nor
the burrows themselves, equal the annelid burrows of the flagstone of
Clare ; the former having only a diameter of one-fifth of an inch, and
being apparently round, while the latter are half an inch in breadth,
and have their form flattened longitudinally, which gives to them, on
transverse     section, the lenticular shape       already referred to.      From
their crenulated margins, which would indicate that the cirri were
more     perfectly   developed in the annelids         to which     we  owe    these
tracks, it would     seem that they are more nearly allied to those which
have impressed the strata of the older formations, than to such as
have left their markings on the English carboniferous deposits               ;   and
if we    adopt the general appellation of      Sir Roderick Murchison, they
might be considered as the carboniferous type of             the ancient  Nerites,
and be designated Nerites carbonarius.

that the method     is not deficient   in variety of demonstration of        the
same fact.     This position  was illustrated    by the exhibition of twelve
totally  different   demonstrations     of the problem,      " To    cut three-

3. On the      Colouring Matter of the Rottlera tinctoria. By
    Professor Anderson, M.D., Regius Professor of Chemistry
    in the University of Glasgow.
    The Rottlera tinctoria    is a large   tree which is found distributed
over the whole Indian peninsula, and is particularly          abundant in    the
hill jungles of Mysore, Canara, and Malabar.             The fruit,    which   is
about the size of a pea, is covered with curious stellate hairs              and
red glands, which are easily separated by rubbing, and           form   without
further preparation the colouring matter which is sold in the          bazaars.

    The colouring matters consist of at least three different substances.
    1. A crystallizable matter extracted by ether, to which the author
gives the name of Rottlerine.        It forms a mass of yellow crystalline
scales, having a fine satiny lustre.        Insoluble in water, sparingly
soluble in alcohol, and readily in ether.       It dissolves in alkaline solu
 tions with a deep red colour, but does not form definite compounds
 with the metallic oxides.    It  is decolorized by bromine      with the   pro

corresponding     with the formula       C22 H10 06     ; but the impossibility
of forming compounds renders it impossible            to ascertain whether this
correctly represents its constitution.
    2. When the colouring         matter is boiled with alcohol the pheno
mena are materially      different   ; for the filtered solution deposits,      on
cooling, a pale flocky amorphous          substance,    which is obtained pure
by repeated crystallization.        It is insoluble in water, readily soluble
in hot, sparingly in cold alcohol, and scarcely at all in ether.               Its
analysis gave results which agree with the formula C40 H34 08.
    3. The red alcoholic solution from which the flocky matter                has
been separated leaves       an   evaporation   or dark red amorphous resin,
melting at 212°.      It    gives a red precipitate       with acetate of lead,
but the compound could not be obtained of definite composition, and
it seems not improbable that the resin may be a mixture of several
different    substances.     The author found the proportion             of oxide
of lead   to vary between      18-67 and 34 per cent., according to the
conditions    under which      the precipitation was effected.         The resin,
on analysis, gave results which agree pretty well with the formula
Ct0 Hg0 014, which is in accordance with the lowest proportion of
oxide of lead obtained from its compound, but none of the other re
sults can   be brought into relation with       it.
    The colouring matter of the Rottlera belongs           to the class   of sub
stantive dyes, and does not require the intervention              of a mordant.
It  gives a very fine flame colour on silk, but to calico, with or with
out mordants, it gives only a pale fawn colour, entirely devoid of
beauty.     The author considers it worth the attention of silk dyers
in this country.

     The following Communications                   were read   :   —
1.   Experiments on Colour as perceived by the Eye, with Re
      marks on Colour-Blindness. By James Clerk Maxwell,
      Esq., B.A., Trinity College, Cambridge. Communicated
         by Professor Gregory.
     These experiments      were made with the view of ascertaining and
registering the judgments        of the       eye   with   respect to colours, and
then, by a comparison       of the results with        each other, by means           of a
graphical construction, testing the accuracy of that theory of the
vision of colour which analyses the colour-sensation into three ele
ments,  while it recognises no such triple division in the nature of
light, before it reaches the eye.
   The method of experimenting consisted in placing before the eye
of the observer two tints, produced by the rapid rotation                of   a system
of discs of coloured paper, arranged so that the proportions of each
of the component colours could be changed at pleasure.                        The ap
paratus       used was   a simple top, consisting of a circular plate                  on
which the coloured discs were placed, and a vertical                     axis.        The
discs consisted of paper painted with the unmixed                    colours used in
the arts.       Each disc was slit along a radius from centre to circum
ference, so that several could        be interlaced, so as to leave exposed             a
sector   of   each.   The larger     discs,    about 3 inches diameter,           were
first combined and placed on the disc, and the smaller, about                          1|.
inches diameter above them, so as to leave a broad ring of the
larger discs visible.
     When the top     was spun the observer could compare the resulting
tint of the outer and inner circles, and by repeated                adjustment, per
fect identity    of colour could    be obtained.The proportions of each
colour were      then ascertained, by reading off on the circumference of
the top, which was divided         into 100 parts.         As an example,        it   was
found on one occasion,      that, —

    By experiments            on   various individuals,                it     was found (1.) that a
good eye could        be depended             upon within two of these                    divisions, or
hundredths,      at most;          and    that      by repetition              of experiments             the
average result might be made much more accurate.
    (2.) That    the difference of the results                    of experiments           on different
individuals     was       insensible,      provided          the light used              remained         the
same.
   (3.) That when different kinds of light were used, or when the
resultant tints were examined with coloured glasses, the results were
totally changed.
    It   follows from this that the cause         of the equality of the result
ing tints is not a          true optical identity of the light received by the
eye, but must be            sought for in the constitution of the sense of sight.
The materials         for this inquiry are to                be    found in the equations                  of
colour of which the above is an example, and these are to be                                        viewed
in the light of Young's theory of a threefold sensation of colour.
    The first       consequence          of this theory            is,   that between          any four
colours an equation can be found, and this                               is   confirmed        by   experi
ment.
    The    second     is,   that from two equations containing different                            colours
a third may be obtained                  by   the ordinary rules, and that this                          also
will agree with experiment.                    This      also was found to be true                   by   ex
periments       at Cambridge             which      include       every combination                 of    five
colours.
    A    graphical        method was then described, by which, after fixing
arbitrarily the positions of three                        standard            colours,    that      of    any
other colour could be obtained by experiments                                 in which    it   was made
to form    a   neutral gray along with two of the standard colours.                                        In
the diagram          so                  of any compound tint
                            formed, the position                  the                                is
centre of gravity of the colours of which      composed, their masses
                                                                  it   is
being determined              from the equation,                 and the resultant               mass        of
colour being the sum of the component masses.                                       The   colour-equa
tions represent the fact that the same tint may be produced                                          by   two
different      combinations.             This diagram             is     similar to those            which
have been given by Meyer,                 Hay, and Professor                   J.   D. Forbes,       as the
results of mixing colours.                    It   is    identical          with    that proposed           by

                                        301
Young, and      figured    in his Lectures     on  Natural Philosophy.        The
original conception, however, seems to           be due   to Newton, who gives
the   complete    theory, with an       indication    of a construction    in his
Optics.
    The success of this method depends             entirely on the truth of the
supposition that      there are three elements of colour as seen by the
eye, every    ray of the spectrum         being capable of exciting     all three
sensations, though      in different    proportions.     It is at present impos
sible to define the colours         appropriate    to these   sensations, as they
cannot be excited        separately.      But it appears probable that the
phenomena       of colour-blindness       are due to the absence of one of
these   elementary sensations, and,        if so, a comparison    of colour-blind
with ordinary      vision will show the relation of the absent sensation to
those   with which we are familiar.
    A method       was   then described, by which one observation            by a
colour-blind eye was made          to determine a certain point representing
the absent sensation, which thus appears to be a red approaching                 to
crimson.      The results of this hypothesis were calculated in the form
of  " equations of colour-blindness"          between    colours which   seem    to
defective eyes identical.         These equations were compared with those
previously     determined from        the testimony of two colour-blind        but
accurate observers,       and   found to agree with remarkable         precision,
rarely differing     by more than 0-02 in any colour.           The effect of red
and green glasses on the         colour-blind   was then described, and a     pair
of spectacles    having one eye red and the other green was proposed
as an    assistance to them in detecting doubtful colours.
2.   Notice of the Occurrence of British newer Pliocene Shells
    in the Arctic Seas, and of Tertiary Plants in Greenland.
    In a letter from Dr Scoular of Dublin. Communicated by
    James Smith, Esq., of Jordanhill.
    Dr Scoular writes       : —
     " I  have lately had the opportunity of examining a series of fossils
 from    high   arctic latitudes,    brought     home   by Captain    M'Lintock,
 R.N.      The series in       one sense is extensive, as there are       Silurian
 and oolitic shells, and also other fossils       of the tertiary times. Among
 these last there are some things which, I am sure, will be of interest
 to you.      Among the specimens are some recent and living shells

                                       302
from    Baring's   Island, of which       I  will    send  you a list when      I
determine     the   species.    In   the meantime,      I  may state   with full
confidence that the variety         called Mya udevallensis, so common a
fossil with us and in Sweden, is still a living species at Baring's Island.
The truncated form of the shell, and the palliar impressions, are
those of the M. udevallensis, and not those of the modern M. trun-
cata.     On the truth of this you may fully rely, and also that              the
shells were taken with the animal in them.
    " In the collection   there are also some fossil plants from Greenland.
They are not, however, carboniferous ; but to my surprise tertiary,
and of the same character as those of the Mull formation.                I could
not find any difference between them and the fossil leaves from Mull,
but   I  cannot at present command the paper by the Duke of Argyll;
however,    I  have not the smallest doubt        of the identity of the forma
tion and species."
 The following Gentleman was elected an Ordinary Fellow : —
             Dr  Wtville     Thomson, Professor of Geology, Belfast.
                          Monday, 2d       April     1855.
         Dr CHRISTISON, Vice-President, in the Chair.
    The following Communications                 were read    : —
 1. — Account of Experiments to ascertain the                        amount of
        Prof. Wm. Thomson's "Solar Refraction."                        By Prof.
        C. Piazzi Smyth.
    After alluding     to the excessive   difficulty   of ascertaining  the pre
                                          medium in space,       by planetary   or
 sence    and   nature of a resisting
 cometary     perturbations,     the author     reminded    the meeting of the
 statements made        in those rooms last year, that one of the conse
 quences to which the dynamical theory
                                                    of heat had led him, was
 the necessity of the existence of a medium filling space ; that such
 medium was but an extension of our own atmosphere, and must
                                                                               ex
 perience a condensation in the neighbourhood of
                                                             the sun ; and that
 there must consequently arise a certain refraction of any heavenly
  body seen through such medium.
     Impressed, therefore, with the importance of endeavouring             to get
  by these means some further light in regard to the long vexed ques

                                     303
tion   of the resisting     medium, Professor Smyth had instituted,
during    the last   summer, a series of observations on stars in the
neighbourhood of the sun.         Atmospheric    difficulties   had, however,
prevented much being done         ; and in the whole history of the ob
servatory, but one group of observations        available for the purpose
in view had been      found.    This, on being   subjected     to  special    cal
culation, has given two results, both confirmatory,         and indicating an
amount of solar refraction of O'-04 in right ascension, at a distance of
12 minutes of time from the sun.
2.   On the Extent to which the Theory of Vision requires us
        to regard the Eye as a Camera Obscura. By Dr George
       Wilson.
    The object of this communication was to combat the current
theory of vision, as exercised by vertebrate animals, in so far as it
teaches that the light which reaches the retina from without, there
after passes through that membrane, and is absorbed by the pigment
of the choroid behind it.
    The author first enumerated the arguments           adduced    in favour of
this view, such as,
     1. The difficulty in assigning    any other use for the choroid than
that of absorbing the light which falls upon it.
     2. The advantages known to result in artificial camera obscura
from the internal darkening of their walls.
     3. The confusion which must attend visual perception,                 if the
rays by which objects are seen are reflected several times across the
chamber of the eye, so as to repeat, on different points of the retina,
 the image of a solitary object.
     4. The painful     and imperfect    vision known      to characterize     the
 human albino.
     The author then     proceeded  to state that a mass     of evidence,    daily
 accumulating,     had established, beyond question, the certainty that
 light is reflected from the anterior layers of the retina and from the
 choroid, and so abundantly, that oculists take daily advantage of the
 fact, to examine, by means of this light, the deeper internal             struc
 tures of the eye.
     This organ, accordingly, cannot be regarded otherwise than in a
 limited sense as a camera obscura, and the arguments in favour of

                                      304
the opposite belief were shown to furnish           no  substantial   support of
the current opinion.       Thus, the    eyes   of albino animals     were found
to exercise   vision   perfectly,  although      destitute  of pigmentum ni
grum ; and the       presence   of the tapetum lucidum, which acts             like
a concave     metallic reflector in the eyes of many creatures,                was
shown to furnish       no  obstacle to sight, which,       on  the other hand,
it rendered more     acute when    light   was feeble.     The supposed       cross
reflection of light within the eye was also shown to be a phenomenon
 which could rarely occur      so as to  disturb vision, since the majority
of the reflected rays would simply retrace the course which they
took on entering the eye, and pass out through the pupil as they
passed in through it ; and the few which diverged so much as to
fall  on the back of the     iris, the ciliary    processes   and the anterior
lateral surface of the choroid, would be caught upon the darkest and
least reflecting portion of the interior of the eye, and undergo in
greater part absorption, whilst such as were not thus stopped, and
those which underwent lateral reflection from the bottom             of  the eye,
would be irregularly dispersed over the entire retina, and only lessen
its general sensitiveness without       repeating the images of objects on
single points of its surface.
    The author finally urged that the reflection of light from                  the
bottom of the eye served         important     ends, especially   in the lower
animals.     Those ends he held to be       ; —
    1.  The return from the choroid of light through the retina,             so as
to double the impression on the latter.
   2.   The reflection of light      on  external    objects, which     was best
seen in creatures whose eyes are provided            with tapeta lucida,       and
acted alike as an assistance to them in finding          their food, and in     the
case of carnivorous     nocturnal   and marine animals, to their prey in
escaping from them.
    In  the human subject, it was contended that, in very faint light,
reflection from the bottom of the eye would assist vision, and that
the known delicacy of visual perception,           which    characterised those
who had been       long    imprisoned     in dark     chambers    or dungeons,
afforded an example of such assistance.             The author     also   insisted
on the fact, that,    as the reflected     light is always coloured, so      as in
the human eye to be bright red, yellowish-red, or brownish-red, and
in different eyes to a different degree ; and as we add from our eyes
coloured light to every object we gaze at, no two persons see the same
colour alike, or will exactly agree in matching tints. The existence

                                            305
  and   importance of such a chromatic                personal equation was dwelt
  on at some     length.

      The method employed was to mix one volume of the oil, two                        vo
 lumes alcohol, and four volumes of strong aqua ammoniae                  in   a stopper
 ed bottle,    and placing it in a moderately warm situation, the stopper
 being tied down.       Occasional agitation is required.         After a time, vary
 ing with the    oil employed, there      is formed a    whitish solid matter, which
 increases    in amount      as the oil     diminishes.        Finally, the whole      be
 comes   nearly solid.
     The mass is collected on a cloth filter, washed with a little water,
 and squeezed,      and the residue dissolved in warm              alcohol   ;  the crys
 tals deposited      on   cooling    are washed first with dilute spirit, then
 water, and      again    expressed, and        this   was repeated     till   a resinous
 matter was removed, which adheres obstinately to the product.
     The amides thus formed, when pure, are white,                    and permanent
in the     air, but   if  any of the      resin     be  present, they soon        become
yellow and resinous.
     The quantity obtained            from    different    oils varied   much.        The
drying oils yield less of the amides and more resin than the fat oils.
     The oils hitherto      examined are almond oil, linseed oil, poppy oil,
cod-liver oil, seal oil, and croton oil,            besides   almond oil and       castor
oil after solidification      by nitrous acid.
     The author describes the properties              and gives the analytical         de
tails of the amides thus produced, and the results are summed up as
follows   : —
        Linseed oil,
        Poppy oil, and        I yield margaramide ;

         Castor oil             yields ricinolamide ; and
        Almond oil and \ after solidification by nitrous j elaidamido and
        Castor oil           J            acid, yield              \ palmamide ;

   lamide.
      The melting points of        these amides    were found as follows     : —
             Margarainide                      103° C.    (60°  C. Boullay)
             Palmamide      and Elaidamide,      94° C.
             Oleamide                           82° C.
      The author      considers   the melting points ascribed to ricinolamide
  (66° C.)   and isocetamide       (67° C), by Boullay, are below the truth.
      The  researches     of the author are not yet completed, and the re
  sults of experiments now in progress will be given on a future                occa

  1.  Notice       of some new Forms of British Fresh- Water
     Diatomaceae.          By William Gregory, M.D., F.R.S.E., Pro
     fessor of Chemistry.
     The author      stated that he had examined, more or less minutely,
 nearly 300 fresh-water gatherings, and that he had found in                    these
 very nearly all the known British species, besides a number not                   yet
 described.      He   mentioned     that, from the want of figures, it was      often
 difficult to know whether a form were new or not.               Thus, Pinnularia
 latestriata,    found by the author two years since in the             Mull   earth,
 had been considered        as a new     species by   all British naturalists, as
 well as several foreign ones        ; yet in Ehrenberg's last work, " Mikro-
geologie"     it  is figured as    P.  borealis, and as having been described
by Ehrenberg ten or twelve years ago.                The papers of that author,
in the Berlin Reports and Transactions, are not generally accessible.
Ehrenberg describes this species as being one of two found scattered
in every part of the world, and in almost every locality, more uni
formly than any others         ; which is confirmed by the author's observa
tions in this country.         Yet, although a remarkable          and  conspicuous
form, it had escaped         notice in Britain till 1852.           This shows     the
necessity    of minute search, without         which the scattered       forms    are
sure to be overlooked.
     The  new forms were described          in three sections.

      The whole of the            above     species,            with    the few exceptions above
noted, were illustrated              by
                             highly finished drawings, made from nature
 by   Dr Greville, and enlarged to scale of 10,000 times the natural
                                                    a
linear dimensions.
  The author concluded by making some observations on the distri
bution of fresh-water Diatoms, and showed by various examples that
it    is   often quite easy to determine the characters of                      a   species,     if
                                                                                                  these
be well marked, even when                   it    occurs sparingly or scattered, and that
when        a   form   is   once noticed, we are pretty sure to find                   it    soon after
in    greater abundance.               To show the value of minute search,                     he stated
that although           most of the above new species                          occurred      in several
gatherings,        yet in point of fact, nearly the whole of them had been

                                       308
observed   in a detailed exploration of only four gatherings, those, name
ly, from Elgin, Elchies, Lochleven, and Duddingston Loch. Nay,
he had found them all, except only one or two, by degrees, in the
Lochleven     gathering   alone, and a very large proportion        of them in
each  of the three others.    So that,  if his observations had been confined
to these four gatherings, or even to that of Lochleven,          it would    have
been possible to recognise and distinguish         nearly all the species here
mentioned.
    The   above  list of forms   is entirely exclusive   of those very nume
rous and varied ones, occurring, however, in many of the gatherings
examined by the author, as above described, which he has elsewhere
united together, described, and figured, under the name of Navicula
varians.
    The figures of Navicula elliptica, Kutz.,          and   its very striking
varieties,   as the   author   had observed      them in the study of       these
gatherings, were referred to, in order to prove that certain             species
vary not only in form or outline, as in the case         of Navicula    varians,
Pinnularia divergens, and many others, but also in general aspect, in
the number of striae in xsVsth of an inch, comparing two frustules
of equal size, in the structure of the median line, and in that of             the
central or terminal nodules.
2. On    Glacial Phenomena in Peebles and Selkirk Shires.                      By
                Robert Chambers, Esq., F.R.S.E., &c.
    In  this short paper, the author presented facts, from which                he
thought himself entitled to infer that the Silurian mountain tract               of
 southern    Scotland   falls entirely    into  his views regarding      ancient
 glacial operations in the country generally, as expounded in a paper
 read to the Royal Society of Edinburgh, in December 1852, and
 published    in the Edinburgh      New Philosophical      Journal    for April
 1853.     He showed that the compact boulder clay, which he regards
 as the detritus    of the early and general       glaciation of the   country,
 exists in the valleys of this district, and in passes amongst the hills,
 up to those of Glenlude and Tweedshaws, which are respectively             1 152
 and 1352 feet above the mean level of the sea.              Striated  boulders
 from Glenlude and Tweedshaws            were   brought   before the Society.
 The rounded form of the hills, and the horizontal                mouldings     or
flutings which are       seen along the faces      of many of them,      he  con

                                            309
   aiders as   other memorials of the operation in question.            Tho nature
   of the rocks      is unfavourable for the preservation         of smoothed and
   striated surfaces ; but        Mr  Chambers      had found one     such on the
   border   of St Mary's Loch in Selkirkshire, 800 feet above the sea.
   On the assumption           that the hills had been shorn and rounded by
  moving ice,      it appeared from the high inclination of the strata, as
  exhibited     in a copy of Professor Nicol's section of the district, that
  the    amount of denudation           fully equalled the remarkable      examples
  adduced      by Professor      Ramsay in regard       to  South Wales     and the
  Mendip hills.         Finally, Mr Chambers described          an example of the
  later and     limited operations of ordinary glaciers, in the elevated
  moor of     Loch Skene, a tarn formed and retained by a moraine.
  3.   Preliminary Notice on the Decompositions of the Platinum
          Salts of the Organic Alkalies.                By Thomas Anderson,
          M.D., Regius Professor of Chemistry in the University
          of Glasgow.
     The following pages are intended merely as a preliminary notice
 of an investigation, which has occupied me for some time past, and
 which,      though     still  too incomplete     for publication   in full, is suffi
ciently      advanced      to   render    obvious the    general character     of the
results,      although,      from   the   extensive   and   elaborate nature of the
inquiry,       a very considerable time must elapse            before it is complete
 in all the requisite details.
      It  has been known for some years that the platinum                salts of the
organic alkalies are decomposed              when boiled with excess of bichloride
of platinum        ;  and with narcotine, the only one as yet examined, the
action is a true process          of oxidation,   yielding results similar to those
obtained by treating the base with peroxide             of manganese   or nitric acid.
The present investigation refers to the pure platinum                   salts, which
undergo an entirely different decomposition, the nature of which                     is
materially        dependent on the stability of the base.          Having observed
that the decomposition was more precise and definite                  when the less
decomposable bases were employed, and apparently calculated to af
ford the         key to the more complex           changes, which occur in other
cases,     I  have     hitherto   directed    my attention    more particularly     to
pyridine       and picoline,      which are so remarkable       for their stability,
     vol. in.                                                             2 b

                                                      310
and especially for the obstinacy                      with which they resist the                    action of
oxidizing agents.
   When the platinum salt of pyridine, carefully freed from excess of
bichloride of platinum is dissolved in hot water, and the solution kept
steadily         boiling   for    some          hours, a fine sulphur               yellow crystalline
powder begins to appear.                        After five or six days' continuous                       boiling
the whole of the platinum                       salt is converted into this substance,                         but
if the powder              be    filtered off before                  the change is complete,                  the
mother liquid on cooling gives a deposit of fine golden-yellow                                            scales
resembling iodide of lead.
   The yellow powder is insoluble in water and acids, and is                                             decom
posed by potash slowly in the cold, more rapidly on                                    boiling,     with the
evolution of pyridine.                 It   is the salt          of    a platinum       base,     analogous
to platinamine,            to which         I    give the name             of platinopyridine.                  Its
analysis gave          —

      It   is therefore     a    bihydrochlorate               of platinopyridine,           with the for
mula       C10    H3   Pt N      + 2   H CI,         and       the     decomposition which yields                  it
consists     simply in the expulsion of an equivalent of hydrochloric                                         acid,
as represented by the equation
            O10        N, H CI Pt CI.            =   C     ,   H. Pt N +     2   H CI + H          CI.
                                                                     escapes with extreme
      The equivalent of hydrochloric acid                                                 slowness,
but the change may be much facilitated by the addition of a sufficient
                                                                 it,                                 must          be
quantity of pyridine to combine with                                   although an excess
carefully avoided, as            it   produces       a   different decomposition, to be after
wards described.
      Platinopyridine            cannot be separated from                        the    bihydrochlorate
 by   alkalies, but when boiled with                           salts of silver, the corresponding
salts of the base are obtained.                       The decomposition, however,                        is   very
slowly effected,           and certain changes occur which                       I     am not yet             in   a
condition satisfactorily               to explain.             When      the hydrochlorate          is   boiled
with two equivalents of sulphate of silver,                                  it    gradually        loses its

                                         311
 colour, and the yellow       solution    produced contains       the sulphate of
 platinopyridine,    which   is extremely     soluble in water, and dries up
 into a gummy       mass on evaporation.        Considerable     difficulties    have
 been   encountered in obtaining          the   salts of  platinopyridine        in a
 state fitted  for analysis, and the only one which          has given satisfac
tory results is the chromate, which is obtained on adding bichromate
of potass to the sulphate,        in the form of a fine orange-red            precipi
tate,  having the formula C10 H3 Pt N HO CrOg.
    When the bihydrochlorate of platinopyridine              is boiled with two
equivalents     of sulphate or nitrate of silver for     a shorter time than is
requisite for its complete        decomposition,    and the chloride of silver
collected on a filter, washed        and treated with ammonia, it leaves           be
hind a yellow      crystalline matter, generally in small quantity.              This
substance is insoluble, or nearly so, in water, but dissolves in boiling
nitric  acid, from which       it  is deposited, on cooling, in beautiful shin
ing plates.      It  contains chlorine, but       I have not yet succeeded in
explaining its constitution.
    The golden yellow scales produced when the ebullition of the pla
tinum salt of pyridine is stopped before the change into platino
pyridine    is complete, have a very singular         constitution, the analysis
giving—

representing it as a double compound of the              original     platinum salt
and the     bihydrochlorate      of platinopyridine.      I   refrain     at present
from discussing its nature.
    When      the platinum      salt of pyridine is boiled with an excess of
pyridine, the fluid becomes extremely dark-coloured,                 and on evapo
ration to dryness in the water-bath and addition of water,                     a dark
solution is obtained, and a crystalline         residue left, which is very spa
ringly soluble in water, more so in boiling alcohol, and is deposited

 on   cooling   in small   needle-shaped     crystals.      Its composition          was
 found to   be —

    This corresponds with the formula C10 H4 Pt N + HC1,                     which      is
 that of a hydrochlorate of platosopyridine corresponding to                  the hy-
 drochlorate of platosamine.       By treatment with nitrate and             sulphate
 of silver the salts of these acids are produced.
    The picoline platinum salt      decomposes     very slowly, but after eight
or ten days' boiling a platinopicoline       is produced.        If   a  little   pico
line be added to the solution, the change is complete in a few hours.
The bihydrochlorate      is insoluble  in water,     and the double compound
containing that substance in combination          with the original salt,           and
of which the formula is
                  C12 H. N H CI Pt Cl+ C12 H. Pt N 2H CI,
crystallizes   in grains, and is much less soluble than the correspond
ing pyridine compound.          The properties of      these substances         will  be
afterwards fully described.
    The   platinochloride    of ethylopyridine     is very slowly       decomposed
by boiling, but eventually a substance is deposited which                 as yet has
given only discordant results.         A  small quantity of pyridine          appears
to promote the decomposition, but the most remarkable effect is                   pro
duced    by the addition     of ammonia.       The solution       in this      case   is
completely decolorized       by a few minutes'      boiling, and it then         gives
a white precipitate     on  the addition of carbonate of ammonia.                 The
substance so obtained is very sparingly soluble in water, and                  almost
insoluble in alcohol.      Analysis   showed   it to  be Raewski's       carbonate,
the    sesquihydrochlorocarbonate       of diplatinamine.         The      action of
ammonia is readily explained by the equation
Cu H„ N H CI        + Pt Cls + 2HN2 = N2 H4         Pt HC1     +  Cu H, NHCI.

                                       313
     The salt, N2 H4 Pt HC1, was separated from the fluid and exa
  mined ; it appears to be identical with the substance obtained by
  Gerhardt     by the action of ammonia       on the platinochloride       of am
  monium.*
     The details of     these,  and other decompositions,       I  reserve to a
  future time; meanwhile        I  shall content    myself with    stating     that
  most of the platinum salts examined are decomposed             by sufficiently
  protracted ebullition,   although some are extremely stable.
     The platinum salt of ethylamine is scarcely changed            when    boiled
 alone, but in presence of excess of base, a substance             is produced,
 sometimes in yellow, and at other times in purple             crystals,    which
 become yellow        at 212°.     It appears to be the      hydrochlorate        of
 platosethylamine.
     The aniline compound      is very easily decomposed, but the products
 do not appear to be definite.
     The narcotine compound dissolves in           a considerable quantity       of
 hot water,     and on boiling the solution at first remains unchanged;
 after some hours, however, it acquires a brown colour, and, a few
 minutes'    longer boiling, a black precipitate, containing the whole of
 the platinum, but combined with some           organic  matter,    is deposited.
 The filtered fluid, on addition of ammonia, gives a precipitate                re
sembling narcotine, but whether it is that base, or a product of                de
composition,      I have not determined.
    The brucine compound        is very sparingly soluble, but    if  boiled with
water     is   at length decomposed,      with   the production      of a black
powder ; on filtering a red solution is obtained, which deposits a yel
low platinum salt on cooling.         It is possible, however, that this may
be merely a portion of the original         salt, for as soon   as   the undis
solved portion had become black I filtered the solution.
     I shall not at present enter on the consideration of the inferences
to be drawn from this investigation, further than to observe that it
is likely to modify to some extent certain of the views now enter
tained regarding the constitution of the bases.          In the third part of
my investigation of the products of the destructive distillation of ani
mal    substances,   I  have shown that pyridine and picoline,         by taking
up a single atom of the alcohol radicals, are converted into fixed
bases, so that according to the ordinarily received opinion, they are
nitryl   bases   in which the whole of the hydrogen is replaced by           these
             * C'omptes Rendus des Travnux Chimiqups, 1849, p. 113.

                                       314
different radicals.     The production of the platinum bases, however,
shows that they do     still contain replaceable hydrogen, so that either
the formation of a fixed base by the addition of one equivalent of                a
radical    does  not prove that they are nitryl bases, or the received
opinion    regarding    the  constitution     of the platinum        bases    must
undergo some modification.
    It  is clear that at present we cannot attempt any explanation of
these apparently anomalous results ; but         I am   now engaged examin
ing the decompositions of the platinum            salts of amide and         nitryl
bases containing     known    radicals,   which will    probably lead to their
correct explanation.
4.   On the     Volatile Bases produced by Destructive Distilla
    tion of Cinchonine.           By C. Greville Williams, Assistant
    to Professor Anderson, Glasgow University.
    In this paper the author shows that Cinchonine                 by distillation
with potash, undergoes a very complex           decomposition, and that in
stead of yielding    one   base, as has hitherto     been supposed, gives at
least seven.
    The    mode   of research at first adopted      was    to convert the basic
liquid into platinum salt, and separate the         bases by fractional crys
tallization   in the manner described in his paper          "   On the Presence
of Pyridine in the Naphtha produced             by destructive distillation      of
the Bituminous      shale of Dorsetshire."*
    The experiments      made in this manner, indicated that several sub
 stances were present, but     it was evident that to decide the question, a
 very large amount of material would be required; the author there
 fore subjected 100 ounces of cinchonine to distillation with potash,
 and   thus obtained sufficient of the basic oil to enable him to            effect
 twelve complete fractionations,      involving at least 240 distillations.
    Runge's Pyrrol was present in the crude bases, and was               removed
 by protracted boiling of the acid solution.
    The    bases were procured free from water by digestion with potash.
 The following fractions were then analysed.
    Fraction boiling at 310° F. The basic liquid                on  analysis  gave
 numbers exactly agreeing with the formula,
                                   Cu II9 N,

  which is that    of Lutidine,     a base which has, as yet, only been           twice
 observed before,      it having    been discovered in Dippel's         animal oil by
 Dr Anderson, and found           soon after in Shale     Naphtha by the author
 of the     present paper.         Pyridine and picoline        were   also found by
 fractionally crystallizing the platinum salts obtained about this point
 in the earlier     distillations,   but the quantity present was extremely
 small.
    Fraction      boiling     between   350° and 360°     F.      This fraction     was
 found    to   consist of collidine, a platinum        salt giving on combustion
 numbers     agreeing closely with the theoretical values.              Collidine   was
 also found in fractions boiling as high as 380° to 390°.
    Fraction boiling         between    410° and     420°   F.     Five analyses of
 platinum salts obtained at this point indicated                the base present to
 possess   the formula,
                                       C18 H7    N,
 being   the chinoline of Gerhardt.             The author     proposes    in a future
 paper to compare Chinoline           with the Leukoline of Hofmann, with              a
 view of determining         the question of their being identical, or merely
isomeric.       Chinoline     forms   by far the greater portion of the basic
liquid.
    Fraction boiling        between    510" and 520°      F.     This   was found to
consist   of a   new base, which the author terms           Lepidine,    the formula
of which, derived from analyses             of the double salt with bichloride of
platinum,      the hydrochlorate,        nitrate,  bichromate, and -also the hy-
driodate of the amyl compound, is
                                      C20 H9     N,
the experimental        numbers in each case agreeing closely with those
required by theory.
    The author      states    his belief that several bases said to        be  the sole
products     of certain     reactions, as well as some natural ones, will bo
found    to be     mixtures,     and    he   is now  examining      nicotine    with a
view to ascertain whether           it is  a homogeneous body        ;  he also gives
the results of some experiments proving              pyrrol  to be produced by de
structive    distillation of many nitrogenous bodies,           and concludes with

1 .  Remarks on the Coal Plant termed Stigmaria.                      By the
                            Rev. Dr Fleming.
    The author, after noticing the proofs of Stigmaria being          the root
of Sigillaria, called attention   to the external organs, known formerly
as the leaves,   and more recently as the rootlets of the former.          He
stated that in the many examples of stigmaria which              he had exa
 mined, he had never observed       these  rootlets articulated to the stem
 by   anything resembling      a  ball-and-socket    joint, considering    the
appearance which had led to this notion as due to shrinkage               and
state of preservation.
    The views of Dr Hooker,       as given in his valuable paper on Stig
maria in the " Memoirs of the Geological Survey," vol. ii., p. 437,
were next considered.         This acute observer, from an examination
of a particular    specimen, concluded that these        rootlets, within  the
body of the stem, form      obconical or flaggon-shaped bases, the sura

                                           317
   mits of which are on a level with the mouths of the cavities in which
   they are contained.
       In the two specimens which Dr Fleming exhibited                      from   the
  Boghead parrot coal,*        it clearly appeared that the rootlets commu
  nicated directly with the body or trunk, which in this case had been
  filled from within, with the pulpy matter of the coal, and had thus
  entered     the tubular rootlets which extended for some distance into
  the argillaceous      matter on the outside.        Hence he inferred that the
  flaggon-shaped       bodies  noticed by     Dr Hooker were the lower por
  tions   of the rootlets, not in the inside, but          on the outside of the
  stigmaria.
      The author next called the attention of the Society to a state
  ment in Dr Traill's paper on Bitumenite published in the last part
 of the Transactions,       vol.  xxi., p. 10, by which      it appeared that "     A
 very magnificent        specimen of stigmaria         in  bitumenite    (the name
 given to the Boghead            Parrot),   as thick    as the human body, had
 been deposited       by  Dr Christison in the University Museum."               The
 unusual dimensions here assigned to stigmaria led the author to in
 spect the      specimen, when it was found to be a sigillaria similar to
 the one which he exhibited         from the same coal.
      Dr Fleming next exhibited           examples of the different       quantities
of coal produced by stigmaria,           sigillaria, favularia, calamite, stern-
 bergia, and lepidodendron, observing that as these plants can fur
nish coal-making materials            separately,    and as their remains exist
in coal,     it cannot   be denied that,      in the aggregate, they would be
equally productive        ; nor, with these facts in view, could it be main
tained that coal can only be formed from fir or allied woods.
     The author       then proceeded      to observe that      in ordinary     house
hold coals, such        as caking, cherry, or      splint, each   bed is stratified,
and     the strata are separated at their partings by patches of fibrous
anthracite, as     if formed  from broken portions of woody matter.            These
partings indicate a recurring intermittency of action, probably arising
from season changes during the accumulation of vegetable matter in
a form analogous to peat.         The parrot    coals, on the other hand, by the
absence     of stratification (being merely laminated or slaty parallel with
    * This valuable coal was dug and sold from the lands of
                                                                Boghead, and known
as the Boghead Parrot or Gas Coal, years before its existence in the lands of
Torbanehill was ascertained, and, therefore, as a designation, has the undoubted
claim of priority.

in the state of disintegrated         vegetable matter,        mixed more or             less
with earthy mud, and distributed                like the    beds   of    sandstone       and
clays.     That these coals were originally clays into which bitumin
ous     matter was injected will not be countenanced by any one ac
quainted with their structural character, contents and relative                      posi
tion.      There    is no bitumen      in the Boghead          parrot, nor any           sub
stance     analogous      to   what has been        termed ozokerite       from Binny
Quarry,      to   which    Dr Bennett has referred.            The last      substance,
indeed, melts at a heat considerably below that of boiling water.
   The pulpy condition of the original material of the parrot                        coals,
must have been favourable             for molecular       changes usually termed
metamorphic, which may have so farmodified the forms and structures
of the vegetable tissues        as to give them a segregated or concretionary
character.
   The author concluded          by expressing his regret that          Dr Traill,   after
the discussions which           have taken place in the Society            should        have
carried his opinion,           that the Boghead       parrot   was     a new mineral
species,    to which   he has given the name of Bitumenite, so very                        far
as to have published       it towards the beginning of the last part of the
Transactions        already referred to ; for the material in question is
neither chemically, optically,        nor mechanically         homogeneous,         as    de
monstrated in the papers of Professors                Bennett and Balfour at              the
close    of the   same part of the Transactions.
2. On     Errors caused by Imperfect Inversion of the Magnet
        in Observations of Magnetic Declination.  By William
         Swan, Esq.
   The direction of the Magnetic Meridian, as indicated by that of a
freely suspended magnetized needle will generally be erroneous, unless
the magnetic axis of the needle          is   parallel   to its axis    of figure    ; and
hence,     in order to obtain an accurate value of the magnetic declina
tion, it becomes necessary         to take the mean of two observations of the
needle, first                    in its usual position and next inverted.                  If,
                   suspended
however, the inversion of the needle            is   not accomplished with perfect
accuracy,  the correction, for want of parallelism       between   the
magnetic axis of the needle, and its axis of figure, will not be com
plete; and the value of the magnetic declination obtained from the

                                                               319
mean of two observations                       of the needle, first in its                                 usual       position,
and then inverted,               will     be affected with                      a residual               error due to im
perfect inversion            of the needle.                       The present investigation                                  refers
chiefly to that form of declinometer magnet, in which the magnet is
converted into a collimator by attaching to it a lens and cross fibres
or a divided glass scale, in the principal focus of the lens.
    It     is shown that the errors                            due to imperfect                      inversion          may be
computed, provided the magnet is observed, not only in its usual
position, and then inverted, — that is turned 180" round its axis, —
but also, when turned round 90° and 270°.
   Putting d for the correct reading, for the magnetic meridian                                                              on the

of the magnetic declination                           got from the mean                           of the readings                  in

      3.    On the Accuracy attainable means of Multiplied                  by
               Observations.  By Edward Sang, Esq.
    On opening any astronomical work of the present day,                                                           we are          at
first startled by, and then familiarized                                   with, the excessive                         precision
of the numbers set down.                              In our Nautical Almanac, for example,

                                      320
although referring to a period three or four years subsequent            to the
date    of publication, the declinations of the stars and planets are         set
down to tenths of a second of arc, and their right ascensions                  to
hundredths of a second of time.
    Similarly in tables of the geographical positions of        observatories,
we find the latitude and longitude often given to the same degrees of
precision    ;  an accuracy which would affect to discriminate         between
the latitudes of the two ends, or the longitudes of the two sides of             a
dining table.
    Yet it is very much     to be doubted    if any  astronomical  instrument
exist, which, by a single observation, is capable of giving the altitude
of  a star, or the latitude of a place, true to the nearest second        ;  and
it   is  also very much     to  be questioned, whether      any ear, however
practised,     has  acquired such   delicacy of perception as to note         the
instant of an expected occurrence true to the nearest tenth of a second.
    Now, astronomers draw the most important conclusions from                the
measurements of minute quantities.           Thus, the absolute distances       of
the sun      and   planets are determined from the measurement of              an
angle of 8 or 9 seconds, and which         is set down as being accurately
8",5776, the unimaginable precision of the last figure being ob
tained by Professor Encke from observations made in 1761, 1769.
    The linear velocity of light, again, is computed from observations
on   an angle of some 40"; our knowledge of the relative masses of
the planets is founded on the measurement             of minute disturbances,
and our wide guess at the distance of the fixed stars relies on              the
perception of a single second of annual parallax amid a heap of              un
certainties of precession, nutation, and proper motion.
    It  is then of some importance to inquire into the degree of            con
fidence which ought to be placed in such excessively minute deter
minations, and to distinguish between that degree of precision to
which we have actually attained, and that imaginary exactitude
w  hich is the result of arithmetical    operations.
    The common method of determining any quantity to an extreme
degree of precision, is to measure that quantity very often, and then
to take the arithmetical mean of the multitude of discordant results,
it being understood that      some principle    of compensation exists which
renders the mean more trustworthy          than any of the actual     observa
tions from which it has been obtained.
    It   has been plausibly argued against this proceeding that         as the

                                                      321
 mean      rarely coincides with             any of its constituents, all the evidence
 goes     to show that          it is not the true result.                    Without, however,
 stopping        to examine       the logical,            I   proceed     to weigh the logistic,
 argument        which bears upon the matter.
      In order      to have a case before me,                  I shall   take, as a fair examplo
 of this method, the determination                        of the latitude          of Padua by tlio
celebrated astronomer,             Giovani Santini, in 1811.                       His      process      was
to observe          the instants       when several stars of various declinations
 reached a fixed altitude ; by which                          means   he depended           only on the
going of his clock and the verticality                         of the axis of his instrument.
From sixteen sets of such observations he obtained the following re-

    Now,     on glancing at these numbers, we observe                              that two of them
are no       less    than 6"-16         below, and one 5" above                     the mean         ;   and
these variations          would seem to show, not that wo have obtained a
latitude which can be depended upon to the nearest second, but that
the observations           are not to be trusted to nearer than ten seconds                                   ;
and      amid these       disagreements, Signor Santini's                     concluding remark
sounds strangely,
    "Si    pud pertanto stabilire la latudine dell' osservatorio di Padova
in numeri rotondi          45" 24' 2"."
    It   would seem that, unless these                        results have been connected                to
gether by some law that would   insure the compensation of errors,
the only conclusion that we are entitled to come to   that the lati                 is,
tude      of the Observatory                of Padua           is   between    45° 23' 56" and
45° 24' 0-7".
    Taking, then, this example        general type of such proceedings
                                                 as   a                                                   ;
I   observe that there are two distinct sets of cases   viz., those where     ;

                                            322
  a known    law of compensation           exists   ;  and those in which the            sepa
  rate observations and their errors are independent of each other.
     Thus, when       we repeat       the    measurements           of     an     angle   upon
 different   parts of a circle, wo are certain that, however erroneous
  the division     may be, the entire          circumference           is 360,      and    that,
 therefore, an error of defect           in one part, implies one of excess                   in
 another part of the limb.           Again,    if  we read at three           or five   places
 equidistant from each other, we know that that part of the inaccu
 racy which arises from the eccentricity of the fittings,                      is eliminated.
  Or if  we   take   an altitude      face  East and then           face West, we know
 that the two errors arising from a misplacement                        of the zero       com
 pensate for each other.           But in all      those     cases where the compen
 sating principle     exists, a result from which any of the compensating
 quantities is excluded, cannot be considered as that of a complete
 observation     ; thus an altitude face East, without its complementary
 altitude face West, could not be used to found upon                      ;  and those only
 in which     the compensating principle            has had       full  scope, can be ad
 mitted to be observations.
     Thus it     seems   that our attention            need      only bo given to        those
 cases in which no law of compensation                 is known to          exist: of   which
our example is one.
    As there existed      no particular      reason      why one set of stars should
have    been    taken rather       than another, Signor Santini might                     have
chanced to make         only observations        I.   and   IV.,    and he would          have
had strong reason to believe the latitude                      to  be 45° 23'        56";    or
if the weather had permitted him                to    make only observations             III.,
IX., XII.,     and   XIII.,    he would       have concluded that the true lati
tude is 45° 24' 04".          Within the limits of the errors                   to which the
particular   class   of observations is liable, it          is difficult     to adduce any
argument in favour of one rather than another, in fact, it is a matter
of accident, what result       is arrived at.
    That  we     may have a clear view of the subject, suppose that, in
order to    measure a given angle, a circle               is used of, say, 30 inches
diameter, divided to 10", and carrying a telescope                       powerful enough
to render an angle of       1 0" quite appreciable           ;   suppose     also, that the
graduation     is perfect, and that by the first observation the angle
comes out so many degrees,           minutes, and say 40".                  If   we measure
the angle again we shall obtain the same result 40", and                             if again
and again, and again,         still the   same    40"; and it        is quite clear, that

                                           323
 however often we          may repeat the        observation, the mean will still
 remain     40-'.     Yet all    the while the true       angle may be 41, 42, 43,
 or even 44" ; and        it would appear that with such            an instrument,     an
 infinity of observations could give us no better a result than a single
 one.
     But   if   I   apply to the same       purpose a ten-inch circle carrying a
 twelve-inch telescope           with which 10" can only be estimated,                and
 having its graduation         pushed somewhat beyond the limits of work
 manship,      I   find my measurements           to fluctuate      from    20" to 60".
 Then    the advantage of multiplied             observations      becomes     apparent,
 and   twenty operations          give us a result different from that given           by
 ten ; and      if   we admit this system of averaging, we               are carried    to
 the   absurd conclusion           that  a small     instrument     gives more exact
 results than a large instrument            does.
     In truth, this averaging of multiplied                observations is a fallacy     ;
 if the results agree,       the averaging is useless ;        if they do not agree,
 their discordance        affords evidence      that the means        employed are in
sufficient    to procure the accuracy aimed at.
    The     same remarks           apply to time-observations.           To  observe  the
meridian        passage    of   a star we note      the instant      of its appulse to
each    of the vertical wires, add           the results and take the mean,            so
that   if  there be a considerable number of wires, great precision                     is
expected.         Now, at      each wire we      can    only,   and with hesitation,
note the time          to  the    nearest tenth of     a second.      Suppose that we
can do so absolutely, and imagine the wires so placed, that the time
of passing from the one to the other is exactly a number of tenths.
Then,    if   the true time of appulse to the first wire were, -04", the
observed would differ from the true by                .0i" at each one of the wires,
and    the mean would err also by that quantity.                      Now, there are
many declinations          which     give the interval      of passage from wire to
wire an exact number of tenths, so that, even                       supposing the ear
perfect to the nearest tenth of a second, there must be many cases
in which the average may be -04" wrong.
    Taking into account           the various sources      of error in the gradua
tion and adjustment of instruments,               we can scarcely assume         that the
declination of any star is known certainly to half a second of arc, or
its right ascension        to the twentieth      second     of time    ; and  it appears
that the true use of multiplied            observation is to guard against blun
ders in reading off, and to indicate the degree of confidence which is

                                                       324
to be placed           in our results.              A quantitative      statement in any           branch
of physical science should give, along with the numerical result, the
limit or probability of error, and conclusions drawn from such num
bers ought to be made with the probabilities of error full iu                                          view.
Increased            exactitude is only to be obtained by improvements in                                the
means of observing.
     The subject may               be presented          in another light.           Assuming            that
there is some unknown                        influence    tending to derange our otherwise
perfect         observations,           we       may try to obtain some             estimate of            its
amount.           If      we were to take the errors as indicating                        the intensity
of the influence,                 the sum           of these   errors      being    zero when             the
mean       is   assumed           as true, would give zero              for the entire        influence*
honce      we        must take, with Legendre,                      the square of the error               as
the measure of intensity.                           In this way, the         sum     of the        squares
of    the deviations             from the mean            may represent            the entire          force
of   the   deranging             influence,       and thence the deranging                influence       on
one     observation              may        be   estimated.         Following      this    mode        with
Santini's latitudes,                   we    find     3"-34    as    the   probable        error   ;     but
whether this              is   to be regarded as the probable error                 of all, or      of   one
of the observations,                   is   not very clear     :    indeed the whole doctrine             is
hypothetical.                  If we   grant the soundness of the method of minimum
squares,        it   is   easy to show that the probable or possible error                          of   tho
result     is   about three-tenths of the ultimate division of the apparatus.

      The following Communications                        were read        :   —
1 .   On the Occurrences of the Plague in Scotland during the
      Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries. By Robert Cham
      bers, Esq.
      In this paper the author             adduced,       from contemporary           chroniclers
and diarists, all the visits of the Test or Plague                         which     occurred         in
Scotland          after      1560;     namely,    in the years           1568,     1574,        1585,
1587,        1597, 1607, 1622, and 1645.                        He cited, from            the same
sourcesof information, the notable instances of scarcity and famine;
namely, 1563, 1568, 1574, 1578, 1587, 1596, 1598, 1612, 1622,
1642-3.               It   thus appeared, that while there were several instances
of famine not followed by the Pest, there was scarcely one instance
of the Pest which was not immediately preceded by a famine. So
far the opinion of modern medical writers, that deficient nutrition in
the community is one of the predisposing causes of pestilential fevers,
may be considered as borne out by facts.
 2. On a          Problem in Combinations.                      By Professor Kelland.
      This   was a problem proposed some years ago by                          Professor      Forbes,
when discussing the question of the distribution                         of the stars.        Simple
as    it   is,    no       prior notice seems to have been taken of                 it,   nor   is   the
author aware that the full solution has yet been given.                                   The   prob
lem    is    this — " There are n dice,
                   :                                 each     of which has     p   faces,   p   being
not less than n                       required to find the number of arrangements
                            ;
                            it   is
which can be formed with them                    ;   ltt, "    that no two shall show                the
same face         ;    2d, that no three shall show the same face, and                        so on."
The only part of this problem of which the solution has                                       yet ap
peared       is   the first, and the result          is   p   (p—   1)    ....      (p    —   n+l)-
The author supplies the solution of the remaining portions.

 3.   Occurrence of Native            Iron in Liberia, in Africa. From
     a Letter of Dr A. A. Hayes, Chemist, Boston, U. S., to
     Professor H. D. Rogers. Communicated by Dr Gregory.
     Dr Hayes      states that there is evidence     establishing    the fact that
 pure native       iron exists abundantly in the country back from the
 central part of the colony of Liberia.             Early travellers state that
 the natives of Africa find iron ore so pure, that they heat and ham
 mer    it into form.         Explorations by the Liberians show that the
 inhabitants of towns are engaged in manufacturing               iron, and an in
 telligent   native      has recently shown how it is done.          Last year    a
mass     was sent home by a          working blacksmith,      who cut it with     a
chisel from a mass          of larger size connected   with rock.     This proved
to be    native iron, malleable and ductile, yet unequal in its molecular
structure.        The general arrangement of the particles is unlike that
of any    artificial iron known, and there are among the iron particles
of crystalline and transparent quartz, octahedral crystals             of magnetic
oxide    of iron, and     one of the silicates  of soda and    lime.     No traces
of carbon exist       in connection with it, and     no piece of    artificial iron
                               ....
has yet    reached      Dr Hayes which does not contain carbon.              When
analysed     by Dr Hayes'        mode of electrolysis, it rapidly shows points
which are positive to the surrounding            portions, and, the action pro
ceeding, the mass          becomes   honeycombed in texture, while the final
chemical     result    is —
       Pure iron,                                                      98-40
        Quartz, magnetic oxide iron, and silicate lime,                  1-60
                                                                     100-
    The positive points are the crystalline           aggregates of the simple
minerals,     the iron in immediate contact being more open in texture,
and   always positive in relation to the crystals which are negative.
    Professor Rogers         supported the view taken by       Dr Hayes of the
genuineness       of the alleged native iron from Africa, by testifying to
the   experience of that chemist in the technical examination of ma
nufactured      iron, and by the statement of his belief, derived from a
comparison of many analyses, that the presence of carbon in an iron
is the best test     of its having been artificially brought to the metallic
state.    The reputed telluric iron of Canaan in Connecticut, is almost
                                                             2 d 2

                                      328
the only instanco in which an alleged native iron has been reported
to have been met with, not in loose masses, but in the form of a
mineral    lode,  that of Canaan being stated to be a true vein two
inches thick in mica slate.          The detection of carbon in this iron
proves the specimens to be spurious, and confirms an impression long
prevalent    among American        mineralogists,      that the original state
ment about this vein was founded either in mistake or fraud.                  An
examination of the best authenticated records of native telluric iron
tends certainly to reduce the number of the genuine instances,             if we
accept the carbon test ; yet the authorities          for the existence of  such
 are too many and too respectable to justify the general incredulity
 in regard to the presence of native iron on our globe.               The state
 ment that this African       iron is manufactured in seven villages, is an
 intimation that it exists in considerable quantity, more than would
 be compatible with the supposition that          it is merely   a large mass of
 meteoric iron.       But the fact, particularly significant, against its
 being native meteoric iron, is the total absence of nickel from its
 composition, as shown in the full analysis given by Dr Hayes. The
 absence  of carbon indicates it not to       be of human fabrication ; that
 of nickel proves it not to be meteoric.           Should it really be shown,
 by further exploration, to exist in quantity, its occurrence on the
 frontier of   a Liberian colony, by presenting another incentive to the
 sottlement of that region by civilized men pursuing the arts of
 peace, cannot but be regarded as        full of  good    omen for the cause of
 humanity     in Africa.

1.   Geological      Notes on Banffshire.              By R. Chambers, Esq.,
                                  F.R.S.E., &c.
    The author described the       succession    of pleistocene beds at Gamrie,
on the coast of Banffshire, as follows (ascending order) : — 1, boulder
clay ; 2, a thick bed of sand ; 3, a thin bed of brick clay ; 4, a thick
bed of sand ;     5, a thick bed of brick clay       ;  6, a bed of sand, contain
ing shells of arctic character        entire  ;  7, a moderately thick bed of
pure clay    ;   8, a thick bed of sand       ;  9, a thin bed      of ferruginous
gravel (which Mr Chambers regards as the equivalent of the upper
till, or coarse gravel, of other geologists) ; 10, a thick bed of soft
blue clay ; 11, a thick mass of sand rising to the top of an eminence
on which is a      vitrified fort.   Owing     to the great scale on which the
formation is presented, and the clearness of the section exposed towards
the sea, this is an unusually favourable             situation   for studying    the

                                     333
Scottish pleistocenes.     The shells are the well known Astarte arctica,
Natica clausa, Tellina proximo,, 8fc.
    At   Stracheres, on Kineddart Water, six miles inland, the samo
shells are found in the boulder clay, in a broken state       ; and opposite
Kineddart Castle near by, they are found entire in         a sand-bed about
thirty feet above the rock, and overlaid with the         same    ferruginous
gravel.
    The   noted clay bed, containing boulders    with lias fossils, at Black-
pots, near Banff,     Mr Chambers considers      as one   of the brick clay
beds.
    At  this latter situation the author found a large terrace or ancient
sea margin at 64 or 65 feet above the present sea level, and corre
sponding in elevation to one seen in various other parts of the island.
He traced      an  alluvial terrace  of very conspicuous appearance, at
about 167 feet above the sea, along both sides of the Deveran River
and the minor vale of Turreff, the town of Turreff being seated on it.
Another, somewhat higher, is equally prominent in the Kineddart
valley.
    In  the Deveran      valley, opposite to Eden Castle,     Mr    Chambers
discovered what he regards as a fine example of an ancient moraine.
It commences at the border of a tributary rivulet at Auchinbeddie,
and curves for a mile upwards along the        hill side, forming an irre
gular ridge of detrital matter about thirty feet high : the other wing
of the same moraine is traceable on the other side of the rill. The
little valley of the tributary stream     has been the bed    of the glacier
by which this moraine       was formed.    On the surface, at short inter
vals, are flat indentations, surfaced with alluvial matter, and corre
sponding in level with the two terraces ; so that they may be assumed
as having been formed by the sea, when        it  was at the corresponding
relative levels.
    The author connected this fact of     a submergence posterior      to the
period of local glaciers, with the fact, which he had ascertained in
Arran, that that period again was subsequent to a former submer
gence, during which the noted terrace of erosion round the west coast
of Scotland (twenty-five feet above the present sea level) was formed ;
 and, seeing it thus proved that the period of local glaciers was one
 of elevation, inferred that the cause of the lower temperature of that
 era was simply our mountain valleys being raised within           the  region
 of the snow line.

      2. On the  Physical Geography of the Old Red Sandstone
        Sea of the Central District of Scotland.    By Henry
        Clifton Sorby, F.G.S.     Communicated   by Professor
        Balfour.
   The author endeavours         to show that    in the Old Red          Sandstone
period there extended across Scotland a branch of the sea or strait,
whose northern shore was somewhere            in the line of the        mica schist
rocks which extend from Aberdeen to the mouth of the Clyde, and its
southern in the direction of the Greywacke rocks that run across from
St Abb's Head       to Wigtonshire.      In this,     at the earlier part of the
period, there were considerable tidal currents ; but when the upper
beds were deposited, they were more or less completely absent, and
there were present such as were chiefly due to the action of the wind.
   He shows that there is        a most intimate       connection between the
physical geography of a sea and the currents present in                it,   and that
even    their directions and characters can           be ascertained from         the
structures     produced in the deposits formed              under their influence        ;
                              geography of our ancient seas may be
therefore, the physical                                                            in
ferred within certain limits.
  He applies these general principles to the facts seen in the Old
Red Sandstone of Scotland, and endeavours to show that the ap
pearances    presented indicate the effects of tidal oscillations.

         DR CHRISTISON, Vice-President, in the Chair.
    Professor Christison, in delivering the Keith Medal to Dr
 Anderson of Glasgow, made the following remarks : —
    Dr Anderson — It          is a peculiar pleasure to me to be the organ of
the Society this evening for presenting to you this token of the ap
probation of this Society and its Council.
    As there must          be    many now        present   who    are   unacquainted
with the origin, conditions, and mode               of adjudication     of the Keith
Prize,    I   hope    that others       will bear with     me   for a moment         till
I   state these     very briefly.        The prize was founded by             tho   lato
Sir Alexander          Keith of Dunottar and Ravelston, to                   be   given
to the     author of the_best paper read in this Society during each
successive     biennial period.         The Council were appointed to ad
minister     the fund, and         to   adjudicate    the  prize.     The adjudica
tion is determined         by advice of a committee of the Council                 spe
cially nominated         for    the   purpose.     Having    been     a   member      of
the Council       almost     since    the   foundation    of the     prize,   and    re
peatedly a member of the Prize                 Committee,    I  can testify to the
exceeding care, and anxiety, and impartial disposition                  of the Com

                                                338
   mittee and Council            on all occasions.       The     best proof, perhaps, to
   this effect is that their award, so far as            I  am aware, has never been
   subjected to challenge in the public prints                ;  nor have       I  ever heard
    it criticised   even in private society.          A still   more satisfactory proof,
   as some may        think, is the eminence of the             men to whom the prize
   has hitherto been awarded.                The first  was    awarded in 1828 to Sir
  David      Brewster;        the next to        Mr   Graham,        now Master         of the
  Mint; Sir         David      Brewster then received it a               second    time;     our
  much esteemed            secretary,     Professor Forbes, has           been   twice simi
  larly honoured        ;  another was awarded to            Mr     Scott Russell for his
  researches       on    the   "  Wave-theory      ;" another      to   Mr     Shaw for his
  experiments on the development and growth of the salmon, which
  have yielded since most                important    practical     results ;     another     to
  our revered president           — whose      duty  I am    now, in his unavoidable
  absence,     inadequately discharging           — for  his laborious and munificent
  "Magnetical         Observations;" and the last awards were to                      Profes
 sor Kelland        and    Mr    Macquorn      Rankine for elaborate and              import
 ant mathematical           investigations.        I do not state these facts for the
 sake of taking any credit to the Council for the discharge of a duty,
 but in order that          Dr Anderson himself,          as  well    as his fellow-mem
 bers of this Society, may duly appreciate that gentleman's honour
able exertions, which have yielded results entitling him to be simi
 larly rewarded on the present occasion, and to be                           associated    with
 such predecessors.
      Among the previous awards                 I  may be       permitted,       I   hope,    to
advert to certain           circumstances connected with the last adjudica
tion      of the Keith         Prize for a chemical paper — namely,                   to    Mr
Graham          in 1834,       for    his   admirable     researches        on   the   "Law
of the Diffusion of Gases."                   For it was this paper, and in               some
measure       the reading of       it in this Society, which laid the foundation              of
his fortunes.          The paper excited intense interest at the time in                    the
Society, both among scientific members and others                      ;   and his name in
consequence         became      well    known     to  many.       It   may not perhaps
be known to         Mr    Graham        himself, but when he was a candidate for
the chair of chemistry                in University College, London, reference
was made         by  the College authorities to several Fellows of this So
ciety    ;  and   I   have reason         to know     that the unanimous             opinion,
greatly      deduced from his paper, and expressed in reply to                           these
inquiries, had much to do with his appointment                       to    succeed the late

                                         339
Dr Turner.       The present       is only the second       occasion, and after an
interval of twenty-one years, that the prize               has been assigned     for   a
chemical paper.        I do not know what the chemists have been about
in the interval, but it is to       be hoped that they may now be stimulated
by Dr Anderson's successful example.
    It  is usual for one in my present position to give some account of
the researches for which the prize has been adjudicated by the Council.
This, however,     I will, I daresay,      be excused for not attempting.          The
                                                          " the Products of the De
papers — for   they are two in      number — are      on
structive Distillation of Organic Substances," and on " the Crystalline
Bodies obtained from Opium."               I   find it impossible to give an ade
quate analysis of      these papers which          would not be too tedious for
delivery now.       In fact,   they are scarcely capable of abbreviation, and
must    be perused in    their entire     state,    in order to    be followed.      In
the course of his experiments on both subjects, Dr Anderson has
examined a great many bodies previously known, and discovered
others of great scientific interest, and ascertained the composition of
all, notwithstanding that they are all of great complexity.                    I  must
be satisfied with merely informing that great proportion                   of his fel
low-members who may find it difficult to follow his elaborate re
searches, that they belong to the most recondite and difficult de
partment of chemical analysis.               It has happened that, with only
one or two exceptions, the Keith Prize has been assigned to
authors      who have not only written             each   a   paper of high merit,
but have likewise contributed many others of value to our pro
ceedings.      So it is in the present instance.               Dr Anderson, when
a very young chemist, communicated to the Royal Society his first
paper in 1842, only one year after his graduation, on the analysis of
two zeolitic minerals        ;   and   we have been        favoured    by him       with
 many other excellent        researches     since.     But his last are the most
elaborate and productive.
     I   have said that      both topics       of   these    papers belong      to   the
most      recondite branch of chemical analysis.               There are not want
ing     people who regard such difficult inquiries              slightingly,   because
they     do not lead to any apparent             practical   results of importance.
 You      will hear such recondite          researches     characterized    as   difici-
 les   nuc/ee, and very lightly         esteemed      accordingly.     But in      these
 days no one who respects himself will fall into so gross an
error. Dr Anderson's researches are all concerned with great che

                                                     340
mieal laws, and bodies                      developed      in consequence          of the existence
of them.               These laws exist, because               they were established           by Pro
vidence       ;    and we may depend upon it that they were not established
without a purpose, and that a beneficent one.                              Permit     me to give a
proof of this.             The great discovery of the existence of the                     vegetable
alkaloids, commenced                    nearly forty years ago, belonged in its day                  to
one of the most abstruse departments of chemical analysis. There
are others besides myself in this room who may remember that for
some years             afterwards          the successive      discovery    of these      bodies was
lightly       spoken       of    as difficiles      nuga: — or laborious
                                                      trifling. But a
different view came to be taken of such inquiries, when it appeared
that all the vegetable alkaloids concentrate in themselves the poison
ous    and medicinal                  properties    of the vegetables which yield               them.
Among the truly practical and beneficent results that have                                     ensued,
let me mention one great fact— namely, that with one of these alka
loids, intermittent fever, one of the most common diseases of hot                                  and
even     of   some temperate climates, may be cured with almost as great
certainty as we can appease hunger with bread or with meat.                                     I shall
detain you by mentioning only one other illustration — the newest of
all.     In        the course of a very elaborate inquiry in a far-removed
corner of organic chemistry,                       a body was discovered which is known
to chemists             by the scientific          name    of terchloride of formyl.              This
was in 1832.               For many years it belonged                  to the      dfficiles   nugte ;
no one even saw                 it,   except occasionally some         chemist more curious
than his fellows in general.                   I    venture to say that many here pre
sent do not know the name, and may think                             it    requires the alchemy
of Dr Anderson, and such                       as he, to understand          it.     At   last, after
the lapse of fifteen years, this was discovered to be the powerful
agent which has since been more familiarly known by its oldest
name chloroform, ono of the kindest gifts of Providence to man. Let
all beware, then, of speaking lightly of the elaborate and apparently
unproductive chemical researches of the present day.   Who knows but
that among the curious new bodies discovered by                             Dr Anderson,         there
may yet be found another gift not inferior to that of chloroform, or that
of quina      ?
I        set out with             observing,       Dr Anderson, that         it     was a peculiar
pleasure to me to be honoured                           with    the duty of presenting this
prize.            It   would be        a   great pleasure in any circumstances, but                  it
is   peculiarly          so when      I    have    to convey this     impartial       mark of our

                                                    341
 Society's respect to one who, once                         my pupil,          and afterwards               my
 friend, is now           also    my professorial           brother.          It   is well known to
 your early friends that             it would have           been easy for you, under                   the
 auspices    of your late father,              to have soon attained a competence and
 independence         as a medical practitioner               ;    but you preferred the more
 thorny path of           science.         I   happen to          know that your choice gave
 some uneasiness and anxiety to your                        parent, when he reflected how
 few, —alas     !    for the scientific welfare of this country,                    — how        very few
 prizes in chemical              science       are held out to its votaries in Britain.
But he was reassured by the assurance of his friends that the spark
so    clearly visible would soon                   be blown into a flame             ;   and, accord
ingly, he lived long enough to see you received                               by universal consent
among the chemists of Europe, and rewarded by the                                    second      —    if,   in
deed,   it   be only the           second      — chemical         office,   in point of honour in
Scotland.
 I      must not conclude without                    mentioning             that the value of the
Keith Prize         is   not be measured             by      Apart from
                                                          this medal merely.
the honour,          the prize varies in value from £50 to £65, and the
latter sum      is   its amount on the present occasion.                            It   is,   therefore,
in all respects, an object well worthy of competition                                    among scien
tific men.
     The following Communications were then read —                                       :
 1.    Geometry,          a   science purely experimental.                           By Edward
                                                   Sang.
     After remarking that the perfect strictness of the demonstrations
in Geometry          is   generally admitted, the author of the paper cited the
almost universal belief in the soundness of Euclid's reasoning as                                            a
notable example of wide-spread credulity.                               He then enunciated the
proposition     that our knowledge                  of the truths           of geometry          is    alto
gether derived from experience.
     Taking the first of Euclid's problems,                       "To   construct an equilateral
trigon," he showed that the                     facts     that the circles intersect at all,
and that they have only one intersection on each side of the base, are
taken for granted,            and he contrasted the looseness of this procedure
with the hypercritical precision of the following problem                                       " to    cut
from the greater of two lines                  a   part equal to the less."
     VOL III.                                                .                           2   B

                                                       342
     Proceeding           from the propositions                to the axioms, he denied that
the human mind possesses                    the innate power of perceiving a general
truth   :   and asserted that, without                       a knowledge       of all the    cases to
which a statement may bo made to apply,                               we are not safe in enun
ciating it     ;    thus, adopting the definition                     of equality       as implied in
Euclid's eighth axiom, the proposition                         " if   equals be added to equals
the sums are equal,"                is not true ; the sums may be equal or they
may be equivalent.                  And,    as an instance of the ease               with which       we
may be led to admit the truth of a specially worded proposition,                                      he
cited this one        :—
                         "    perfect equality implies equality in size, in                     shape,
in weight, in colour, and in every respect in which we can compare
them, so that of two perfectly equal bodies, the one could not be
distinguished         from the other              ;    perfect equality, then, must include
every inferior degree of resemblance."                            Such is an axiom to which
most people would assent as self-evident                        — yet     it   is not   true.
     Even the axiom              " things        equal to the same             thing are     equal    to
each other,"         is not to be admitted without examining                            the particular
kind of equality            implied ; for though                bodies similar to the               same
body be similar to each other, and those equivalent to the same equi
valent to each             other,    solids symmetric             to the same           solid are not
symmetric to each other.
     Passing       from the axioms to the definitions,                         he pointed out the
necessity of establishing               the possibility          of the thing defined           :   thus
if   we form such a nomenclature                        as this ; a solid with          four trigonal
faces is called a tetrahedron,                   a solid     with five trigonal         faces is called
a pentahedron, one with six trigonal                          faces a hexahedron, and so on,
our definitions           would be essentially vicious, since no such                        pentahe
dron can exist        ;    and    thus we see that our definitions of the tetrahe
dron and hexahedron are only admissible after examination.
     Again it is      necessary         to take care that the definition                   of one    ob
ject    be consistent            with   that          of another.       Thus, having defined               a
straight line, we are not at liberty to use the straight line in defin
ing a plane surface until we have made sure that this use is consis
tent with what has already been predicated.                              Now the ordinary             de
finition of        a plane surface         is,
                                            that the straight line joining any two
points in      it   lies wholly         on the surface.    This definition, however,
implies     a      very abstruse property of straight lines                      ;   namely, that      if
two straight lines be drawn from one point, and     two points be as           if
sumed in each of them, the two straight lines joining alternately the

                                          343
  remote point on the one line with the near point on the other cross
  each other.      Until the truth of this proposition shall have         been de
  monstrated we are not at liberty to define a flat surface.             This  de
  monstration      can only be obtained by experiment, and, therefore,            it
  was concluded, all our knowledge of geometry being founded on this
  proposition,    is experimental.
  2.  Notice respecting recent Discoveries on the Adjustment
       of the Eye to Distinct Vision. By Professor Goodsir.
     The question as to the arrangement by means of which the eye is
 adapted for distinct vision at different distances has for two centuries
 strongly    attracted    the attention     of physiologists.     The numerous
 hypotheses, and untenable          theories    which have been      advanced on
 this subject are all, however, more or less unsatisfactory.             They are
 severally based on
     1 . The mere structure or form of the refractive humours of the
 eye  ;
     2.  A  presumed process connected with change in the direction of
 the axis of vision     ;
     3. The movements of the iris         ;
     4. Change in the position of the retina         ;
     5. Change in the position of the lens ;
     6. Change of form of the cornea          ;
     7. Change of form of the lens.
     This important question has        now been     definitively determined by
the researches of      Dr Cramer of Groningen,         detailed in a prize treatise
submitted      to the   Dutch Association for the advancement of medical
science    in 1851     ;  but, which, except in the form of a short abstract
at the time,     was only published at a later period.          In  1853, Helm-
holtz    also announced        to the  Berlin Academy the same discovery,
reached     independently, and by a method more complex                 than that
employed by Cramer.
     The entire question had      been previously simplified by the conclusion
to which Volkmann had come, that the eye, when in a passive con
dition, is adapted for the vision of distant objects, the foci of con
vergent pencils being then situated in the retina ; that when it re
quires to    be adjusted     for a near object, an active process       of accom
modation     is set   up, which brings the foci forward          to the nervous

                                         344
membrane       ;   and that the return to the passive condition, which           again
adapts the eye to distant objects, is a passive process, following                   on
the previous effort.
     Cramer had therefore         only to determine the nature of the          active
change,     by means      of which the foci, for     a near object, are brought
forward to the retina.           Now,  as Helmholtz had shown, that         the ad
aptation of the eye to distance must depend upon a change of                    some
kind in the refractive condition of the humours of the organ             ;   and    as
Senff had previously proved that no change takes place in the curva
ture of the cornea ; and as the ingenious theories of Ludwig and Stell-
wag had in no way removed the difficulties                involved in explaining
how the lens can be moved forward           ;  there remained only, as a         basis
for investigation, the hypothesis          of a change of form of       the lens.
This hypothesis,        as Volkmann had stated, could only be objected to
as insufficient ;     but not as involving any contradiction of fact ; and
might be verified by more careful and extended observation.
    The question, therefore, which Cramer had to determine, was this—
is  the form of the lens changed in the adaptation of the eye to near
objects   ?
    Cramer       was   indebted to Donders       for the fundamental       idea on
which      he    proceeded     in  the solution    of this question.      Donders
had previously entered on the investigation, but had failed in his ob
servations.       He  is entitled, however, to the credit    of having suggested
the employment of the experiment             of Purkinje in this inquiry       ;  and
of having subsequently elucidated its successful results.
    Cramer has discovered that in the adjustment of the            eye for a near
object, there takes place a change in the form of the lens, consisting
of an increase in the curvature of its anterior surface, produced by
the   iris and ciliary muscle, but without alteration in the position                of
the   lens itself ; while the return to its original form for the vision             of
a distant object is the effect of its own elasticity, which in proportion
to the pressure applied, had co-operated           in producing the increase of
its anterior convexity.          He ascertained the occurrence of this altera
tion of form by watching, through an arrangement of his own contri
vance magnifying from 10 to 20 diameters, the change which takes
place in the image of the flame of a candle reflected from the anterior
surface of the lens during the adjustment of the eye to a near               object.
The     eye having been adjusted to a distant object, and the erect image
 from the surface of tho cornea having been brought                 nearly    to tho

                                       345
margin of the iris in the pupil, the erect image               from the front of
the lens will be observed deeper and less distinct,            a   little beyond     the
centre of the pupil, and the small distinct             inverted image from the
back of the lens     will   be close   to the opposite margin           of   the    iris.
The     eye being now adjusted to a near object, the deep erect image ad
vances, diminishes, becomes more distinct, and moves across the centre
of the pupil to the immediate neighbourhood of the corneal image.
  This change in      the relative position      of the three images         was cor
rectly considered by Cramer as a distinct evidence of an increase in
the curvature of the anterior surface of the lens. It would appear,
however, that he was not entitled to conclude, as he did, from the
immobility of the inverted image, that no change occurs in the pos
terior curvature of the lens. Donders, in reference to this has as
serted, that the immobility of the inverted image affords satisfactory
evidence that a change does actually occur in the curvature of the
posterior surface of the lens ; and Stellwag has demonstrated that a
change of this kind must necessarily take place. That there is a
contemporaneous       increase in the curvature of both surfaces of the
lens must be admitted from the consideration that              if such       a change
did not occur in the posterior surface, the increased curvature of the
anterior would necessarily produce             a change in the position of the
inverted images ; which is not the case.     The optical effect of the
increase of anterior curvature masks the slight movement of the in
verted image.
   The alteration in the curvature of the posterior surface                   is,   how
ever,    so slight, that we may safely assume          that the essential altera
tion takes place    in   the anterior surface.
   Helmholtz      has proved that the anterior curvature of the lens                   is
increased during adjustment of the eye to near objects, by measur
ing accurately the distance between the images of the flames of two
candles reflected from that surface, in the active and passive condi
tions of accommodation.    According to his calculations the radius of
curvature of the anterior surface        is,   for distant vision, from 10 to 11
millimetres   ;   for near vision about   5     millimetres.
   A     change in the form of the lens having thus been ascertained to
be the mode of adjustment of the eye to distances              ;    the next point
to be determined      is   the mechanism        by   which the change of form          is
effected.
   It   may bo stated generally, that although the structures which act

                                                    34 G
upon the lens have been ascertained, the details and arrangements                                    of
the process itself still require elucidation.
   Cramer removed the eye of a seal immediately after the death                                       of
the animal,        and exposed            a portion         of the surface of the            vitreous
body at the back of the organ.                        He then introduced the               electrodes
of an electro- magnetic rotation apparatus into the opposite attached
margins      of the iris.            The flame of a candle at the distance                       of 35
centimeters from the cornea was distinctly                          observed on the vitreous
surface,    with    a    microscope magnifying                   80 diameters.              At     each
passage  of the electrical current through the organ, the pupil                                    con
tracted, the image of the flame became broader, less distinct,                                      and
less definitely outlined.                 This effect       was visible       to the naked          eye,
and indicated the probability                   of the form of the lens being                 altered
by the contraction of the muscular structures                             in the interior of         the
eye.      Cramer ascertained that the iris is at least the principal agent
in producing the change               ;   for when a cataract needle was introduced
so as to divide the        iris, and produce               a complete coloboma, the focus
was no longer        affected        by the electrical          current.         Cramer      also re
moved the cornea, annular                  ligament, and iris, after which the                     elec
trical current produced no change in the adjustment                                ;   although     the
ciliary    processes    were        observed to be put upon the stretch.                            The
lens was also shown by numerous experiments                                    to be incapable of
changing its own form.                    It   is not muscular        ;    for when the recent
lens was removed from the eye, and the flame of a candle brought
to a focus through         it,   on a piece of oiled paper, the electrical current
produced no change in the adjustment.
   Cramer concludes, in this department of his subject, that the iris
and ciliary muscle alter the form of the lens.                                The ciliary     muscle
contracting     pulls the ciliary processes forward, and so prevents the
Ions from receding under the pressure of the iris.                                The latter       pro
duces the change in the anterior curvature, by                            a   primary contraction
of its circular        fibres   ;    followed up by contraction                  of its radiating
fibres,    which, from being                   curved forwards,           become       straight,    and
thus pressing on the marginal portion of the anterior surface of                                     the
lens, force the central portion forwards.                           Cramer's       explanation           of
the action of the iris          on the lens          is   based on Stellwag's          recent asser
tion, that the posterior chamber has no existence, but that the iris
rests immediately on the front of the lens, the ciliary processes, and
the zonule of Zinn,             so    that     it   projects like   a     domo into the          auto-

                                        347
  rior chamber.      The pressure    is thus communicated by the         iris  to the
  lens through    the medium of the ciliary processes,           zonule of Zinn,
 and contents of the canal of Petit, the lens being supported and
 kept forward     by cotemporaneous contraction        of the ciliary muscle.
 Donders is inclined to believe that a       very thin layer of fluid is inter
 posed between     the iris and the structures     behind it   ;   but practically
 Cramer's opinion appears to be correct.
      Hueck, in attempting to explain ocular adjustment by the move
 ment of the lens by the iris, had stated that when viewed in profile,
 the iris is seen to project into the anterior chamber during vision of
 a  near object. Volkmann denied this ; but the fact is undoubted                    ;
 and Helmholtz has ascertained that the protrusion is about                J   milli
 metre.
     Ruete  has objected    to Cramer's conclusion as to the agency            of the
 iris in altering   the form   of the lens, on the ground that in cases            of
congenital deficiency of the iris the power of adjustment is not de
 ficient.   In  such    instances some compensating        arrangement          must
exist.
     Senile Presbyopia mainly depends, according           to    Cramer,     on the
diminished muscular contractility of the iris             and     ciliary muscle.
Myopia, again,      on   diminution of the elasticity of the capsule of the
lens, which disables the lens from regaining           its normal form after
each act of adjustment.         He denies that   the curvature of the cornea
is increased in myopia, and states that the apparent              increase    is duo
to the continued       increased protrusion of the iris into the anterior
chamber.

1.    Memoir of Rear-Admiral Sir John Franklin.                           By Sir
     John Richardson, C.B. Communicated by Professor Bal

 2. On the Geological              Relations of the Secondary and Pri
     mary Rocks of the Chain of Mont Blanc. By Professor
     Forbes.
     This paper*     is intended     to meet the objections         taken by    Mr     D.
 Sharpe, in a paper published in the Quarterly                Journal of      the Geo
 logical Society      for February         1855,    to  the   views   of  the present
 writer, and those      of several eminent geologists, on the            structure      of
 the chain of Mont Blanc.
     De Saussure first described the singular superposition of gneiss                   to
 limestone which occurs         on  the south-east side      of the valley of      Cha-
mouni, a testimony the more clear from its obvious opposition                           to
 the Wernerian views of the period.
     M. Necker, grandson of De Saussure, in a remarkable                    paper      on
the granite of Valorsine, published              in 1828, presents a section            of
 the south-east slopes of the valley of Chamouni, which exhibits                      the
limestone dipping under the gneiss, the beds of which                  gradually      be
come      steeper  as we     approach the centre of the chain.              The     facts
were still more emphatically          stated by the same author in a work              on
 the Geology of the       Alps, published thirteen years later.
     In   1842, Professor Forbes paid particular attention to the struc
ture of both sides of the chain of Mont Blanc               ;   and pointed out       the
 precise analogy of the superposition             of gneiss    to limestone      on the
 Italian, to that     on   the Swiss side      of the mountain.        He    indicated
 very distinctly two localities,         one   on each side of the Alps, where
the superposition       might    be  distinctly   seen   and traced for some         dis
 tance.
     Mr   Sharpe, in the paper referred to, having treated the descrip
tions of De Saussure and of             M. Necker      as vague or contradictory,
the present       writer defends them.             And   he   repels   Mr    Sharpe's
objection to his own conclusions as not based on sufficiently definite
indications of the localities, by citing          the passages from his Travels
in   the  Alps, where     he has specified them, and by showing that other
geologists have satisfactorily         verified his observations.
     He next    quotes the testimony        of M. Favre of Geneva,         and of M.
 Studer of Berne, as having from personal                observation of the      closest
 kind, been led to conclusions identical with his own.
    *  It will be printed   at length   in the Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal
for   April 1856.

                                          349
     Finally, he gives examples from the writings of M. Elie de Beau
  mont of similar anomalous superpositions in the Alps of Dauphine,
  and in the writings of M. Hugi and M. Studer, of others in the
  Canton of Berne, which would           leave the fact in question     still to be
  accounted    for, even    if  all geologists from the time of De Saussure
 had been     in error    as   to the particular constitution of the chain of
 Mont Blanc.
     The paper     was   illustrated   by sections showing the views of suc
 cessive geologists.
     The following Gentlemen were duly                     elected     Ordinary
 Fellows : —
             W. Mitchell Ellis, Esq.
             Dr G.  J.  Allman, Prof. Nat. History, Edinburgh.
                       Monday, ith February 1856.
        Right Rev. Bishop TERROT, V.P.,                    in the Chair.
    The following Communications                 were read    : —
1.   On the Turkish           Weights        and  Measures.        By Edward
                                    Sang, Esq.
    In  this paper a short account was given of the comparison of the
oka with the imperial          grain  weight,    and of the arsheen with the
inch.
    The oka was     stated to be     19,807 grains,   so that 18 cantar      of 44
oka each make one ton one pound.
    The length of     the arsheen was determined by comparison with the
ebony standard of Sultan Selim.
    The extreme length,         as obtained by contact, was      29-890 inches,
but the ends had evidently been             tampered with   ;   on that account
the divisions of the rod were referred to         ; these gave results   varying
from    29-944 to 29-949, and therefore the mean, 29,946                   inches,
may be taken as the true length of the Turkish arsheen.
2.   Observations on Polyommatus Artaxerxes,                        the Scotch
                      Argus.        By Dr W. H. Lowe.
    Polyommatus Artaxerxes, or the Scotch Argus, is an insect
not only of great local interest, but has attracted, and continues to
   vol. m.                                                          2 v

                                                        350
attract, the notice of entomologists all over the world.                                       Among the
English, and still more among the foreign students, who annually
throng our University, there are always a considerable number who
arrive in Edinburgh anxious to see                           " the     rare butterfly from Arthur's
Seat," or who are commissioned                          by entomological friends to obtain                       it.
Besides, there are the still                          more destructive          emissaries from the
London and provincial                 dealers in insects,                 who infest the        hill    during
the season in which             it   is   found.           But although the situation                 in   which
this insect      is   principally taken                 is   extremely circumscribed,              I    am not
aware that its numbers are materially diminished by this continuous
drain upon them.                 The new road now in contemplation                                     beneath
" Samson's Ribs," and through the
                                  village of Duddingston, will,                                                  1
fear, go far to exterminate                     it,   as   it   will   pass,I   believe, through              the
exact spot upon which                 it       is   found, and to which             it   is   in   a   singular
degree limited.
     The first published account                      we have of this insect             is   by Fabricius,
in   his   "   Systema Entomologiai," 1793, under the name                                             Lyctena
Artaxerxes," in which                     he    states         its habitat     to be     "    Ancrlia,"       but
without any special reference to                               Scotland.       He    does      this     on the
authority of         Mr Jones        of Chelsea, in whose cabinet a specimen                                then
existed    ;   but    it   would appear that Fabricius himself never saw                                      the
insect, as     it   was at that time                a   frequent custom to insert in                   entomo
logical cabinets           a   painted         piece       of card,       to supply the place of an
insect then believed to be too rare to afford much probability                                              of   its
being obtained.            I     may here mention, that naturally                             feeling       some
interest to know who this                  Mr Jones of Chelsea (so often quoted                                  by
authors) was, applied to
                    I                      Mr James Wilson of Woodville, who most
obligingly wrote to Mr Adam White, of the British Museum,                                                    and
through whom we find that                        Mr Jones            had an excellent collection                  of
native insects, and also              a        number of illustrations,             coloured           by   him
self, which are still in existence                         ;    but from       the higher          degree
                                                                                                                  of
excellence now attained in such delineations, of course greatly dimi
nished in pecuniary value, however interesting they may have been
at the time alluded to.                    It    was       no doubt one of these                illustrations
which  Fabricius availed himself of in his Systema Entomologia.
We find this insect next mentioned as Papilio Artaxerxes     Lewen                                    by
(1795), a fellow of the Linnean Society, who, like Fabricius, refers
to   Mr Jones'        specimen, but adds, that                       it   was taken in Scotland.                 In
the    Natural History                of       Insects,         by     Donovan,     in 1813,           we    have

                                             351
   the first  full account of this insect; and his description                is so    ani
  mated    and enthusiastic, that the naturalists of the Society,              if not the
  other fellows,    will   excuse     my making        one  quotation    from him       : —
  "  To the great astonishment of our English collectors of natural
  history," he says, " Papilio Artaxerxes, an insect heretofore of the
  highest possible rarity, has been lately found in no very inconsiderable
  plenty in Britain.        For this interesting discovery          we are indebted to
  the fortunate researches of our young and very worthy friend,                         W.
  E. Leach, Esq., who met with it common on Arthur's Seat, near
  Edinburgh, and also on the Pentland Hills."                   It will not be unin
  teresting to the fellows of this Society to know that              Mr James Wilson
 was with     Dr Leach    on this occasion,       and joined him in his entomologi
 cal researches at that time.           As   I have entered    so  far into the history
 of this insect,    I  must now in fairness state, that the same authority
 (Donovan)        mentions the existence of a specimen in the *' exten
 sive and valuable" cabinet of Mr Macleay, taken in Scotland, pre
 vious to     Dr Leach's discovery.           It   is the same    Mr    Macleay whose
 name is associated      with another interesting, but much more widely
 distributed insect, the Erebus Blandina, or Arran Argus.                          Dono
 van concludes with the remark — "                 As  these insects   fly in the day
 time, there     can be   little doubt they may          be sought for by the collec
 tors with success on the hilly spot called Arthur's                 Seat, near Edin
 burgh."
     Polyommatus Artaxerxes, thus established as a well-known British
 insect, appears successively in the works of Mr Stephens, 1828 ; Ren-
 nie (Conspectus),      1831    ;  Duncan, 1837; Wood (illustrated catalogue),
 1839    ;  Westwood, 1841 ; and Captain Brown, 1843 ; but                      I  do not
think there is in these works any important                  addition     to the infor
mation      I  have thus thrown together.
     Having endeavoured           to trace  rapidly, and in    a manner as      little   te
dious as      possible, the history of P. Artaxerxes,            I  may remark, that
great    as is the interest this insect has excited among naturalists,                    its
habits, and especially its transformations,              were until recently entirely
unknown.        Mr R.   Logan, who resides almost on the spot on which it
abounds, endeavoured some years ago, I believe, to obtain its larvae by
inclosing a number of the perfect butterflies beneath a glass frame
in his garden, in the hopes that the eggs might be deposited ; but as
at that time it was generally believed to feed on the Ulex europeeus,
amidst which it may           be seen     to   flit, the eggs,   if  deposited at all,

                                          352
 naturally   perished for want of their proper               nidus; and    this laud
able experiment       of course failed.        The same accurate         and patient
 observer, however, subsequently arrived at the belief that the                  insect
 preferred the Helianthemum            vulgare, which grows luxuriantly         on the
south side of the hill, remarking,              that while the Ulex europeus
abounded     all over the hill, the butterfly did not, but was            confined    to
the south, and only where the Helianthemum                  grew, frequently    indeed
in conjunction with the Ulex.             This inference      has since proved cor
rect.    So lately as 1851,      Mr Logan,       in an article in the Naturalist
for March in that year, after describing              the   P. Artaxerxes     as they
may be seen gaily flitting over the banks of Arthur's                    Seat in    the
sunshine, or resting on the tall culms of grass and other plants                  while
quiescent, remarks      :
                             " Strange     to  tell,  no   one  knows anything        of
their history    ;  where they lay their         eggs,   or what the larva        feeds
on, and where the inactive chrysalid            passes the long, cold months          of
winter, are all in mystery        ;" and    adds,
                                                    "  the discovery of the      cater
pillar and chrysalis       is a point    much     to   be desired."     Struck     with
these remarks, published too          just before the insect might       be expected
to make its accustomed         annual appearance,        I determined   to go to Ar
thur's Seat for the express object of finding this long looked-for chry
salis.  I spent several hours diligently examining the stems of different
plants, particularly     the Ulex europteus and the Helianthemum val-
gare ; the latter of which       I   frequently tore up bodily, and examined
piecemeal.      1  did this in the belief that all the Polyommati attached
their chrysalids to the stems of plants, as is indeed the usual habit                 of
this genus, and was ignorant that any of them burrowed in the ground.
My time     and patience being nearly exhausted,             I now began    to dig in
the loose earth which lies beneath the bushes                of furze, the   shade of
which precludes anything from growing beneath them.                     Here     I  was
also unsuccessful, but seeing some tufts of Helianthemum                  overhang
ing some barren patches of earth,            I continued my examination there
also, and almost immediately found several chrysalids, the appearance
of which left   me no doubt that they were those of           P.  Artaxerxes.      The
day was now declining, and          I was anxious to show         my acquisitions to
Mr Logan,     to whose house       I immediately repaired.         That   gentleman
showed the greatest interest in the discovery, and, like myself, ex
pressed his surprise that one of the genus Polyommatus should bury
its chrysalis in the ground instead of attaching it to the stem of a
plant.    He further    requested      me to place the chrysalids in his keep

                                         353
 ing, that   he might     figure them for a work        upon which he has long
 been engaged, and to which           this society has become         a   subscriber.
 A  few days after,     I   received the said chrysalids        from    Mr Logan,
 and he at the same time mentioned              that, acting on the information
 I had given him, he had pursued the search for the chrysalids,                    and
 had found them in considerable numbers.             Those  I had in my own pos
 session emerged from the chrysalis, either that day or the following                  ;
 and since that time it has, of course, become easy to note the habits
of  P.  Artaxerxes, and        a beautiful    delineation of   it in all its    stages
of development will appear in         Mr Logan's      book, whenever its appear
ance shall realize the expectations of his numerous subscribers.
    To  go  further into the description of its transformations               at this
point would      be to trespass on the subsequent but as yet unpublished
observations of     Mr Logan,      and  I shall  therefore leave it now, to say a
few words      in conclusion on Polyommatus Agestis and                P.  Salmacis,
two insects so nearly allied to the one before us that they have been
at different times considered to be one species.               On looking at the
drawings     of these  three closely allied insects, for which very faithful
and beautiful illustrations       I am  indebted to my friend       Mr    Dallas, we
perceive     that  P. Artaxerxes        is readily    enough     distinguished      by
the conspicuous white         spot in the angle of the upper wing, while
 P. Agestis    has a black one in nearly the same position.            These mark
ings, though affording in themselves but slight              grounds for specific
distinction,   are nevertheless permanent in their character, and oven
before   we    were acquainted with         the caterpillars of the respective
insects, gave great probability to the opinion            that the two were dis
tinct, especially when taken in conjunction with the fact that P.
Artaxerxes is confined to Scotland and the north of England, and
P. Agestis     as exclusively    to the southern counties of       England.      Still
this   was   matter of opinion, and it is only now that we are enabled
by our own observations in Scotland upon             P.  Artaxerxes, and almost
at the same time by similar observations by Mr Harding and Mr
Stainton in London upon P. Agestis, to determine, as think, finally I
upon the specific difference of the two insects.               The gentlemen         I
have just named have bred          P. Agestis from the caterpillar, and find
that it  feeds    upon Erodiura cicutarium, a plant           in natural affinity
and every other respect widely removed from Helianthemum                    vulgare.
When, therefore,      to the slight but permanent differences          of its exter
nal markings and habitat is added the fact that the caterpillar of the

                                            354
 oho feeds upon a plant so different             from     the food     upon which the
 other is found, that probably the food of the one would poison the
 other, it appears to me that the specific distinctions between the two
 insects may be regarded as established.
      We have, however,        P.   Salmacis still remaining          undetermined,      its
 caterpillar    and chrysalis      not having as yet been           found.     The chief
 distinction to be remarked in its external character is the slight                     but
 peculiar areola of white scales which surround                 the black spot occu
 pying an exactly similar position in the                 upper wing as in Agestis.
 Although       Mr    Doubleday regards this insect as a variety of               P. Ar-
 taxerxes,    I  have always      felt and still believe it         to be   much     more
 closely allied to    P.  Agestis.    During last year (1855)          I visited   Castle-
 Eden-Dene, the habitat of         P. Salmaeis,      and bearing in mind my         obser
 vations on      Arthur's Seat, felt sure         I   should   by   digging in similar
 places under       the tufts of Helianthemum              find the chrysalids.          In
this    I was unsuccessful, although the Helianthemum                  was most abun
dant.     The spot     on which    P.  Salmacis is found faces the sea (the Ger
 man Ocean), and the ground is a stiff wet clay, with dense, coarse
 herbage, both ill suited for burying its chrysalid, if that be its habit;
 nor is the Helianthemum           the prevailing plant there.          Mr   Wailes     ob
serves,    that he has      never found it more inland            than a quarter of        a
 mile from the sea       ; and  although the Helianthemum is most abundant
 in the upper part of the Dene, Mr Tristram, the clergyman of the
district, and other residents, assured me it was never seen except                       on
the spot     I  have named, by a high         cliff of clay overhanging          the sea.
 This certainly      suggests   the idea    of its being dependent on           some    lit
toral plant growing         only within a certain range of the salt water.
I    observed     the Antliroccera filipendula           and   Procris statices flying
in great numbers together with             P.  Salmaeis, and their chrysalids at
tached to the stems of plants were abundant.                    I did  not at the time
know of      Mr Harding's        observations, and that         P. Agestis     fed upon
Erodium cicutarium,           and, consequently, did not particularly                 note
whether that plant grew there            ; but having been accustomed to bota
nical observations all my life,         I  think    I  should certainly have noticed
it  if it had been the prevailing plant,          — a thing, moreover, which           the
stiff clay soil renders improbable.            What     I did  notice was the Gera
nium sanguineum in great quantity (the flowers filled with Ceutorhyn-
chus geranii), a plant not far removed in natural affinity from the one
I  have   just named.        Altogether,     I  feel inclined      to predict    that   P.

                                      355
Salmons may         be found to feed on  Geranium sanguineum, and           to at
tach    its chrysalids    to the  stems  ;   but this is mere     surmise, and
until its transformations have been observed,          it must still remain,      as
it now is, an undetermined species.
3.  On Solar       Light, with a Description of          a simple Photome
                        ter.  By Mungo Ponton, Esq.
    The first part of this communication          was   occupied with a detail
of some observations, made          in the course     of last summer, on the
quantity-arid      intensity  of Solar   light,  as  compared with       familiar
sources of artificial flame.       The instrument employed for         these ob
servations was a simple monochromatic photometer, whose construc
tion was minutely described.
    The results obtained were stated         to be, that a small surface,      illu
minated by mean solar light, is 444 times brighter than when it is
illu minated by      a moderator lamp, and 1560 times       brighter than when
it is illuminated      by a wax candle (short six in the lb.), — the artificial
light being in both instances placed at two inches distance from the
illuminated surface. It was then pointed out, that as the electric
light maybe easily obtained of a brilliancy equal to 520 wax candles,
three such electric lights, placed at two inches from a given small
surface, would render it as bright as when it is illuminated            by mean
sunshine.
    It    was thence inferred, that a stratum       occupying the entire sur
face of the sphere of which the earth's distance from the sun is the
radius, and consisting of three layers of flame, each T ffVff'h of an inch
in thickness, each possessing a brightness equal to that of such an
 electric    light, and all three embraced within a thickness of j^th of
an inch, would give an amount of illumination equal in quantity and
 intensity to that of the sun at the distance of 95 millions of miles
 from his centre.
     It   was then shown, that were such a stratum           transferred    to the
 surface of the sun, where it would occupy 46,275 times less area,
 its thickness would be increased to 94 feet, and it would embrace
  138,825 layers of flame, equal in brightness            to the electric    light;
 but that the same effect might be produced by a stratum about nine
 miles in thickness, embracing          72 millions     of layers,  each    having
  only    a brightness equal to that of    a  wax candle.
     The various possible      causes  of the light proceeding from        the    lu

                                    350
mi nous envelope of the sun were then considered;            and an   attempt
was made to show that the shining          particles  in that   envelope may
possibly   be minute    luminiferous   organisms,    floating    in an  elastic
atmosphere, each emitting only a small amount of phosphorescence, —
the enormous flood of splendour       emanating from the surface of          the
medium being due to the combined action of these individually            feeble
agents.

    The following Communications were read : —
1. On certain cases       of Binocular Vision. By Professor Wil
   liam B. Rogers.        Communicated by Professor Kelland.
    The object of this paper     was to ascertain, by a geometrical con
struction, the optical appearance presented by the binocular vision            of
a straight  line and a circle, or of two straight lines.        The   problem
discussed  was, accordingly, the geometric one of the intersection of           a
cone  with  a plane, or  of two  cones with each other     :  and the  conclu
sion arrived at was that the apparent image is always a conic          section.
The author took no account of the perspective of the presented com
bination of images, nor of the union or disunion of the extremities
of the respective images when their lengths are different.            Nor    did
he allude to the mode by which the mind arrives          at connected      con
clusions, from separate examination by the eye, whether by retention
of images on the retina, or by the action of the memory, or other
wise.    In anticipation of the introduction of such subjects, which the
author has discussed in three papers, printed in Silliman's Journal            of
last year, Sir D. Brewster       addressed   the following     letter to Prof.
Kelland, which puts      some   of these   questions in a striking point      of
view, and is of considerable interest    : —
    " My dear Mr Kelland, — I         observe   that Professor Rogers      is to

                                           357
read a paper on       Binocular       Vision at the Royal Society         on Monday.
As he has published his experiments and views on this subject in
three articles in Silliman's Journal for July, October, and November,
1855,    I presume       that the paper he is about to read will contain the
same views.         I regret that     I  cannot be at the meeting on Monday
to defend my theory          of the Stereoscope against his objections to it ;
which    are    founded on an inaccurate perception of the phenomena,
and stand in direct           opposition to the       Law of Visible Direction,
which    I have placed       beyond    a doubt, and which,       I believe, is univer
sally admitted.
    " Mr    Rogers maintains that two lines of unequal length,                  AB, ab,
for example, ab being the shortest, can be made to coalesce perfectly,
i.e., that when the points A a are united by distinct vision, B and 6
are also united.         Now, when the optical axes are converged, on Aa
united and       seen  distinctly, B and       b, the other ends     of the lines, are
seen indistinctly, and, therefore, the observer cannot               see  them united,
unless by running the point of distinct vision from                 A  to  B, when he
will   see them       united.       But when     he is thus seeing    these points B
and b united,       A   and a have separated        till the  eye returns and unites
them as before.         This    is the true process which goes on, and the ap
parent union of the lines thus             effected   is aided by two causes which
Mr    Rogers does not seem to have noticed.                 The  eye runs from      A to
B and back again in           less than one-third       of a second (the duration of
the impression         of light upon the retina), so that the impression of
A and a united remains                when the eye is actually seeing           B and   b
united.     The other      cause is merely an      auxiliary one, and      is not neces
sary to the apparent union of the line. It is the mental recollection of
the union of A and a when the eye has passed in an instant to join
B 6.      I  lay no stress, however, upon this fact, as it is only a phy
sical   one, on the supposition         that a recollected impression is the re
sult of a visual sensation.
    " If   two unequal lines can be united and perfectly coalesce, then
two separate visible points would have their pictures                   on    the retina
coincident    ;   or, what is the same thing, a line joining two points, a
and   6, would have a single           point for its image      on  the retina    ; and,
what is still more absurd, two different points of the retina would
have the same line of visible direction !
    " When       the difference between the two lines             AB   and ab exceeds
a certain quantity, the apparent             coalescence,     produced by the causes

                                         358
 I  have mentioned, entirely         disappears, and it is then easy to     con
 vince one's self that the ends    B and   6 are not only extremely indistinct,
 but completely separated when the optic axes are converged upon               A
 and a united and seen distinctly.
     " You   will oblige   me by reading     these few and hurried observa
 tions to the Society.       I differ  with  Mr  Rogers on many other points
 to which    I shall   have occasion to refer in a treatise on the Stereo
scope which     will  soon be published.       I am,  &c.

        M.D., F.R.S.E., Professor of Chemistry in the Univer
        sity of Edinburgh.
     The author, after referring to his former paper on this            subject,
stated that he had continued the investigation,           and that the number
of undescribed      forms besides those formerly figured         had proved   so
large, that the present paper does not conclude the subject, but           that

                                                      359
a good many forms remain for a future communication.                                         He     added,
that even now, after he bad explored                              600 slides     of    it,   new     forms
were   still occasionally found.
     He then gave a list of about thirty additional                                   known        species,
which had been noticed since the former                               paper was read, many of

Okeden.              He bad also found both                 these    forms in soils from South
America,         and gave his reasons                   for suspecting 0. mirabilis to be an
abnormal state of 0. spinosa.
     He then          proceeded       to describe the following new species, of which
very exact drawings                   by   Dr Greville were exhibited —           :
     1.   Navicula rhombica, n. sp.                              2. Navicula   maxima, n. sp.
     Both of          these    had been          figured     in the former        paper, but were
now better understood.                      N.   rhombica occurs in packs, like packs of
cards.

doubtfully, as no description of N. nitida, Sm., has yet appeared.
The two others are quite new. The author here stated that he had
found in this deposit           N. didyma        with   costae, so that he considers it
possible that all these forms may belong to only one species                         ; but the
point requires investigation.

  2.   Theory of the Free Vibration of a Linear Series of Elastic
               Bodies.         Part II. By Edward Sang, Esq.
      I.  The first part of this paper             was   occupied with        the   discussion
  of the validity of Newton's              Theory of the Propagation of Sound.
  In   order to discover the velocity of sound, Newton supposes a series
  of particles ranged in         a straight     line   to be set to vibrate        all  equally
  and isochronously, but the epoch of vibration to vary gradually                          along
  the line   ;  and he then investigates              the circumstances         under     which
  such a vibration       is possible.       The true result of the investigation               is
  this, — that    if the two extreme particles              be kept     vibrating      by  some

                                             361
 external       influence, and      if all  the intermediate      particles  be   fairly
 started     with     the velocities     appropriate    to  their   positions   in the
 series, the constrained vibrations           of the two extreme particles, aided
 by the     elasticities of the intermediate         parts, are sufficient to main
 tain the vibrations        of those parts.
     Neither the premises of this investigation nor the conclusion have
 the   slightest      reference to the problem        "  to discover the velocity     of
 sound."          In order to represent the conditions of this problem, we
 must suppose         that, the row of particles being at rest, the particle at
 one end      receives a sudden impulse, and we must seek to trace the
 manner in which this impulse is propagated along the chain ; and                      it
 is evident that there is not one point of connection between Newton's
theory and such premises.
    Having failed in many attempts to separate the variables which
enter into the analysis, the author of the paper was again led to
consider      the question       by the construction       of the Manohester        and
Liverpool railway; for the question in hand is identical in its charac
               this one,    "
ter with                      to investigate     the effect  of a concussion on a
train of waggons connected by elastic buffers ;" but although the
practical       importance of the subject induced him to make more
strenuous efforts, the difficulties of the integrations again baffled him.
In   the month        of November last, however, being again led to recon
sider the problem, he was so fortunate as to discover an easy method
of separating          the variations so as to render them integrable,              and
thus to     bring the matter within the          scope  of strict analysis.
    The same method is applicable                 to problems of a higher         class.
Thus     if  we suppose       a number      of planets, of which the attractions
are proportional         to the distances, although       these attractions    be not
proportional to the masses of the attracting bodies, the integrations
can be effected.         The result of    the investigation shows that such a pla
netary system would have as many nuclei as planets,                   — one   of  these
nuclei being the centre           of gravity   ; each  of the other nuclei would
describe an ellipse          around the centre of gravity in its own periodic
time   ;  and thus the motion of any one planet would be the com
pound      of    as many     elliptic motions, less one, as there are planets,
superadded to the rectilineal motion of the centre of gravity.
    It was mentioned that this is the first instance in which the pro
blem     of three bodies          has been resolved when the resultants          of the
attractions do not all pass through one point.

                                    3G2
    II.  The motions of a linear elastic series form but a             case of the
preceding problem.       It was shown that the vibration           of  a series of
n equal bodies are compounded          of n—       1  distinct   vibrations, per
formed in times which are proportional           to the secants       of  the mul
tiples of the nth part of a quadrant.             These     times, then, are all
incommensurable,     so that  a perfectly elastic series       of n   bodies could
never again return     to its original  state   ;   nay, not even      two of     the
bodies could ever again be simultaneously at the corresponding parts
of their orbit.
    This incommensurability     of the periodic times presents              a great
obstacle to a theoretic estimate of the velocity with which                 an im
pulse is transmitted, since it is difficult     to decide     what phenomenon
should be defined as constituting      the transmission         ;  and since      the
equations to be evolved contain       the sines of angles of which                the
ratios are incommensurable.       Thus, although the equations               enable
us to compute the state of the system        at any prescribed time,         we are
unable to resolve generally the converse          question, — At     what time      is
any one body in a given state     ?
    One very important deduction is, that a blow on one end of an
elastic series evokes every oscillation of which the series is suscep
tible, and that, therefore, no pure or musical sound can ever               be pro
duced by a perfectly elastic body.       A   simple oscillation can only           be
produced by the concurrence of twice as many initiatory conditions
as there are particles.     Now there is no doubt that the vibrations
of elastic bodies  do resolve themselves       into simple or very slightly
complicated vibrations, so that the viscidity, imperfect               elasticity of
the parts, or some analogous        quality     of the material,         must    ope
rate.
    The time needed for the transition from an infinitely              confused to
a simple vibration, and the manner in which              that transition      is ac
complished, may lead to the explanation            of consonant sounds         ; and
 the existence of some    of the higher    classes     of vibrations with        that
 vibration which gives the musical pitch,            may occasion the peculiar
 phenomena of vowel sound.

       Right Rev. BISHOP TERROT, V.P., in                        the Chair.
     The following Communications              were read     : —
  1.  An Account of some Experiments on certain Sea-Weeds
     of an Edible kind. By John Davy, M.D., F.R.S., Lond.
     and Edin., &c.
     The  sea-weeds    examined by the author, reported on in this paper,
  were the following    : — Carrigeen    Moss [Chondrus crispus), Dulse or
  Dylisk   (Rhodymenia palmetto), Sloke or Laver (Porphyra laci-
  niata), Tangle (Laminaria digitata), Doughlaghman                (Fucus vesi-
  cidosus).
     The results, imperfect       as they are, it   is stated, are offered   as a
  contribution,   with     the  hope of inducing       others more favourably
  situated to turn their attention to a subject hitherto,          in a chemical
 point of view, singularly neglected.
     Chondrus crispus was found to be         composed     of about 28-5 parts
 by weight soluble in cold water, of 49 soluble in boiling water, and
 of about 22-5 per        cent, resisting both infusion and decoction.        The
 part dissolved by boiling water had the properties of gelatine            ;  that
 by cold water of mucilage.
     In  Dulse no gelatine was detected.          Acted    on by cold, followed
 by boiling water, it lost about 52 per cent. Its colouring matter has
 the property of combining with alumina, and is precipitated by this
 earth from its infusion.
      Sloke or Laver    was    found to be very similar to the preceding.
 Acted    on by cold and by boiling water it lost about 50 per cent.
     Tangle also bore a considerable resemblance to the preceding,
judging from the properties of its infusion and decoction. The stalk
yielded less soluble matter to water than          the fronds, only about 13-5
per cent.
     Fucus vesiculosus lost by infusion about 16 per cent., and by sub
sequent decoction about 39 per cent.
     In  all these Algae iodine was detected       in the matter extracted by
 infusion and decoction, and in the residual matter           : it was found also
 in the water     used    to wash the weeds,    for the purpose of removing

                                       364
 the  salt adhering, derived from the sea, iu which they grew.                  The
proportion of iodine, as indicated by testing the saline matter ob
tained from the ash, varied in each. It was found very abundant in
tangle, with a trace of bromine, and especially in the stem.                 In  the
ash of each also a notable proportion       of phosphate of lime was found,
with more or less of carbonate of lime and magnesia.
    In conclusion, the author offers some general remarks — 1st, On
the   absence  in   these  algae  of starch, fatty or oily matter, and          sac
charine matter.      2d, On the necessity of minute research             to deter
mine the exact nature of their          several  proximate principles.          3d,
On the loss sustained by washing the weeds preparatory to their
being used as food, thereby diminishing         their value.      4th, On their
value as articles of food,     if the nitrogen    they afford may be consi
dered as a criterion of their nutritive power       :  a table is given showing
the proportion of this substance       in each,  as   determined by Professor
Apjohn, exhibiting the unexpected result, that these esculent                 algse
are actually richer in nitrogen than flour of the first quality.               5th,
On the advantage likely       to be derived, especially by persons of the
labouring class, in regard to health, from their more general                  use.
6th, On their efficacy as manures, on account of the nitrogen which
they yield in the act of decomposition, and the inorganic compounds
they supply to the soil.        Lastly, On the part they perform            in the
economy    of nature — in purifying sea-water by removing               excess    of
carbonic acid, and probably azote — and in separating and storing                up,
not only most of the inorganic elements which exist in terrestrial
plants, but others, especially those powerful medicinal agents, iodine
and bromine, as     if specially for the   use  of man.
2.   On the Deflection of the Plumb-Line at Arthur's Seat,                     and
    on the  Mean Density of the Earth.              By Lieutenant-Colonel
    James,   R.E.      Communicated by Professor Forbes.
    The author    states that the results of the Trigonometrical           Survey
of Great Britain are now nearly ready for publication, and that                   he
has   deduced   from them the most          probable measures which            they
afford of the length of a meridian, and the figure of the earth.
    After determining the       most probable spheroid from        all the astro
nomical and geodetical      operations in Great Britain, it has been found
that the plumb-line      is sensibly deflected     at several of the trigono

                                         365
metrical stations    ;  but in almost every case the physical cause of such
irregularity may be with probability inferred.
    In the case of the station at the Edinburgh Observatory, and on
the summit of Arthur's Seat, where the latitudes inferred geodeti-
cally in consistency with the entire            survey are compared with           the
direct astronomical       determinations,      a deviation of the plumb-line
towards the south, to the extent of between            5" and 6" is manifested.
The exact latitudes are       as follow    :—
                                     Observed.           Calculated.     Difference.
     Observatory, Calton  Hill,    55°57'23"-20        55*57'17"-57          5"-63
     Arthur's Seat, summit,    .   55° 56' 43"71      55°56'38"-44           5"-27
    From this it is evident that the discrepancy occurring at the Ob
 servatory cannot be ascribed to the deflecting attraction of Arthur's
 Seat, where    it exists almost equally.        Colonel James attributes it in
 both cases   to the effect of the hollow of the Firth of Forth to tho
north, together with the         mass  of high ground to the south, includ
ing the Pentland       and Lammermoor ranges.              On actually calculat
 ing the effect of the configuration        of the ground within a radius of
 15 miles, about 2"-6 of the deviation is accounted for; and the
 writer believes that the mountainous             country beyond may farther
sensibly increase the effect.
    With a view     to determine the      strictly local attraction of Arthur's
 Seat, three stations were fixed nearly on a common meridian line,
passing through the summit of the hill.              These are marked          N, A,
 and S.     The station     N    (most northerly) is in the vicinity            of St
Anthony's Chapel, A         is almost on the highest point of the             hill, S
 is situated on the knoll above Sampson's Ribs. 220 double obser
vations of stars were made at each station in September and October
 1855 with     Airy's Zenith Sector.
    The difference of astronomical latitude of          the stations    N   and S is
42"-56.
    The difference of the geodetical latitudes is
    The difference of these numbers, or 4"-10, measures the double
deflection of the plumb-line at the two stations due to the attraction
of the interposed hill.
    The accurate system of contours which have               been    carried   round
the   hill allows the calculation of the attraction of all its parts at
the two stations       N  and S, to be performed with the utmost nicety,
on   the supposition of its being of homogeneous material.                    By in-

and denoting by x the unknown                 ratio of the density of the hill          to
that of the entire globe, these equations are obtained                 :
      Deflection at South station,        .        .             =  4-197 x North.
            „         Arthur's Seat,      .         .      .      = 0-607 m South.
            „         North station,     .                        = 3-710 a South.
by the solution of which the ratio of the density of the hill to that
of the whole earth is as -5245 to 1.*
    By extending the radius of sensible attraction considerably                  beyond
6000 feet, and calculating the             effect  of the surrounding        country in
the same manner on the plumb-line at the three stations, this value
of the relative density of the globe is somewhat modified.                    The   ratio
is then -5348 to 1.
    From direct experiments on the specific gravity of the rocks                         of
Arthur's Seat, Colonel James infers the mean density of the hill                         to
be 2-75 times that         of water   ; whence the earth's density comes out
                                           514,
with a probable error of 0-07.
3. On the        Possibility of combining two or more independent
    Probabilities of the same Event, so as to form one definite
    Probability.          By Bishop Terrot.
    In  this paper the author showed that, a and                e being independent
probabilities of the same event, the expression a +                 e —  ae,   given    in
the article     Probability in the Encyclopaedia Metropolitana as the
value of their combined force, was erroneous.                      For if a + e— ae
be the probability        of the occurrence of the event, then 1— o +              l— «
 —  1 —a    •
               1 —  e  or  1 — a e, is the probability        of its  non-occurrence.
Whereas       the probability      of non-occurrence derived directly from             the
expression a + e—a           e is 1 -fa e   — a + e.
    It  was then shown,         that if the ratio     only of equally probable      cases
 in two or more probabilities were given, no definite probability could
 be derived from their composition ; but that if the two given pro
 babilities       and   -   indicate   not merely the ratios, but the actual
              ^
   * The outstanding        abnormal deflection of the plumb-line                    to be
                                                                         (assumed
 equal at the three stations) amounts to 4"-72.

                                              367
numbers of favourable and unfavourable cases or hypotheses, their
compound force is properly expressed by
                                                                   J.
    Under both of these conditions, the                   second    given probability in
creases or diminishes            the force of the first, according as the fraction
expressing the second is greater or less than that expressing the first.
When the ratios only are given, then the increase or diminution is
indefinite.          When the actual numbers are given it is definite.
    In    conclusion, it was questioned whether                      was a proper expres
                                                               ^
sion   for the probability derived from total ignorance, and whether
this would not be more properly expressed by the indefinite fraction
§      It     was shown that such a        priori probability had             no effect upon
the force       of   a subsequently admitted probability.

   The following Communications              were read      : —
1.  On Atmospheric Manoscopy, or on the direct Determina
   tion of the Weight of a given bulk of Air with reference to
   Meteorological Phenomena in general, and to the Etiology
   of Epidemic Diseases.          By Dr Seller.
   The intention    of the author in this communication               is to  recom
mend the daily determination of the weight, by direct means, of                 some
considerable bulk of atmospheric          air.  This subject has         become      of
interest to medical observers, owing to the belief which has arisen,                on
hardly sufficient  grounds, that during the prevalence of                 epidemics
the air is of greater weight than usual.           The late Dr Prout,          whose
researches on the specific gravity of air give authority to his opinion,
was led to conclude, from the greater weight observed               to belong     to a
given bulk of air at the first outbreak of Asiatic cholera in London
during the year    1832, that a malarious principle, heavier than                  the
atmosphere itself, was    at that time slowly diffusing            itself   through
the atmosphere.     Other observers in the succeeding         cholera-epidemics
have contented themselves with           determining     the daily weight of          a
cubic foot of air by calculation from the recorded barometric pressure,
temperature,    and humidity.      The author endeavours to show that
this last method does not meet       the case.     He says that, in order to
detect foreign elastic matter in the atmosphere,               it is  necessary to
weigh a certain bulk of air    ; for  if the foreign matter be lighter than
the atmosphere itself, it increases the general pressure, while it ren
ders a given bulk of air lighter than usual      ;  and though, when         heavier
than the atmosphere itself, it both increases        the general pressure         and
the weight of a given bulk of air, yet that the former effect may                   es
cape detection, while the latter is distinct.

                                      369
    Dr Seller further insists that,    even when no foreign elastic matter
 exists in the atmosphere, there is reason to doubt       if the specific gra
 vity of the air near the earth's surface is uniformly dependent on the
 general pressure, the temperature,       and the humidity.       Among the
 grounds for this doubt, he refers to the vast extent           of the atmo
 sphere, the infinity of circumstances constantly tending to disturb its
 equilibrium, the considerable periods of time required on many occa
 sions to restore that equilibrium, if it can be said to have an ordinary
 equilibrium,    and, in particular,    to the peculiar   laws, in some de
 gree antagonistic    of gravity and therefore of pressure, observed        to
 affect the distribution   of gaseous bodies, whether placed simply con
 tiguous to each other, or already in a state of mixture.       He concludes,
therefore, that the only mode in which any useful result in this sub
ject, either   as respects the etiology   of epidemic   diseases or meteoro
logical   phenomena in general, can be obtained, is by following the
example of Prout, and determining            daily, by a direct process, the
weight of   some certain volume      of air.   Neither does he regard the
efforts at present making by chemists to detect foreign bodies in the
atmosphere by means of chemical tests as necessarily superseding the
proposal to determine its daily variations of density by direct means.
    Dr Seller   considers the usual method of weighing air by compar
ing the weight of an exhausted vessel with that of the same vessel
filled with air,  as involving  too much trouble for daily use.       He sug
gests that a near approximation        to an exact result may be made by
observing the difference between the weight of a light body in vacuo
and its weight in air    ; the former being a constant quantity for every
place, while the latter varies in exact conformity with every change
which occurs in the density of the air.        The larger such a light body
is, and the greater the difference of bulk between it and its counter
poise, the nearer is the approximation to an exact result, while there
is the less   need for extreme nicety in the process.      The counterpoise,
with the exception of the mere grain weights, should be capable of
easy admeasurement ; for example, cubic inches of a heavy metal.
The sum of the weights of the       body and its counterpoise    in vacuo, di
minished by the sum of their weights in air, is to be divided in the
ratio of their bulks for the weight of air which each displaces. The
weight of a body in vacuo, independently of its weight in air, can be
ascertained with precision in proportion as the following data, at a
certain temperature,     are exactly known, viz., the weight       in vacuo of

                                        370
a given measure of distilled water, the volume of distilled water         equal
to the bulk of the body, the weight of the body when immersed in
distilled water, allowance being made for the difference          between the
weight of the counterpoise       in vacuo and in air.
    The chief difficulty is   to procure a body of sufficient    size not    too
heavy for a delicate balance.         It  seems not improbable   that a  mate
rial may be found which, when formed into a globe or             a drum, and
filled with air merely for the sake of lightness, shall          not exceed    a
pound in weight, and yet may be of such a size as, with a              balance
turning with the tenth of a grain, may, under the occasional            correc
tion of exact methods, enable those who engage in meteorology           merely
for the sake of occupation, to add to their register a near approxima
tion to the daily density of air.         If such a body, equal to or  exceed
ing a cubic foot in volume, cannot be provided with the requisite           qua
lities, namely, lightness, permanence in figure, impermeability           to air
and moisture, and the being susceptible of having its expansions             and
contractions,    under changes of temperature, reduced to rule, a          glass
globe capable of displacing 600 cubic inches of air, with a little         more
pains and attention, can be made to serve the purpose recommended
in this communication.
2. Researches         on   Chinoline and its Homologues.                By    C.
    Greville Williams.          Communicated        by  Dr T.  Anderson.
     In this inquiry,    which    is an extension of an investigation      pub
lished in the Transactions        for last year, the author examines         the
connection which has been said to exist between chinoline            and qui
nine, and shows that they bear no simple relation             to each other.
He states,    also,   that the supposed analogy between the action of
heat on quinine and the hydrated            oxide of tetramethyl-ammonium
does not exist, and that      the assertions which      have been    made re
garding    the possibility   of the formation of quinine from the leukol
of coal-tar are founded on error.          He then, after showing that   chino
line from cinchonine had not previously been obtained in a state              of
purity, gives the history and composition of the platinum,           gold, and
palladium    salts  ; also the nitrate, bichromate, and binoxalate.
    He describes two new      classes    of salts formed by the chlorides of
cadmium and uranyl with organic bases, and gives the analysis of

                                     371
their compounds with chinoline.          Then follows      a determination   of
the vapour density of chinoline, and an examination           of the action of
the iodides of the alcohol radicals on the      base, and some     of the pro
ducts of the decomposition        of the hydriodates of the ammonium
bases so formed.
    He also examines the chinoline series       as it  is obtained from coal-
tar, and proves the presence, in addition to chinoline, of lepidine,
and a new base, " cryptidine."

4. On the Transmission of the Actinic Rays of Light through
       the Eye, and their relation to the Yellow Spot of the
       Retina.      By George Wilson, M.D.
    In  1849 the learned Swiss philosopher Wartmann stated, in his
"  Deuxieme Memoire sur le Daltonisme," p. 40, that " the eye

                                               372
arrests the chemical          radiations which accompany the more refran
gible rays."         He founded this conclusion on experiments                          made
with guaiac resin ; but as this substance is by no means very                           sensi
tive to actinic        influence,     it   seemed     desirable     to test the question
whether      the eye can       transmit        the chemical         rays of light, by        an
appeal to those          highly impressible           actinolytes      (as   they may        be
called)    which       the recent      progress       of photography         has    revealed
to us.
   The     necessary     trials were kindly made for me by Messrs Dick                      and
Spiller of London, and their results, which are opposed                           to those of
Wartmann, were published last autumn in the Appendix                                 (p.   166)
to my Researches on Colour-Blindness.
 I      now lay upon the Society's table photographs of small                        objects,
on glass and paper,          produced by rays which,                before reaching         the
sensitive surfaces, had traversed the transparent humours of an                            ox's
eye.      These photographs           were obtained by the gentlemen               I       have
named in the following way             :   —
        An ox-eye      was prepared by cutting away the sclerotic until the
choroid came into view   circular aperture of one-eighth of an inch
                              ;   a
in diameter was then made through this membrane and the retina,
which laid      bare the vitreous          humour        at   a   point opposite to that
where the light enters.             The     eye was then supported           in    the brass
mounting of      a     photographic        lens (i.e.,   a    brass tube adapted        to the
front of   a   camera),    resting     at the posterior end on a ring                of    cork
which fitted tightly into the tube, and retained in front                          by a    dia
phragm,     so as to     permit the cornea to protrude.               From the     arrange
ment of the fittings, we are quite satisfied that no light excepting
that which passed through the eye could enter the camera.
   " Within      the dark box,strip of black paper, with
                                      a                     diamond-          a
shaped or rhombic aperture occupying the greater part of its breadth,
was extended across in front of the prepared collodion glass plate, so
as to throw its image on the latter, in the event                    of any chemical       rays
finding their way to it.            The camera was then pointed to                  the sky
(the morning being bright and the sun shining), and the plate ex
posed for fifteen seconds.   On developing with solution of sul
phate of iron,       a   very decided picture            appeared.      The glass       plate
which     accompanies this paper was                 the result      of twenty      seconds'
exposure.
   " The    conclusion derived from this experiment, although perfectly

                                       373
satisfactory to those who arranged the apparatus,                 is open to the ob
jection, on the part of others, that the picture does not present any
prima facie evidence of its being the result of rays which passed
through the eye.        We therefore endeavoured to copy photographi
cally the actual image which is depicted on the retina.                      To do so,
another bullock's eye was carefully dissected,           so as to open a circular
space of about three-eighths of an inch in diameter at the back of
the eye, the retina was removed, and a very thin film of glass,                      in
shape like a watch-glass,        substituted for     it;   this supported       the vi
treous humour in its original        position, and served also to prevent its
contact with the photographic paper placed behind to receive the im
pression.     In  another trial, the retina was left untouched, without
altering the ultimate result.
    " Iodide of silver paper was then       made sensitive to        light by awash
of gallo-nitrate of silver, and      used as in the Talbotype           process, small
squares of the wet paper being successively applied                    to the back    of
the thin glass film, and exposed for varying periods (one minute on
an average) to the different objects to which the bullock's eye was
presented.     On developing the latent            images with           strong  gallo-
nitrate of silver, very distinct      pictures    were obtained           of a key and
of a spotted window curtain.           These negative pictures are inclosed.
It  is thus beyond a doubt that the chemical             rays penetrate the hu
mours of the eye, and impinge upon the retina.
                                                            " Allan B. Dick.

    It  thus appears that the actinic or chemical rays are not arrested
in their  passage   across the chamber        of the eye      ;  and it becomes      an
 important question      how they    will  affect  the general surface of the
retina on which       they impinge, and what share they have in pro
ducing    vision.    Into this problem,       as a whole, however,            I do not
 purpose to enter   :   the question   I  alone consider is the change which
 the actinic rays will undergo when they fall upon that peculiarly or
 ganized portion of the human retina which anatomists distinguish as
 the  " yellow spot."       This  " spot," almost peculiar to man, presents
 a diameter of about      j'jth  inch, and occupies the bottom of the eye,
 in the exact axis of its transparent humours.              It  is more transparent
 than the rest of the retina, and has long been recognized as the seat
 of most perfect vision in the eye of man.             I  have      elsewhere drawn
    vol. hi.                                                                2 I

attention to the effect which it must have as a coloured medium                                         on
the light which reaches it,* and on the actinic rays which traverse                                      it.
I wish now to carry these views a step further, in connection with the
reflection of light from the choroid through the retina, which was dis
cussed before the Society last session,                    in   a   paper
                                                                             " On      the   Eye    as   a
Camera Obscura" and which, before and since, has been largely                                      made
the subject of independent inquiry   foreign and British observers. In
                                                    by
particular, Professor Goodsir has shown, in lecture delivered in thea
University of Edinburgh last June, and since published,!                                        that     it
is   not merely the case that light traverses the retina                                to the      cho
roid, and          is   then reflected so as to return              through        the retina, but
that     it   is   only the rays thus returned                  which produce           a luminous
sensation.              The light, therefore, which traverses the yellow                            spot,
and      is   then reflected forwards on the choroidal                      extremities            of   the
optically sensific constituents of the retina, must have been deprived,
to   a   greater or less extent, of its actinic rays, before                      it   determines        a
luminous           sensation, unless       the portion       of the retina             under       notice
differ from all other yellow transparent media known                                   to us,      in   not
arresting the chemical               rays.     If   it    be not in this           respect      excep
tional, then the theory of perfect                   human vision may be simplified
by   the exclusion from consideration of the actinic rays                          ;    and one         use
of the yellow spot, for which                 it   has hitherto         baffled    physiologists         to
find a use, may be to extinguish                    these radiations.        I      offer this only
as a suggestion, the value of which must be determined by testing
the chemical power of light after                   it   has traversed the yellow spot, —
an    experiment which only those                   few anatomists           can    try who         have
the opportunity       of examining the human eye soon after death.
I        will only, therefore, remark further, in reference to the absorp
tion of the actinic rays by the yellow spot (with which this paper                                       is
chiefly concerned), that the views of those who have described visual
impressions on the retina, as phenomena of the same kind                                      as    pho
tographic               on surfaces charged with salts of silver, or
                    impressions
other actinolytes, must fall to the ground  the actinic rays of light
                                                                 if
are stopped before reaching the optically sensific constituents of                                      the
retina. The similar opinion, also, that "spectral vision,"                                   and other
abnormal peculiarities of sight, are phenomena of the same                                      kind     as

the development          (as it is technically called) of latent photographic
images, must, for the reason mentioned, be abandoned.                        It will still,
of course,    be competent to compare normal and abnormal vision with
photographic        effects,   as phenomena          displaying    analogy, though not
affinity.
    To one other relation of the retina                 to  light,  I make the briefest
reference.         If only    those rays which are reflected from the choroid
produce, by their impact on the retina, the objective perception of
light, and    if  the depth of tint of the yellow spot be considerable, and
its colour at all homogeneous, then perfect vision must be exercised
by yellow, not white light.               But   if  this be the case, we should be
unconscious of red and blue when seeing best, or at least should re
ceive from them an impression very different                     from that which they
occasion when they affect the general surface of the retina.                        I for
bear, however, to speculate on this,                   seeking rather      to direct   the
attention    of the few anatomists who have the opportunity                     of inves
tigating the subject to an examination of the chromatic as well as
the actinic relations of the yellow spot, than desiring to dogmatize
on either.*
    P. S. — I    take this opportunity         of expressing my regret, that in a
postscript,    added after       it  was read, to the paper in the Transactions

I   have, therefore, to request those who wish to do justice to                        Mr
Goodsir,     to    consult     his lecture     on     the Retina, published        in the

    The following Communications              were read      : —
 1. On the      Prismatic Spectra of the Flames of Compounds of
         Carbon and Hydrogen. By William Swan, Esq.
    While the prismatic spectra of the blue portions of an oil-lamp or
 coal-gas flame, exhibit a number of bright lines, separated by dark
 intervals, the spectra derived from the bright          light of     these flames
 are perfectly continuous.         Apparently inconsistent results are in like
 manner obtained when the flames of different compounds of carbon
 and hydrogen are compared.            Thus, lines are easily         seen  in  the

                                         377
spectrum of the flame of alcohol, which are invisible in that of the
flame of oil of turpentine.
    These discrepancies are shown, in the present paper, to arise from
 the predominance of the light of incandescent solid carbon in some
flames, and its comparative absence in others          :  and    it is also proved
that in order to obtain uniform results from the flames of the various
compounds of carbon and hydrogen, it is sufficient, in cases where
the body contains much carbon, to convert the carbon into carbonic
acid, without     its previous separation      in a solid form, by means            of
an artificial supply of air.       This is conveniently     effected for coal-gas
by means of the Bunsen gas-lamp,             which burns a mixture            of   gas
and air    ;  and, for other bodies, by directing     a stream      of air from      a
table blow-pipe      through the flame.
    When thus treated, all the compounds of carbon and hydrogen
which have been         submitted     to experiment,   were found to produce
identical spectra     ; that of the Bunsen lamp serving as a standard of
comparison.
    In   these spectra five   principal bright lines    were observed, accom
panied by several smaller          ones,   and separated by dark          intervals.
One of the lines, the well known            R of Fraunhofer,       has  been     long
known       to coincide   with the line     D of the solar spectrum.            Two
other extremely close coincidences were           discovered.       One between
a  brilliant green line of the lamp spectrum, and        the remarkable        triple
line b of Fraunhofer ; and another, between              a bright purple line,
and the conspicuous line G of the solar spectrum.
    It  follows, from these experiments, that all bodies whose composi
tion is expressed by the general formulae
                           Cp  Hr   ,  or Cp Hr 0„
produce, in burning,       perfectly identical   spectra  ;  the nature of the
light being always the same, notwithstanding variations in the rela
tive proportions of carbon and hydrogen, and the occasional                presence
of oxygen in the body.

2. On the      Laws of Structure of the more disturbed Zones
    of the Earth's Crust. By Professor H. D. Rogers, of the
    United States.
    After adverting to previous publications on the subject by himself
and Professor W. B. Rogers, the author of the paper began the
enunciation of the laws of structure of disturbed tracts of strata, by
stating    the general proposition that in all districts where the strata
have been displaced from the original positions or levels in which
they were deposited,       they invariably have the form of one or many
waves,    even where, from      a  flatness of the undulations, they    seemed
to retain their   original horizontality.       In  large areas of undulating
strata, where the dips are gentle, the main or primary crust              waves
are very broad    ; but where the dips are steep, the crests of the adja
cent undulations     are    more closely approximated,       and generally   the
amplitude of the waves is in proportion to their flatness.
    It  is another prevailing feature of districts of displaced strata, that
the undulations into which they have been lifted are approximately
parallel, and exhibit a remarkable          resemblance to those great conti
nuous billows,     which are called waves         of translation.   This  wave
like structure    was   first distinctly recognised by the author and bis
brother in the Appalachian chain of the United States, and has been
subsequently shown by them to characterize other mountain systems,
such as the    Jura, the Alps, and the mountainous districts of Wales
 and   Belgium, and other countries.
                                    Parallelism.
     1. Expressing,    in systematic form,       the general relations of    the
 flexures of the earth's crust to each other, the first law is that of
the mutual parallelism        of the waves.       This prevails not only     be
 tween adjacent individual        flexures,   but between these and the chief
 igneous axes of the disturbed zones, including them.             The parallel
 ism extends to the different groups of waves into which the breadth
of the undulated district         is divided,   and subsists as well between
 those which are curved       in their crest lines     as between  those which
 are straight.    The persistency of this law of parallelism throughout
 the Appalachian      chain, was fully exemplified        in the paper.     The
geological maps of the United States and of Pennsylvania,               soon to
 be published, make it obvious upon mere inspection.

                                         379
     2. The flexures, when the undulated belt is broad, exist in groups
of  waves,  and the parallelism        is generally    more perfect between the
members of a given group than between one group and another.
    3. Usually where the zone of undulated strata is extensive, there
are several orders of waves,          as regards      their dimensions, the      se
condary or lesser classes constituting as it were ripples on the slopes
and summits      of the primary or larger.            These    minor   flexures, or
subordinate rolls, are themselves parallel, but not always necessarily
parallel with the principal waves upon which they lie.
                   Form and Gradation of            the Waves.
    Three essential varieties of form prevail among the great flexures
of  the earth's crust.      1. The most simple is that of a symmetrical
wave, or one where the convex (anticlinal) or concave (synclinal)
curve is of equal flexure upon both slopes.                   This form belongs
chiefly  to   the   flatter    and   broader waves,       and    when    met   with
among those     of steeply-inclined       sides, is apt to be accompanied by
an angular bending       or even partial dislocation at the anticlinal or
synclinal axis.     2.  A  second prevailing     form is where one side of the
wave is visibly steeper than       the    other.    This   is the normal type     of
flexure in the Appalachian chain, in the           Jura mountains of Switzer
land, and in the undulated zone of Belgium and the Rhenish                     Pro
vinces.    3. Tho third     class of flexures embraces those which          exhibit
an inversion or folding under of the most bent slopes of the several
waves.     This doubling under frequently amounts to an almost per
fect parallelism of the two sides of the flexures.                  In such cases
where the alternate convex and concave bendings are numerous, and
the whole belt is closely plicated,          a transverse section presents the
puzzling phenomenon of strata of different ages dipping in one direc
tion, in parallel, seemingly conformable superposition, the newer rocks
underlying the older      ones as frequently      as they overlie them.
   Conceiving     a series of imaginary        geometric planes to bisect the
successive  anticlinal and synclinal bends in a belt of undulated strata,
these axis planes, as they may be called, are, in the case of the sym
metrical class of waves, necessarily perpendicular             ; but, in the other
two classes,   they are inclined      to the horizon,     and their dip or incli
nation is flatter   as the     waves    approach     the form    of most extreme
folding with inversion.       In many districts,     as along the south-eastern

                                             380
side  of the Appalachians,          and on both flanks of the        Alps,  these axis
planes, or what is the same thing, the foldings              of  the rocks, incline at
a very low angle,       implying an         excessive   amount of horizontal move
ment at the time the strata were thus plicated and packed together.
    This parallel reduplication of strata is usually attended by more or
less metamorphism, amounting to that change of internal structure
which is denominated cleavage              ;  and the cleavage planes, frequently
more conspicuous         than the original planes of sedimentation,               serve
still further   to conceal the flexures, and disguise               the true order of
superposition of the rocks.
           Waves     of   the Crust     both   Straight and Curvilinear.
    In the much corrugated belts, the crust waves are both straight
and curvilinear.         In   the Appalachians there are groups                of  both
these classes,    retaining their        special features throughout their entire
length, which, in some instances, exceeds                 100 miles.     Some of the
crescent-shaped waves           present their convex curvature towards the
region    of maximum            dislocation      and   metamorphism,      while   other
groups are concave          toward the same quarter.             These different sys
tems    of waves      seem     to have been         generated some of them from
straight, others from curvilinear fractures in the earth's crust.
    The Appalachian chain, regarded in the light of a long zone, or
 chain of groups of parallel straight and curving waves, consists of
 eleven sections, six       of which are straight        and five curvilinear,    three
 of the latter form being convex towards the                 N.W., and two      convex
 towards    the   S.E.,     the   whole zone having a length of 1500, and              a
 maximum breadth of 150 miles.                    Certain of the straight divisions
 have their anticlinal axes, or the crest lines of the undulations trend
 ing  N.  15°    E. ;  other divisions,         theirs  trending    N. 70" E., while
 some of the curving sections           of the chain show      a deflection  in the di
 rection of their individual axes of as much as 40°.                  Indeed, in par
 ticular instances, the change of trend amounts to as much as 60°.
 So remarkable a bending              without    disruption,   of groups of parallel
 anticlinals seems      incompatible with the inferences of some eminent
 geologists,    who     conceive       that    there   prevails   a  general   relation
 throughout     the globe between            the  directions of the lines and the
 epochs,  of crust elevation        ;  for we hero find that the self-same axis,
 generated throughout            its   whole length, not merely in one geolo

                                      381
gical period, but in one brief interval of time, alters its direction          to
coincide successively with sundry of the different assumed           systems of
crust elevation.
                          Gradations in Flexures.
   Every broad belt of undulated strata exhibits certain gradations
in the form of its flexures starting from the side of maximum
igneous action, as this is displayed in plutonic eruptions, or in dislo
cations and     metamorphism.       Crossing   the   zone,    the flexures first
met with are invariably of the closely plicated class, their axis planes
dipping often at      a low angle towards the igneous       border.    To these
succeed more and more open waves,          until, from being perpendicular,
the steep far sides of the undulations        become    flatter and flatter    in
their dips, till at last they assume a slope equal and symmetrical          with
those of the gentler        flanks.   Parallel    with   this   gradation   is a
progressive widening of the waves themselves, and a corresponding
sinking or flattening down of the summits, until they finally disappear
in imperceptible       undulations.   All   these phenomena of gradation
may be clearly       discerned in every section      across the Appalachian
chain, traced from the S.E. towards the         N.W.,    and a perfectly iden
tical structure will be found to exist in the great plicated belt ranging
through the Rhenish        Provinces and Belgium.        In truth, there   is no
great corrugated zone that does not display         a   similar law of grada
tion in its flexures, when these are properly traced and generalized.
                    Fractures in Undulated Zones.
   Two    classes of dislocations abound in all belts of the crust where
the strata are greatly undulated.         The least conspicuous, but most
numerous      are  comparatively    short faults,   transverse more or less
perpendicularly      to the strike of the anticlinal      and synclinal axes.
These abound in the Appalachians          and   other corrugated      mountain
chains, and are a principal cause of the deep transvere ravines and
mountain notches        which intersect their ridges, and give passage to
their streams.       The more obvious dislocations are the great longi
tudinal    ones    coincident either   with   the anticlinal     and synclinal
axis   planes,   or with the steep or inverted       sides  of the anticlinals.
A  distinctive    character of these great fractures is their parallelism to

                                       382
 the axis planes, whether         they are coincident      with   them     or   not.
 Many of the more extensive longitudinal            dislocations of the Appa
 lachians are traceable to the rupturing of the anticlinals along their
 most wrenched inverted slopes.           These waves are entire at their
 extremities, but     so broken along all their intervening       portions     as to
 present only one-half of the wave form, the other half being                   pro
 foundly   buried with inversion       under the unbroken        part.       Gene
 rally, in these great dislocations, the gently-dipping uninverted            slope
 of the   waves has been shoved     — in  the inclined    plane of the     fault —
 forward and upward upon the other inverted and crushed half,                   and
 in  some instances through a great distance.
    The up-driven parts having        been extensively     removed by      erosive
 action, the upper strata of the overturned buried half of the                wave
 are seen to be immediately overlapped in nearly conformable altitude
 of dip by the denuded lower strata of the uninverted side. Similar
 phenomena of the plunging of newer formations under older ones,
 with approximately conformable dips,       meet us continually      in the Alps,
 and other much plicated districts, and can be demonstrated to                have
 arisen from the same cause, the upward and forward                propulsion of
 the uninverted halves upon the inverted sides of the anticlinal            waves
along the great sloping        planes of dislocation,     into which the flex
 ures have snapped at the time of their sudden bending.
    These several laws of crust undulations, consisting of those which
relate to the parallelism,       form, gradation      in distance,    shape, and
dislocation of the waves, are exemplified in detail in the paper,          and by
appeals to the phenomena of some of the more conspicuously corru
gated tracts of Europe.        Viewing,   as one such zone, the undulated
districts of southern      Belgium, the Rhenish Provinces, the West-
phalian    coal-field, the chain of the Ardennes, and the Hundsruck,
Taurus, and Hartz ranges, and referring for proofs to the descrip
tions and maps of M. Dumont and other geologists, who have described
these provinces      in more or less     detail, the author    shows that this
belt displays all the phenomena of structure and gradation              described
by him as so conspicuous in the Appalachians of America.                 Sections
transverse to this region from S.E. to       N.W. will     be found to exhibit
precisely   the same      succession,  from    closely folded    flexures     with
metamorphism        through   steep   normal waves,     to   broad, open,      and
approximately      symmetrical ones.

                                         383
    The structure of the Jura chain of Switzerland              likewise    exhibits
proofs of the same laws.         There the crust       waves     closely resemble
those of the Appalachians       — the     whole chain is composed of several
groups of flexures,     differing    in their direction     or strike     ; but the
waves of each group display a remarkable parallelism among them
selves.    Very few of the flexures          exhibit actual inversion of their
steeper sides.     It is remarkable        that the steep slopes of the great
waves of the     Jura face the Alps ;       and those nearest the Alps, or on
the borders of the valley of Switzerland,           are more compressed than
those on the far side of the chain, — their more inclined flanks,                 for
example      in the Weissenstein,       dipping   even   perpendicularly,       or a
little past this, into partial inversion. This southward thrust of the
crests of the Jura anticlinals would seem to imply a movement
from the north, and not from the igneous axis of the Alps, or probably
from both quarters, at the period of the production of the flexures.
     The Alps themselves show the same general structural phenomena
as   the other plicated zones described, but under more complex condi
tions. This much convulsed mountain system contains but few
 waves of the open      or normal       type, consisting,   except on its outer
flanks, of many very         close   plications   of the strata.       When these
foldings   are carefully   studied and structurally        connected      with  each
other, the whole chain appears to          be composed   of two or more central
 parallel igneous crests, and each flank of these mountain ranges
 of a belt of closely compressed waves.                 Each of these plicated
 zones or Alpine slopes displays the axis planes of its flexures dipping
 in towards     the centre of its own chain, the flexures               nearest the
 igneous    axis plunging at a lower          or flatter inclination     than those
 more remote.      High in the     slopes of the chain, where denudation has
 removed the largest part of the originally present upper formations,
 only the synclinal folds of these remain preserved.                 These are the
  so-called V's of the tertiary and jurassic beds, pinched in between
 the closely folded anticlinals      of the gneissic, and other older rocks.
  The inward dip of nearly all the beds of both slopes of the Alps,
  thus occasioned by the completeness of the folding and the outward
  thrusting of the anticlinal parts of the flexures, is the obvious cause
  of that fan-like feature of dip of the entire chain, which has recently
 excited   so  much    discussion     among geologists.         Cleavage      of the
  rocks, and   a superinduced       crystallization    parallel    to  the cleavage

                                        384
 planes, contribute      not a little, the author conceives, to the illusive
appearance of a general inward dip of all the strata, even the               newest,
 under the older formations of the high igneous crests of the chain                     ;
 for both the cleavage planes and the crystalline              foliation observe      a
very constant parallelism       in the direction of their dip          to the dip of
tho axis planes of the flexures.
                                Slaty Cleavage.
    It  is now a good many years since Professor Sedgwick                 and other
geologists announced the important           general fact, that the structure
called slaty cleavage pervades the altered strata affected by it in di
rections independent of their bedding or laminae of deposition                 ;  that
these planes of cleavage are approximately               parallel   to each other
over large spaces of country, however contorted the dip of the rocks                   ;
and that where the cleavage is well developed in a thick mass of
slate rock, the strike      of this cleavage     is nearly coincident with the
strike    of the  beds.    Professor Phillips, in 1843, added to this rule
a still more comprehensive and exact expression             — that     the cleavage
planes of the slate rocks of North Wales were always parallel to the
main direction of the great anticlinal axes.             Since 1837, these phe
nomena of the close parallelism            of the cleavage planes with           each
other, and with the main axes of elevation, have been observed                    and
recorded by Professor W. B. Rogers and the author of this commu
nication    ; and in 1849 the author submitted to the American Asso
ciation for the Advancement           of Science a communication             on    the
analogy of the ribbon structure of glaciers to the slaty cleavage of
rocks, in which he stated what he deems                 the true law of cleav-
ago   of   a district   of undulated and plicated strata, — namely, that
the cleavage      dip is parallel to the average dip of the anticlinal
and synclinal axis planes, or those planes which bisect the flexures.
The generality of this rule         was   shown by sections exhibiting             the
flexures and cleavage in the Appalachians,            in the Alps, and in         the
Rhenish Provinces.          Subsequent      observations     in   other    localities
have confirmed the universality         of this law; and the recent         descrip
tion of the Devonian strata in the south-west of Ireland by Profes
sors Harkness       and  Blyth still farther   tend to illustrate and establish
it.    In their paper in      the  Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal
(October 1855), they not          only recognise    an agreement between the

                                                    385
strike of the cleavage planes and that of the several rolls (or anti-
clinals) which   affect the island of Valentia, but they show, that
while the cleavage dip is southerly, the anticlinal " curves have been
pushed over in a more or less northerly direction,"                          inverting         the
carboniferous limestones and coal measures.                          Their general        state
ment      is,
         that the cleavage structure of rocks does not result from
the simple rolling of the strata, but from this cause, combined with
a considerable amount              of pressure, and this latter force acting from
the south, has pushed              over the strata in a sorios of oblique curves
to the north, and given to the inclined cleavage more or less of its
southern dip.   They further support the deductions of Mr Sharp,
" that         there has been           a   compression      in the mass in       a   direction
everywhere perpendicular to the planes of cleavage, and an expan
sion of the mass along these planes in the direction of line at right        a
angles to the line of incidence of the planes of bedding and clea
vage."         But from this view of              the mechanical nature and the direction
of the         force engendering cleavage              the author of this communication
begs leave to dissent.
     A   second general           law       is,   that where the cleavage    is   fully   deve
loped, and the anticlinal and synclinal                     flexures are also conspicuous
and      very sharp, the cleavage planes immediately adjoining                             these
bendings         are not parallel            to the axis    planes, but radiate partially
from them, in           a  fan-like arrangement, upward              in
                                                             the anticlinals, and
downward          in    the synclinals.  This aberration from the normal direc
tion     is,   furthermore,       not symmetrical upon the opposite sides of the
geometric axis planes, but                   is    usually greatest upon the inverted or
steep sides           of the   waves.
     A   third prevailing relation of the cleavage planes                     — their
                                                                             is                ten
dency to deviate from the normal direction of parallelism                         to the axis
planes, in order            to conform
                                    partially                  or dip of the
                                                          to the direction
strata   ;     and as in every belt of uniform flexures closely plicated with
inversions, the uninverted,                   or normal     dips, greatly exceed the in
verted         ones    in   breadth, there prevails           a   lower inclination       in   the
planes of cleavage than belongs to the planes bisecting the flexures.
     There       is   yet another law modifying cleavage,              dependent upon the
mechanical            texture, and possibly the chemical               composition,     of the
strata.        In formations       composed          of alternations of the coarser mecha
nical rocks, such as siliceous grits and conglomerates, with the                          finer

                                               386
grained argillaceous beds, such as slates, shales, or marls, the coarser
beds are unaffected by cleavage,                    while   the finer-grained        ones are
often pervaded by it.          Indeed, there appears a strict proportion                    be
tween the degree of intimate Assuring of the rocks by cleavage and
the degree of comminution of the particles.    Connected probably
with this interruption        in the propagation of the cleavage, the author
has     observed   another modification             of the cleavage planes, — namely,
that they tend to curve a little from the normal direction, in the fine
grained argillaceous beds, approximating                    to parallelism   with the       sur
facesof bedding of the adjoining coarser mechanical deposits, as they
approach them, showing in a transverse section, a kind of gentle sig
moid flexure.  This fact is well illustrated in the cleavage-traversed
rocks at the base of the anthracite coal-formation                       of Pennsylvania,
where the red shales alternate with the lower beds                        of the coal-sus
taining     conglomerates      and coarse            sandstones.      These        remarkable
facts    seem   sufficient    of themselves           to refute the hypothesis,           some
what in favour at present, of the purely mechanical origin of                               the
cleavage-producing force ; for we cannot conceive how a mechanical
force either of compression, or of tension, transmitted, as necessarily
it must    have been, very equally, through parallel layers                   of   coarse and
fine material, should have exerted no Assuring action the moment it
roached the surface of the coarser beds, and yet have been able                               to
cleave    into thin parallel slaty             laminae the whole body         of    the finer-
grained argillaceous strata.              One would more naturally            suppose that
the less finely-aggregated              softer mud rocks or shales would have
been     even   less   easily fissured into sharp cleavage                joints than       the
more massive and better cemented grits.
                                         Foliation.
   The relations of the foliation or crystalline                   lamination        of   meta-
morphic strata to the cleavage planes and the planes of stratification,
are next dwelt on.     Two facts may be stated of foliation, which
possess    perhaps the constancy of general laws.                        One of them          is,
that this structure, as       it   is   seen   in   gneiss and mica schist, observes,
when      the strata    are   not traversed            by cleavage, an        approximate
parallelism with the original bedding.The author of this paper has
beheld apparent exceptions to this rule in several localities near
Philadelphia and elsewhere in the United States and others have      ;
been noticed in Europe by Mr D. Sharpe and other good observers,

                                             387
but    all of them     can be reconciled to the general fact, and reduced,                           it
is conceived,        to the one      comprehensive            law, — that the planes of
foliation, or the laminae formed by the crystalline                     constituents of the
foliated rocks are parallel to the planes or waves of heat which have
been transmitted         through the strata.          Whenever           large tracts of the
gneissic rocks retain a nearly horizontal                     undisturbed      position, the
foliation is almost invariably             coincident with the stratification                 ;    and
in this case the wave              of heat producing           the crystalline        structure
can    only have flowed upwards through                       the crust,     invading             stra
tum after stratum          in parallel       horizontal       planes.      Again, when in
jections    of granite have lifted the gneissic strata, the crystalline
lamination        is generally seen to be parallel to the plane of outflowing
temperature.
      The other general rule         is,   that the foliation      is   parallel, or approxi
mately so, to the cleavage, wherever these two structures occur in the
same mass of rocks.           This fact, recorded             by   Darwin, of     the gneissic
rocks and clay slates of South America, has been noticed likewise by
Mr D.      Sharpe,     Mr David       Forbes,      Mr     Sorby,        and other geologists
in Great Britain, and by the author                 in many localities in Southern
Pennsylvania.           An interesting         instance of such parallelism                   of the
foliation       to the cleavage,    in the last-named region, tending to show
convincingly        that both phenomena are the consequences                   of   one species
of force, or but different          degrees    of development of the           same molecu
lar or crystallizing agency,         is    presented in the great synclinal trough of
the lower Appalachian limestone, north of Philadelphia. On the north
side of this trough, the primal and auroral rocks, Cambrian or Lower
Silurian, dip S., over wide outcrop, at very regular angle of about
                             a                            a
45°. On the south side, they have been lifted into, and even   little                         a
beyond, the perpendicular position, so that the synclinal axis plane of
the belt dips at an angle of 65° or 70° to the south. Neither for
mation shows cleavage structure on the northern side of the valley,
the limestone being there of an earthy texture, and in thick massive
beds   ;   but on the south, or upturned              side,     this limestone           is   altered
into a mottled blue and white crystalline marble, and    pervaded                   is
with cleavage planes, dipping at angles of 70° and 80° southward.
Many parts of          the rock are like
                                  foliated calcareous gneiss, thin
                                               a                                                     la
minae of mica and talc dividing the slate-like plates of the marble.
What       is   especially worthy of notice         is,   that the foliation of the mica
and talc, composing some of the thin partings                           between     the original

                                          388
beds   of the limestone,     is   itself very generally parallel    to the cleav
age in the adjoining      calcareous rock.        Indeed, wherever the cleav
age   is excessive,   the mass       throughout   becomes,    by introduction of
fully developed talc and mica            between    its laminae,  a true foliated
stratum.     An   especial     interest attaches itself to cases of this kind,
from their showing, in the two contrasted conditions of the              absence
and presence of metamorphism in the two opposite outcrops of                   the
self-same synclinal     stratum, that both effects, cleavage and foliation,
have originated at the same time, and from one and the same cause,
and are in truth but different stages of the same crystalline condition,
superinduced on the mass            by high temperature, at the period of       its
elevation.
    The  above enunciated general facts         of the prevailing parallelism    of
the foliation to the cleavage, is but a corollary of the still more           ge
neral relationship     already expressed of the parallelism of the         resul
tant planes of crystallization to the waves of heat, which                   have
produced the metamorphism.
                             Theoretical Views.
      Theory  of  the  Flexion and Elevation of Undulated Strata.
    The wave-like structure of the Appalachian              and other undulated
zones   has been attributed          by the author and his brother        W. B.
Rogers,    in their communications           to the   American Association      in
1842, and to the British Association            in the same year, to an actual
undulation   of the supposed flexible           crust of the earth exerted in
parallel lines, and propagated in the manner of a horizontal pulsation,
from the liquid interior of the globe.         They   have supposed the strata of
such a region    "  to have been       subjected to excessive    upward tension,
arising from the expansion of molten matter             and gaseous vapour, and
this tension relieved by parallel          fissures formed in successive lines
through which such elastic vapour escaped, the sudden removal of the
pressure adjacent to the lines of fracture, producing violent pulsations
on the surface of the      liquid below.      This oscillating   movement would
communicate a series of temporary flexures to the overlying crust,            and
these flexures would be rendered          permanent (or keyed into the forms
they present) by the intrusion of molten matter. If, during this oscil
lation, wo conceive the whole heaving tract to have been shoved (or

                                           389
  floated) bodily forward in the direction of the advancing waves, the
  union of this tangential with the vertical movements may explain the
  peculiar steepening of the front side of each flexure, while a succession
 of similar operations will accomplish the folding under or inversion
 seen in the more compressed districts."              They think that no purely
 vertical force, exerted either simultaneously or successively        along paral
  lel lines, could produce     a series  of symmetrical flexures, while      a tan
 gential pressure, unaccompanied by a vertical force, would result only
 in an imperceptible bulging of the whole region or in irregular plica
 tions, dependent on local inequalities             in the amount of the resis
 tance.      The alternate upward and downward movement               necessary  to
 enable     a tangential force to bend the strata into a series         of regular
 parallel subsiding flexures was, they conceive, of the nature of a pul
 sation such as would arise from a succession of actxtal waves roll
 ing in      a given   direction    beneath     the   earth's  crust.   Successive
 feeble tangential movements could not agree either in direction                 or
 amplitude,     nor is it easy to imagine how they could shift their posi
 tions through a series of parallel axis lines, nor how, when renewed,
 they could return always to the same lines to build up the conspicuous
 flexures.     These    oscillations    of the crust, to which the undulated
 strata are attributed, have been, they conceive, of the nature of the
 earthquakes of the present day ; — earthquakes being, as they have
 demonstrated,       a true   pulsation    of the flexible crust of the globe,
 propagated in parallel low waves          of great length and amplitude, with
prodigious velocity, from lines of fracture, either conspicuous volcanic
axes, or half-concealed deep-seated           fissures in the outer envelope     of
the planet.
            Theory of the Origin of Cleavage Structure.
     Concerning     the cause    of slaty cleavage,     the author of the paper
has adopted the explanation           originally   proposed   by Professor   Sedg
wick, that it     is due  " to crystalline or polar forces acting simultane
ously and somewhat uniformly, in given directions, on large masses
having     a homogeneous composition."            And following up the further
suggestion     in extension of this idea, ingeniously proposed by Sir
John Herschel, that this molecular force was of the nature of an
incipient crystallization, and has been developed in the particles by
their being heated to a point at which they could begin to move among
       vol. m.                                                          2  k

                                     390
 themselves, or upon their    own axes, he has endeavoured         to    show
 that, whether the cleavage-cut     strata have been much disturbed          or
 not, the cleavage planes invariably approximate      to parallelism with
 those great planes in the crust, which give indications of having been
 the planes of maximum temperature.         It has been already   stated, in
 the present paper, that the cleavage dip is parallel to the        average
 dip of the anticlinal and synclinal axis planes bisecting the flexures.
 Now it is easy to prove that these axis planes, and the inverted parts
of the flexures, are just those portions where the greatest crushing,
 Assuring, and displacement of the strata must have occurred, and
 where the highly heated pent-up volcanic steam, gases, and            liquid
 mineral matter would find their chief channels obliquely upward            to
wards the surface.      Not to attempt the application of this      view     in
detail, it will suffice at present to state, that every plicated     belt     of
strata may be regarded as having,         at the time of its folding       and
metamorphism, contained from this cause a series of alternate         hotter
and colder planes or belts, arranged in parallel oblique dip.          These
planes of temperature      are supposed to have acted to polarize           the
particles of tho strata in corresponding parallel planes, by transmit
ting through    the half-softened   mass parallel waves of heat,      stimu
lating the molecular crystalline    forces ever resident in mineral      mat
ter in planes parallel to the generating surfaces.

4.   Analysis of Craigleith Sandstone.           By Thomas Bloxam,
    Esq., Assistant-Chemist, Industrial Museum, with a Pre
    liminary Note by Professor George Wilson.
    One object of the Laboratory of the Industrial Museum is the          pro
secution of investigations likely to throw light on the economic        value
of materials employed in the useful arts.        It  has been  impossible
this winter to do more than make a small beginning by instituting
an examination    into the properties of certain of our building    stones ;
and as the results obtained in the case of the sandstone of Craigleith
Quarry have an interest for geologists      as well as for architects and
builders, they are laid before the Society, as all similar results of     any

                                         391
scientific value will be in future.            The entire investigation will    be
published in the course of the summer.
     It  is necessary to remark        here that the following       experiments
were made solely upon the coarser variety of the stone, known as
Common or Bed Rock           ;  the finer portions, not yet submitted to che
mical investigation, being called Liver Rock, most probably from the
closeness    of its grain.
     The objects which     I   had chiefly in view in the course of the follow
ing inquiry were, the exact chemical composition of the stone                ; the
extent to which it contains other insoluble substances than silica          ;  the
amount of substances       soluble in pure water,       in water saturated with
carbonic acid, and in water containing            the mineral acids.      The ex
 tent to which the stone absorbs and retains water, was also object of
 investigation,    and the coaly matter which          occurs at intervals in it
 was analysed.
      The whole of the analyses were made by Mr Thomas Bloxam, the
 assistant-chemist in the Laboratory of the Industrial Museum, who
 spent much pains on the inquiry.              From what follows it will   be seen
 that the Craigleith sandstone, as taken in cubes for building, is nearly
 all silica, but that it contains in addition small portions of alumina,
  lime, magnesia, iron, and, occasionally, a hitherto unsuspected ingre
  dient, oxide of cobalt, which Mr Bloxam has distinctly indicated.
  In   addition to those substances, black particles          occur disseminated
  even through the whitest and most solid portions of the stone, which
  in the majority of cases appear to be coaly matter, but are some
  times in greater part carbonate of the protoxide of iron, coloured by
  an admixture of coal.
      The condition     in which     those bodies occur in the stone is as im
  portant as their relative amount ; but it is not so easily ascertained.
   Much of the silica is present in more or less perfect grains of quartz ;
   a small portion occurs      as the chief ingredient    of  scales  of mica, and
   also probably as felspar      ; and according to    Mr  J.  Napier of Partick,
   Glasgow,    a   certain amount of the silica is in combination with alu
    mina as clay.     Mr Napier     experimented by reducing the stone to fine
   powder, and washing it on a flannel filter, which retained the silica,
    and allowed the clay to pass through.           Proceeding    in this manner,
    and receiving     on a weighed       filter paper the muddy water which
    passed through the flannel,       Mr    Bloxam  found that 9-33 per cent, of
    substance remained on the paper after drying at 212°.            This may pro

                                                392
visionally be called clay, of which               it consists in small part ; but till                  it
is analysed,   it would     be premature to discuss its nature.                          Mr      Napier's
observation, however, that               sandstones contain clay,                    is an important
one, especially                their power to retain moisture,
                    in reference          to                                                          and
continue long damp in the walls of buildings.
   The iron which occurs so generally in sandstones, and is so                                        im
portant an ingredient,              from its tendency to stain the stone after it is
quarried    and exposed to the air,                    is certainly         present in different
chemical conditions.           It has been       generally assumed,                 1   think,   to occur
in carboniferous         sandstones       as     bisulphuret       ;    but it appears              to be
chiefly present in the Craigleith rock as carbonate of the protoxide,
the form   in which it         has always been recognised as                        prevailing in     the
shales accompanying             such sandstones.                 As already mentioned,                the
protocarbonate       of iron     in detached portions, coating
                                     occurs                                                       and di
viding certain strata of the stone from each other ; but it is                                     not on
this circumstance that           I found       the conclusion stated above, but on the
following results:       — 1000        grains of the stone, finely powdered,                         were
suspended in cold distilled             water, and a stream of washed carbonic
acid gas sent through               the liquid        for   an   hour.        The water            passed
through a filter quite transparent                ;   but upon boiling became troubled,
and deposited carbonates of lime and magnesia, peroxide of iron,
and a little silica.        Of      these substances         the peroxide of iron was                 the
most abundant, and it had plainly been dissolved as protocarbonate.
The probability, accordingly, is that the metal existed as carbonate
in the sandstone ; but it may have been present as metal or as black
oxide, though scarcely as bisulphuret,                      and certainly not as peroxide.
The point of most practical                    interest, however,             is,   that rain-water,
containing,    as   it   always does, carbonic acid,                   is   able to dissolve iron
as well as lime and magnesia from                      exposed sandstones               ;    so that we
may always expect to find them colour more or less from the solution
and subsequent peroxidation                   of the iron which they contain.
   It   was not found possible to remove the whole of the iron from the
powdered sandstone             by   the action of carbonic acid water, for after                       it
had exerted its full effect, hydrochloric acid,                    if   boiled on the powder,
extracted iron as peroxide,              unaccompanied by protoxide.
   The action of other solvents                on the stone        is   as follows       :  —Distilled
water boiled upon     in fine powder acquired
                          it                       notable quantity     a                              of
lime, a small quantity of sulphuric acid, and     trace of iron. Mi     a
nute quantities of the alkalies, of magnesia, and of silica were doubt

                                         393
less also present, but were not sought for.              Hydrochloric acid boiled
upon the powdered stone yielded a solution                in which protoxide and
peroxide of iron, alumina,         lime, and magnesia, were found in marked
quantity      ; and traces of manganese and cobalt, along with potassa,
soda, and silica,     in small quantities.
     From those results it will be seen that the purest water can dissolve
 a   certain amount of substance from Craigleith sandstone ; that if
 charged with carbonic acid it will disintegrate it further                ; and that
 if containing free mineral acids,         as the  rain-water of towns       occasion
 ally does, it will decompose        it still further.
     In  connection with those results, it is important           to notice the ex
 tent to which the stone absorbs and retains water, points on which
 Mr Napier has already         made valuable observations.           The specimens
 selected    for the following    trials had an average sp.       gr. of 2-443.
     A   piece weighing     3506-l grains, which had            been received from
 the quarry in the month of November               1855, and remained for about
 a month in a room without a fire, was kept at 212°,                 till it ceased to
 lose weight ; the loss was equivalent              to 5-7  fluid  ounces per cubic
 foot.
     A   similar piece, weighing 4597-95 grains, was immersed in dis
 tilled water at 58°, till it ceased to gain weight.                    The surface-
 moisture was then allowed to evaporate, and the stone weighed.                    The
 gain was equivalent to 3-8 imperial pints per cubic foot.
      According to    Mr Napier,     a sandstone    acquires much more moisture
 if allowed to absorb it by capillary attraction from                 one part of its
 surface, than     if entirely  immersed in water, but upon making the ex
 periment in the way he describes, the difference, by capillary attrac
 tion, was comparatively         small   ;  the whole gain being 4-2 imperial
 pints on the cubic foot.        On the other hand, when the           stone was im
 mersed in water under the bell             jar of the air-pump plate, and the
 air withdrawn,      the ultimate gain in weight amounted to 6-2 imperial
 pints per cubic foot.        The error of      those who hope to render build
 ings dry by constructing        their walls of solid sandstone, will         be suffi
 ciently apparent from these facts.             The numerical results obtained
 by Mr Bloxam are added in full.

                    Opening Address.             By Bishop Terrot.
   The Council of the Royal Society                   have,   in the course of the        last
year, taken into serious consideration the state and prospects of                            the
Society, and have deliberated upon many propositions                             having for
their object       to render our ordinary meetings more interesting, and
generally to        increase the efficiency and usefulness of the Society.
Among other          schemes       of this nature, they have adopted one, in             con
formity with which           I    have now the honour of addressing you.                They
have resolved that henceforth                the winter session         shall    commence
with an Address from the President,                   or one of the Vice-Presidents,
leaving     it,   of course,     to the judgment        of the individual       selected to
choose such         topics as he may think most likely to excite, among                      the
Fellows,     a     deeper    interest     in the welfare of the Society,            a    more
earnest determination to render their scientific attainments, whatever
they may be, serviceable, not merely to the world                       at large, and          to
the advancement of their own scientific                  reputation,    but also to the
efficiency        and reputation         of our common object of interest — the
Royal Society of Edinburgh.
   Possessing, as we do, a President                   equally   distinguished      for his
science     and for his love of science, for that which he has done him
self, and for that which, by his open-handed liberality, he has invited
and enabled others to do,            it   would have been        most natural       and de
sirable that he should have been                requested to address            you on this
occasion.         You are aware, however, that the state of his health                         is
such as to render            it   very    unadvisable     that he should attend our
evening meetings, and the Council were consequently under the                                ne
cessity of laying this duty upon one of the Vice-Presidents.                            There
also, you must be aware, the Council                      had but   a    small range           of
choice.       Your senior Vice-President, to whom every                          one would
have listened with interest and attention, and from whom even                                the
most advanced         in   science might     have learned something              new,    is, I
regret to hear, obliged to retire             to the Continent         on account       of   the

                                        399
  health of a member of his family.           Others on the list are prevented
  by various causes from attending          our meetings      ;  and the result has
  been   that the Council      felt itself under the necessity of imposing
  upon me the duty, which I now attempt to perform.
     I think you will agree with       me, that     a Society       like ours, insti
  tuted for a definite            —
                        purpose the      advancement of Science and Litera
 ture — has, in relation to that purpose, a duty to perform ; and that
 each member, according to the extent of his ability,                     is bound in
 duty    to contribute    to  the energy      and action whereby              alone the
 Society, as a whole, can satisfactorily perform its obligations.                 Now,
 in relation to the purpose of the Society, the clear understanding of
 which must go far to determine the character of its duties, it can
 not,  I  think, fail to strike you that for many years our attention has
 been exclusively directed to what is commonly called Science, — to the
 abstract, the physical, and the experimental              sciences    ;  while   every
 thing coming under the designation of Literature is altogether                     ab
 sent from our proceedings.         Literature, indeed, in its ordinary              ac
ceptation,    is unsuited to our purpose.         It  is not desirable that, like
 the old French Academy,         we should invite poets to recite fragments
of some forthcoming epic, or historians to put us in advance of the
external world, by communicating the purpurei panni, the heroic
portraits, or battle-pieces, of a projected narrative.                 But    I  cannot
see why the word Science should be restricted                to the knowledge         of
material    objects  ; why it should not be extended to all knowledge
difficult to acquire, and relating to matters which are interesting to
any considerable number of thinking, cultivated                  minds.       It  would
surely    be unjust to refuse the name         of science       to that     philosophy
which, in the hands of Smith, Reid, Stewart,               and     Brown, has done
more to raise the character of Scotland as an intellectual nation, than
all that   she has done, and that is not       little, in all     the    mathematical
and physical      sciences.      And   besides    this   science     of mind, there
exists a science of the great exponent of mind, of spoken or written
language.        This, in combination        with    anatomy,       constitutes     the
science which the British Association          have admitted into           their cycle
under the name of Ethnology.            Even those among us who are most
absorbed in abstract or physical         science    may feel       some     interest in
learning to what extent, and how and why it is that a basis of same
ness exists between the languages of a long line              of nations extending
from the Ganges to the Atlantic           ; how varieties of this one species
                                                                       2  l  2

                                               400
have branched off in different directions                    ;       how in some countries in
vading hordes have speedily obliterated the language of the conquered,
while in others they have abandoned their own, and have adopted
that of the conquered majority.
  Now,      I   beg you to understand                that    I       have no wish that either
mental philosophy            or philology          should,       in this Society,            supersede
those   abstract and physical              sciences      with            which    we are generally
occupied.        All    I   would ask for is, that those                      who are engaged in
the former should not               be   led to consider the Royal Society as an
Institution in which they are not wanted, and in                                 whose labours they
can take no share.             It   may be replied, that there exists among                                  us
no exclusion      of    such students, and that our door is as open to them
as to the Chemist or the Mathematician.                              There       is no exclusion,         but
there is an obstruction.                 Such students, the speculators upon mind
and language, when hesitating                whether they shall propose themselves
as candidates for admission                into the Royal Society, will naturally
look into some recent volume of our Transactions.                                    There they will
find little that can interest them — little that they can understand, or
even    read.         For the notations employed by the analyst and the
chemist are to them an unknown tongue                            ;   and though they be fami
liar with common arithmetic, they would not find                                   a volume         of the
Makerstoun            Observations       very inviting.                  In   short, the impression
would be that our trade was not their trade, or that for their ware
there was no demand in our market.
   And yet this last conclusion would                       be a false           one.      There exists
in the Society a very general wish for some infusion of literature                                       into
our proceedings, and it exists among those who are themselves most
exclusively devoted to scientific pursuits.                              But it    does not lie          with
the Anatomist,          the Botanist, or the Astronomer, to supply the defi
ciency.         All   that they can do is to express not merely their willing
ness, but       their wish, that         men       of letters would               come     forward           and
contribute something of a more general interest, and a more graceful
character, to the severe simplicity of our usual evening engagements.
 About this time last year the Council                      issued a report to the Fellows,
 in which the subject to which                 I    am   now referring               was    urged very
                                  "            It    has long been a matter of regret
 strongly.        They then said,
 that literary papers are so seldom offered                          ;    insomuch that       it.   is   often
 forgotten that the Royal Society                     was        originally instituted              for the
 interchange of literary as well as of scientific                              communications            ;   in

                                                      401
 deed, that the Society long divided                        itself into two        classes,       having re
 ference        to   those subjects.                  Essays    on     criticism,        philology,        and
 ffisthetics,    are to be found in the earlier volumes                           of   the Transactions,
 but for many years such papers have rarely                                   been communicated.
 The Council          believe        that such contributions             would be very acceptable
 to the Society, even should the authors not in every case deem                                          their
 observations sufficiently original and important                                 to demand publica
 tion in extenso in the Transactions."                             Such was the urgent call made
by the Council upon the literary members of the Society                                            ;   but as
yet the call has been made in vain.
    I   venture,          in the next place, to offer a few words of counsel to
those who are so far engaged in science                              as to be conscious that, by
the withdrawal             of
                     little time from their professional engagements,
                                a
they might contribute either to the interest of our evening meetings,
or to the contents of our annual publications.     distinguish between        I
these two purposes, because                      I    consider them widely separate.                      The
ideal of a paper for the Transactions                           is,   that   it   contains some           new
important truth            ;    and since, by its publication,               it    is   presented to the
whole scientific world,                it   is   clear that the author should have such
knowledge not only of his branch of science, but also of its history,
as may secure him from wasting his time upon the discovery                                             of that
which     is    already familiar to the masters of the craft.                               Such,      I   re
peat,   is   the ideal of a paper                     for the Transactions.              In many         cases
snch a paper can give no gratification                          to the audience, and, indeed,
in the very best cases such papers are not read throughout.                                            A brief
abstract of the purpose, method, and conclusion                               is    all that      is   given   ;
because      the author         is   aware that, to         a   large portion of his hearers,
the details would be uninteresting,                         because unintelligible            ;    and that
even those who are on                 a   level with himself, require                   time fully and
clearly to apprehend the accuracy of his arguments and of his cal
culations.
   But     no such requirements and                     limitations apply to communications
made     at our       ordinary         meetings, without               any view to their being
afterwards published in the Transactions.                              Those among us who are
employed upon sciences                  of observation, and those who are watching
the progress         of   science both at home                 or abroad, might add much to
the interest of our meetings                     by   communicating          information          which     is
not positively,                       which might be found else
                          but only relatively new              ;
where, but which would probably not be found by many who would

                                                 402
gladly    receive       it,   when presented        to   them by an             intelligent in
formant.          Nay,I       do not see why the proposing                 of well-considered
questions might not be considered relevant                       to the purpose of our
evening meetings.               Those      who, from      heavy professional                occupa
tions, cannot advance              beyond the outskirts of any science, would                     be
very troublesome members of society were they perpetually                               invading
the studies of the learned, and applying for the solution of their
doubts and difficulties.  Yet such sciolists, among whom     must                       I
honestly class myself, have, in virtue of their fellowship, some claim
upon the assistance of their more learned brethren      and that assist    ;
ance might be easily afforded,              if   the proposing of         a    reasonable ques
tion, not pointedly addressed to any individual,                      were to be considered
as an allowable and             ordinary    proceeding in our evening meetings.
These suggestions may appear trifling or impracticable.                                 My pur
pose   will   be served       ifonly the attention of the more earnest working
members of the Society be turned to the fact that the proceedings at
our    meetings possess             little attraction    for     a great portion             of the
Fellows   ;   and   if    they are led to devise          some        better plan for popu
larizing, without degrading, the public business of the Society.
I     suppose, that any of us were asked, What
                          if                       the purpose of the is
Royal Society he would answer generally, the promotion of science.
                    ?
But this formula, the promotion of science, may be taken in various
senses.       In   one sense, and that the highest,              a    philosopher       promotes
science when he observes and publishes facts unknown before, or when
he reduces known facts under the conditions                      of   a   new law.      In either
case he promotes science               by increasing      the number of things which
may be known             by   study alone without         invention.           But the school
master, in another sense, promotes science when he excites to the
pursuit of science minds which, without such excitement, would have
remained trifling or inert           ;   when he smooths difficulties which would
have discouraged, or altogether stopped, the progress                        of the young
student   ;   and in some,           though certainly       in   a     much lower degree,
when he merely            communicates to his pupils his own knowledge of
the facts and laws             of nature.        The philosopher, in the               successful
exercise of his vocation, makes things knowable                       ;     the schoolmaster,
in his vocation, makes them to be actually known.                               So far as   I    can
see, these are the only two methods in                   which    science can be directly
promoted      ;    and the question        is,   in which of these ways           is   it   that our
Society ought to labour               for the promotion           of science.          Individual

                                                     403
 members then, contribute to the advancement of science, when they
 communicate to the Society either the unrecorded facts which                             they
 have observed, or the results                   of their scientific experiments, or the
 general laws which they have                     established by processes of inductive
 reasoning, or improvements which they have effected in the instruments
 of observation, or in the calculus by which their reasonings are effected.
 The Society again,        as a body, co-operates to this direct advancement
 of science, when,        after winnowing                the important from the unimpor
 tant, it gives to the world in its Transactions,                      such communications
 as, in its judgment, are fitted either to extend the field or to facili
 tate the acquirement of useful knowledge.     But perhaps the indirect
 action of this and similar societies is more important than these
 its formal and visible products                 ;   nay,   I   know not whether    the   best
answer to the question, What is the use of the Royal Society                         ?   would
not   be, that it is useful by bringing together, into familiar inter
course, men of science and men of letters — men of similar and of
different views.         Solitary study is requisite even for the most mode
rate attainment of knowledge                 ;    but a solitude unbroken by intercourse
with other minds,         is apt to generate,               in scientific men, an overesti
mate of their own powers and performances, and a doting fondness
for notions which are commonly described by the term crotchets.
Now every man of vigorous                      inquiring intelligence, and so far
                                             and
constitutionally        qualified to     become a man of science, who, by being
brought into competition with his equals, and under the influence of
his superiors, is induced              to    moderate his self estimation,           and to
abandon his crotchets,          ia    thereby rendered a better, wiser, and more
useful man than he was before.                       I   need not again refer to the more
obvious use of familiar intercourse                        among the professors and the
lovers of science, of the labour                  and time that may be saved by the
friendly communication of difficulties, or of the overcoming of diffi
culties, and by everything which tends in science to that generous,
unselfish       co-operation,        which        is the source      of strength and pro
gress in all artistic, commercial, and social life.                      Every great sub
ject has    some dark side;          and, next to          the unholy contests of intolerant
religionists,     I   know nothing          more melancholy than the disputes of
men of science respecting priority of invention and discovery ; to see
them too evidently acknowledging, that not the discovery of truth,
but the credit of having discovered                             the stimulus and the reward
                                                         it,
                                                         is
to which they are looking.

                                                  404
   The affording facilities for such intellectual                              intercourse between
those       who are       engaged        either upon the same                   or upon different
branches of science, and the promotion   of this generous, brotherly
co-operation,       is,
                  believe, in the present state of society, the most
                     I
important purpose, and the most beneficial result of scientific insti
tutions such as that which              I      have the honour of addressing.
   The Council            have, in the last year,                    acted    as   if   they felt the
force of some of these considerations.                           They have made the next
apartment   complete in everything that can conduce to the comfort
of the Fellows who visit                it,
                            either for reading, writing, or consulta
tion   ;   and, situated as we are, at the very centre of our principal
thoroughfare, they may,            I          think,   be disappointed that so few                  of our
members appear as yet to avail                         themselves of the accommodation
afforded them.            But they have taken               a    much more important step
than this; they have devoted                     three hundred pounds, not from the
capital, but from the savings of the Society, to the increase of the
Library.        Every department of               fairly represented in
                                                  science has been
the sub-committee appointed to expend this sum         and    the Natu         ;         if
ralists have carried off the lion's share in the distribution, this has
arisen from no unfair preference, but from the great expensiveness
of their       necessary      apparatus.           A      tolerably          extensive        library of
mathematics or philology may be purchased at the price of a single
publication      on shells or ferns.               In   the geographical department our
collection     is   eminently       rich.        We     possess,       and have mounted              in a
new and very serviceable manner, maps to the amount                                     of 625 sheets.
Of these 439 relate to Europe, and 78 to Asia                                      ;    and many are
from        elaborate     surveys,        and     on    a   large         scale.         The      Council
has     also    been      busily       employed         during        a   great        portion     of the
year in preparing           a   Catalogue of the Library.                   The completion of
this       has unavoidably         been         impeded         by    the gradual accession of
additional books        ;   but    it   is    hoped that    in the           course    of the present
session,     or of the succeeding              summer,      a   complete and well-arranged
Catalogue will be accessible                      of the Society and that
                                              to the Members                                  ;
from    it   the students of every branch of science will learn that valu
able contributions           to their         favourite     branch, whatever              it      may be,
have been        recently made, with an especial                          view to       the   supply    of
works of reference, which were not to be found in the great public
libraries of this city.             It   may not be uninteresting                      to the literary
members        to know that        a   considerable number of Dictionaries, Gram

                                        405
mars, and works on general Philology, are among the                     recent addi
tions to the library.
    Another important subject        to which the attention of the Council
has been directed, is the finance of the Society.                  Several circum
stances have shown it to be desirable that the amount both of ad
mission and annual payments           should be diminished         ;  and the state
ments drawn out by our very intelligent and zealous Treasurer, show
that    such   diminution    may be made          without      incapacitating     the
Society from carrying out any of its legitimate               purposes.       As the
rate of fees is fixed by a law of the Society, the sanction of a general
meeting will be necessary to the alteration            ;    and a motion to that
purpose will,     I believe, be made this evening.
    In  recounting the duties of the Society,       I ought to remind        you that
we are trustees of three funds devoted to the promotion of science                   ;
and are the judges appointed         to select   among competing candidates
those most deserving of the prizes afforded from the interest of these
funds.      The first of these prizes is the Keith Gold Medal and
Prize, given biennially       to the author    of that paper         read before the
Society which the Council considers        as the most valuable contribution
to science, made through the Society, during the two preceding ses
sions.     The   second is the   Brisbane Prize, the special application of
which    was left by the learned and liberal       donov entirely        to the judg
ment of the Council.          They have decided that this prize shall              be
awarded, at biennial       periods alternating     with the Keith Prize, and
that for the first biennium it shall be awarded to the author of the
best Biographical Memoir of some deceased Scotchman, distinguished
by his scientific attainments.         Thirdly,   we have the        Neill Bequest,
which, in conformity with the well-known               pursuits of the founder,
will   be devoted   to  the encouragement of natural history in its various
branches.      We   are thus empowered       to invite     and stimulate      and re
 ward exertion — 1st, In the great field of physical             and experimental
science   ;  2d,  In  mathematics and astronomy           ;  3d,  In   the investiga
 tion of the forms, properties, and relations of the various families of
 the organized creation.        The destination of the Brisbane Prize ap
 pears to have this peculiar merit, that it gives scope for the exhibi
 tion of literary    as well as  of scientific merit    ;   and  I   hope that those
 who    may be induced to compete for it will remember that each of
the heroes of science was not an abstract intellect, but a man, with
 human affections and passions acting for good or for evil — with moral

                                                406
and religious tendencies, influencing,                    it may be, his scientific            pursuits,
and colouring his enunciation of his discoveries.                                 Good biography,
the accurate life-like portraiture               of a great mind, is one of the highest
achievements of literary skill.
    Having thus directed your attention                             to some       of the secondary
                          Royal Society, I feel it right to
offices and purposes of the                                                                    revert to
that which the external world will always consider as its                                       primary
duty, and by the adequate                  performance          of which, without reference
to anything else, the Society                 must rise or fall in the estimation of
men of science at home and abroad                    ;    I    mean, of course, the annual
publication of a valuable fasciculus of Transactions.                                  To this         point
the efforts of the leading members of the Society ought to                                      be     espe
cially directed.            Individually they may have scientific                          reputations
to make     :   but they have not to create, but to maintain, the reputation
of the Society.  The papers contributed to our Transactions by
Robison, Ivory, Hutton, Playfair, Hope, and Hall, will bear compa
rison with any on like subjects, and of the same                                   date    ;   while,        to
mention only one of our living members, the optical papers of Sir
David Brewster have carried the name of the Royal Society of Edin
burgh, in conjunction with his own, through                              the whole of the scien
tific world.
    But though          we may be obliged                to confess       that our more recent
publications are inferior to those                   of an earlier          date,       this is not          to
be attributed entirely,          if   at all, to a falling off in industry or talent
among our members.                    In    the first place, there are ebbings                          and
Sowings in all intellectual pursuits ; and                           I   am told by those               who
know more of the matter than        do, that     I                       at present the tide of
science    is not flowing either here or elsewhere.                           Such turns of                 the
tide in an advancing direction are,                  I   think, generally attributable                       to
the rise of some man of genius who gathers                               round him, and stimu
lates and directs the minds                 of those      whose talents are             of kin       to his
own genius.            In   this leading class       we        may place such men                 as   Lin
naeus,    Laplace,          and our own Sir Humphry Davy                      ;    and    I    feel sure
that Cambridge              has lived and       acted         for   a century and a half,                   not
upon the reputation, but under the abiding influence of Newton                                          and
Bentley.        If,   then, science be at present but slowly progressive,                              it    is,
I suppose, because the men                 of talent, of whom there               is   no lack,      are     in
want of a man of genius to lead them on.
  Whatever may be thought of this, there exist causes which ren

                                     407
der the preparation of a good volume of Transactions              more difficult
in the present day than at any former period            ; and these difficulties
are not peculiar to our Society, but are felt,        I  believe, by all similar
institutions.     The first of   these   is the multiplication       of scientific
societies,  each devoted   to some particular     branch — Chemical, Astro
nomical, Geological, and Botanical.          Whether      science is more effec
tively   promoted by such      specific associations,      or   by those    which,
like our own, give     a general     admission to contributions          in every
branch of science,   I do  not take upon me to say.          The practice of all
the civilized nations in maintaining, under some designation or other,
an academy of science, and giving to it a pre-eminence above socie
ties working in a limited      field, shows   I  think   a general feeling that
the necessity for the former is not superseded by the multiplication             of
 the latter.   And there are reasonable grounds for this feeling. The
 dictum of the orator in accounting for his interest in the poet is so
 universally   admitted    as  almost    to  have passed into         a proverb     :
 " Etenim    omnes artes quae ad humanitatem          pertinent, habent quod-
 dam    commune vinculum,       et quasi cognatione quadam          inter  se con-
 tinentur."     To strengthen this vinculum and relationship is not the
 least important office of the Royal Society : and therefore whatever
 attraction our members may find in societies            instituted for the ex
 clusive promotion of their own favourite pursuits, they will,             I trust,
 never abandon their allegiance       to science   in the largest acceptation
 of the term, nor their co-operation with that society which gives                a
 cordial reception to every art,       «<c  ad humanitatem pertinet.
     Still I fear that such specific societies, whether publishing            their
 own transactions, or sending        them to the various specific journals,
 must draw away many valuable           papers, which at an earlier period
  would have found no convenient channel of publication                but in the
 pages   of our Transactions.      This turning of our supplies into other
 channels it is impossible for us to prevent          ;  and   so  that science is
  promoted, we ought not to care          very deeply whether this is done
  through us or through others.         But  a generous       emulation is some
  thing very different from an envious rivalry ; and the activity and
  success of other scientific societies ought to stimulate those of our
  brethren    who have already proved their          competence,     to continued
  and increased    exertions  to  promote the usefulness and the reputa
  tion of the Society.
     And now     I must refer to a subject, which, indeed,         if  we be a So

                                          408
  ciety actuated by a really social spirit,        must be more or less in         the
  minds of the Fellows, when we meet for the first time after the in
  terval of the summer vacation.           The interval    is not long, and yet it
  has been sufficient to produce great changes in the managing                   por
  tion of the Society, by the removal from this world of several of             those
  who     un.ted   high scientific attainments        with a   deep   interest    and
  careful attention to the ordinary business of the Society.             The   mem
  bers removed by death during the last year are Sir George Ballin-
  gall, Professor Gray, Colonel Madden, Mr John Clerk Maxwell,
  General Martin White, and          Mr James Wilson.
      It  might  be thought invidious      for the Society acting in its      corpo
  rate capacity to single       out among these        some   whose memory de
 served commemoration above that of others.               But an individual       can
 speak    of that only which     he  himself knows, and must         be allowed to
 speak in preference of those whom            he  knew, not merely by the re
 putation of their talents, but more closely in the intercourse of pro
 fessional or of social life.
      I  mention   then, in the first place,       Sir George Ballingall,        who
 closed a life   of much useful activity at the advanced          age  of  seventy.
 His scientific labours,      so   far  as  I  am   informed,    were very     much
 limited    to   his  profession   ;   his  more important       works,    such as
 his Lectures on     "Military Surgery," " On          the Construction    of Hos
 pitals,"
            "  On the Diseases of India,"        were all intended to commu
nicate to the younger members of the medical profession the results
of his own long and careful experience as an army surgeon and                   as a
 medical officer in India     ;  and his more numerous occasional papers,
having all the same        professional character       and purpose, appeared,
not in our Transactions,          but in the journals of Medical           Science.
Throughout his long career in the army,              in the University of Edin
burgh, and in private practice, Sir George possessed the confidence
and esteem of all with whom he was connected, and this was                  due not
only to his professional      knowledge and skill, but also to his upright
and gentlemanly deportment in private life.
     I  have next to speak of one whose name and person at least               have
been more under the notice           of the younger Fellows of the Society,
from the circumstance of his having very kindly and very effectively
undertaken the duties of General Secretary, when for a time we
were under great difficulty       from the severe      and protracted illness     of
Professor Forbes.        I should not have ventured upon any attempt              to

                                                 409
delineate, even in outline,               the moral and scientific character of                Mr
James Wilson,             had    I    not felt that whatever          might       be thought
or said of him elsewhere, something                    was due to his memory in                this
place and        at this time.            I   should not have attempted            it,   because
the branches         of   science    which he cultivated have never occupied my
attention, and because the whole of his character, both in its moral
and  intellectual aspects, has already been depicted our brother             by
Professor George Wilson, who knew his honoured namesake more
intimately       than     I   did, and who       is   far better qualified than     I     am to
speak of his scientific             labours.     Indeed,    I   must confess that, what
ever, in the execution of the office assigned me,                   I   feel bound to say
respecting          our   excellent     and     lamented      brother, James Wilson,             is
either borrowed from or confirmed                      by   the beautiful Memoir of him
which         has appeared in the Edinburgh New Philosophical                        Journal,
from the pen of             Dr George         Wilson — not    a   kinsman, I      believe, but
certainly       a   man of kindred spirit with the subject of his Memoir.
      A   weakness of constitution,              which manifested itself in his early
manhood, withdrew              Mr Wilson        from the labours of    a    profession     ;   and
as his leisure permitted, so his inclination prompted him to devote
himself to the study of animated nature.       His retiring modesty
could not prevent his becoming known as an accomplished natural
ist   ;
          "   and after the death of the late Professor Edward Forbes, the
Chair of Natural History in the University of Edinburgh was offered
to, but declined by, Mr Wilson.  He was an acknowledged authority
on Entomology,             and      scarcely less distinguished       as an      Ornithologist
and Ichthyologist."              His published contributions         to science, generally
anonymous,            were extensive and important.                To the    seventh      edition
of The Encyclopedia Britannica alone he furnished   whole volume             a
of articles, amounting to 649 pages, all on subjects of Natural
History.            He contributed largely to the various scientific journals,
and to the transactions               of scientific societies, while at the         same time
his literary talent            and genial        humour were shown by many inter
esting papers which              appeared in the more popular Magaz'nes                         and
 Reviews of his time.
      But Mr Wilson has               a   higher claim on our affectionate remem
brance than could be founded upon his scientific labours alone.                                 He
was       a   good man of a high type of goodness.                  The gentleness of his
temper must have been apparent to all who had any intercourse with

                                     410
him in the business of this Society         ;   but those who knew him        most
intimately concur in testifying that his naturally amiable mind                  was
indebted for much of its charm to the pervading influence of a                deep
religious principle   ; that he sought after God, not in his works only,
but in his word also ; and that he closed his blameless and useful
life by a death robbed of its sting, and left this world with a humble
reliance upon the promise of better things to come.
    We have lost another         and   very kindred      spirit by the    death of
Colonel Edward Madden.           Him    I   knew intimately,      and though       his
favourite track of science was very remote from my pursuits,                 I soon
learned that his mind had many sides and could not fail to interest
any one who had a respect for talent or a love for goodness.               Colonel
Madden joined our Society in           1853, and not having,          as far as      I
 know,    read any papers at our        meetings,      he  was    probably     little
 known to a large portion        of the Fellows.        But his character        and
 attainments were well known to botanists, and they gave a sufficient
 proof of the estimation in which they held him by electing him to                the
 Presidency    of the Botanical      Society.      He   was,   soon  after his    ad
 mission    as a Fellow,   elected   into the Council of this Society,            and
 rendered valuable assistance as a member of tho               Library    Commit
 tee, from his extensive knowledge, not of his own science only,                  but
 also of the apparatus       required    by the student of geography              and
 of philology.
     I have to express my gratitude            to Dr Falconer of London            for
 having supplied me with        notices respecting Colonel         Madden's pur
 suit of Science in India,      much beyond what         I can use on the        pre
 sent occasion,   and which    I shall   return to him,      in the hope that       he
 may employ them in raising a worthy                 memorial    of our departed
 friend.
     From these notices it appears that before Colonel Madden's                     at
  tention had been directed to the vegetable kingdom,               and when        he
  was a lieutenant   of artillery in the Company's service, he employed
  a leave   of absence   in search of health among the lower              ridges of
  the Himalaya.      Health   he found    ;   but he found something more, —
  his own proper vocation as a lover and a student of nature.                 In    no
  other region, probably, could his natural powers and tendencies                have
  been so strongly called into action.           No region presents     the leading
  phenomena of physical geography in greater contrast, both              as regards

                                                 411
the    varieties        of human        races,   difference      of vegetable      and animal
life, meteorological            and other climatic            conditions,    than the north
western plains of India, and the stupendous chain of mountains by
which they are bounded on the north.                    Here, in comparative prox
imity,        are found the vegetable        productions of the Torrid and the Tem
perate Zones, while the traveller,                      as he ascends       through a belt of
Alpine character, reaches at length the region of perpetual snow.
   When Lieutenant Madden first visited these interesting regions,
he appears to have been totally unacquainted with systematic botany.
But he brought with him                  a vivid     recollection of the vegetable forms
which he had noticed at home, and a tendency and capacity for ob
serving every affinity or contrast to these in the objects which sur
rounded him             in    India.      These observations were regularly                 noted
down      ;    and though necessarily very imperfect, they wero of material
service to him when afterwards                     he prepared      and published      his me
moirs         " On the Plants      of the Turaee," and " On the Coniferae of the
Himalaya."
      A   few years after this tour, Colonel Madden revisited the Hima
laya, and was             there fortunate in making the acquaintance of Dr
Falconer,         at   that time Superintendent of the Botanic Garden at Sa-
harunpore, a station very near the foot of the Himalaya.                           It was here
that his mind was formed to the systematic study of his favourite
science.          Here he had          access to a     rich collection of plants,    to a   well-
stored herbarium, to a good botanical library, and to the society of
experienced            and    friendly instructors.     Of these advantages he
made the most            ;   and the fruits of his studies were shown in his first
publication            of any importance,            entitled,    " Brief    Observations      on
Himalayan Coniferae."                    This    was    first published in an obscure local
journal, but reprinted in the "Journal of the Agricultural Society
of Calcutta," and through that channel found its way into general
 notice among the botanists of Europe. A supplement to this paper,
more extensive than               it, in the latter journal
                                        was printed          1850,                    in
after the author had left India. These memoirs are of such striking
merit that they were transferred in extenso by Dr Lindley into the
Journal of the Horticultural Society of London.
      Soon after leaving Saharunpore,                    Colonel Madden was removed to
a station         in the hill province of Kumaoon.                    He     was   there fortu
nately         brought       into co-operation         with   the two brothers,       Captains

                                      412
Henry and Richard Strachey, at that time employed upon an inquiry
into the physical geography of that and the adjoining Hill Pro
vinces.     The results of the labours of the Stracheys are well         known,
through memoirs communicated to the Royal Geographical and                  Geo
logical Societies.      Colonel Madden was an active colleague to Cap
tain Richard Strachey in the botanical branch of this survey ; and in
1848 he published the results of his observations in a very             valuable
memoir on      " The   Turaee and outer mountains of Kumaoon,"             which
appeared in the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal.                  These
are spoken of by     Dr Falconer    as models   of careful observation    on the
geographical distribution of plants, and at the same          time as rich in
illustrations,   drawn    from every department of a well-stored           mind,
and a wide and varied range of literature.
    Hitherto,   I have been speaking     of Colonel Madden from the      notes of
his attached friend     Dr Falconer,    and  in reference to scientific   attain
ments and labours on which, you are all aware, that            I  am incompe
tent to form, and d      fortiori, to express an opinion.     All  of  you who
knew him in social life, or in the Council meetings of the Royal               So
ciety, must remember with affectionate regret the gentleness of his
manner, and the unobtrusive modesty with which he gave his assist
ance only when      it  was  needed,   and where he was sure      of the preci
sion of his knowledge.         In respect to the highest wisdom, it      appears
that from his youth he was actuated by that love of the true                   and
the good which constitutes the character of those who,          if not actually
in,  are at any rate not     far from the kingdom of Heaven.             Careful
and conscientious inquiry led him from doubt to conviction            ; and his
latter years were spent under the influence of an assured faith                and
a steady resolution to do the       will of God.
    Such were some        of  those  who have been      taken from among         us
in the course of the last year, and whose virtues and useful labours
 will not  be forgotten     by those with whom they co-operated for             the
advancement of science.
    I  must now conclude my very imperfect performance of the                 task
 imposed upon me by the Council, with the expression of a hope that,
 on future occasions of the same kind, they may be more fortunate in
 their  choice,  and obtain addresses more worthy of occupying the time
 and attention of the Society.

On the Minute Structure of the Involuntary Muscular Tissue.
    By Joseph Lister, Esq., F.R C.S. Eng. and Edin. Com
    municated by Dr Christison.
    In  this paper the author, after a short general account of the
different forms in which contractile tissue occurs in the human body,
describes at greater length the discovery made in 1847 by Professor
Kcjlliker, that involuntary muscular fibre is capable of being resolved
into nucleated elements, supposed to be of the nature of elongated
cells, and hence termed " contractile" or " muscular fibre-cells."
He then alludes       to some     authorities who object to this view of the
structure of involuntary muscle, and notices, especially, a paper by
Professor    Ellis of University College, London, read before the Royal
Society of London in June of the present year (1856), in which
that distinguished anatomist expresses his belief that "the fibres are
long, slender, rounded cords of uniform width," and that the nuclei
 " appear to belong to the sheath of the fibre ;" whence                   it   is to be
inferred that Kolliker's fibre-cells            are, in the opinion of       Mr Ellis,
created by the tearing of the tissue in the preparation of the objects.

    The author then               proceeds       to describe the         involuntary           muscular
tissue as it presents itself in two situations where he has recently
examined         it,   namely, the minute arteries of the frog's foot and the
small intestine of the pig.   He finds that, by suitable manipula
tion, exceedingly delicate arteries may be dissected out from the
web   of the frog,        some of them being               of smaller calibre than              average
capillaries; and that in such vessels                          the middle       coat consists of
neither    more nor less than                 a   single layer of          Kolliker's muscular
fibre-cells      wrapped spirally round the internal membrane, and of
sufficient length to encircle               it   from about one and             a   half to two          and
a   half times.          The tubular form of               the vessels enables        the observer,
by proper adjustment of the focus, to see the fibre-cells                                 in   section     ;
and where the nucleus                 is   so placed       in the artery as to appear                      in
section    also, the section of the nucleus                 is   invariably found surrounded
on all sides by that          of the fibre-cell, whence               it   is   inferred that the
nucleus    is    not merely connected              with the external part of the mus
cular element, but           is   embedded        in its substance.             Considering that
no tearing       of    the tissue     is   practised in the preparation of the objects,
but that the parts are seen undisturbed                          in their natural relations,
this simple observation appears to prove conclusively, that,                                        in   the
arteries of the frog's foot,               the involuntary           muscular        tissue        is   con
stituted as      Kolliker      has described it.
    The pig's intestine proved                   to be     a   very favourable         situation for
the investigation            of unstriped         muscle, the fibre-cells
                                                     being larger
than in the human subject in the same situation, and very readily
isolated      by    simply    teasing out         a    small portion        of the tissue with
needles     in     a    drop of water.             Under         these     circumstances,               they
corresponded            exactly     with      Kolliker's descriptions, and the                          deli
cate and      perfect form of their tapering                     extremities was sometimes
seen to be such            as could         not possibly have been produced by the
tearing of      a   continuous fibre.             In   one fibre-cell      that happened to be
coiled up, the position of the nucleus embedded                            in its substance              was
seen in the same way as in the arteries of the frog.                                 In    examining
the circular           coat of    a   contracted piece of intestine from                       a   freshly
killed pig, the author observed some short, substantial-looking bodies
of high refractive power, each of    somewhat oval shape, with more
                                                       a
or less pointed extremities, and presenting several strongly-marked,
thick, transverse ridges upon its surface and each, without excep;

                                         415
tion, possessing a roundish nucleus, whose longer diameter lay across
that of the containing        mass.     Between these   bodies   and the long
and delicate      fibre-cells   every possible gradation     could be traced,
and it was therefore pretty clear that the former were but the ex
tremely     contracted form of the latter.         That the appearances in
question were due to contraction of the fibre-cells, was proved by
their    disappearance when a portion           of the tissue    was   strongly
stretched.
    The bearings of these observations on the main question, respect
ing the structure of involuntary muscular fibre, are obvious and im
portant.      In the first place,   if the short substantial bodies were mere
contracted fragments of rounded fibres of uniform width, we should
expect them to be as thick at their extremities            as at the middle     ;
instead of which they are always more or less tapering, and often
present a very regular appearance of two cones applied to each other
by their bases.
    Secondly, the uniform central position of the nuclei in the con
tracted fibres, proves clearly that the former are no accidental ap
pendages of the latter, to which it seems difficult to refuse Kolliker's
appellation of cells.
    In  conclusion, the author makes the following remarks           : —
    To  sum up the general results         to which we are    led by the facts
above mentioned, it appears that in the arteries of the frog, and in
the intestine of the pig, the involuntary        muscular tissue is composed
of slightly flattened, elongated elements, with tapering extremities,
each provided at its central and thickest part with a single           cylindri
cal nucleus imbedded        in its substance.
   Professor Kolliker's account of the tissue being thus completely
confirmed in these two instances, and the description            here   given of
its appearance in the arteries of the frog's foot being an independent
confirmation of the general doctrine, there seems no reason any longer
to doubt its truth.
   It  further appears, from what        has been seen in the pig's intestine,
that the muscular elements are, on the one hand, capable of an ex
traordinary degree of extension, and, on the other hand, are endowed
with a marvellous faculty of contraction, by which they may be re
duced from the condition of very long fibres to that          of almost globu
lar masses.      In   the extended state      they have a soft, delicate,   and,
                                                                2 M 2

                                       416
usually, homogeneous aspect, which becomes altered during contrac
tion by the supervention of highly refracting           transverse ribs, which
grow    thicker   and   more approximated         as  the   process   advances.
Meanwhile the " rod-shaped" nucleus appears to bo pinched up by
the contracting fibre, till it assumes a slightly oval form, with the
longer diameter transversely placed.
   The author further remarks, that these properties of the constituent
elements of involuntary muscular fibre explain in a very beautiful
manner the extraordinary       range of contractility      which  characterises
the hollow viscera.

     The following Communications                        were read        :   —
1.   On the Ovum and               Young Fish of the                      Salmonidae.              By
     William Ayrton, Esq.                    Communicated                by Professor All-
     man.
     The paper contained a         series of observations                on the development
of the embryo in the salmon, made on ova procured from an esta
blishment for the artificial propagation of this fish, at Overton,
on the river Dee.  The author's observations commenced about the
37th day after impregnation, and were continued from that period                                    to
the time when the vitellus becomes finally absorbed.                          The    progressive
development of the various organs was described, and the principal
steps illustrated    by carefully drawn and                  expressive figures.                 With
regard to the proper time for transit, the author arrived at some
practical conclusions.  He maintained that the ova, after impregna
tion, should be as little disturbed as possible for tho first thirty or
thirty-five days, but      he proved that at the end              of that period                 they
may be exposed        to great changes                 of temperature, and of                    other
external conditions, with comparative impunity                       ;    and he was of            opi
nion that they would then endure                   a   transit of   some days        if   only   sup
plied with moisture         by   means        of    moss,    wool, or similar material.
He further concluded,        as the result             of various observations             and ex
periments, that     if   the transit be not made                when the ovum              is    from
thirty   to forty days old,      it   will   be made        with    most      safety after        the
young fish has attained an age at which the yelk                         is   wholly or     nearly
absorbed.

   2.    Notice of the Vendace of Derwentwater, Cumberland,
          in a letter addressed to Sir William Jardine, Bart., by
          John Davy, M.D.
       In  this communication       the author    first gives an account of     the
  occurrence of the Vendace (a fish hitherto supposed to be confined to
  the lochs of Lochmaben in Dumfries-shire) in two of the lakes
 of     Cumberland,       viz.,   Derwentwater     and Bassenthwaite      Lake, in
 each of which it seems to be pretty           abundant, and to have been long
 known to the boatmen           ; secondly, he offers some speculative sugges
 tions as to the diffusion of species        in the instance of this fish, giving
 the preference to that presuming that its transfer might               have been
 accidentally      effected by the      impregnated      ova  being conveyed     by
 aquatic animals      :  adducing in favour of this conjecture facts         ascer
 tained by him respecting the ova           of the Salmonidae, such as their
 bearing exposure         in    a moist atmosphere      for days without    losing
 their vitality,    and also, with equal impunity,         the reduction  of their
 temperature      to the freezing point       of water,   and their entanglement
 in and adhesion       to ice.
 3.   On the Races of the Western Coast of Africa.                   By Colonel
       Luke Smyth O'Connor, C.B., Governor of the Gambia.
       Communicated          by Professor Kelland.
      The British   possess three colonies on the western coast of        Africa   :
Gambia, 2490 miles from England, in latitude 13° 30' N., longitude
14° 40' W. ; 500 miles south, Sierra Leone, in latitude 8° 30'
N.,     longitude   13° 10' W. ; and, 1500            miles down in the Bight
of Benin, Gold or Cape Coast Castle, in latitude                  5° 5'  25" N.,
longitude 1° 12'45"W.
     Gambia is selected for this paper, as not only the first, but the
most singular and interesting of our African colonies.
     Nearly two centuries have glided away since the British, by per
mission of the kings and chiefs of Combo, established a settlement
on the      island of St Mary's, — a mere bank            of sand, swamp, mud,
and mangroves, pregnant with miasma, and well stocked with alli
gators, —situated near the mouth of the river Gambia, along whoso
banks we by degrees           established small trading ports or factories,
until at last we reached Pisania, nearly 300 miles up the river,
         vol. hi.                                                 2 w

                                            430
whore       Dr Laidley superintended              an    extensive        trading     depot        in
1786, and for years continued the able head and manager of it.                                  But
singular enough, with all our wealth, enterprise, desire to extend
commerce, and procure channels for the circulation of our home
manufactures,      we      are   to    the present         moment        ignorant         of    the
source and      course of the           Gambia    ;    having      but     hazy,    legendary
records of the wild tribes adjacent to its banks, or of the chil
dren of the desert, the " Foutah Foulahs" and " Foutah Toros,"
who, rushing down periodically from the interior, devastate districts,
plunder whole villages, and bear off into slavery men, women,                                   and
children.      Our settlements in the Gambia are surrounded                           by war
like and powerful nations, the kings of Barra, Combo, Badaboo, Kat-
tabar, Woollie being the chief.
   The kings of Barra long ruled with despotic sway all the minor
sovereigns, and, as their dominions lay adjacent to ours, and ex
tended for several miles along the right bank of the river, we had                                to
conciliate their favour, and submit              to their unjust,          tyrannical,          and
insatiable    exactions,    to   preserve intact           our struggling          settlements
of Bathurst, and secure the lives and properties of our                             merchants
trading in the river to Pisania.
   The   head man of the kings            of Barra was, and indeed still                  is,   the
" Alkadee of Jillifree," from time immemorial the most powerful                                chief
in the Gambia among the adjacent nations and with the distant tribes.
These kings are mentioned by several travellers in Western Africa, —
by Johnson in       1621, Stibbs in 1723, Moore                     in 1737,        Dr Laid
ley, the special friend of the gallant Houghton, in 1791,                           the    enter
prising Mungo Park in 1795, and again, when he left Pisania,                                   upon
his last fatal expedition to the Niger, in May 1805, by Snelgrove,
Winterbottom,      Meredith, Houghton, Murray, and many other writ
ers, —as     great chiefs, who held the principal sway in the kingdom                             of
Barra.  They collected the king's dues (for   former times    in                      the kings
of Barra levied  duty of £18 on all vessels proceeding up
                   a                                                                  the river
Gambia beyond       Jillifree), and monopolized the salt trade                       as far as
the kingdom of Woollie;               in consideration       of which,       the kings          en
gaged to redress the wrongs of all traders, factors, agents, or                                 ca-
boceers, who held commerce with them     and did so effectually,
                                                       ;                                          by
sending a war-man           and canoe      to any bey, chief, or             " sooma,"          who
dared to molest friends belonging to them, that                      is,   under their im
mediate care.

     Two hundred miles up the river Gambia is our most distant mili
tary station, M:Carthy's Island, which we purchased from the king of
 Kattabar.     It is about nine miles in length, and one to one and a half
 in breadth, and forms the principal depot for the merchants' goods, con
 sisting of blue and white bafts, cotton prints, sugar, guns, gunpowder,
 tobacco, salt, and rum — the white man's fire water, which has been and
 is the  burning curse — the poisonous draught — the fatal fountain from
 whence flows the long list of crimes which stain the wild Indian's
and the savage African's career for centuries.             To it may be traced
the bloodiest records in the      history of the Old and New World; and
the moral, religious, civilized Europeans         have    a fearful  account to
answer for.
     Beyond McCarthy's Island the river           becomes    wilder,   more ro
 mantic, the banks loftier and more thinly inhabited.        Alligators, hippo
potami, baboons and monkeys, of great size, and uncommon strength
and ferocity, crowd the banks, and follow the steamer or boats with
 barking and howling, little intimidated by the discharge of fire-arms.
 The natives entertain a respect, mingled with fear, for the large            ba
 boons, and class them with       the devil.    Indeed, when passing a hill,
said to be the especial resort of the devil, the natives salute, not
 by profound     bows,  genuflexions,    retreating    backwards,    or flinging
dust upon their       heads,  but by turning       their backs, and dancing
an    antic  bolero for some minutes        ; and they are so firmly per
suaded of the necessity of this           ceremony,     that    no  promise    or
reward     will induce    one   of them to    pass    the   Devil's   Hill  sans
salutation.
     The far-famed Falls of Barraconda, beyond which             few white   men
have advanced,      are nothing more or less than shoals, formed by the
river rushing over       a ledge   of sunken rocks, extending diagonally
across the channel.       In  the rains, a vessel can pass over the Falls,
and the whole country is inundated for miles.
    A   few hunters   for ivory,   or wandering     traders, occasionally fre
quent the Falls, but no factories or settlements extend to this dis
tance.     Captain Stibbs, who was despatched by the Duke of Chandos,
Director of the Royal African Company, in 1723, proceeded beyond
the Falls of Barraconda, until the river became too shallow to float
the boats, even when the channel           was   160 yards broad.       He    de
scribes the few natives he met with as a harmless people, who sup
plied him abundantly with fowls and provisions            ; but he found    him
                                                              2 N 2

                                      432
self in the region of elephants,      river-horses,     and baboons.         Nearly
a century and a     half have   passed      since Stibbs    explored the river,
and we are not better acquainted with the region of              " river-horses"
 nor of the nature, customs, manners, and habitsof the harmless dealers
 in  " fowls and provisions."
    The nations not only adjacent to our settlements on the river
 Gambia, but as far as we carry on commerce, may be classed under
 the heads of Mandingoes     and  Jolliffs, although divided and       subdivided
 into several tribes   bearing different       names, such as Warasoonkos,
 Labous, Surruwoollies,     Syreras, Teboos,        Tuarics, Jolahs     ;   the last
 having hardly the features and semblance of human                beings.       The
 Mandingo language is soft, musical, poetical, and might be styled
 the Italian of Western Africa.        The Jolliff is harsh, guttural, and
confined. Upwards of one hundred dialects are to be met with.
    The Arabic character     is used for the      Koran, general      despatches,
public or private communications        ;   and the Marabouts        instruct    the
children   in the different villages by        means   of large oval pieces of
board, on which letters and sentences          from the Koran, or the " Pro
phet's Laws,"     are written with a pen made from the common reed.
Frequently    in my ramblings     I have come       at night-fall to a Moham
medan town, and after being introduced to my                " lodging-man,"       or
landlord,   who is bound to protect both my person and my purse,
strolling through the narrow closely-fenced paths — for streets they
             I
were not — have reached a small but open space in front of a cir
cular hut, at the door of which was seated a venerable, white-bearded
Marabout,    surrounded by a crowd of children of all ages, each holding
his wooden book, and repeating in full chorus, an extract from the
Koran, given forth in a clear sonorous           voice by the aged instructor.
    Polygamy and slavery are the great banes of Western,                  if  not of
all Africa.     The former checks population, shatters all                domestic
ties, all kind and friendly feeling       ;  reduces woman to the lowest,
most    degraded position, so that she becomes           the beast of burden,
the servant of servants of one tyrannical         master.
    Slow and uncertain has been our progress in the river Gambia.
Since the days of Johnson, in 1621, or           Dr Laidley, 160 years after
wards, or Mungo Park, in 1805, to my two trivial expeditions in
1854 and 1856, we are still ignorant of the source of the Gambia                   ;
whether (as is vaguely surmised) it connects itself with the Senegal,
or flowing southward into the Niger, and joining its volume of waters

                                      433
 to those of    that singularly    obscure and interesting          river, empties
 them, thousands of miles from our settlement at Bathurst,                 into the
 Bight of Benin.

2. Some      Remarks on the Literature and Philosophy of the
       Chinese.      By the Rev. Dr Robert Lee.
2. Observations        on the Crinoidea, showing their connection
       with other branches of the Echinodermata. By Fort-
       Major Thomas Austin, F.G.S.                Communicated            by Pro
       fessor Balfour.
    The author remarks,      that although    there     are upwards of 280
writers   on the Crinoidea,    yet there is no class of ancient animals so
much misunderstood.         These animals     have     not merely played an
important part in     the system   of creation as regards animal life, but
they have also modified the physical condition of the globe.                 They
are found abundantly      in limestones, both of the Silurian and of the
Carboniferous     epochs, attaining their maximum          in the latter.     The

                                           434
author traces the Crinoids, or  Encrinites, through various strata,
showing the gradual disappearance of ancient forms, and their re
placement by new forms of Radiata.    The chief characteristics of the
Crinoidea, up to the Carboniferous epoch, are, that the articulations
which connect the indurated pieces of which the column is composed
radiate by simple striae diverging              from the central         axis ; and that
the dorsal portion of the body, that              is,   the part below the rays, ge
nerally preponderates           over, or at least       is fully equal to, the ventral
or upper portion.             From this period          these    older types gradually
became extinct,        and we find them succeeded               by forms in which the
ventral portion        is   generally superior          in size to the dorsal, which
seems now to serve only as           a   for the support of the wide-spread
                                         base
ing rays    ;    while, with two exceptions (the Apiocrinus and Gnatho-
crinus), the articulations         in the columns are secured by crenulated
floriform     ridges on the facets of the joints.                This peculiar form        at
tained its maximum in the Lias             ;    since which      it   has dwindled       down
to   a   solitary Pentacrinus,      and a few other Crinoids, having little re
semblance to the ancient forms.
     The author then gives a historical sketch of tho various opinions                     en
tertained regarding these animals, and notices the superstitious ideas
regarding them, whence had originated the names given to them                               of
 fairy-stones,      giants'    tears, St Cuthbert's beads, star-stones, wheel-
 stones, screw-stones, &c.           After alluding to the views of early                  au
 thors, he proceeds to show the advances                     which    have   been   made    of
 late in our knowledge            of the structure and affinities of Crinoids.
 He traces the analogies         between   them and the Echinodermatous tribe.
 From the Comatula             we pass through      a     succession    of forms onwards
 to the most perfect          Echinoderm (the sea-urchin),              and backwards to
 tho Marsupite,        the Pentacrinus,        and the Crinoidea.            General affini
 ties exist between           the free swimmingEuryale and the Marsupite,
 as well as       the fixed Euryalicrinus of the Silurian and Carboniferous
 rocks.
     The analogy       between     fossil Crinoids and the recent forms             of   Echi-
 noidea     is   noticed.     The author traces the gradual and uninterrupted
 transition from the Asteriadae to the Crinoidea, from the Crinoidea
 to the Blastoidea,           from the latter to Echinida,             and finally to the
 star-fishes.

       Right Reverend BISHOP TERROT in                      the Chair.
    The following Communications             were read    : —
 1.  On the application of the Theory of Probabilities to the
    question of the Combination of Testimonies.                      By Pro
    fessor Boole.      Communicated by Bishop Terrot.
    The method for the solution of questions in the theory of proba
bilities which is applied in this paper, is that which was developed
by the author in a treatise entitled
                                          " An Investigation of the Laws
of Thought,     on   which  are founded the Mathematical          Theories   of
Logic and of Probabilities."
    The special problems with relation to the combination of testi
monies to which the method is applied are the following, viz.: — 1st,
That in which the testimonies        to be combined    are merely different
numerical measures of a physical magnitude, as of the elevation of a
star, furnished by different observations taken simultaneously.            2d,
That in which     the testimonies to be combined relate, not to a nume
rical measure, but    to some fact or hypothesis of which      it  is required
to determine     the probability   ;  the probabilities  furnished     by  the
separate testimonies being given.

                                                        436
    Before proceeding to the solution of these                                       problems, the author
notices     a distinction            between           problems (relating                to probabilities)        of
which the elements are logical, and problems of which the elements
cannot, without being subjected to some                                  previous         mental transfor
mation, be regarded as logical.   He describes as logical those pro
blems in which the data are the probabilities of certain simple events,
and the quaesitum              the probability               of some compound event, whereof
the simple events are the elements combined in any way as happen
ing or not happening.                       If,   for example, the probabilities                        that the
individuals         A, B, C, will continue in life for ten years,                                     be p, q,     r,
given fractions, and the quajsitum be the probability of all the lives
continuing, or of their                 all       failing,      or of any two falling and one
continuing      ;   these he calls logical problems.                                In   like manner,       if    the
data be the probabilities of such compound events, and the quaesitum
be the probability                  of some other compound, or of the simple events
compounded,            these         also     are       logical.         This the author expresses
generally.
          Given prob.    <pl   (a, y, i), prob.     f       (x, y,       Sc.
                                                                           ;    find prob.      $   (x, y, z).

     It   may be observed, that as an event                              must either happen or not
happen, these functions can consist only of factors of the form x and
1   —x.       He     observes,       —" I         regard the elements of                 a    problem relating
to probability as logical when the numerical                                         data are the probabi
lities, in the mathematical                        sense,      i.e., measures of probability of
certain events, and when the object sought   the probability of some           is
other event whose connection with the former   either, — 1st, That                  is                             it
is   a    compound event of which they are the simple components;                                                 or,
 2d, That both          it      and they may be resolved into the same compo
 nents.       He employs the term                        '
                                                              compound              event'     to denote,         not
 merely the conjunction                     of certain          simple         events,        but any kind of
 combination          of them          in    the way of happening                        or not happening,
 happening together, or in alternation  or in any way which     ca   ;                                       is
 pable of being expressed                         by
                                the grammatical forms of language,
 and especially          by     the adverb not and the conjunctions and, either,
 or, &c.
   According to this definition, the problem of the reduction or com
bination of different simultaneously-observed altitudes of a star                                                  is
not in its direct presentation   logical one. The immediate data are
                                                   a
not probabilities     events, but measures of
                               of                physical magnitude.            a
The author, however, remarks that this problem                                           is   capable of being

                                           437
reduced to a form in which its elements are logical.                    If  a quadrant
of the celestial        arc be taken as the unit of magnitude, then any
observed     elevation of a star, regarded as a physical point, in a parti
cular quadrant of elevation, will be the probability furnished by that
observation, that a pointer directed at random to the given quadrant
will point somewhere below the star.
     This  is clear from the      ordinary definition of the measure of proba
bility.     For, supposing the observed altitude to                be    10°, then the
number       of different     directions    that may be given         to the pointer,
is to the number         of such directions falling below the star, as 90 : 10,
or as 9: 1.         Hence the probability of the direction of the pointer
 being below the star at         J = the altitude of the star, considering the
 quadrant as       unity.
     In  considering this problem, the author first makes some observa
 tions on the different         principles    which have been        employed in its
 discussion, viz.     :  the principle of the arithmetical mean regarded as
 axiomatic in its nature, the principles            of mechanical analogy, of geo
 metrical consistency, &c.           And he      suggests     that the agreement of
 results deduced         in such various ways is to be taken as an evidence
 of   a certain harmony between           the intellectual     powers and the exter
 nal universe considered as their actual sphere of exercise.
      Reducing the problem, as above intimated, to logical elements,                  he
 then applies to it the method developed in the
                                                                " Laws     of Thought."
 The following, though not the most general, is the most interesting
 result to which the application leads           : —
      If n  observations of the altitude of a star are to be combined, and
  if C1, c2,
              . . . cn are the several probabilities        that these respective ob
  servations are absolutely correct, and if pv p2, . ,pn are the altitudes
  which they furnish, then the most probable altitude will be

   observations.        But it is free from any admixture of mechanical ana
   logy, and it expresses the so-called weights as functions of certain
   initial probabilities, viz.     :  the several probabilities        of absolute cor
   rectness in the observations.           Even    if  these   probabilities   are, as in

for if it is certain that if an observation be correct, the result which
it furnishes must     be adopted.

and expresses the principle of the arithmetical             mean.
    The author     conceives   this investigation to be of value, not         on ac
count of the result to which it conducts us, but on account of the               con
nexion which it establishes between             the doctrine of the arithmetical
 mean and the logical theory         of probabilities.
    In   the second special problem, viz., the problem of the combina
tion of testimonies to         a fact or hypothesis,        results   are   obtained
which may thus be described           : —
     1st, The complete solution          involves arbitrary constants, and          is
therefore indefinite.        It  admits, however, in various cases of a           de
finite value, and leads to many general conclusions of considerable
 interest.
     2dly, The arbitrary constants relate, not          to the   probability   of the
 fact or hypothesis as dependent upon the testimonies or evidences, but
to    the probabilities   of the testimonies         themselves.      Thus, if    two
 symptoms are observed, each of which gives a certain probability of
 the existence of a disease, the strength of the joint presumption               does
 not altogether depend upon that of the separate presumption, but is
 affected,  for instance, by the d         priori likelihood     of  concurrence of
 the symptoms.
     3dly, In general, combined presumptions would                 be strengthened
 by the a priori unlikelihood of their combination.
     4tldy,  In   many cases the arbitrary elements disappear.                 Thus,
 if  one of the presumptions amount to certainty, the combination
 will always indicate certainty, however unfavourable the opposite
 presumption may be.

     bthly,    Where testimonies                       are     in    a    high     degree         cumulative, e.g.
where their concurrence was A    priori very improbable, the formula
for the strength of the united testimonies plt p2, . . . pn, tends to
assume        the following expression as its limits, viz.                                   :   —
                                                    p, P »   • • • p»

     This     is commonly assumed to be the general                                         solution.             The   au
thor shows that the proof of                          it,   as usually given, involves the neglect
of   a   real and important                     consideration,            — viz.,      that      it   is    to the same
fact     that the testimonies                       relate.         To the true general solution                         it
stands in the position of    limiting value, applicable only on the
                                                a
hypothesis of the testimonies being of     very unexpected kind, or         a
of their concurrence being very unexpected.
     Qthly,     When         the probabilities                     are not cumulative, but some of
them are felt to be too great, others                                too     small, and           a     kind of mean
between        them    is    required,          a      definite result            is   again obtained, which
may be thus stated.
     Let    p1, p3,    .   .     pn, represent the separate probabilities, then                                     is   the
mean probability               represented by the formula
                                      ...

     This formula   the counterpart of (2).
                            is                                                    It   expresses the average
of the probabilities furnished      differing                 by                  judgments, even as the
formula of the arithmetical                          mean expresses the average among                                   dif
fering      measures         of a numerical                   magnitude.               But       it   differs in cha
racter      and     in the consequences                        which        it   involves from the latter
formula.
     Thus     if    the testimonies are two in number, and the probabilities
which they furnish in favour of an event are                                      p    and       q,   the formula be

lie half-way between                     the values           p     and     q,   but which, as may easily
be shown, lies nearer to the one                              of    those    values which               is   the nearer
either to       1   or to        0.        This indicates, that                  if    we        have to take an
average between two judgments, one of which partakes more of the
character of certainty than the other, the former will have greater
weight in determining the final state of expectation.                                             This, the author
observes,      is   accordant with our instinctive feelings.
       The formula,            it     is   to be observed,                 is    not applicable to cases in

                                            440
   which evidence      is of a cumulative character, as where different posi
  tive assertions are made of the absolute truth of a fact, — but to cases
  in which different       modes    of considering a subject      lead  us to assign
  different   probabilities    to a fact or hypothesis, and it is our object to
  take between      these probabilities     an average.
      For example if A and B,           whose veracity, that    is the probability
  of their speaking truth,         has a given       value, both affirm    that  the
  event   E has occurred,       the formula       does  not apply.     The proper,
                                                                          p  q

 But if the question be the probability that Sir Philip Francis was
 the author of Junius' Letters, and p and q be the probabilities

     In that portion of the memoir, which is introductory to the                de
 monstration of the above results, the author explains the grounds of
 his method for the solution of questions in the theory of probabilities
 whose elements       are logical.      They are briefly the following : —
     1st,  He   defines   the  mathematical probability of an event, as         the
 ratio which the number of cases or hypotheses favourable to that
 event bears to the whole number of cases conceivable, supposing
that to none of those         cases   the mind is entitled to attach any pre
ference over any other.
     2dly, He remarks, that when the probabilities of simple events con
stitute our only data, no knowledge whatever being given of their
connection, we can thence, by virtue of the definition, determine the
probability    of any logical combination of them, either absolutely or
conditionally.
     Sdly, He postulates that when the data are not the probabilities of
simple events,      we can only grasp them and apply them to the calcu
lation of probability       by regarding      them, not as primary,     but as de
rived from some hypothesis in which the data are the probabilities of
simple events, and to which, accordingly, we may apply the princi
ples already referred to, as flowing from the very definition of pro
bability.     The probabilities of the simple           events in the hypothesis
must, of course, be determined in accordance              with the original data.
    At this    stage    the question arises,      How shall such an hypothesis
be lawfully framed?         To this question the following answer is given. —

                                      441
   4thly, When,      as in the case supposed,    the data are not the proba
bilities of simple events, the numerical measures of probability p, q,
r, &c., which they involve, will ba subject to certain conditions
(beside that of their being positive fractions), in order that these data
may be mutually consistent, — may,         if considered   as furnished by ex
perience, represent an experience which is possible.             These  condi
tions the author terms the " conditions of possible experience," and
he gives a general method for their determination.              Thus, for ex
ample,   if p  is the probability  of the conjunction of the events x and
y, q of the conjunction of y and z, and r of the conjunction of z and
x, the quantities p, q and     r, besides the condition of not transgress
ing the limits 0 and 1, must satisfy the conditions
          P^9       +   r—l,q^r        +   p-l,r,^p          +  q- 1 ;
similar conditions deducible from the data, will in general, limit            &
priori, the value of the probability sought.
    bthly, The author then lays down the principle, that the hypothe
tical construction     (already referred to) of the problem from simple
events with unknown probabilities, must be such, that the determi
nation of these unknown probabilities         from the data will be possible
and definite, when the above         conditions of possible experience are
satisfied.    In   other words, the hypothesis      should involve the exist
ence   of no other conditions among the data, than the condition of
their being possible, and mutually consistent.
    This principle, he observes, completely limits and determines the
nature of the solution, restricting it to the particular method deve
loped in the chapters on probability        in the Laws of Thought.        He
remarks, that the method in question            was   not, however, as it first
presented itself to his own mind, associated         with such considerations
as these, nor are such considerations even          hinted at in the work re
ferred to.     The method     was there exhibited as resting upon an axio
matic basis.       The fact, that the conditions which it involves     as con
ditions of mathematical validity and consistency, are identical with
the conditions of possible experience, was subsequently discovered.
    The proof of this identity,    is not, however, in its present state, to
be considered as complete ;     neither can it be considered as established
that no other method can satisfy the so-called conditions of possible
experience.       The proof of the former proposition      has, however, been
carried sufficiently far to leave no doubt of its truth, and the latter

                                      442
  one has in its favour the    negative evidence furnished        by the failure
  of solutions attempted by competent analysts upon other            grounds.
     2. On    New Species of Marine Diatomaceae from the Firth
        of Clyde and Loch Fine.             By Professor Gregory. Il
        lustrated by numerous drawings, and by enlarged figures,
        all drawn by Dr Greville.
     In two papers, read before this Society, and subsequently                pub
 lished in the Microscopical    Journal,   I described and figured a          large
  number of new species of Diatoms, chiefly marine, which           I  had   found
  in the Glenshira sand.
     This  sand was   deposited by the Dhu Loch of Glenshira,            at a    pe
 riod geologically recent, when that lake occupied a higher level              than
 it now   does, and  extended about     two miles      farther up    the valley.
 That the Dhu Loch at that period, as well as now, communicated
 with Loch Fine, so that at high tide the salt water flowed into the
 lakes, while at low water the current, as in a tidal estuary,             flowed
 outwards, is proved by the fact, that the sand then deposited                 con
 tains   more marine than fresh-water        species.     In   the deposit      now
 forming in the Dhu Loch marine forms are also abundant.
     But while it  was obvious that   all the marine forms       of   the   Glen
shira sand had come from Loch Fine, itself a branch of the Firth                   of
Clyde, it was remarkable that the new forms           I had described      should
not have been found in the Clyde by those who had examined its de
posits.     There  was  indeed   0110 form    which   I  had figured,     namely
Navicula TIennedyi, which Mr Hennedy had shortly before observed
in the Clyde, but which had not yet been described.               Many known
forms were also common to the Glenshira sand and to the Clyde.
    Being firmly convinced that the        new forms     had also, so far         at
least as they were of marine origin, como from the Clyde,             I resolved
to explore    such Clyde   deposits as  I could obtain     ;  and having pro
cured several, the result has entirely        confirmed      my anticipations,
and has, besides, brought to light a large number of additional un-
described forms.
    The materials    I have examined are       1 1  in number, of which,          3
were from     Lamlash Bay, one from Corallina officinalis, taken from
pools on the shore of Arran at Corriegills, and 7 from Loch Fine,
four of these having been dredged by the Duke of
                                                          Argyll and myself

                                        443
off Inveraray, and       3 having       been    dredged off         Strachur    by   the
Rev. Dr Barclay.
  For one of the dredgings from La ml ash Bay am indebted to    I
Professor Allman ; the others from that quarter were sent to me by
the Rev. C. P. Miles, M.D.
   All     were more or less interesting.         The richest       was that    of Pro
fessor Allman, which was simply the dirt washed from some nests
of Lima hians, dredged in 4 fathoms.   One of Dr Miles's was also
from these nests in 7 fathoms, and was not so rich, though still full
of new forms.    Those from Loch Fine were from depths varying
from 14 to 60 fathoms.
  No two were alike, except that the two just mentioned, from the
nests of Lima, in nearly the same locality, were more like each other
than any of the others.           This variety is very curious, when          we reflect
that over a large extent of the bottom of          the   Atlantic   the recent sound
ings    have exhibited an astonishing            similarity, being, however, en
tirely different from our estuarial             deposits of the Clyde, and very
poor in Diatoms.
   The variety just alluded         to shows    that the deposits of as many lo
calities    as possible, even in the same         estuary, should be examined,
and that we cannot beforehand            know what they are likely to yield.
It is   not at all likely that 11 dredgings, from three localities, and
all different, should      have    exhausted     the undescribed        forms of the
Firth of Clyde.
   I.These materials yielded a very largo number of known species,
among which were a good many which have hitherto been extremely
rare.      Such are, for example,

   Perhaps the most interesting among these forms, is Campylodis
cus Horologium, which very few observers had seen, as it had only
occurred very sparingly in a dredging made on the Coast of Skye by
Mr G. Barlee, and examined by Professor Williamson.       have now        I
a tolerably     abundant    supply of     it,   chiefly from    Loch Fine, but        it

                                             444
 occurs     also     in Lamlash Bay.         Eupodiseus        sculp tus occurs         twice  or
 three times the size of Professor Smith's                      figure, and Eupodiscm
 Ralfsii    occurs, in the Corallina material,        of remarkable size           and   beauty,
 and in great abundance.               Discs of this fine species, from               0-005* to
 0-007" in diameter, are frequent, and some even reach the                             diameter
 of 0 008."            Orthosira marina (olim Melosira sulcata) is very abun
 dant in Lamlash Bay.                  Syndendrium Diadema, figured by Mr
 Brightwell in his paper              on   Chaotoceros,      is not      rare     in   Lamlash
 Bay.       It     has not,   I believe, been yet described as a             British     species.
    II.    As      I  anticipated, these    materials    have        yielded almost        every
 one   of the new forms of the Glenshira              sand.
    I   have recognised the following           : —

    It   is impossible to doubt, that the few remaining                       Glenshira      ma
rine forms will yet be found in the Clyde, perhaps even in                                 these
dredgings        ;   if not, in others.
    III.    Besides the above          forms, all of which           I  had    figured, there
had occurred in the Glenshira sand 7 or 8 forms, the study of                             which
I  had postponed,          either from want of good specimens, or from their
extreme scarcity in that deposit.                  By the help of the new ma
terials,    I have       been   enabled to clear up, and to establish               as distinct
species,     every one of these forms, most of which are very curious                        and
interesting.
    IV.     Lastly,      I have  detected,  in these materials,          a very large      num
ber of new species.             These  I have arranged         in the following         groups-
                                         Group     I.

 I       have given           a     figure of the typical                   N. Lyra, Ehr.,             not yet
figured as     a    British form.                 The figure referred          to   by   Professor Smith
in his second vol. (vol.                 i.     fig. 152a)       is   that of the variety           /3.
 I      exhibit drawings of all the most remarkable of these forms, and
an    enlarged figure of N. prcetexta, Ehr., which not only remarkable        is
and beautiful            in itself, but              interesting       from     the circumstances in
which     it   occurs.
      Ehrenberg found              it    only fossil, in the Clay             Marl of -lEgina, where
it    seems to be very scarce, as he has figured an imperfect specimen.
I   have found       it   recently, both in Lamlash Bay and Loch Fine, and
though     not abundant, yet sufficiently                             frequent to have enabled me
to distribute       a    good many specimens.                         No doubt,     if   we persevere in
examining the estuarial deposits, we shall some day find                                      it   in greater
abundance in the vicinity of its proper habitat.
      Here, then,        is   a form which, till now, has been regarded as fossil
only, which  found to be still existing in the Clyde.
                    is                                The Clay
Marl of JSgina     stated by Ehrenberg to belong either to the
                              is
chalk formation, or to the                         oldest tertiary or eocene              beds.     I      have
selected this form,                 because          the bed in which          it   occurs fossil         is   the
oldest in which Ehrenberg has found any Diatoms.                                         He   has, indeed,
found     microscopic organisms in the chalk, and even in older rocks,
among which he mentions the Mountain Limestone and the Silurian
Green Sand.              But      the forms in the two latter rocks are                         not nume
rous, and, as well as those which abound in the chalk, belong to the
Foraminifera or to the Polycystineae, not to the Diatomaceae,
  Wo find, then, that this very remarkable form, which occurs fossil
in the Clay         Marl of ^Egina, exists in the Clyde at the present day                                      ;
and there      is   no difference whatever between the fossil and the recent
specimens.
      But this      is   not all.               In   the same Clay Marl Ehrenberg has
figured many more species                       of Diatoms, and of these, upwards of three-
fourths    are absolutely                     identical   with        forms   which       abound in the
Clyde.         Such       are Navicula                Bombus,          N.     incurvata, Pinnularia
Pandura, Orthosira marina, Amphitetras antediluviana. Tricer-
      vol. in.                                                                                2 o

                                            446
    atium Favu3, AcUnocyclus             undulatus, Coscinodiscus        radiatus,    se
    veral Grammatophorte,          and various others.
        In short,   I  have no hesitation       in saying, that     I believe  all    the
   forms in the j£gina           Clay  Marl, which is the oldest Diatomaceous
   deposit yet described, will be found living on our coasts.
       It   may also be observed,       that of all the forms figured by Ehren-
   berg from more recent strata, whether miocene, like the bed on which
   the town of Richmond, Virginia, is built, and several kinds of Berg-
   mehl, or pleiocene, like other Bergmehls and polishing slates, &c., or
  still more recent, the great majority               are perfectly    identical   with
  existing Diatoms.
       Indeed, although        many forms are stated in Ehrenberg's earliest
  writings to be fossil only, and have been supposed to be extinct,
  the progress of observation          is continually adding to the number of
  species which are found also in the recent state.                    Thus, for ex
  ample,     the  whole     group  of  dentate   Eunotiae,     which  abound    in the
  Lapland and Finland Bergmehls, were long thought to be only fos
  sil.     But they have been nearly all found living in America, and I
  have myself seen several of them recent in this country.                    Eunotia
  triodon, long      supposed    to bo extinct,     occurred scattered in many of
 the Scottish fresh-water           gatherings    I  described in this place three
 years ago, and        I  found it this last summer the predominant form in
 a gathering brought from Arran by Dr Balfour.
      Taking     these    facts into consideration,      I   am led to believe that
 we have no evidence that any species             of Diatom      has become extinct,
 as so many species,          and even genera and tribes, of more highly or
 ganized beings have done.             I observe    that  Mr Brightwell     expresses
 a   similar opinion in his valuable paper on Chaetoceros.                (See Micr.
 Jour. IV. 105.)            His anticipation that Syndendrium would be found
 recent has been fulfilled.         (See  List,  p.  450.)     Our knowledge of     the
existing      species    is yet very imperfect, as is obvious from          the facts
adduced in this paper, in which so                  many undescribed       forms are
shown to exist in a few localities of one estuary.                 And among     these
are such forms as the present one,             N. prcetexta, which      has hitherto
been supposed         only to exist as a fossil.
     It   is well  known, that in certain animal           tribes, Molluscs, for ex
ample, many species are common to the present and to earlier                      geo
logical periods.          I need  only allude to the circumstances that            the
eocene, miocene,         and pleiocene strata are named          from their propor

                                         447
tions of existing to extinct molluscs, and that the Terebratula of the
 Silurian  epoch is found to exist at the present day.
    But in the      case   of Diatoms, there is reason            to   think that the
whole of the species which occur fossil will, ere long, be detected in
the recent state,     just   as has occurred     in the case before us,        N.  pree-
texta, which,     it must    be remembered, occurs in the oldest Diatoma-
ceous    deposit    yet described, and       along with forms, nearly all of
which    I have actually found in the Clyde.
    It  is at all events       certain, that a very large proportion of the
Diatoms     found in the fossil state also occur in the living state, and
that every day adds to their number.
    There is at present no good evidence of the existence of Diatoms
earlier than the Chalk, if so early.               But we must not forget that
the shells of Diatoms appear to be altered by long contact with car
bonate of lime, so that they may have existed atone time in the Chalk.
We find them, however, in spite of the action of calcareous matter,
in the Chalk Marls of Meudon and of Caltanisetta, which are rather
more recent than the Chalk, and probably about the age of the Clay
Marl of JSgina.          If, as I  believe, no Diatoms have become extinct,
this may, perhaps, depend on their minute size and extreme simpli
city of structure,      which probably      render them more indifferent                to
climatic changes than more highly organized and larger beings.
    We have evidence, to a certain extent, that this is the case                   ;   for
by Ehrenberg's       figures it appears, that in gatherings of recent Dia
toms, from all parts of the world,            in every possible variety of cli
mate, the majority of the species are identical with our own.
    Diatoms,    therefore,     are not materially        affected    by existing dif
ferences of climate, and have probably been as little affected by the
geological changes which have occurred, at all events                   since the pe
riod of the   eocene deposits.
    To return    to the new forms.

    The number of       new forms     in this group     is  not large, but they are
all interesting.      They are    as follows   : —

     The first       I  have    figured a second      time, because       I  have    detected
 in it a character which effectually distinguishes it from C. Scutellum.
 The second is one of those Glenshira forms, which I have been en
 abled by the new materials to study and distinguish.                 I exhibit drawings
 of them, and enlarged ones of               C.nitida, C. splendida, and G.pseudo-
 marginata, which are very striking forms.                      C. major is equally re
 markable.

     The first      species was described by Professor          Smith, but doubtfully,
as a Himantidium, the F.V. only being then known.                                 The S.V.,
which abounds in some of the dredgings, proves that it is not a Hi
 mantidium        ;   but it is not      so easy to say   to what genus           it belongs.
Diadesmis is not admitted by Professor Smith, but comes nearer                              to
it than any of his genera.                 It has also some analogy with Achnan-
thes, as well as with Odontidium and Denticula.                         I  give the genus,
therefore, with a mark of doubt.                  The four next agree pretty well
with Denticula           ;  but the six which follow them are all very doubt
ful as to genus,           although, perhaps, nearer to Denticula than to any
other genus admitted                by Smith.      The next form has strong ana
logies with Meridion, and even with Gomphonema.                          I  do not venture
here to decide on the genera of these forms, but content myself with
indicating       the existence of the species.             Fyxidicula        crueiata    is a
form, long described by Ehrenberg                  as fossil;  indeed it occurs in the
iEgina Clay Marl, already mentioned; and in the miocene deposit
of Richmond, Virginia.                 I  do not know that it has ever been found
recent,     till  now.        Orthosira angulata is very abundant in Lamlash
Bay, and its        disc has probably been described as Coscinodiscus                 minor,
by Kutzing          and others.        But it is  a true Orthosira.

      It   will   be seen, that two            of these forms              have       been   described by
Ehrenberg, who figures them in the fossil deposits above alluded to,
and one by De Brebison, who found it near Cherbourg.     The form
to which          Mr       Haifa's      name is attached was supposed by him to be
Coscinodiscus                 concinnus, Sm., but proves to be a very remarkable                                 Eu-
podiscus.             I   had not seen it when               Mr Ralfs first            observed it           ;    but
since then,           Dr Greville observed it                on one      of my slides, and               I       have
myself repeatedly noticed it since.                               I give     a figure of      it,   as   it       has
not yet been         figured. Campylodiscus Ralfsii                           I        figure, because             it
occurs       in these dredgings, twice or thrice the                                  size of Professor
Smith's figure, from which, moreover,                              it   differs       in several points             ;
but   I     believe       it   to be the same species.                  The remaining forms                       are
new and remarkable.                      That which         I      suppose     to be a Melosira                     is
doubtful as to genus.

the Glenshira sand                  ;   while the          S.V. had       been figured        in my first
paper as Amphiprora vitrea                          /3.    But    as both figures were imperfect,
and the form not quite understood,                              I     have    now figured       it       again.

the same genus.                    Segments of        it   had occurred in the Glenshira sand,
but    it   was    only in the Corallina gathering that found the entire       I
form.      I      exhibit enlarged figures of Amphiprora maxima, and of
Amphiprora                ?   complexa, both the segments                  and the entire form.

         I
      exhibit enlarged figures of one or two from each division.
    The first three species in the list of complex Amphorae have been
 already figured from the Glenshira sand, but imperfectly, and in one
 case        erroneously        ;   I    therefore         figure         them again, as they are now
 better understood.                     This complex group, of which a short time                               since
 only one was known, namely,                             —A.     costata, Sm., has now become a
 very large one, and the remarkable structure of the forms included
in     it,   which had hardly been attended to in                               A.    costata,   is    found to   be
of very frequent occurrence.   It                           is   probable that these complex forms
will require the establishment of                           a    new genus        ;    but in the meantime
I    regard them as forming                      a   well-marked             sub-genus.
       There     are    still   several      species        of Amphorae to be added to the long
list already given              ;   but they have not yet been fully studied, for want
of time.

      The first of     these   forms resembles JV. rhombica, figured as oc
  curring in the Glenshira Sand.                Both  forms are doubtful      as to
  genus, and may possibly prove to be Schizonemata.                 The   second  is
  allied to Tryblionella as well as to Nitzschia.              The fifth, Pleuro
  dynia reverswn, is       a very singular     form, the genus of which is not
  quite certain.       The sixth is of a genus new         to Britain,  and is one
  of the forms hitherto believed       to be fossil only.     The next, Synedra
  undulata, has      not  yet been figured entire as a       British form.     The
 form which        follows closely resembles it except that it has no undu
 lations in the margin.
      In  an appendix,     I   have added a full description and a figure of a
 very fine new species, detected          by Professor Arnott in a gathering
 from Teignmouth,         and subsequently found, by the same observer, in
 one from the Clyde,            which  justifies its introduction    here.     The
 figure and description are by         Dr Greville.
     The new form, Crcswellia Turris, Arnott, belongs to               an entirely
new genus, which is allied to Pyxidicula, but differs from that genus
as described by        Ehrenbf rg, in forming filaments or chains.          It will
be    remembered, that       I  have also detected a Pyxidicula in the Clyde,
so that both these allied genera occur in that estuary.

       Davy, M.D., F.R.S., London and Edinburgh.
   The urinary secretion of fishes, the author believes, has hitherto
received so little attention owing to certain difficulties attending its
investigation.      He brings forward the few and imperfect observa
tions he has made, with the hope of inducing others more favour
ably situated to prosecute the inquiry.
   The   fishes   he has   examined in quest of their urinary secretion

                                          453
have been fifteen     ;   of those with a urinary bladder         he found a fluid
only in three, the Perch,            Ling, and Ray      ;  and  in those without
this organ, only in two, in their ureters — those of the Pike and
Turbot.
    His experiments       to ascertain the composition of the secretion were
attended mostly with negative results.             In  one instance, that    of the
Pike,   he detected     lithic acid   ; in some others there were indications
of the   presence  of urea in the fluid urine.
    The conclusions he ventures to draw are, that the secretion is
small in quantity,       mostly liquid, and that urea or some other analo
gous nitrogenous compound is its principal ingredient.
    For the   sake  of comparison and further inferences, he notices the
secretion in other classes of animals, laying emphasis on the propo
sition, that the quality of the secretion in each is more regulated
by the structure       of the urinary organs than by any other circum
stance, and that the quality of the food, whether animal or vege
table, neither exercises an influence on the quantity of the nitroge
nous excretion nor on its kind.             He points out how, irrespective of
the    nature of the food, urea is the chief ingredient            of the urine of
the Mammalia, and of other animals provided with a urinary blad
der  ;  how the alkaline      lithates   and uric acid take the place of urea
in those destitute of this organ, such           as birds, serpents, lizards,    in
sects, mollusca, and some          lower in the scale of organization,      as the
myriopoda     ;  and     further, how in the instance of scorpions and
spiders another compound is substituted for the soluble urea, viz.,
guanine, which, like the lithates, is excreted in the state of a soft
solid.
    He concludes with adverting           to the harmonious relation      of func
tions in the animal economy, and the close alliance in action between
the lungs     and the kidneys         ; adding, that     as their activity   seems
generally to be in accordance, and as in fishes the temperature is
low, and little carbonic acid evolved, it may be presumed, as his ex
periments seem to show, that their urinary secretion is proportion
ally inconsiderable.        And hence,      as their digestive powers are great,
it may further     be   inferred that most of their food is assimilated, and
is used in administering         to their growth.     This view    he thinks is in
agreement with, and helps to explain               some    of their peculiarities,
such as we witness in the salmon, the history             of which, of late years,
has been so carefully        and successfully studied.

 2. On the Reproductive Economy of Moths and Bees ; being
      an Account of the Results of Von Siebold's Recent Re
           searches in Parthenogenesis.                    By Professor Goodsir.
     In    a recentwork, entitled          " Wahre Parthenogenesis          bei Schmetter-
lingen und Bienen"                — Real   Parthenogenesis      in Butterflies and      Bees,
Von Siebold, after reviewing the present condition of the subject,
distinguishes            the so-called      alternate      generation    from partheno
genesis, and limits Professor Owen's term to reproduction by un-
impregnated             females.
      He has ascertained that this real parthenogenetic                       mode      of   re
production occurs in certain moths — Solenobia lichenella and tri-
quetrella, the larva? of which are sac-bearers; and in Psyche
helix, the larva          of which constructs one of those remarkable spiral
sacs       which have        been mistaken      for the shells of molluscs.
      It
     would appear that the apterous females of these moths                                   re
produce for many generations without the access of the male,                                and
that the progeny of these virgin females is female.
  Von Siebold's observations on the bee larvae resulted in the
verification of the hypothesis recently propounded by Dzierzon, a
clergyman           and distinguished bee-master               in Southern Germany,
that all     the eggs which come to           maturity in     both ovaries    of   the queen
bee    are   of    one kind, which,        if deposited    without having come in con
tact with spermatic               fluid, are developed into drone or male               bees;
but    if impregnated         by spermatic contact, are developed into female,
— that       is,   into working or queen          bees,   according    to their subsequent
treatment.           The verification         of this      remarkable     and important
physiological doctrine has apparently been effected by,    The                 1,        ad
mitted fact, that working bees occasionally deposit drone eggs                          ;    2,
By the determination of the voluntary muscular structure of                              the
spermatheca         ;   3,   By   the detection    of spermatozoa in the interior of
eggs recently           deposited in working comb-cells,              and the non-detec
tion of spermatozoa in eggs deposited in drone comb-cells     and,                  ;
4, By  a careful analysis of the entire reproductive economy of the
bee.
   Von Siebold, therefore, considers himself entitled to conclude
that the females of certain lepidoptera, and the males of the bee,
are developed from unimpregnated                    ova.

 1. On the      Crania of the Kaffirs and Hottentots, and the Phy
        sical and Moral Characteristics of these Races.                 By Dr
        Black, F.G.S.
    After exhibiting Crania of these races recently received from
 South Africa, along with two British crania of normal size and
 form,    and stating their respective        measurements,    facial angles,
 and    principal diameters, the author reviewed the observations
 of Natural Historians and Anatomists on the skulls and phy
 sical   characteristics      of the races above      mentioned.      Camper's
 facial   angle     was   compared    with    that of Blumenbach,        show
ing the differences, and how far the adult Negro and the orang
outang receded from the higher cranial types ; and also how,
according      to  Mr Owen, the facial angle depends upon whether
 it is taken     in  the young or adult state.          The little difference
which exists between the capacities of the skulls of most of the
human       races was      alluded to, and also     Mr Owen's opinion of
the superiority       of the basal examination       of the skull over that
of the facial angle or vertical aspect.             A peculiarity of several
Negro skulls was also mentioned, viz., the juncture of the tem
poral and frontal bones, and consequently the separation of the
sphenoid     from the parietal.      It  is observed, that the people    of the
high countries of Africa are greatly superior to those of the low
plains ; the former receding further from the physiognomy and
colour of     the  Negro.      Colour of skin greatly varies amongst the
South African natives, from black to a light brown, even amongst
the same nation. The superiority of strength of intellect possessed
by the    Kaffir over the Hottentot is sufficiently marked          ;  and, on
the other hand, is counterbalanced           by the greater pliability of (lis-

                                      457
position in the latter, the one being remarkable for reasoning abili
ties, and the other for aptitude for music, &c.
   M. Virey's       description   of the distinguishing     traits of the
Kaffirs   and Hottentots was noticed, and the mental            superiority
of the former over the latter.            The Kaffirs are   held by him,
Prichard, and Knox, to        be of one ethnic origin with the Negroes,
only they are improved,         and may be called the Negroes of the
mountains,    a change being caused by inhabiting an extra-tropical
climate.
   Dr Morton and the Editors of the "Types of Mankind" were
noticed   as  observing     the affinities   between the Kaffirs  and the
Foolahs and Felatahs, — an affinity upon which others have thrown
a doubt; while the Editors agree with other observers that the
Kaffirs resemble the true Negro much more than the Hottentot,
and that the latter is supposed        to belong to the same race as the
Bosjesman.       The great question       of the primitive origin of man
kind was next adverted to, and it was stated that, in opposition to
Dr Prichard, the Editors of the " Types" contend for distinct
zoological   creations, grounding their opinions partly on Egyptian
monuments.
   Richard Lander has        made  personal observations   on the Kaffirs,
and has shown the resemblance            between them and the Felatahs     ;
and   Lichtenstein     concludes,    that   the same race of people     and
the same family of languages          were spread into the interior, and
also toward the north, far beyond the limits of the Kaffirs proper.
Dr Kraff and Peters were quoted, as showing that all the eastern
nations, from the equator to the Cape colony, belong to one great
family.
   The opinion that the Kaffirs ought to be classed with the Euro
peans or Arabs was shown to be unsound, and also that they con
siderably recede in features and shape of the skull from the
prognathous     races.   There is one trait that directs us to a foreign
source, namely,      the rite of circumcision,     which they universally
practise.    It   is known that the ancient Africans and Egyptians
practised the same rite.        After noticing the belief of the Kaffirs in
a Supreme Being, though they have no idea of future rewards and
punishments, the author noticed the Bechuana Kaffirs as su
perior to the Amakosas., and as having made some advance in
arts and civilization, and the Kosah Kaffirs of the pure breed as

                                      458
approaching      in colour and physiognomy           to the ordinary Negro,
hut    some   of them are of       a  lighter hue, and redder.       Colonel
Smith's observations        on the   Kaffir race are favourable     to their
intelligence    and bravery, and some of them display the               pecu
liar accumulation of fat over the glutei muscles which is more
common among the Hottentots and Bushmen.                      He also men
tions that the northern tribes try to mitigate the small-pox                by
inoculating between the eyes.             Further testimony seems to       es
tablish a near       and kindred relation        between   the languages     of
South Africa, the idioms of which constitute a particular family of
languages, and a singular development of human speech.                In one
respect these languages are shown to agree with the Coptic — in the
law by which they both prefix all modifying particles, while other
languages suffix them.
   The author then entered briefly into a description of the Fingoes
and     Bosjesmen,     as  given   by travellers and natural historians,
showing that the latter exhibit the features of the lowest humanity,
and are almost allied to the ourang and troglodytes; though Dr
Smith's more accurate observations have convinced Dr Prichard
that the Bosjesmen        are of the same      race as the Hottentots, and
originally spoke the same language.              The oblique foramen at the
lower end of the humerus was also noticed as occurring in some of
them, as it does in the humeri of the simiae, dogs, and wild boar.
Observations      were made on the physical form and features          of  the
Hottentots, including        the form    of their noses, cheek-bones,    chin,
eyes, and teeth,      their hair and colour, their nipples and      mammae
at different ages,     and also the steatopygea of the females.        While
some consider      them a tribe of Mongolians, and allied to the         Kal
mucks, others are inclined to think them quite as primitive in their
origin   as these   Asiatics.
   The author concludes: "Notwithstanding the difficulties which
ethnographists      must meet with in assigning a probable origin
and descent to the Kaffir,        and especially to the Hottentot tribes,
sufficient to induce them to resort to the theory of distinct centres
of human,     as  well  as  of animal and vegetable creation     ; and, not
withstanding all that has been lately advanced on the subject of
the unity of the human species, we may safely say with the emi
nent Natural Historian, that no differences, such as those observed
among      mammiferous       animals,   are   to  be  found among     human

                                            459
 families, and that whatever varieties exist in these respects are the
 effects  of external       agencies, and the tendency to variation which
 such agencies call into activity."
 2.   On a Roche Moutonnee on the summit of the range of hills
        separating Loch Fyne and Loch Awe. In a letter from
        the Duke of         Argyll to Professor Forbes.
     Polished     and    rounded    surfaces of rock       are, under   their more
 ordinary conditions,         of very frequent occurrence in Argyllshire.
 By " their more ordinary conditions,"               I   mean   principally   two—
 viz., Where they occur on the existing coast-line, either                at, or not
 far above      the     present  level    of the   sea ;   secondly,  Where they
 occur in valleys, or the lower flanks of the hills, — whether under the
 boulder clay, or on surfaces naturally exposed.
    From the occurrence          on   Loch Fyne of       some beds   of a chloritic
 schist,   which     is   both very    soft and very tough,       receiving    easily
 mechanical impressions, and resisting as easily the chemical agencies
 which tend to wear them off, there are on its shores some very fine
examples       of rocks rounded         and  deeply grooved.        So far as my
observation goes, however, they all indicate not only a configuration
of the surface identical with that which now exists, but also a com
paratively      small change in the level of the sea.              The prominent
points upon the shore are those which are principally marked — the
direction     indicated is from the head of the loch towards its mouth               ;
that is to say, the direction          which   ice  breaking    up from the high
mountains       at   the    head  of the lake would naturally take in its
passage     to the open sea.         There is nothing to imply a change of
level beyond some fifteen or twenty feet.
    In   the glens leading into Loch Fyne, in the neighbourhood of
Inverary, the       stones and boulders in the clay are abundantly          marked
by abrading        action.     But   I  have not observed upon the walls of
those glens       any appearances which would indicate direct                glacier
action.      When smoothed surfaces of rock appear at all, they seem
rather connected with the general phenomena of the Boulder Clay.
There is one observation, however, which applies generally, if not
universally, to smoothed surfaces of rock in all these situations —
viz., that the direction of the striae is that of the glen or valley in
which the rock is situated, that is           to say, they are in the direction

                                            4f.O
  which   currents    of water, whether          bearing ice or stony matter,          or
  both, would   naturally take, if guided in any degree by                the existing
 configuration of the surface.
     What    appears      to    me    to   be   the   peculiarity    of the "     Roche
 Moutonnee"       I  am now about to describe, is its position, forcing                 us
 to seek   for its explanation         in causes    with which the physical         geo
 graphy of the country can have had comparatively little to do.
     In a communication to the Geological Society of London which                        I
 made    about three years ago, with reference to another                    subject,    I
 gave   a general     description       of the structure      of the ridges which
 separate the valley of Loch Fyne from that of Loch Awe. This
 line of hills, taken from the point where it is traversed by Glenaray,
 runs in a south-westerly           direction about twenty         miles,  till it   falls
 into the transverse valley           behind     Lochgilphead,      along   which     the
 Crinan Canal      is carried     from Loch Fyne to the Western Sea.                    It
 is  of moderate elevation           as   compared      with   the great      group     of
 mountains    which     lies to the       N.E.     But these mountains,          closing
 round the upper end of Loch Awe, terminate                       in Ben    Cruachan,
 opposite to the point         which    I have taken as the commencement                 of
 the ridge   referred to     ;  and beyond that point the remainder of the
northern shores of Loch Awe, and the whole district of country                        ex
 tending from it towards Oban, is of much lower elevation,                      so that,
standing on the higher points of the range of hills to which                    I  refer,
there is an uninterrupted         view to the channels which wind among the
larger Hebrides to the mountains                of Jura, Colonsay, Mull, and up
the Linnhe Loch to the entrance of the great valley of the Caledonian
Canal.
    It  was on going to one of these points            — the    highest on the ridge
for some miles, and probably about 1800 feet above the level of
the sea — during last autumn, that                 I  was surprised to observe
close to the summit so remarkable                 an example     of a well-rounded
surface    of rock as to attract my attention                from     a considerable
distance.     It  is the more remarkable, from the contrast                it  presents
with the generally sharp and broken edges of the strata, which are
there composed of hard quartzose beds, at a high inclination, and
with steep escarpments.             The direction from which the abrading
force    has  acted is about         N.N.E.        It  has passed over a lower
shoulder in its way —lower by about 100 feet; but the effect is
strongest upon the rocks of the main peak itself, and especially

                                    461
upon one or two prominent faces within twenty or thirty feet of
the summit.      Above this it may be observed sloping off, as it
were, with diminished force, over successive ledges towards the top,
until it passes close behind the very highest point, leaving that
point itself apparently untouched.
   I  need hardly say, that in this    case glacier action is impossible.
Even   if this hill  had itself been the seat of the glacier, it could
only have been snow     so near the summit.
   There is one explanation which immediately suggests itself to
the mind, and, however difficult it may be to realize the conditions
which it involves, it is the only one which it           seems    to me to be
possible to suggest.     It  is that this peak, when          subject to that
grinding force, was a rocky islet just appearing above the surface
of a glacial sea, and that floating icebergs, drifting from the north
eastward,    were constantly grounding upon            its   sides.   I   may
observe, that this explanation would accord with the fact that the
surfaces   displaying most strongly         the effects    of the abrading
action are considerably     below the summit       ;  because, as ice floats
deep in the water — not more than one-twelfth              of its bulk being
above the line of flotation — the heaviest           masses would always
ground upon such a rock at a distance from the top proportioned
to the steepness of its declivity, and none but the lighter pieces
would ever    be drifted over the higher points.
   If  this peak was ever,    as  I   have supposed, a mere rock          just
appearing above the level of the        sea,  it becomes of course      neces
sary to suppose that its altitude above the present level of the
ocean is due to      subsequent     elevation.     But    as   the geological
structure of the range — the dip and inclination of its rocks — were
clearly the same when it was subject to these forces of a glacial
sea, it becomes necessary further to suppose that the required
elevation has been a general one, affecting the whole country of
which this range forms a part.         But if this were so, and whether
the elevation was slow and continuous, or more rapid and effected
by   (as it were) successive heaves, we should expect to find at
corresponding points evidences of the same action at lower and
lower stages.     There is certainly one such evidence, viz., that on
some    of the lower ridges which fall in successive steps to the
shores of Loch Fyne there are some very remarkable examples of
large blocks of granite     perched upon       the very summits, in posi-
   vol. in.                                                          2 p

                                      402
tions which it is impossible       to suppose them to have attained by
any other    means than transportation upon ice.            Such blocks,     if
they had fallen or rolled from above, must have                crossed deep
hollows, and again bounded up steep slopes with such a nice
adjustment of impetus as to exhaust itself exactly at the very top,
leaving them perched, where perhaps a single step in advance
would have precipitated them on another journey into the glen
next below.      But this position     so  far from being a difficulty, is
but the natural position in which we should expect to find them,
if ice had been the transporting agent ; because, what are now
summits     must   have been      then   shoals,  upon    which ice would
ground, and upon which, also, ice melting, they would drop their
burdens.
    I send with this very short notice, a copy       of the paper to which
I have referred,* upon the geological structure of the line of hills
on which this Roche Moutonuee occurs.                In it there is an eye
sketch, tolerably correct, taken from Loch Fyne, of the range of
hills between its waters and Loch Awe, and I have marked in red
ink the point where the smoothed surface occurs.            On the succeed
ing page of the same paper there is an ideal section of the same
range of hills, and on this      I  have likewise marked both the posi
tion of the rock and of the massive blocks of stone alluded to in
this letter.
   Since  I  came to London, my attention has been            drawn by Sir
Charles Lyell to a paper, in which he has described a similar
phenomena in the United States, and in which he accounts for it by
the same explanation.        In that   case, however, the fact   of a Roche
Moutonnee on the summit of a range of hills is accompanied                 by
other   very peculiar phenomena          of transported boulders, which
corroborate in a manner not to         be mistaken     the conclusion thus
arrived at.    The continuity and uniformity of direction taken by
the floating ice in that case, as evidenced by the lines of its deposit,
is a peculiarity which must have been due to local causes.                But
if the facts   of submergence and elevation to such an extent              be
established   anywhere, there is no difficulty in applying the          same
explanation to other cases, which, however different               in detail,
involve the same essential facts.

    I  need not allude to the questions                   which crowd        upon us in
contemplating           the   explanation thus          suggested.       What       is  the
connection        between      the glacial period         indicated    by the Roches
Moutonnees found close to the present level of the sea, and those
—in all respects so similar —found on the tops of mountains of
such considerable             elevation.       Was it one long glacial epoch
during which the required elevation was accomplished ] or was it
a recurrence of similar conditions                  after a gale of intermediate
 changes     ?
 3. On     M.    J.  Nickles' claim to be the Discoverer of Fluorine
    in the Blood.            By George Wilson, M.D., F.R.S.E., Regius
    Professor of Technology in the University of Edinburgh.
    I am very reluctant to occupy the time                  of this meeting with           a
personal matter, but as            I am     necessitated to defend my priority in
 reference to certain          researches     which,    in greater part,       were    first
communicated          to this     Society,    and  first made       public   through     its
"  Transactions,"        it seems the proper tribunal,         at least in this country,
to adjudicate on a question liable to dispute.
    A   communication was made to the French Academy, at its meet
 ing on the 3d of November 1856, by M. J. Nickles, entitled
" Presence       du Fluor dans le Sang."           From the tenor of M. Nickles'
remarks, it would seem that he is not aware that the existence of
fluorine in      the   blood was announced by me in 1846,                  and specially
demonstrated         in   1850; nor        is he acquainted       with   the   researches
which others besides myself have made in this country and in Ame
rica, into the distribution          of fluorine    throughout the different king
doms of nature.             In  justice,    accordingly,    to   all parties,   I  seek to
recal the following           facts, which       may save        M. Nickles       needless
labour, and prevent future disputes.                  His announcement           is as fol
lows  :   It   is reported in the Comptes Rendus for November 6, 1856,
and in the         Journal     de  Pharmacie      et de    Chimie, December          1856,
p.  406, from which          I  take it  : —
   " Pretence du Fluor dans                le Sang.    Par M.      J.  Nickles.      (Com
         munique a l'Academie          des Sciences, dans     la sdance du 3 Novembre
         1856.)
   " Par     suite de considerations        quej'aurai    prochainement     l'honneur    de
                                                                       2 p 2

  «oumettre       à l'Académie       j'ai  été conduit     à vérifier cette assertion     tant
  contestée, de la présence           de fluor dans les os.        Mes expériences      ayant
  été affirmatives        j'ai  recherché     le fluor dans le sang, seule voie par où       il
  ait pu arriver jusqu'au tissu osseux.                J'y  en ai trouvé de notables pro
  portions,     non pas seulement dans le sang humain, mais encore dans celui
  de plusieurs mammifères              (porc,   mouton,    bœuf, chien),     et de plusieurs
  oiseaux (dindon, oie, canard, poulet).
      "Des résultats si         concordants      me semblent     donner au fluor une im
  portance qu'il n'a pas eue jusqu'à ce             jour  en médecine ou en physiologie       ;
  ils infirment évidemment             cette opinion de Berzélius, suivant laquelle la
  présence du fluor dans les os est purement                accidentelle,   et qu'en tout cas
  elle n'est pas nécessaire.
      " S'il   fallait d'autres preuves en faveur de la nécessité de reviser le
 jugement de l'illustre chimiste, on le trouverait dans les faits suivants :
  il y a du fluor dans le bile, il y en a dans l'albumine de l'œuf, il y a dans
 la gélatine, il y en a dans la salive, dans l'urine, dans les cheveux ; il y
  en a dans les poils d'animaux (bœuf, vache, et veau) ; en un mot, l'or
 ganisme est pénétré de fluor ; on peut s'attendre à en trouver dans tous
 les liquides qui l'imprègnent.
      " Dans     un prochain travail je ferai connaître les procédés très simples
 à l'aide desquels j'ai pu reconnaître la présence du fluor dans toutes ces
 matières.         Pour le moment, je dois          me  borner à prendre date et à prier
 l'Académie de me donner acte de cette communication."
       I   subjoin, for convenience              of reference,      an English       transla
 tion    : —
      " From     considerations     which    I shall  shortly have the honour to submit
 to the Academy,          I have been led to verify the much disputed            assertion of
 the     presence     of fluorine in      the bones.       My   experiments     having   been
 affirmative,       I  sought for fluorine in the blood, the only channel by which
 it could have reached the osseous tissue ; and I found notable quantities
 of it, not only in human blood, but also in that of several of the Mam
 malia (pig, sheep, ox, dog) ; of several birds (turkey, goose, duck, fowl).
     " Results so uniform appear to me to give to fluorine an importance
 which      it has not yet obtained in medicine or physiology             ;  they manifestly
contradict       the opinion      of Berzelius, that     the presence     of fluorine in  the
bones is purely accidental,            and that it is at any rate non-essential.
     " If    other    proofs   were needed to show the necessity             of revising  the
judgment of the illustrious chemist, they would be found in the following
facts : there is fluorine in the bile, in the albumen of eggs, in the saliva,
in the urine, in the hair ; in the hairs of animals (ox, cow, calf) ; in a
word, the organism is penetrated by fluorine, and we may expect to find
some in all the liquids with which it is impregnated.
     In an early work I shall make known the very simple processes by
means of which I have recognised the presence of fluorine in all those

                                          465
substances.     For  the present   I  limit myself to noting the date, and asking
the Academy to give me formal acknowledgment                  of this communication."
    From the statement of Nickles, which                  I  have    quoted in full, it
will  be seen that its      author was      led by his verification of the con
clusion, first announced at Rome             by    Morichini      and Gay-Lussac in
1802, that fluorine occurs in            tho bones    of animals,      to  infer that it
must be conveyed        to these organs by the blood, and to seek for               it in
that fluid.
    The majority of analysts, however,               have    long    ago   justified the
early Roman observations.              In particular the question of the pre
sence of fluorine in bones was keenly contested in London in 1843,
and analyses confirmatory of its occurrence in them were published
by   Professor     Daubeny      and     Mr Middleton;          to which      in 1846     I
added,   in   a communication         made to     this Society, the accordant         re
sults obtained by Professor Gregory and myself, and drew attention
to the suggestion of Professor           Graham of London, and of Dana, the
American geologist, that animals possibly derived the fluorine found
in their tissues from fluoride of calcium held in solution by water
containing      carbonic acid.      In the    same paper       I adverted to the con
clusion     of  Mr Middleton,      founded on his detection of fluorine in a
 multitude of aqueous deposits, that             " beyond     a doubt   it  is present  in
 water, though perhaps in very minute quantity                               The simple
 fact that the blood conveys it to the bones would,                I  apprehend, suffi
 ciently confute any scepticism on the subject."
    At    this point    I  took up the inquiry in January                1846,    and on
 April   6   of that year communicated a paper to this Society, in the
 " Transactions" of       which it was published.           It will be sufficient here
 to give an epitome       of its contents.         The paper was entitled " On
 the Solubility of Fluoride of Calcium in Water, and its relation to
 the occurrence of Fluorine in Minerals, and in Recent and Fossil
 Plants    and   Animals."      It   is divided into seven sections.            The first,
 entitled   " Introductory Remarks,"           details the researches         of my pre
 decessors,    including those to which        I  have  just referred.       The second,
 entitled   " Of   the Solubility of Fluoride of Calcium in Water," points
 out, that, contrary      to previous      belief, this salt is dissolved         by pure
 water, yielding a solution        answering to all the tests of lime and of
 hydrofluoric     acid.    The third, entitled " Of the          presence     of Fluorine
 in  Well, River, and       Sea  Water," confirms and extends               the  observa

                                         466
tions of previous analysts on the occurrence of a dissolved fluoride in
fresh water, and for the first time announces its direct discovery in
sea-water, where Middleton and Dana had independently anticipated
its presence,   after finding it invariably in the shells of marine mol-
lusca and in corals.        The fourth section, entitled        " Of   the presence
of Fluorine in Minerals," does not call for special notice.                The fifth
entitled   " Of   the presence of Fluorine in Plants," confirms the re
sults of   Will of Giessen      as to the existence       of this element in the
ashes of vegetables, and         draws    attention to plants       and to water as
the media by which         fluorides   may be transferred         from   the soil to
animals.     The sixth section, entitled " Of the presence of Fluorine
in Animals," commences with the statement, " As there exists, then,
a twofold source of fluorine for animals, we may anticipate its occur
rence in various parts of their structure          ;" and thereafter announces,
in opposition to the negative results of Dr Rees, my confirma
tion of the observation of Berzelius, that a fluoride is present in hu
man urine, — a result which the great Swedish chemist hailed with sa
tisfaction before his death*, although           M. Nickles    seems to   think that
he has been tho first to confirm         the original assertion.         The paper
then proceeds to     state, — It
                                "     could not be doubted, after the facts          I
have detailed, that       fluorine would be found in the two great               for
mative liquids of the animal body, blood and milk               ;   I have found it
in both.     So far as    I  am aware,     it has   hitherto   been overlooked in
all the analyses that have          been made of these liquids ; probably it
has   not been sought for.         I employed the blood of the ox, and in
two cases     obtained markings on glass            which only      became    visible
when breathed upon, but are then quite manifest.                   In the third, the
glass was distinctly, though faintly, corroded."
    The concluding part of this section is occupied with a criticism of
the declaration of Treviranus, that the gastric juice of birds contains
hydrofluoric    acid ;  the final sentence      being,
                                                        " We    may now look fur
fluorine in all the animal fluids."
    I merely name the title of the seventh section, which is headed
" Of the presence of Fluorine in Fossil Bones, and its relation to
Animal Life."
    In the summer of the same year, 1846, I ascertained the ex
tent to which pure water dissolves fluor-spar,              namely, 0-26      grains

to the    British Association            at its meeting for that year, and to this
Society in November.                In    1849     these        observations were repeated
with certain variations,            to meet     objections which had been raised to
my conclusions,           but with the same              result.      In     1849      I    communi
cated     to the     British Association         the results of a series of analyses,
demonstrating by a new method of inquiry the presence of fluorine
in the waters of the Frith of Forth, the Frith of Clyde, and the
German       Ocean;         and in March          1850      I     communicated             to this So
ciety an additional series of observations made in the same way, but
extended to the waters of the                   Irish      Sea,    of the Atlantic,             and the
Mediterranean.  This paper was accompanied by a letter from Pro
fessor Forchammer  of Copenhagen, testifying to the presence of
fluorine in the waters of the Baltic.                      In the summer of the                         same
year (1850)          I   returned to the analysis of blood and milk for fluorine,
feeling     assured       that  still more decisive proofs of its presence in
both could be            obtained by using a larger amount of material, and
subjecting it to a simpler process.                    Accordingly, employing                       in the
case of blood        (which      was that  of the ox) 26 imperial pints, in                               the
case    of milk      9   imperial   pints, and in that of cheese 12 lbs.,                           I    was
able to etch glasses with the hydrofluoric                        acid evolved from them so
deeply that they might have                 been      printed from, like copper plates.
The     etched      glasses   were shown to the members                    of the Chemical               and
Physiological Sections of the British Association, at its meeting in
Edinburgh in 1850, and the details of the process published in its
" Transactions,"          as well as in the   Edinburgh Philosophical Journal for
October of that year.*              In   the spring of 1852, 1 again brought the
subject before this Society in a paper entitled

munication, read        July    8, 1852,       I reported   the results of an exami
nation of twenty-four plants or vegetable                    products, in twelve of
which fluorine was found.            It  will suffice to state in reference to both
papers, that their object is to point out, and illustrate by examples,
methods of readily discovering fluorine in circumstances which pre
viously rendered its detection difficult.
     The   more perfect       of the two     processes   has been applied with suc
cess by Professor        Hoffmann       to the detection     of fluorine in the mine
ral waters of Harrogate            ; and Fresenius has introduced it into the
last edition of his      "
                            Qualitative Analysis."*
     The    researches     thus referred to have been chiefly published                in
the "Transactions"            of this Society, and of the British Association,
but have been       brought in part before the Chemical Society of Lon
don.      They are known in Germany, Denmark, Sweden, and Ame
rica, and have been referred to by many authors in this country.
 It  is reasonable, accordingly,          to infer that some knowledge of them
has reached      Paris   ;  and it might        have been    supposed    that they had
not altogether        escaped     the notice of M. Nickles, whose name ap
pears on the title-page of the             Journal de Pharmacxe et de Chimie,
as    editing the department of that work entitled
                                                                     " Une revue des
Travaux Chimiques publics              a   l'Etranger."
     I  bring no charge, however, against               M. Nickles.     In  these days
of multiplied monographs it would be unjust to blame any man for
 ignorance of a single series of special researches.                      Nevertheless,
seeing that       this   author's     name appears on the title-page             of the
 Journal de Pharmacie side by side with those of our Vice-President
 Dr Christison, as its Edinburgh Correspondent, and of Dr Redwood,
 the Secretary of the Cavendish Society, as its               London Correspondent,
 the countrymen of         M. Nickles, may think themselves entitled to quote

process essentially consists in heating the silicated fluoride with oil of vitriol,
and condensing the gaseous fluoride of silicon in aqueous ammonia, which after
evaporation, re-solution in water, and desiccation, yields fluoride of ammonium.
 Fresenius recommends        the addition   of " some coarse pieces of marble to insure
 a continuous slight evolution of gas ;" but I cann'-t approve of this recommen
 dation, since the constant occurence of fluorine in shells and corals implies its
  presence in limestones ; and the employment of marble for the purpose indica
 ted risks the introduction of the very element for which we are seeking.

    The following Communications            were read   : —
 1. On the   Functions of the Spinal Cord. By Professor Hughes
                                  Bennett.
    The object of Dr Bennett's communication was to unite two se
 parate kinds of research, which of late had been directed towards
 advancing our knowledge of the structure and functions of the spinal
 cord.   From   these it would,  he thought, appear, that the views con
 sidered to be so firmly established by the genius and labours            of
 Charles Bell, required great modification.       Dr Bennett then    gave a
 sketch of these views, and of the present opinions of physiologists     re
garding the functions of the spinal cord.        He indicated certain  facts
which had long been recognised as difficult of explanation in accord
ance with them. He then described the results of several experiments
by   M. Brown-Sequard      on the columns      of the cord in living ani
mals, which he himself      (Dr B.) had    witnessed,  and which satisfied
him that, on the posterior columns being cut across, increase of sen
sibility in the inferior extremities     was  the consequence, instead of
paralysis.    He also described the discoveries recently made in the
structure of the spinal cord, by Budge, Kolliker, Lockhart Clarke,
Stilling, Remack, Wagner, Van der Kolk, Schiling, Kupffner, and
especially by Owsjannikow.       He pointed out how the structural dis
coveries  threw light on the experimental       ones, and from   the whole
inquiry drew the following conclusions     : —
    1.  Although the anterior and posterior roots of the spinal nerves
may still be considered motor and sensitive, we can no longer
apply these    terms to   the   anterior  and posterior    columns of the
cord.

                                              471
      2. The fibres in these columns do not convey impressions directly
  and continuously to the brain as hitherto supposed, but enter the
  grey    matter, and       operate      through    the  ganglionic    cells  of that
  matter.
      3. That     all   so-called     reflex    movements are     carried    on   by a
  definite system       of conducting        fibres and ganglionic     cells, passing
  through    the grey matter ; in other words, they are diastaltic and
  not reflex.
      4. That the particular           fibres and cells which are necessary to
  spinal diastaltic      acts    have yet to be discovered ; so that a new
  field of inquiry is opened up to the physiological            histologist.
 2. On the       Delta of the Irrawaddy.              By T. Login, C.E., Pegu.
                  Communicated by William Swan, Esq.
      Little  is known     of the course of the Irrawaddy River          above   Ava,
 and as it is joined          by no large tributary near its mouth, its sec
 tional    area differs very little for hundreds            of miles.    At    Promo,
 a distance     of 190 miles in a direct line from the sea, the river is
 confined between two ranges of hills.                  The eastern range passes
 through     the Tharawaddy           district, separates the Irrawaddy from the
 Sittang Valley, and is lost in low undulating             hills at Rangoon.      The
 western or Aracan          range is more mountainous, and terminates in a
 bluff headland forming the right bank of the Bassein River at its
 mouth.       The plain     bounded       by these two ranges is inundated when
 the river is in      flood — so    much so, that it can be traversed in almost
any direction in small canoes.
     The Irrawaddy, like all other large rivers in India, begins to rise
in March, and attains its highest elevation in August, after which it
gradually subsides, until it is again swollen by the melting of the
snows among the hills, when it rises from 10 to 12 feet before the
setting in of the rains.                            *
     My observations       were made at        Than-ba-ya-doing in March 1855,
with as great care as circumstances would permit, to determine                     the
discharge,      velocity,     slope,   and    the  proportions   of earthy matter
suspended in the water.              It  was   found that, when the river was at
its lowest, it discharged 75,000 cubic feet per second.                   The    mean
surface velocity was 1£ miles in the hour, the slope lg inches in
the mile, and the proportion of earthy matter was ITVi Dy weight.

                                                472
     When the river is in flood its surface rises 37 feet higher than in
the dry season     ;   the discharge was estimated at 750,000 cubic feet in
the second, with a surface velocity of 5 miles in the hour, a slope of
3$ inches     in the mile, and the proportion                   of silt about TTVv            D7
weight.
     Although, however,            I had  thus obtained the extreme cases approxi
mately,    I had   no means          of determining the average discharge for the
 12 months     ;  but for my present purpose,                 I  have supposed       it to    be
350,000 cubic           feet    per second, containing jsVc- Part by weight of
earthy matter       ;    and as the clay of the delta is nearly twice the
specific gravity of water,                there      would be    60   cubic    feet    of silt
passing Than-ba-ya-doing                every second,      to form    the delta    ;   or  say
 2,000,000,000 cubic              feet annually.
     The apex of the delta, and the mouths of the Rangoon and Bas-
sein Rivers, are each about 140 miles apart, which would give an
area of 8500 square miles ; but as the delta is intersected by creeks,
 the dry land may be 7500 square miles. For the sake of calculation,
 I  have supposed the           silt  to be evenly deposited to a distance              of 25
 miles out at sea off the mouths of the river, and that each                           annual
 stratum is five times the thickness of the deposits on the dry land of
 the delta.      By the         above     approximate       data, which    I trust     will    be
 found hereafter         to differ not very widely from the             truth, the follow
 ing is obtained      : —
      (140 x 25    + '«••) x         (5280)
                                                2  = 139,392,000,000 square           feet  ;
 or say an area of 140,000,000,000                        square feet to be covered by
 2,000,000,000 cubic             feet of   silt  :  thus, each cubic foot would have to
 cover 70 square feet at sea, and 350 square feet on the delta, or the
 sea would become            Jth of an     inch shallower every year, and the land
 would be raised         3' ffth of an inch.        The delta, however, must be 6 feet
 higher   at the  Rangoon           mouth   of   the  river than at the Bassein mouth,
 as the tide rises 21 feet at the former point and only 9 feet at the lat
 ter.   Again,   as correctly as         I could learn, the tidal wave      is not sensibly
 felt higher     up than          35 miles below Than-ba-ya-doing in the dry
 season  ; and, in the rains, it only reaches a point 95 miles lower down,
  as measured along the course               of the stream.        I could thus approxi
  mately find the level of Than-ba-ya-doing to be 40 feet above high
  tide, and the slope of the river 3| inches.

                                               473
   Supposing,        therefore,        my calculations            to   be    correct,     and       not
taking    into account theeffects of vegetation, it must have taken
14,400 years to raise the head of the delta above high tide to its
present level.        If     to this     be    added       the probable          time it took to
raise    the beds of the ocean                above     high water, even with such                      a
powerful agent at work as the Irrawaddy, ages on ages must have
elapsed    since this     silting up     process            From the great depths
                                                       began.
of the river, and its liability to             change its course, relics of man, and
bones     of existing animals, may hereafter                      be found even more than
100 feet below the sea, at different                       points throughout             the delta.
Caution     should therefore be observed                   in ascribing antiquity to such
relics, nor should they be considered a proof of the subsidence                                   of the
land.
   Before commencing this survey, Lieutenant Walker of the Bengal
Engineers pointed out to me the inaccuracy of                               M. Du Buat's rule
for calculating the discharge of rivers.                     I   also, while engaged on the
survey, discovered that the fundamental                          rule for finding         the mean
and bottom velocities, by the known surface                       velocity, was also inaccu
rate.     The rule    is,   where the surface velocity v               is   expressed in inches,
the bottom velocity equals               (*/v— l)1.
   But    even when the         river    was at its lowest, the bed, which consisted
of sand, could only have withstood half the velocity calculated by
this rule   ;   and when the river was             in   flood, even large boulders would
have been swept             along   by   the current.            To this fact    I      beg to draw
particular attention, for at no point did                  I     find the bed to consist of
such materials        as could withstand              the calculated velocity            ;   but the
nature of the bed always varied according to the depth and surface
velocity.   Itherefore estimated the bottom velocity by the nature
of the bed,       instead of abiding             by the above rule, and found the
mean velocity, by halving the sum of the estimated bottom and known
surface velocities.           Mr Ellet,         however,         found      on    the Mississippi,
that where the river was deep,                   the velocity was always greater at
some depth below the surface than at the surface itself.
    Another      source      of error, — the      one      of all others         most   difficult for
the engineer to contend             against, —     is   the power rivers have of abrad
 ing their beds to considerable depths, and again silting them up to
 their former level while the flood               is    subsiding.
 I       have had many opportunities of observing this process                               of   scoop
 ing out the bed and again silting                    it   up, and     I     have       known      it   to

                                       474
extend to a depth of ten and a-half feet in rear of one of the works
on the Ganges Canal that was under my orders.
    In the accompanying table        I have  compared the Irrawaddy with
a few of the largest rivers.        (P. 476.)
    The discharge of the Ganges appears         to me much too     small  ;  for
I have seen    both the    Nile and the Ganges in flood, and should say
that the Ganges at Gazepoor is nearly three times the size of the
Nile.    The proportions of earthy matter vary to a great extent in
all the above-mentioned rivers.          The Ganges appears to convey the
largest proportion      of silt and the Rhine the least.
    The power of       a river   in transporting earthy matter, however,
chiefly depends on      the shape of the particles : sand, which is only
one-seventh     the specific gravity of gold, will sink much faster in
water than gold leaf.          By investigating this branch of the subject,
the power of water in motion to transport solid bodies may be dis
covered,   as the rate    of sinking of any solid body must bear some pro
portion to   the velocity of the water required to transport that body.
It   may here bo also remarked, that where there is a strong current in
the ocean, rivers cannot push out deltas into the sea            ;  and rivers
which fall into tideless seas have no trumpet-shaped mouths, nor are
they easily navigated, for even the Mississippi has only fourteen feet
water at its mouth, though it is 170 feet deep higher           up the river,
and the bar consists of soft mud.
    As  a navigable stream the       Irrawaddy is    second to few   rivers   in
the world    ; for not only are its mouths easily approached, but for
hundreds of miles up its course it has been found much more navi
gable than the Ganges.           The valley through which this noble river
flows equals,    if it does   not surpass Bengal in the richness of its soil ;
can it be doubted, therefore,         but that ere long Anglo-Saxon enter

     P.S. — On    this paper being read, Professor Forbes drew the atten
 tion of the Society to that part which related to the abrading power
 of water at different velocities ; he stated that the experiments re
ferred to were made fifty years ago by Professor Robison, his prede
cessor ; and as the subject was of considerable interest, he hoped
 some one would verify these experiments.
     Through his kindness in giving        me the use   of some of his  instru

                                       475
merits    and class-room,      along   with the assistance of      one  of his
establishment,      I am   enabled to give the few following results of ex
periments tried on brick-clay        from Portobello,    sea and fresh-water
sand, rounded pebbles about the size of peas, and common vegetable
soil.
    1.  The brick clay, in its natural moist state, had a specific gravity
of 2-05   ; and water passing over it for half an hour at a rate of
 128 feet in the minute, which was the greatest velocity I could con
 veniently obtain, made no visible impression           on the clay.    When
this clay was mixed with         water, and allowed to settle for half an
hour, it required a velocity of fifteen feet in the minute to disturb it.
This mud sank in water at         a rate of  0566 feet in    one minute, but
the very fine particles were very much longer in subsiding.
    2.  The fresh-water sand, which sank in water at          an average rate
of 10 feet in the minute,          required   a  velocity of 40 feet in the
 minute over the bed to disturb it.
    3. The    sea-sand   sank 11'707 feet in one minute, and was moved
over the bed by a velocity of 66 22 feet per minute.
    4. The rounded pebbles, about the size of peas, which sank at the
rate of 60 feet in one minute,        were rolled   over each other by a ve
locity of 120 feet in one minute.
    5. The vegetable soil, being a mixture of different kinds of par
ticles, it was difficult to determine the rate of sinking.           The very
fine   particles were     swept away by a velocity        of 2-45 feet in the
minute, and those that were disturbed           by a velocity of 33^ feet in
the minute, sank at a rate of 0-98 feet per minute only.               All the
vegetable soil was swept away when the velocity of the water over
the bed was increased to 50 feet in the minute, and the particles of
sand left, of which nearly one-half of this soil consisted, were set in
motion by this velocity.        This sand, however, only sank at a rate of
5-62 feet in    one minute.
    From the    above   it is evident that the velocity of water over the
beds   of canals, and water-courses for irrigation, unless protected by
a pebbly bed,      should never exceed      half-a-mile an hour, otherwise
the fields irrigated    will  be covered with a stratum     of sand.
   These experiments were made with water seldom exceeding half
an inch in depth, and the float was within ^ or ^ of an inch of the
bottom.      The time was measured by an instrument which indicated
tenths of seconds.

3.   Notice of a Collection of Maps.                By A. K. Johnston, Esq.
    In this paper the author reported the progress made by the commit
tee appointed to select and purchase a series          of chartagraphic works for
the library of the Royal Society, and            the means      adopted for their
arrangement       and classification.     The collection already comprises
534 separate sheets of the best existing maps, chiefly of the several
countries of Europe, but embracing the survey of India, in so far as
published.      The    maps   are placed in cases resembling          volumes, so
indexed as to admit of being indefinitely extended, and easily con
sulted.     Specimens of the different works were exhibited, and the
author presented a rapid         sketch of the progress of surveying and
mapping,     from     the sixteenth    century      to the present      time.    He
showed that modern improvement in this important branch of science
dates from the middle of the 18th century,               when, in 1750, Cassini
de   Thury, under the auspices of the French Academy of Sciences,
constructed a map of France on astronomical principles.                    In 1784
the French triangulation         was  extended to London, and formed the
basis of the trigonometrical        survey of Great Britain.          The surveys
 of Belgium, the Netherlands, Prussia, and Sardinia, have                 also been
 based on that of France.          The different methods adopted           to repre
sent relief of the surface by contour            lines    and   hill shading, were
 then referred to, and examples of the effects produced by vertical and
 oblique lights were exhibited.        It was shown that the method which
 supposes    the light to      fall vertically      on  the model,     casting    the
 shadow in      all directions, gives the        most     exact idea of the ine
 qualities   of the ground, and that it           is   adopted in nearly all the
 great survey maps now in progress.            As an example of the time         and
labour necessary to produce a good map, it was explained that in the
 great survey of France,        now nearly     completed, a single sheet          re
quires, for reduction and drawing,           at least two years, and for en
 graving, five to eight years.        Thus,   between      the termination    of the
 field-work    of the surveyor and the publication,             seven to ten years
 must necessarily elapse.         Mr Keith Johnston concluded his remarks
 by referring to the economical advantages of the electrotype process
 in reproducing copies of original plates, thus reducing the price of
 the publication    ;   and to an ingenious        application    of this   process,
 recently    adopted     at the Depot     de    la     Guerre,   Paris, by which
 erasures made in the        work, for correction, are filled up by a fresh
deposit of copper, leaving a surface ready for being re-engraved.

1. Notice respecting Father Secchi's Statical Barometer, and
 on the Origin of the Cathetometer.   By Professor Forbes.
     A    friend,     who returned            lately    from     Rome,   has     sent me some
copies     of   a pamphlet by          Father Secchi of the Collegio Romano,                    one
of which        I   lay on      the table of the Society.
     It   describes a barometer                   stated to be on a new construction.
The barometric               tube is suspended           from one arm of a balance, and
counterpoised.             It    is filled   with mercury in the usual way               ;   but the
cistern        into which         it   opens is fixed apart, and does not move with
the beam of the balance.                     It   is evident, therefore, that the varying
pressure of the air on the exterior of the tube will require a chang
ing counterpoise, and that the magnitude of the change may be
increased by enlarging the section of the tube, so that the alteration
of pressure may            be indicated with any required delicacy.
     It    is also obvious that,              to use this barometer, the tube does not
require to be transparent,                   but may, for instance, be made of iron                   ;
only the internal               section must be uniform throughout the range of
pressure.
   The idea of thus measuring barometric pressures appears so obvi
ous that it is not likely to be really new. But   had also, when I       I
read the paper, a distinct                    recollection      of having    seen   it   described
many years ago.
     After      a slight search         I    found     it,   accordingly, under the name of
the Steelyard Barometer (the tube being suspended from the shorter
arm of    steelyard, while the other points to the angular deviation
               a
on   scale), in Rees, and others of the older Encyclopaedias (as in
     a
the earlier editions of the BritannicaV in Hutton's Mathematical
Dictionary,           and in Gehler's                     But, what
                                                  Worterbuch.           singular,   is
no inventor          is   assigned to the contrivance, except in the last-named
work, whero           it   is described generally as Morland's though Hutton,;
 who      is   there cited as the authority,             says nothing of it.

                                                 481
     In Desagulier's Natural Philosophy (1763),                             an experiment with
a balance,  similar to Father Secchi's arrangement, is described and
figured, but it is not referred to as a construction available for prac
tical purposes. This might lead one to believe that the contrivance
was      more recent than Desagulier's                   time.     But, after considerable
search,        I   found, in the nineteenth volume of Rozier's Observations de
Physique (1782),                   page    346, a curious         historical      statement         by
Magellan, which refers the contrivance to                        Sir Samuel Morland, who,
it   is there stated, presented               it to Charles       II.       Magellan     does     not,
however, give his authority for this, stating, on the contrary, that he
found no mention of the contrivance in any of the authors who had
treated of the subject, but that he had seen two of these instruments.
One of them, made           by Adams in 1760, belonged to George         ;                      III.
and      I   think it possible that it may still be found amongst the in
struments of the Kew Observatory.                             The other was       made       by    the
celebrated Sisson, and came                   into   M. Magellan's          possession   ;   a care
ful figure of it is given in the work just cited. It is perhaps likely
that the ascription of it to Morland, and the story of its presenta
tion to Charles II., was a tradition among the London instrument-
makers.             It   may, however, be recorded in some of                 Sir Samuel Mor-
land's writings, which                I   have not found either in the College or the
Advocates' Library, and in which it does not appear that Magellan
had himself seen it.
     I     have as yet been unable to trace the steelyard modification                              of
the statical barometer to its origin.                     I    think it likely to        be an in
dependent invention.
     Of course           these    remarks     are not intended to infer the smallest
doubt on Father Secchi being the inventor of the instrument                                  which
he describes.                 Of that there    can be no question       ;   and the application
of   it,     which Father Secchi proposes, to the purposes of self-registra
tion, makes             ita    well-timed resuscitation of an almost forgotten                    con
trivance, which yet appears to date from the same century with                                     the
invention           of the barometer.

                                       have not succeeded in throwing
                                                     I
any further light on the true origin of the statical barometer.    On
writing            to    Mr Welsh         of the Kew Observatory,           I    find that      King
George         III.'s        curious collection of apparatus has been long dispersed.

                                           482
I  ought perhaps to add, with reference to Father Secchi's contriv
ance, that he recommends in some cases the cistern of the barometer to
be made moveable, instead of the tube.              The balance    is then disturbed
by the efflux of mercury            from the tube of the barometer when the
pressure diminishes,          and by its influx when the pressure increases.
Though      less elegant, as an application         of a principle,   it has the   ad
vantage of making the suspended mass lighter.                  It will be seen, by a
reference to Magellan's account of Sisson's instrument, that the
weight was such as to require                support on friction-rollers, instead
of knife edges.*
    Invention of       the Cathetometer.     —I    take this opportunity    of adding
a historical notice, which has occurred to me whilst making                  the pre
ceding     inquiry.       In the twentieth volume of the Philosophical
Transactions        for   1698,    Mr    Stephen    Gray described      a microscope
moving on a vertical pillar by means of a micrometer screw, to                       be
used for determining the exact variations of level of a liquid, such                 as
mercury       in  a    barometer     or thermometer,      and not necessarily     con
nected    with the apparatus.           This instrument accurately corresponds
in most respects with that known to French physicists and instru
ment-makers under the name of the Cathetometre, which                           I have
never heard ascribed to any inventor in particular,                  and which,    till
very lately, has hardly been recognised in this country.

    phuric Acid and Water.                 By Balfour Stewart, Esq. Com
    municated by Dr G. Wilson.
    The object of this paper was to show that where sulphuric acid
combines with water, distinct reference is made to certain definite
compounds or hydrates of sulphuric acid.
   * Since this paper      was read,  I have  been  enabled to carry back the history
of  the Balance Barometer, or at least       of the experiment described by Desagu-
liers, considerably farther.      In Cotes's Lecture/ on Hydrottatia, Sc., published
by   Smith   in 1747   (but which  were delivered more than forty years previously),
the experiment      is fully detailed and explained. It is also ascribed to Wallis,
as well as an ingenious modification of it w ell adapted for the lecture table.
    April 1857.                                                            J.  D. f.

                                                  483
      The combination of these two liquids                       is attended with contraction
 of volume ; that            is,   the volume occupied by the compound                         is   less
 than the sum          of the volumes occupied by its ingredients when un-
 combined.            By means of    simple formula (assuming 1-8485 to
                                         a
 be   the specific      gravity of strong liquid sulphuric acid), we may find
 what ought to be the specific gravities         of the different strengths in
 Dr Ure's table, were no contraction                       to take place.          By this table     we
 may find the actual specific gravities of such mixtures    and dividing            ;
 the actual or observed specific gravity                      by
                                             the calculated specific gra
 vity,    and deducting            unity from the quotient,               we have the propor
 tional condensation.
      The proportional             condensation       is   greatest for strength 73 of              Dr
 Ure's table, which              is   the strength          of   a   hydrate   composed of one
 atom of     liquid acid and two atoms of water.
      But   it   is   not necessary      to suppose all the strengths of                    Dr Ure's
 table to be formed by           mixing together strong liquid acid and water                         ;
for, taking      a    certain strength as our standard, we may suppose all mix
tures stronger          than   it   to be formed            by   mixing   it   with strong acid,
and all mixtures             weaker than         it   to be        formed by mixing          it   with
water in certain proportions.
   On this hypothesis we shall                   have different calculated specific gra
vities,     and consequently, different                proportional         condensations from
those obtained when              all strengths       were viewed as composed                of strong
acid and water.
   It     was shown thatgreat range of standard strengths gives
                                    a                                                                a
maximum at 73, as before, while others indicate maximum between         a
84 and 85, denoting            a   hydrate composed of one atom of liquid acid and
one of water.           These results were made visible by                     a   curve, of which
the abcissae represented strengths, and the ordinates proportional con
densations,       and   it                of greatest elevation or de
                             was shown that points
pression, or more generally peculiarities in the curve, denoted de
finite compounds of acid and water.    By means of such      curve the                  a
following hydrates may be indicated, in addition to those already men

Ure's observations were reliable                 ;    and   a    remarkable        agreement was
found for the weaker strengths tried                  ;but in the higher strengths the
observations seemed              to show     a   constant error in Dr Ure's results,

     The constant error     supposed   to pervade    Dr Ure's determinations
of specific gravities for the higher strengths, was accounted for by
 supposing that Dr Ure must have operated with two or more differ
 ent specimens     of acid   ;  the error arising    in his determination        by
 chemical analysis      of the strength of     each, and different acids being
 used for high and        low strengths.      As   an instance   of this,  taking
 strength    90   as   our  standard,   the proportional      condensations     for
 strengths    68, 67, 66, 65, are respectively -0426, -0429, -0410,
 •0411; that for strength 66 being very much less than that for
 strength 67.       This is indicated by an abrupt fall in the curve at that
 point, after which it goes on slowly rising, just as before its fall.
     These experiments confirmed a maximum point corresponding to
 the hydrate HO, S03 + 15 HO, and showed a minimum point corre
 sponding to the hydrate        HO, SO,     + 6 HO.
     Allusion    was   made    to Professor Langberg, who, in a report to
 the British Association for 1847, has described a method of research
  somewhat similar, but giving negative results.           Professor Langberg
  expresses the specific gravity of an acid, in terms of its strength,           by
  means of an empirical          formula, the constants of which       he derives
  from Dr Ure's experiments, and, by means of this formula, he                    is
  enabled to   exhibit the proportional condensation of any strength (for
  a given standard) as a function of that strength, so that, equating
  the first differential coefficient of this function to zero, the resulting
  equation gives the position of maximum condensation.                The   points

                                       485
 so   determined do not correspond to definite compounds, probably
 because an empirical formula is used instead of the immediate re
 sults of experiment.      In conclusion, the author's results were briefly
stated    thus  :—
     1.  The points of elevation, depression, or peculiarity in the curve
of condensation, denote definite compounds, whatever be the stand
ard strength used.
    2.   The   use of varying the standard is simply to render such
points more prominent, or, in other words, to convert a point of
peculiarity into one of elevation or depression, as the case may be.

    The following Communications were read : —
    1. On the     Structure of Pedicellina.          By Prof Allman.
    The author maintained that the genus Pedicellina, notwithstand
ing the circular arrangement of its tentacula, does not properly belong
to the infundibulate Polyzoa at all, but is in reality hippocrepian ,
of which type, however,       it presents  a remarkable    modification.   The
intestine at first sight appears to terminate within the margin of a
orbicular lophophore,      and, consequently,      within the circle of ten
tacula, and thus to present a striking exception             to the admitted
plan of the Polyzoa.         It   was shown, however, that the anomaly
which thus seems to exist was only apparent, for the lophophore,
 when carefully examined, is found to be constructed on the hippo
crepian    type, with the tentacula        confined to the outer or convex
margin, and the arms of the crescent united              at their extremities
so as to enclose    a space,    around which the tentacula        will then   be
arranged in an uninterrupted         circle, and within which the intestine
opens, its termination    being thus quite normal, and properly external
to the lophophore.
    As in the ordinary hippocrepian Polyzoa,          so also here the mouth
is furnished with an epistome, which, however, is less complete than
in the others, and not provided with special muscles ; and it is more

                                      487
over highly     probable that the calyx, which constitutes a universal
feature    in the ordinary hippocrepian genera, enters here into the
composition of the peculiar        cup which    surrounds   the base of the
tentacula, and which the author believes has its homology in a per
manently inverted portion of the endocyst, united externally          to the
uninverted endocyst, and internally to the calyx and tentacula.
2.   On a Case of Lateral Refraction in the Island of Teneriffe.
                      By Professor C. Piazzi Smyth.
    In  his astronomical visit to Teneriffe last summer, the author was
instructed to inquire into the lateral oscillation of stars, as seen by
Baron    Von Humboldt in his ascent of the mountain.              During   a
month's residence on the place of the alleged observation no ap
proach   to anything of the sort     was ever noticed, although a powerful
equatorial, with a twelve-foot telescope      and high magnifying powers,
was employed to detect any       irregularity in the motions of the stars.
The author concluded, therefore, that the anomalous movements de
scribed   by Humboldt could not have         been  produced by any general
or cosmical action of the atmosphere, or of light or heat, which as
tronomers were bound to consider.
      3.    On Insect Vision and Blind Insects.             By Andrew
                                Murray, Esq.
   Mr Murray       commences    with a resurrU of what is known regard
ing the growth of eyes in insects, from the first stage in the larva,
when many are without eyes,         till their exclusion from the chrysalis,
when they usually appear well provided with compound eyes. Ho re
views the nervous system in different species, and gives some details
as to those species     which live in dark places, and which     have small
eyes and a less-developed      optic nerve, contrary to what one would at
first  suppose.     The next portion of his paper is devoted to explain
ing his views of the structure of the eye in insects, and its ro
tation to the eye in vertebrate animals.             Instead of seeking the
homologies of the parts of the eye in the vertebrata in each separate
eye tubule, or individual     part of the compound eye in insects, as has
hitherto     been   done,  he  compares     it with the entire compound
eye.     Resting   on  the microscopic researches of Kölliker, H. Miiller

                                                  488
Brucke, Hannover, Helmholtz, Goodsir, and others, into the intimate
structure of the retina, he compares its structure with the structure
of the compound eye in insects, making the filamentary layer equi
valent to what is called by Leydig the retina in insects, the rods and
cones     in the bacillary         layer to the conical bodies in the eye tubules
of insects, &c.        And        he explains the discrepancy between the rela
tive position of this structure                 in insects and in the vertebrata,                 on
the principle suggested by Brucke and Hannover,                            and worked out by
Goodsir, that the light is reflected back from the choroid or back of
the eye in the vertebrate animal, so that the animal       as   were,              is,     it
looking       backwards, and            sees   objects as reflected in        a   mirror   ;    while
in insects, he assumes that objects impinge directly on their visual
sensorium.
   The rest of       the     paper       is    occupied with an examination              of     those
insects    which are destitute of eyes in their perfect state, with par
ticulars relating to their habits and structure, and concludes with the
results of his examination of the interior structure of the integument
in the Anophthalmus Bilimekii, Schm., from which                                it   appears that
the interior texture              of the thorax         is   a series of transverse elongate
cells, similar to the cells in plants, and which                           is   known to be the
usual,    if   not the universal, structure              of the chitonous integument                in
insects   ;    the same cells are to be seen             in    the head   ;   but on the ocular
spaces where the eyes should have been,                            and which      (in Anophthal
mus) occupy large portion of the head, these cells become enlarged,
                   a
and gradually less transverse, until, towards the middle of the ocular
space, some        of them have assumed the hexagonal form usually seen
in the facets      of the compound eye in insects whence, Mr Murray ;
concluded, that            this    is    possibly an atrophied            or abortive eye, and
draws conclusions as to the manner of the development of the eye in
insects.
   Mr Murray           also considers           the question, whether these insects are
sensible of light, and             if   so, whether      it   is   through this atrophied eye
or not     ?    He supposes they are, to            a    certain extent, sensiblo of light;
but only in the same way as plants or zoophytes, and not through any
optical apparatus.

4.   On the mode in which                   Light acts on the Ultimate Nervous
     Structures of the Eye, and on the relations between Simple
     and Compound Eyes.      By Professor Goodsir.
     Since the publication in 1826, of Joh. Miiller's Vergleichmde                       Phy-
siologie des Gesichtssinnes,                Physiologists      have admitted three fun
damental       forms of the organ of vision.                1st, The eye-spot, organized
for the mere perception of light.           2d, The compound eye, in which
the picture on          the nervous surface is a mosaic. 3d, The simple eye,
in which       the retinal picture is continuous.                 The difference    between
the simple          and compound eye, as explained by                   Miiller, and since
generally admitted,  consists in this, that the formation of the pic
ture in the simple eye is the result of the convergence of all the
pencils diverging from the visible points of the object on correspond
ing points of the retina, by means of the crystalline lenticular struc
ture    of the organ         in the compound eye, the picture is
                              ;    while,
formed by the stopping off, by means of the constituent crystalline
columns    the eye, all rays except those which pass in or near the
              ofj
axes                  The extent of surface of any object, and the
        of the columns.
number of separate parts of such surface, represented on the ner
vous structure of  compound eye, will vary, therefore, in terms of
                           a
the distance of the object,                  the curvature of the superficial          ocular
surface,     the corresponding              inclination   of   the crystalline    columns to
one another,            the size of their individual              transverse sections,     and
their lengths.           The continuous retinal picture in the simple                    eye   is
psychically          interpreted      as    a   continuous     image.    If,   therefore, the
possessor of        a   compound eye perceives            a    continuous image of an ob
ject,   it   must be the result of           a   more complex psychical operation, in
virtue of which, the separate portions of the ocular mosaic picture
are psychically combined, and interpreted as a continuous whole.
     The      successive          researches of Treviranus, Gottsche,             Hannover,
Pacini,      H. Miiller,          and Kolliker, have determined the existence and
general structure             of close-set rods or columns, which                 extend be
tween the inner and outer surfaces of the retina, in the midst of the
nervous and vascular textures of that membrane.                                The outer   ex
tremities       of    these       rods present a crystalline        columnar aspect,       and
constitute,         collectively,      the external       layer    of the retina,     usually

                                               490
termed Jacob's membrane.                     The ultimate            filaments    of the       optic
nerve, after being connected in a plexiform arrangement in the gan
glionic    layer      of the retina, terminate              each      independently,       in the
more perfect portion of the retinal field, by passing into, or becoming
continuous with, the inner end or side of a rod.     Kolliker considers
these     nodes      as nervous structures,          that      is,   as   terminal portions of
the nerve-filaments          themselves, and holds that they constitute                          the
parts of the nervous structure of the                    eye on which objective light
primarily acts.
   Having myself carefully examined the structures to which                              I     have
now alluded,      I    have been able to verify the more important anato
mical details, as described            by    their discoverers, and agree with                 Kol
liker in considering the rods                 as the     primary optic apparatus.               I
cannot, however, coincide with this distinguished                 observer in holding
these rods as modified nerve filaments.                  I           hold them to be special
structures appended to the extremities                      of the ultimate            nerve fila
ments, and referable to the same category as the Pacinian bodies,
touch-corpuscles,         rods of Corti, &c.         ;   and moreover,            so    far am   I
from coinciding with         Kolliker in his speculations                 as to the    part of the
rod on which the objective light acts, that                 I        have found    myself      com
pelled, not only from the consideration of the structures themselves,
but also from the development of the eye itself, and the arrange
ments of the compound eye, to conceive the rays of light as acting
upon the retina, not as they impinge upon                      it,   or pass through      it   from
before,    but as they pass          backward        again out of the eye after re
flection from the choroid.
   The general aspect of the rods, and more especially of those por
tions termed Miillerian filaments, where they collectively amalgamate
in the limitary membrane of the retina, indicate, as     believe will be    I
generally admitted, that they consist of                 a   modification         of connective
tissue, enveloping and supporting                  the extremities            of the ultimate
nerve filaments in such          a   manner as to form special structures, which,
from their functions, may be termed photcesthetic bodies.
   That special structures are required for the initiation of action                              in
the filaments of the optic nerve by objective light, appears to be es
tablished       by   the facts, that the nervous filaments of the retina, and
the cut extremities         of   these       filaments    on     the stump        of the optic
nerve, are not affected           by   it,   although       irritation of the          same    fila
ments      by   electrical or other means produces subjective luminous phe

                                       491
nomena.       Subjective sounds may be produced by various modes                      of
irritation  ;  but actual sonant vibrations         can only excite the acoustic
filaments through the medium of the rods of Corti, or the correspond
ing terminal structures in the vestibule.               Corresponding terminal
structures are in like manner appended to the tactile,                 olfactory, and
gustatory     nerves, apparently      for a similar purpose, to provide the
necessary    conditions of the initial excitement of the nervous current
by those secondary properties of external             bodies to which the organs
of touch, taste, and smell, are related.
    When the attention of anatomists            was directed, a few years           ago,
to the structure and physiological        signification      of the columns of the
retina by the observations of          H. Miiller and Kolliker,              I   became
satisfied  that those    structures    are   not, as the latter asserted, ner
vous structures,      properly   so called,      but special structures,          of the
same    nature    as the  Pacinian    bodies    and the tactile corpuscles.            I
stated    and explained     my opinion        of   the nature      of these bodies
in a lecture on the retina delivered and reported in                  1854.       But  I
had generalized      these relations of nervous         filaments     to special ter
minal     exciting structures, still further, in the zoological lectures
which    I delivered in 1853, for my late distinguished colleague and
preceptor Professor Jameson.            I  also expounded it at considerable
length in my course of lectures last winter (1855-6).                      I  shall now
state the doctrine in general terms, not only because it is necessary
for the elucidation of the        distinctive     characters of the simple and
compound forms of eye          ; but also     because      I  am anxious to put on
record, by submitting       it to this Society,       a generalization       which   ap
pears to me of      primary importance in the general physiology of the
 nervous system.       I assume, as established, the doctrine of Du Bois
 Raymond,      that a nerve filament is capable of propagating                  the ner
 vous current    equally well in both directions         ;   and that the physical
and physiological characters of this current differ in no respect, are
 in fact identical in the so-called motor and in the so-called sensory
 filaments, whether special or common,               I also assume     as established,
 that the specific manner in which a centripetal nerve current is con
 verted at the central extremity           of the filament, that         is   to say, is
 physiologically    reflected into motor filaments, or, psychically                inter
preted as sensation, depends upon the physiological                 or psychical en
dowments of the different portions of the nervous centre with which
the filaments are connected.           These two positions being assumed,

                                           492
then,     I hold   that, although the ultimate nervous filament may have
its functional current (that is the common nervous current), excited
or initiated by electrical or other physical or chemical agencies, yet
this current can only be initiated or excited, for the special functional
purposes for which each nervous filament is provided in the economy,
by the structure          or tissue with       which     such filament is connected
peripherally.        If   so, then, not only are the              individual filaments of
the nerves of special sense provided with current-exciting                         structures
at their peripheral        extremities, by means of which alone the objects
to which they are related can initiate the nerve current ; but also cen
tripetal nerve filaments of whatever kind, are provided, in their con
nection with the] textures from which they proceed, with arrange
ments, by means           of which alone their functional                 currents can       be
initiated.
    From this point of view, every particular structure in the or
ganism from which nervous filaments proceed to the nervous centre,
may be considered with reference to the nervous system, as a peri
pheral nervous organ, — that         is,   an organ capable of exciting or ini
tiating centripetal nerve current          ;   which    is   physiologically      converted,
or psychically interpreted at the corresponding central organ, accord
ing to the special endowments of that central organ.
    After this preliminary statement,                  am in          position   from which
    can explain     the mode     in which
                                               I Iunderstand
                                                                  a
                                                                        the structure
I                                                                                           and
actions of the rods of the retina in the simple, and the columns                             in
the compound eye.
    1
    .   In   the simple eye.   —A   ray of light can only impress an ulti
mate retinal nervous filament under certain conditions.                           These con
ditions are, that     it   should impinge upon the distal extremity                    of   the
filament     in, or parallel     to, the axis      of that filament, or within                a
certain angle to that axis.
    All   rays impinging on the distal extremity of an ultimate retinal
nervous filament under the conditions stated                 I     term photogenic rays.
Rays impinging upon, or passing through, the filament in any other
direction, may be termed aphotogenic.    The distal portion of the
ultimate retinal nervous filament,         I     distinguish          as the photcesthetic
surface.
   In order that the ultimate retinal nervous                      filament      may be sub
jected to the rays of light under the required conditions of vision, its
 distal extremity or photaesthetic surface      inclosed in a peculiar
                                                             is

                                          493
 structure, consisting of a so-called rod or cone (which             I distinguish
 as the crystalline column), and its appended Miillerian filament, with
 its nuclear enlargements.         This structure constitutes      a specific kind
 of peripheral      nervous organ,       which, from its function,      I  term    a
phottesthetic body.
    A   photaesthetic   body consists of a distal segment, or dioptric por
tion, elongated, cylindrical, or club-shaped, homogeneous, transparent,
and highly refractive, usually termed the rod or cone ; and a proxi
mal segment or peduncle, with its nuclear enlargements, into which
the ultimate nervous filament passes, and within which it apparently
terminates, probably at its outer end.
    The entire aspect and arrangement of             these  photaesthetic   bodies,
their predominance over the other parts of the retina at the axial
spot   of the   eye, and    the direct continuity of their stems with the
nerve filaments at that spot, appear to me to indicate not only the
nature of their functions, but also the general             features of the mode
in which it is    effected.    It  appears to me that         the rays which act
upon the nervous filaments, must be such rays as the arrangement
permits to pass from behind, forwards in the axis of the photaesthe
tic bodies.      It has now been ascertained, that the quantity of light
reflected,    and consequently        irregularly dispersed within the         eye
ball from     the choroid, and bacillary        layer, &c. is very considerable     ;
and   it consequently    becomes a very important          question, to determine
in what manner this reflected           and   irregularly dispersed light is pre
vented from affecting        the retina.       The view which      I  have already
given of the structure         and probable mode of action of the photaes
thetic bodies, affords the       basis  of a hypothesis which meets all the
conditions of the question, and          is in full accordance with the com
parative anatomy and development of the organ of vision.                     I can
not interpret the functions of the structure of the retina as now de
termined, except by assuming that the photaesthetic columns are im
pressed not by the light as it enters the eye, or as it is more or less
irregularly reflected and dispersed in its interior, but only by those
rays which, in their passage backwards to the pupil pass along, or
nearly in the axes of the crystalline rods or columns of the photees
thetic    bodies,  so  as to reach the       photaesthetic spots     under the re
quired conditions. No confusion, therefore, can result from the mul
titude of convergent and divergent rays which pass through the
chamber of the        eye,   and through the retina.          By this   means,  the
    vol. m.                                                            2 s

                                                  494
numerous rays not necessary for vision,                                are as it were eliminated
from the operation, the eye being blind to them, and affected only
by such as are reflected backwards to the pupil along the axes of the
crystalline columns.
  2. The Crystalline Columns                         of    the Compound              Eye. — As       stated
in my lecture on the retina formerly alluded to,                                I   conceive     the crys
talline columns in the eye of the insect or crab, to act in the same
manner as the retinal rods in the spheroidal or simple eye.                                           That
they do so, may be held as established by the researches of                                      J. Miiller
on the lawsof vision in the compound                            eye.      Miiller        even    refers to
the columnar structure of the retina,                             as presenting a certain             simi
larity to the structure or arrangement of the compound eye.   F.
Leydig, in an elaborate memoir published in M tiller's Archiv in
1855, on the structure generally of the Arthropoda,                                       examines mi
nutely     the structure            of the simple               and    compound eyes,             and ar
rives at the conclusion that the crystalline                                  columns of their com
pound eyes,            as well     as    the corresponding                structures        in their so-
called simple            eyes     or ocelli,      are of the same                   nature as the so-
called     rods and            cones,    that     is,     the     photesthotic         bodies     which   I
have already described                  in the retina of the proper simple or ver
tebrate eye.            But Leydig entirely                 loses      sight of      a   fact, which      if
unexplained,            vitiates his conclusion                 as to the physiological              iden
tity of the bodies in question. In the annulose or molluscous eye,
whether in its so-called simple or compound form, the crystalline
columns are directed like the tubes of so many telescopes towards
the object, the corresponding nervous filaments passing to them from
behind     ;    whereas the crystalline                 rods of the vertebrate retina are
directed away from the object, that                         is,    towards the back of the eye
— are in contact in fact with the choroid, while their nervous fila
ments are connected               to them       in front, that          is,   between them and the
object.
   On the other hand,               if  I   am correct in holding that the vertebrate
eye   is   acted upon by those rays only which are                                   reflected    from its
choroidal           surface,
                          I       have not only explained physiologically                          why its
retinal        columns are reversed              ;   but   I      am legitimately           entitled, as
Leydig    not, to consider them as the homologues of the crystalline
               is
columns of the annulose and molluscous eye.
   But the teleological explanation                         of the opposite arrangement                   of
the corresponding structures in the vertebrate and invertebrate
                                                                eye,

                                                495
 is,   in   the present phase        of the science, insufficient.               The difference
must be explained morphologically.                      This explanation          is   afforded by
the different modes in which the vertebrate and invertebrate, that                                 is,
the simple and compound eyes are developed.
       In   the compound eye the primordial ocular papilla or convexity,
which       is   only slightly protuberant, has its cutaneous or superficial
surface      immediately converted into the crystalline                        columnar     struc
ture, the individual          columns of which are connected with the fila
ments       of the subjacent optic nerve.               The columns are all therefore
directed to the object.
   The primordial cerebro-cutaneous spheroidal protuberance or pa
pilla of the simple refracting or vertebrate eye, speedily hollowed      is
out    in front by the development in or upon                      it    of the lens and          vi
treous       humour,       so that   from   a   spheroidal     convex surface the pri
mordial protuberance assumes the form of                      a   cup, with its mouth di
rected forwards, and its cavity occupied by the refracting                               media of
the organ.          This cup-shaped         mass   is   the retina   ;   the crystalline rods
are not developed on its concave                 surface, but on its outer or convex
surface,      as they exist on the convexity               of the compound         eye, that       is,
in   the direction of the radii of the sphere, but directed backwards,
on account         of   the nearly spheroidal surface.
     In conclusion,      I    may state, what appears to be the physiological
superiority of the simple over the compound eye.                          As the simple        eye
is   acted on by reflected light only,                it   cannot be disturbed            by rays
not required    for the definition of the image. It                       is   also arranged so
as     to admit of    much more delicate or minute
                         a                                               mosaic        representa
tion of the object, from its microscopic and reversed photaesthetic
bodies being in contact with the reflecting choroidal surface on which
that image         is   formed.      It   moreover combines the advantages of the
continuous image, formed by the lenticular structures and the mosaic
image,       which results from its crystalline rods.

1846, athwart the shoulder of Arthur's Seat           above   Samson's Ribs,
for the formation of the Queen's Drive, the rock          was found hollowed
in a trough -form for a space of about eighty yards,           and   smoothed
and striated in the manner of a glacier-bed of the         Alps.    The  striae
were in      the direction   of the hollow,    pointing  to east   20° south.
The whole      was covered over   with   a brown tenacious clay, containing
fragments of rocks of the district, along with some supposed to have

                                      498
 come from a distance.        The phenomena were carefully          observed at
 the time, and reported on to this Society by our associate           Mr  David
 Milne (now Mr Milne-Home).
    The formation of a road to Duddingston along the south side of
 Arthur's Seat has, during the first three months of this year,
 revealed a set of phenomena precisely similar in character,             at the
 well-known    pass of   Windygowl, through which it was necessary to
 make a deep    cutting.    This pass, it may be remarked, was simply
a low point or breach     in the crest of an upturned      bed  of porphyritic
greenstone    which comes prominently       out to the south in the form
of what is called the Girnel Crag, and          on the other side loses itself
in the mass of the hill, the dip being to the north-east.            When    the
surface matter was taken off at this place, a tenacious             brown clay
was disclosed, very much       like that which had formed the covering
 of the smoothed rocks above Samson's Ribs.                 When this was
 removed, the upturned edges of the greenstone bed were laid bare ;
 basseting of course towards the south-west ; and all were found to
be rounded, smoothed, and striated,           the striae  lying in nearly     an
east and     west  direction.    The rocky outline formed an irregular
hollow,    of which about six feet was thus worn, being the portion
heretofore covered with clay, while about thirty feet more was com
posed   of the rough weather-worn cliffs of the Girnel Crag on the
one    hand and the hill-side on the other.              The only difference
between     the hollow    here laid bare and that formerly exposed at
Samson's Ribs,       was  that the rocks were less worn down.            There
was not here,     as in the other case,   a complete trough        with smooth
sides or walls, and every longitudinal       chink worn, as    I  remember to
have observed, down to the bottom, as       if  by some searching —    I might
say   insinuating  — agent.      We only  saw a rude hollow,       whose   irre
gularities had been partially ground down —the same                 work, as it
were, half done.      There was not, however, a single prominent face
of rock within the hollow which did not show more or less of round
ing, smoothing, and streaking.         It is worthy    of remark that these
appearances were not confined to the immediate gorge cut in the
Girnel Crag, which was not more than ten yards in extent, but
were partially observed       on  prominent    surfaces of the hill-side for
fully fifty yards   to the westward.
    Immediately     to the east of the gorge, the cutting, though descend
ing at  a  rapid angle towards the lake, did not reach          the rock.     It

                                           499
   presented, however, a deep section of superficial matters.              First  was
  the compact blue or boulder            clay containing      small stones.    Next
  was a rough brown clay       drift, containing large boulders, all rounded,
  and many of them smoothed and scratched.                  Over this lay a bed of
  tolerably pure sand, and over all was a thick deposit of debris from
  the hill-side, including     many large       angular masses.       The boulders
  in the clay beds have been reported on as from the rocks of the dis
  trict.     One which lay in the brown drift just beyond the gorge, to
  the eastward, was a square mass of arenaceous limestone, probably
  from a bed in the hill-side      little more than      a hundred      yards to the
  westward.      It  was three feet long by twenty inches broad, and was
  split up by the workmen into six slabs, exposing              a multitude   of the
  characteristic conchifers of the formation to which the bed belongs,
  besides a few vegetable      remains, apparently calamites.             What   was
  very remarkable,      this block bore     the glacial    dressing with striae on
  two sides crossing the planes of stratification,             and further seemed
  partially water-worn      on one   of its  ends.
      It  is important to remark that the boulders were all of eastward
  transport,    and in perfect accordance         with this fact was that of the
  deep section    of superficial   matters being presented to the eastward
  of the gorge.       A precisely similar deposit being found to the east
  of the Loch Crag, between Windygowl and Duddingston, we may
 fairly conclude that the westward side of these prominent masses
 was the stoss seite      or exposed      side,  and the eastward the lee side,
 with regard     to the movement of the           agent by which the attrition
 was produced.
     The operations for the        new road     within the garden      to the north
 of Duddingston        Church    have since     laid bare a sloping face of ex
ceedingly hard greenstone, which had been only covered with a thin
 bed of vegetable soil.          I  am    assured that      this face, though not
 smoothed or marked with stria;, was dressed and channeled in much
 the same manner as the well-known                 surfaces on the west slope
 of the Costorphine Hill, which were first described by Sir James
Hall.
     It  is worthy  of notice that the smoothed hollow            above   Samson's
Ribs     was 385 feet above the level        of  the  sea.     The ice-worn     pass
at Windygowl        is about 180 feet above the sea.
     Glacially-marked      surfaces have      within the last      few   years been
laid bare at three other      places   in this group of hills.

                                               500
     The most remarkable              was    at the north            foot of   Arthur's      Seat,
close beneath           the line of the North British Railway, and within the
precincts of the St Margaret's                 Station.         It    was a swelling piece of
surface, fully thirty feet each way, and all beautifully                          polished     and
scratched, the striae pointing to             E. 15° N. Many greenstone boulders
of large       size,     generally with flattened and polished                   soles, marked
with striae in the line of greatest length, were taken out of the clay-
drift which overlay this surface.
   About two years ago, the officers of                   H. M.        Office of Works were
good     enough, at my request, to lay bare a few yards of the surface
of the trap-bed near the summit of Salisbury Crags.                               The    exposed
space was found to be worn down into a smooth slope,                              with shallow
channelings            and deeply cut striae in the line of the inclination, £.
15°     N.     Many of          these striae could be traced for one or two yards                    ;
and throughout a space of fifty feet along the summit of the hill,
they were all of uniform character.                  The cliff has here          been quarried
away, so as to form a deep sinus, and, as the lines go up to the pre
sent verge, it is of course to be presumed that they had originally
gone much farther.
     What      is,   however, most remarkable             in this instance,        is   the clear
presence       of   a   system of cross scratching, of posterior date, and quite
as evidently the result of natural causes.                      These scratches are gene
rally   less    than      one    foot long, and only impressed on the swelling
interspaces between the channelings already described.               They point
to   E. 20° S., being            a   difference of 35° from the direction of the
earlier and more general striation.                  It   is   worthy of remark, that the
summit of Arthur's Seat lies pretty nearly in the centre of the sepa
rating lines.
     Professor Fleming having some years ago observed some glacial
markings on the verge of a projecting piece of rock, at                          a   spot called
the Egir Pond,             about 150 feet above St Anthony's Chapel,                     I    had
an exposure made there, by favour of the Government Officers, to the
extent of two or three yards.                This surface       is    flattened, polished, and
marked with striae pointing to E. 15° N.
  The Egg Pond,       may be further remarked,
                            it                                            beside which        this
smoothed surface           is   presented,   is   a now dry hollow,            forming part of
a little narrow valley which here indents for 150 yards the haunch
of the hill.   It     circumstance not without its significance, that
                          is
                          a
this little valley or trough lies in precisely the same direction

                                         501
  as the striae of the smoothed       rock.    There is a hollow precisely simi
  lar immediately under the summit of Arthur's                   Seat, to the north,
  with a ridge of equal length forming its boundary in that direction.
  This valley and this ridge lie in the             same    line, namely, pointing
  to  E. 15° N.
      On the north haunch of Arthur's Seat there are many exposed
  trap surfaces of a rounded form, but much weathered, and sometimes
 greatly shattered.        These may be considered as roches moutonniet in
 a state of extreme decay.
      I  have    only to remind the Society of what          Mr Maclaren pointed
 out many years ago, that fragments of the trap of Salisbury Crags
 are scattered over the back of that hill, and in some instances have
  been    transported across the valley, and placed higher on Arthur's
  Seat than any part of the parent hill now is.             One has settled a little
 above     the hollow just described as existing             under the summit         of
 Arthur's Seat.          From the very hard greenstone, again, which               con
 stitutes the      south haunch of the Lion, large blocks are carried             east
 ward along the slope of the        hill to the extremity       of the park in that
 direction.
      It  will   be observed,  that amongst the whole phenomena, old and
  new, there are some remarkable harmonies. All the drifted matters
 have been carried eastward.          The prominences are all abrupt towards
 the west, while to the eastward they are tailed away, affording on
 that side shelter to accumulations of loose matter.              The   striae in four
 exposed       surfaces of the two hills, and two remarkable              troughs or
 hollows on Arthur's Seat, are coincident in direction, namely, between
 W. 15° S.        and E.  15° N., being precisely the direction in which the
 striae in numberless other places throughout this district, and                all the
 longitudinally-shaped        hills and hollows       also,  are disposed.       Over
 looking the somewhat discrepant direction of the hollow over Samson's
 Ribs, — for which       some accidental cause may be speculated            on, —this
 uniformity       in the phenomena may        be said to speak      strongly for the
 deep     ice-current,    which   I have    long upheld as necessarily to be
 assumed,       to account  for a large class of appearances         in Scotland,    as
 I believe     also in Scandinavia and in      North America.
     I have already pointed out, however,          that ice has operated in more
 ways than one in our country.*            The   traces of a later glacial system
    *  Reference is made to a paper which I had the honour to read to the Society
in December 1852, and which is published in Jameson's Journal for April 1853.

—a    system    of local subaerial glaciers — are abundant throughout all
the alpine grounds of Scotland, as well as those of Cumberland                    and
Wales.       By   these the boulder clay     — the     result of the original     and
general ice-work — has been swept out of many valleys, and ordinary
moraine detritus left in its stead in more partial situations.                One of
the   most notable memorials of local glaciers in our island                    is the
curving ridge of detritus forming the dam which retains a mountain
lake.       Examples     are   to be seen at    Lochs Whorral        and Brandy      on
the eastern skirts of the Grampians,              at Loch Skene in Dumfries
shire, and     Llyn Idwal in Wales.           In   many places, a north-looking
sinus in a mountain has such a curving ridge of detritus girdling it
in front, without any lake.           Keeping in view      these objects, of which
I   have now seen a considerable number,             I am    inclined to think     that
the valley between        Arthur's Seat and Salisbury Crags has been the
seat   of  a glacier, and that its moraine is still to be seen at the lower
end,     near the bleaching-green.          There     is certainly    at that   spot a
broad agger of detrital           matter, including      many rough      blocks, and
which has all the appearance of having once confined a lake, the               breach
by which the water was discharged being still                   visible.   That     this
lake existed     so  lately  as  the reign of Mary is tolerably well        evidenced
by a passage       in Marjoribanks' Annals, where it is stated that, at
the marriage of Lord Fleming to the daughter of Lord Ross, in May
 1564, " the banquet was made in the park of Holy rood House,
under      Arthur's     Seat,    at the end    of   the loch, the Queen's grace
 being    present," — this      description  being scarcely applicable         to any
 other place.       It may be considered as favourable to this view of               the
former condition of the Hunter's Bog, that very few blocks lie there,
in comparison with the multitudes which are scattered over the moun
tain sides.                            I
                 In other papers have proved that the system of local
and subaerial glaciers was preceded as well as followed by a submer
 sion  ;  from which it may be inferred          that it was a period       of   eleva
tion, — perhaps of       such elevation as to bring the higher            grounds of
 our island within the        snow-line, — being all     that was required to pro
duce the phenomena to be accounted              for.

  2. On a      Dynamical Top, for exhibiting the Phenomena of
     the Motion of a System of invariable form about a Fixed
     Point ; with some suggestions as to the Earth's Motion.
     By Professor Clerk Maxwell.
     The   top is an instrument          similar to that exhibited by the author
 at the meeting of the British Association                 in 1856.     It  differs from
 it in being of smaller        size   and entirely of brass, except the ends            of
 the axle    ; and in having six horizontal              adjusting   screws and three
 vertical ones, instead of four of each kind.
     It  consists of a hollow cone, with a heavy ring round the base, and
 an axle, terminating        in a steel     point, screwing through          the vertex.
 In   the ring are the nine adjusting screws, and on the axle is a heavy
 bob, which may be fixed at any height.
     By   means of these adjustments the centre of gravity of the whole
 is made to coincide with           the   steel   point, and the axle of the top is
 made one      of the principal       axes  of the central ellipsoid.
     The whole theory of the spinning of such a system about its cen
 tre of gravity depends on the form of Poinsot's ellipsoid correspond
 ing to the particular arrangement of the screws.                  The  top is intended
 to   exhibit   those    cases    in which the three axes of this ellipsoid are
 nearly equal.        In   these     cases   the instantaneous axis         is never far
 from the normal to the invariable plane, which we may call the in
 variable axis.       This axis     is fixed    in space, but not in the body        ; for
 it describes,   with respect to the body, a cone of the second order,
whose axis is either the greatest or the least                of the principal    axes  of
inertia.
    To    observe   the path of the invariable axis in the rapidly revolving
body, we must have the means of recognizing the part of the body
through which it passes at any time.                      For this  purpose     a disc  of
card is placed near the upper end of the axle.                    The four quadrants
of this disc are painted red, yellow, green, and blue, and various other
marks are added        ;  so  that by observing the colour of the spot which
appears the centre of motion, and the diameter of the coloured spot,
the position of the invariable axis in the body at any instant may be
known, and its path traced out.
    This path     is a conic section, whose centre is in the            principal axis.
If that    axis be the greatest or least,            it is an ellipse    with its major

                                         504
  axis parallel to the mean axis.         If  the axle of the top be the      mean
  axis, the path is an hyperbola as projected on the disc.
      When the axle is the axis of greatest inertia, the direction of           mo
  tion in the ellipse is the same       as the direction     of rotation.    When
  it is  the axis of least  inertia these directions    are opposite.     All these
  results may be deduced from Poinsot's theory, and verified by              means
  of the coloured disc.
     The theory of precession may            be illustrated    by this top in   the
  way pointed out by       Mr Elliot,   by bringing the centre of gravity         to
  a point a little below or above the point of support.
     The theory and experiments         with the     top suggest   the question —
  Does the earth revolve accurately about a principal axis              ?    If not,
 then a change of the position of the axis will take place, not in space,
  but with respect to the earth, so that the apparent positions of stars
 with respect to the pole will remain the same, but the latitude                   of
 every place will undergo a periodic variation, whose period is               about
  325 days.      To detect this variation, the observations of Polaris          with
 the    Greenwich     transit circle for four years have been examined.
 There appeared some doubtful indications of a variation not exceed
 ing half a second.        A more extensive investigation would be re
 quired to determine        accurately   the period, and the epoch of maxi
 mum latitude        at a given observatory,       which    must depend on       the
 longitude of the station, as the pole of the
                                                       " invariable"   axis travels
 round the mean axis from west to east.
3. On the true          Signification of certain Reproductive Pheno
                 mena in the Polyzoa.            By Dr Allman.
     When the reproductive phenomena of Alcyonella,                 as  manifested
both in gemmation and true generation,               are viewed in their proper
sequence,     they will be found to present a series of acts which admit
of  an obvious comparison         with the    class   of phenomena      commonly
known as the        " alternation of generations."
    From the fecundated ovum an embryo              is produced in the ordinary
way after the segmentation          of the vitellus.      In  this embryo, which
presents at first the form of a locomotive ciliated sac, sexual organs
are never directly developed,        but there are produced within it by            a
process    of gemmation the following          series   of zooids.     1.  A   poly-
pide, which,     like the containing      sac,   is essentially nonsexual, and
which is eminently organized for the functions              of digestion.     2.   A

peculiar bud, at first undistinguishable                from the polypide-bud, but
which never develops digestive organs, and is soon seen to be filled
with proper ova, each with its germinal vesicle and germinal spot.
This body, may, in accordance with common usage, be called the
ovary of the zooid from which it is developed, but since it is pro
duced from this zooid           in the manner of a bud, exactly            as the poly
pide     is,   it   may itself be fairly viewed as   a    unisexual zooid, in which
the whole organization becomes subservient to the reproductive func
tion,     while all the other functions          and their special organs become
masked and suppressed               by   the dominant      development of the or
ganization           destined for generation.      3.   Another unisexual       bud de
veloped upon the polypide, endowed               with a male function and com
monly called the testis, but truly           a   distinct zooid, with its whole or
ganization          rendered subservient, as in the ovary bud, to generation.
4.   Anonsexual bud of peculiar form (the statoblast) also developed
from the polypide.
  The esential features in the reproductive phenomena just enu
merated, present themselves in an indefinitely repeated series, where
the first and last terms of each cycle consist in              a   fecundated ovum,
and the intermediate terms in a succession                of gemmae.

                              Ancient British Pottery.
   The specimen of this pottery was found last spring (1856) on the
property of William Stirling, Esq. of Keir, along with the remains
of   a   human skeleton, and so broken into fragments                  as to be   of no
archaeological value
  The clay, or rather loam, from which this pottery had                     been made
had evidently undergone little or no previous preparation                  ;   the frag
ments were brittle, and had not been highly                  fired; — in   this respect
being inferior          to the pottery of the Ojibbeway Indians about to be
described.           The fractured edges of the pieces presented two layers,
the outside one of          a   dun hue, the inner black      ;   but neither of the
surfaces was glazed.              Its brittleness rendered this pottery easily
reduced to powder, which had             a   uniform olive-brown colour.

   The specimen of this ware which        I examined, in general appear
ance very much resembled the Ancient British Pottery, being like it
made    of unprepared    clay, marked on one of its surfaces by               lines
forming part of some simple design.         In colour, the surfaces of this
ware were whity-brown.        The section of     the fragments presented          a
black appearance, almost as       if  the   clay previous to         firing     had
been mixed     with some carbonaceous       substance.       It  was, however,
better fired than the British ware, and rung to some extent                  when
two pieces were struck together.

   This pottery has already     been   analysed more than once, and             my
analysis was only confirmatory      of those already published. It          would
appear    that in  many of those pottery clays peroxide of iron can to
a very great extent replace alumina, for, in the
                                                             specimen      I  ana

lysed, the oxide of iron is in greater quantity than the alumina; while
 in all the analyses of this pottery           I  have  seen,    the alumina is the
 greater.
    The     specimen     of this ware which       I analysed was     procured from
the Museum of the Society of Antiquaries, Edinburgh.
    After the analysis of the            mass    of this pottery    was   finished, I
 scraped several of the pieces         at my disposal, so as to ascertain the
 composition of the glaze of this beautiful ware.              I could only procure
                           .....

 circumstance        already noticed about this pottery,           namely, that its

      6.   Theory of Linear Vibrations. Part VI.                      Alligated
                         Vibrations.      By Edward Sang.
    This part of the paper contains an inquiry into the action of                   a
 vibrating body upon a linear           elastic series,  as representative of the
 action of a sound-emitting substance             upon the air.
     It   results that when one end of a linear elastic series is attached
 to an oscillating substance,        all the internal oscillations of which the
 system is capable         when one end of it is fixed, are called into exist
 ence   ;  the number of these being equal to the number of the ele
 ments in the system, and their periodic times being mutually incom
 mensurable       ; and that to these is added another, isochronous and
 synchronous with that of the oscillating substance.
    The investigation         shows   that the whole of these oscillations are
instantaneously communicated to the system,                  and that the state of
repose in which         it was  at first is merely that phase        of the general
motion in which all the parts but one have their velocities simul
taneously zero.

                                     508
    On account of the incommensurability          of the times,   no periodic
return of this or of any other phase can take place, and thus the for
 mation of waves      or pulsations   in a perfectly elastic uniform linear
series is impossible ; so   that this line of inquiry also fails to give any
indications    of the velocity with which a vibratory impulse is         con
veyed    from one end of such a series to the other end.
   When the periodic time of the oscillating body is exactly equal to
that of any of the internal oscillations of the system, the extent aug
ments indefinitely      with the time during which the action is con
tinued    ; a result which would imply that the loudness of a sound
should increase with its duration.
   The attempt      to pass  from a discrete to a concrete system by the
method of infinitesimals fails, because by augmenting the number of
the parts, we also augment       the number    of the equations of condi
tion, not one of which can be omitted without vitiating the result.
   The general conclusions are these : — That the observed pheno
mena of sound are inconsistent with the supposition of a perfectly
elastic vibratory medium,       and that either the viscidity, or some     as
yet unknown quality of the air, has to do essentially         with the pro
duction of those phenomena, so that any analysis in the present state
of our preparatory knowledge must be futile. And that the un-
dulatory theory of light is altogether conjectural, since far from
knowing how one supposed wave          would influence another, we do not
yet know anything of the manner in which such waves can be formed
at all.
