                    1.  Chairman's Opening Address.
    It  is my privilege to welcome you at the commencement              of this
 new Session, which, from many indications, promises             to he one of
 great activity among the Fellows of the Society.
    Since the close of last Session our esteemed President,        Mr Thomas
 Stevenson,    has placed his resignation      in the hands of    the Council,
 and, although asked to reconsider        his decision,  he urged, after con
 sultation with his physician, that, on account of his failing health,
he could not continue to hold a post, the             duties connected     with
 which he was quite unable efficiently to discharge.            I feel sure the
Fellows will join with me in hoping that         Mr   Stevenson   may soon be
blessed    with a return of good health, and that he may long continue
to be a contributor to the work of the Society.
    Our new President, Sir William Thomson, is not a stranger to the
office ; when he last occupied         the Presidential chair he conferred
many lasting benefits on the Society, and his re-election          augurs  well
for the future.
    The vote recently taken among the Fellows, with reference                 to
the proposal to      change   the hour of the ordinary meetings          of the
Society, has resulted in a majority for the usual hour of meeting
being retained.      Still,  as there   was a large   minority   in favour of
some change, the Council        will  most   probably arrange to hold some
meetings at four o'clock in the afternoon during the present Session.
   Whether we look at the membership of the Society, the extent
and value of its publications, or the general activity of the members
with reference     to scientific investigations, we have     every reason     to
congratulate    ourselves   on its prosperous     condition, and to cherish
the notion that the Society has entered on the second century of its
existence   with a vigour and prospect of usefulness unknown even at
any   previous period of its career.       This very    prosperity, however,
brings with it new duties and responsibilities.            Some new matters

of vital importance to the welfare of the Society are now forced on
the consideration of the Council and Fellows                                :   it   is to some of these
that       I   propose to refer this evening.
      The membership of the Society, including Foreign and Honorary
Fellows, numbers at present 507, which is just about the strength
of the Royal Society of London.                          The number of ordinary Fellows
is,   however, increasing at               a   somewhat rapid rate, and                 it
                                                                                        is    freely dis.
cussed, both among the Fellows                          and in the Council,                whether the
time has not arrived when only                      a   limited number of Fellows should
be     elected          each     year — after
                                       ;            the manner of the election to                        the
fellowship          of     the     Royal       Society of London                     and some foreign
societies.
      At       present, when       a   candidate    is   proposed       by four or more Fellows,
the application remains for several weeks under the consideration of
the Council, and thereafter,                   if   the Council be of opinion                   that the
candidate         is.   likely   to be a useful         member         of the Society, he           is   re
commended               to the Fellows         for election.           It   would be      a   mistake to
suppose that            all the    names submitted to the Council are, as                      a   matter
of    course, recommended                  for election   ;   it   not unfrequently             happens
that        names       are withdrawn           while under the consideration of the
Council, and some never pass the Council.
 I         have no hesitation in saying that              I    believe          it   would be   a   great
mistake to depart from thi3 method of election,                                      which has worked
so well in the past, and has secured as Fellows                                 of    the Society repre
sentative men of all social positions, and from every department of
human activity and effort.
      "Why should we seek to limit the membership?                                      Every energetic
scientific man, and every man who                        is   able and willing to assist in
any way in the discovery of new facts, new principles, new pro
cesses, new knowledge,                  is a   new strength to the Society, and should
be welcomed.               If    thirty or forty such men become                          candidates      in
each year, let us have them all as Fellows                         ;   the day has passed when
it   is    possible to number the elect either in science or literature                            !
      If   we were to adopt the system of selecting                         a   definite number from
the candidates of each                     year — this   means the placing of these can
didates in   sort of competition with each other for the vacancies,
                   a
a most objectionable thing among grown-up men- — we place     very                                 a
                                    —

  satisfaction would follow, however carefully the selection he made                       ;
  some men who would be most desirable                  Fellows would be prevented
  from ever becoming candidates,               and   offence   would be given to the
  unsuccessful,       whose     names    would ever afterwards be pilloried in
  the Proceedings of our Society.                A   less objectionable plan would
  be for the Council to invite a certain            number of representative         men
  to become Fellows each year, but              it is doubtful if this would work
  well   so   long    as  fellowship     involves the payment of fees.             There
 seems to me nothing              to fear from an increase         in the number        of
 Fellows from year to year.              The larger the membership,            the more
 are we     likely   to be in sympathy with the rapidly increasing number
 of the general          public    who   interest themselves       in the acquisition
 of new knowledge.              We will      be all the   more    powerful when we
 approach       the Government on matters of public interest,                  and none
 the less able to give advice              in Scottish scientific     affairs.    In his
 anniversary address,         a few days ago, to the Royal Society of London,
 the President         suggests     that    that Society should be strengthened
 by the election         of  a  number of distinguished literary men.               This
 appears to be an admission that the election                of fifteen   from among
 candidates each year does not secure                   that   diversity which it is
 desirable     to   have    in   a representative       Society, and furnishes         an
 additional       argument      against     the adoption of such a method of
 election in our Society.
    One of the best evidences of the prosperity of the Society is to
 be found in the great increase in the size and value of the Society's
 publications.        If  we include       the extra volumes      on the Ben Nevis
observations        and   ou the Botany of Socotra, which will shortly be
issued to the Fellows, then the Proceedings and Transactions of the
Society during the past three years probably surpass in bulk and
importance those of any other Society in the United                      Kingdom for
the same period.           This must      be gratifying     to the Fellows, for the
money value of the publications in these years is greater than the
sums paid in annual fees.             The illustrations      for these papers have,
it is  true, been a great drain on the              funds of the Society, but the
money has been well spent.               Just   as it is the function of a Society-
like this to publish in great detail new observations                and discoveries,
which it would not pay an ordinary publisher to undertake, so
should the illustrations of these papers be kept up to a high standard

 of artistic merit.      It is too often the case that the funds of Scientific
 Societies demand that the cheapest             and not the best shall be under
 taken in the matter       of illustrations.
     I commend it      to some of the richer Fellows,            if they might not
 see   their way to giving or bequeathing to the Society               a fund from
 which the Council might draw to assist in the careful and artistic
 execution      of such illustrations      as  may be inserted in the Society's
 publications.
     The magnificent and valuable library of the Society, which                    Mr
 Gordon informs       me now approaches           to twenty thousand volumes,
 has been acquired        chiefly by obtaining the Transactions and Pro
ceedings     of the other learned         societies   in   exchange   for our own.
 Foreign societies have always paid us the compliment of placing
a   high value on the work done by our Fellows, and published by
 us.    As a consequence         we have not only the publications              of the
great academies        which     have been long established in the great
capitals and other cities of Europe and America, but contributions
have flowed into the library from the remotest                 parts of the world      :
from     Shanghai,    Hong-Kong,        Japan,    and Java in the far east,          as
well as    from our   great dependencies       and colonies of India, Australia,
and New         Zealand.     Again, we get Transactions and Proceedings
from the       far west: from Rio de Janeiro,             Buenos Ayres, Bolivia,
and Mexico, as well         as  from many rising cities and towns in the
United States and Canada.
   At every meeting of          the   Library Committee fresh proposals of
exchange      from Societies and Universities, not in scientific communi
cation    with   us, have to be considered.         As education and enlighten
ment penetrate the various countries of the world, and extend their
vital   influences to new         centres    of population, new        societies   are
formed, and,      with  the same desire for exchange           on the part of the
new societies     daily springing into life and activity, the acquisitions
of our library must go on increasing at a rapid rate, not only from
old but      from new sources.         In addition       there  are the donations
from     Fellows     and    others,   and the purchases          which   are     made
annually.        Unfortunately,     the    space   at   our disposal is now         so
limited     and inadequate that a considerable part of the                    library
cannot be referred to or consulted.             This fact cannot     be too widely
known,     in order that active     steps may be taken to provide a remedy.

6             Proceedings      of Royal Society of Edinburgh.              [dec. 6,
That remedy is not far to seek; in the new arrangements                      which
must follow the removal of the Antiquarian Museum, the Society's
library should be spread over the greater part of this noble building,
which     could not be devoted to a higher or better purpose than
accommodating,        for the behoof of the leading scientific society of
Scotland, the literature of the learned Societies of all nations, — the
accumulated records of the scientific researches of the world.
    The Council has considered         it expedient    to lay these facts regard
ing the library       before the      Board    of Manufactures,       and has    re
quested     the favourable consideration of the claims of the Society
for more space in this building.
    For  the prosecution of scientific        investigations    the Transactions
and Proceedings of learned societies              are not only    invaluable, but
indispensable.        They fulfil the twofold         purpose of showing what
has been accomplished          in each department of science, and of serving
as starting points, on our part, of new advances             into the unknown.
    Mere scientific compilations,         as distinguished from monographs,
however useful to the student, are comparatively of little service
 to the investigator who is striving to extend the boundaries                of his
 science  ;  and  it may   be affirmed that many original researches, which
 have conferred much honour on this Society, could not have been
 successfully prosecuted        without   the   aid derived from the literature
 received    from similar institutions        showing what had most recently
 been done      in  the  same     departments by workers in other parts of
 the world.
     It could be wished that the funds at the disposal of the Society
 would permit of the acquisition of the records of scientific voyages,
 which embody valuable original observations and investigations,                  as
 well as numerous special monographs.                Meanwhile,    it is gratifying
  to know      that among the large and varied collection of memoirs
 existing in this library, there are some which were searched for in
  vain in the greatest of the metropolitan lihraries, although that is
 annually supported by large Government grants.
     Let  me give an      illustration   of the value of this Society and, its
 library to the community.
     When     some six     years   ago  I  succeeded     to the direction of the
 work connected       with the publication of        the scientific results of the
  " Challenger    "
                     Expedition,     there was then no reason why the work

 should be continued in Edinburgh,              and    I  was ou the         point of re
 commending        the Government         to   transfer      the   office    to  London,
 chiefly on account of the difficulty           connected       with the      access to a
fully equipped scientific library. Had the recommendation been
made it would, without much doubt, have been adopted.                                It was
not made, because        I was   assured by the Council of this Society that
every facility would be given, to me, my assistants, and strangers
who might       be  engaged on
                                    " Challenger     "
                                                         work, for consultation of
 books in the Royal Society library, and at the same time the Univer
sity conferred certain privileges of a somewhat                similar kind.
    I  suppose    it is not altogether       a matter of indifference to Scots
 men    to know that the work connected                with     the largest     scientific
 publication     ever   issued    by any country or           age,   has been       chiefly
 carried out in Edinburgh,         or that Edinburgh would have liked it to
 be said that> having        once been commenced            here,   it  was impossible
 to carry it on in this city.       But over    and above the mere sentimental
aspect of the matter, the retention of the "Challenger"                  Office  in Edin
burgh has been a distinct material advantage                     to the      country, for
the work which has been given to printers, binders, lithographers,
 artists, wood engravers,         and others,    represents       the expenditure of
many thousands of pounds annually.                   Then, there is the indirect
advantage of having many scientific men from abroad coming and
carrying on work here for short periods of time, and                    I   am bound to
say some of them would have remained much longer had the library
facilities been better.       Again, some special industries, such as litho
graphy, have in consequence            been greatly developed             in our midst.
When      the  " Challenger    "
                                  work was first commenced, it was believed
to be impossible to have the finest          kind of lithographic and             engrav
ing work done in the United Kingdom; some authors even stipulated
that their illustrations      should be done abroad.              But now this litho
graphic work can be done as well here              as   anywhere in the world,            if
not better    ;  and  I   frequently receive     from abroad requests             to have
this kind of work undertaken by Edinburgh firms.                       It  seems to me,
then, that anything         that can be done to increase            the    completeness
or accessibility of the      Royal Society library is         to be regarded, not as
a favour conferred upon a small body of savants, but as a direct
boon to the city and the country of which                it is the metropolis.
   A   Society like     ours has a very special interest in seeing                 a  truly

complete      national library established in Scotland, for to scientific
and literary        investigators such a library             is the most important
instrument of research.            We must all of         us rejoice that there is to
be a Free      Library in Edinburgh,          and    it is  to be hoped that     it will
be established so as to give the public                  the freest    possible access
to all the ordinary standard works               and current literature.        It   may
even be hoped that the directors of the institution                    will be able    to
specialise     to some extent in the reference             library, so as to embrace
works not now to be had in Edinburgh.
     It   must be remembered,          however, that this Free Library will
mainly be a duplication            of books already in Edinburgh libraries.
It    in no way solves the question of a National                    Scottish Library,
 which is the great desideratum          for all engaged in the study of science
and literature.
     There is a great wealth of libraries in Edinburgh,                but they   are  to
 a large extent inaccessible       from want of room or from the antiquated
 machinery connected           with their proper consultation.               There is a
 popular belief that the Advocates' Library contains every English
 book.       As   a matter    of fact, it  is very defective       in the literature of
 some periods      ;  it lacks many important provincial publications, and
 is of course     very deficient in Indian, Colonial, and American works,
 which are every          year becoming more           important.      There are rela
 tively few foreign works in the Advocates' Library, and were it not
  for the excellent series of foreign treatises in the University Library,
 Edinburgh would           be very poorly supplied         in this  respect.
      If I  wish to consult all the authorities who have described                    the
  ice of the Antarctic        regions,  I can     find only some of the books           in
  Edinburgh.         If I   wish to consult the original authorities who have
  described     the desert of Sahara,        I  can find only one or two of them
  in the Edinburgh libraries.             <I.\ps like     these are not confined to
  scientific or geographical       worka       Socialism is      a  subject not in the
  background at present, yet one will seek in vain among our libraries
   for some of the works of the best-known continental exponents of
   the theory.
       Every true Scotsman has an interest in seeing these defects speedily
   remedied.
       It is much to be regretted       that there is no organisation by which
   reference    to the various libraries       in Edinburgh could          be facilitated

to those     engaged    in scientific and literary        work.     I  have   never
received    a book from the Advocates', Physicians',              and some other
libraries without being indebted to the courtesy of some member of
these bodies; and although this be always            willingly given, it   becomes
irksome to all parties when repeated week after week.                   In  connec"
tion with our "Challenger" work, we often find it                more convenient
and expeditious to get books from London than from certain of the
Edinburgh libraries.         It   is not for the credit of the city that this
should be the     case.    I   cannot but think that it would be a great
advantage     to form a central board, composed             of representatives of
the different library-owning           societies  and corporations of the city.
 Such a board would do good service by preventing the duplication
of purchases     among     the various libraries        where    unnecessary.     It
 might have the power of granting the privilege to investigators of
 consulting all the libraries to       a limited extent   ;  but, more important
 still, it might draw up      a scheme for a National         Library — a   scheme
 which, while allowing existing libraries to develop on their present
 lines, would yet erect one of them,               say the    Advocates', into     a
 National    Library,   whose function        it would  be to supplement or      fill
up in those departments            not embraced     by the other libraries.       It
seems to me that some such scheme would command support
    "When    we remember        the   large sums of public money that are
annually spent on national libraries in London, and that in addition
 to the cost of buildings       and maintenance,       about £18,000     has been
spent during the past ten years on salaries and purchase of books
 for the National    Library in Dublin, then surely the claims of Scot
 land deserve some consideration.               Were a good workable scheme
drawn up by some of our leading men, and supported by the public
generally, then even Scottish Parliamentary                representatives   might
 awake to the fact that there are some Scottish questions worthy of
their attention and combined action.
    Some time ago the        Council of the Society drew the attention of
 the Government       to the     fact, that no     bathymetrical survey of the
 Scottish freshwater lochs existed, except those of Loch Lomond and
 Loch Awe; and urged the importance, in many branches of scientific
inquiry, of knowing        the     depth and form of such basins as Lochs
Morar, Maree, Lochy, Assynt, Linn, Tay, Ericht, with many others,

and expressed     the    hope that these      surveys would be undertaken
at an early date, and, at all events, before           the completion of the
Ordnance Survey         of the country.        The reply from the Treasury
was that these surveys could not be sanctioned, because they                  did
not come within the function          of the Board of Admiralty or of the
survey department of the Office of Works.              This matter  was subse
quently brought up in Parliament by Lord Balfour of Burleigh, but
no steps seem to have been taken to carry out the survey.               It may
be hoped     that   this matter will not be allowed to drop.              Quite
recently soundings of 175 and 180 fathoms have been obtained in
Loch Morar.        This is the     greatest   depth that has hitherto been
found on the plateau on which the British Islands are situated              ;  to
get depths equal to this we must go towards the deep gut off the
coasts of Norway,       or beyond the 100-fathom line off the coasts           of
Ireland.    There are also geological and biological problems of great
interest connected      with the depths of these lochs.
    Should these surveys not be undertaken a very important part of
the survey of the United Kingdom will be left untouched                 ; for it
cannot be denied that it is at least as         important  — sometimes much
more important — to know the depth          of a lake than to know the height
of an adjoining mountain.         It  would be a matter for great regret        if
the admirable surveys,       which are now drawing to a close, and       which
reflect so much      credit on    the officers    who conducted them,       and
honour on the scientific reputation of the country generally, should
be lowered    in value by the great omission here pointed out.
    The Council has recently had before           it the subject of  Antarctic
exploration, and has drawn up and printed a number of suggestions
as to the investigations which should be undertaken or attempted
in the event of such       an expedition being fitted out.       There can be
little doubt that     a  thorough exploration of these unknown regions
would enrich almost every branch of science with valuable observa
tions  ; the Antarctic     appears   to exert a controlling influence on the
atmospheric and oceanic circulation and magnetism of the globe, and
presents many interesting physical, geological, and zoological problems.
No    steam  vessel,    protected   for ice, has ever penetrated    these seas,

the Antarctic      regions except during the summer            months of January,
 February, and March, and, although the first endeavour to pass                     a
 winter in these regions would doubtless be accompanied with con
 siderable risk, still it must be attempted, aud the duty of attempt
 ing it lies heavier on Great Britain than any other nation.                If Great
 Britain is     to hold her proper position among the family of nations
she must       explore the Antarctic, and it is to            be hoped that the
 numerous learned Societies of the United Kingdom                  will  before long
 press the matter on the attention of the Government.
    During     the   past few years     there  has been great       activity in the
examination        of the biological     conditions of the coasts, lochs, and
 estuaries   of Scotland, and     some of the more          important results have
 appeared,    or are about to appear, in the Transactions and Proceedings
 of the Society.
    In connection with the Scottish Marine Station, carried on under
 the auspices     of the Scottish Meteorological          Society, there has been
 conducted during the past three years             a  very valuable series of in
 vestigations into the physical and chemical conditions of the Firths
of Forth and Clyde, and various rivers and estuaries, which are of
great    importance to a right understanding of the general meteor
 ology of the country.
    The little steamer      of the Station, fitted with        the most    approved
 apparatus, has been        constantly at work         at all  times of the year.
Three      years'   observations    on the Forth         have given the general
conditions with regard         to temperature and salinity for all seasons,
with   the laws of their changes.
    About    the time of the vernal equinox           all the water of the Firth
is of   a uniform       temperature   ; there    is a gradient of temperature
from     river to sea and from surface             to   bottom in summer,        the
 warmest     water being on the surface            and    towards the land.       In
winter this state of matters           is entirely reversed,      at the autumnal
 equinox there being again a uniform distribution of temperature.
    Nearly a year's      observations have been completed on the much
more complicated         and varied region of the Clyde.              Here a vast
amount      of heat is stored up in the waters of the deep lochs during
summer,      and slowly given out again to the air during the winter
months,     thus greatly modifying the climate of the West Coast of

Scotland — a condition         of things to which          there     is apparently
nothing analogous on the East Coast.
   This influence is       due to the great depth of          the lochs and     their
exposure    to summer heat, and does not appear              to he entirely inde
pendent of the effects produced by the warm Atlantic water, which
flows over the shallow ridge stretching from Cantyre                   to  the   Ayr
shire coast.       Some    of the preliminary       results of these researches
have been presented        to the Society by     Dr Mill, but all      the observa
tions are now in course of preparation for publication,                    and    will
furnish physicists and meteorologists           with many much-needed          data.
   I  have     already referred to the extra volume of the Society's
Transactions, containing the Ben Nevis Observatory observations,
which will shortly be in the hands of the Fellows.                 Among meteor
ologists in all parts of the world             there   has   long been a desire
expressed     to be furnished with copies of the Ben Nevis observa
tions, and     as   the Directors     have  no    funds for the purpose,          the
Council have in the circumstances considered                it   a duty to under
take their publication.
   The Fellows        are reminded      that the Observatory buildings            and
the  road    thereto are the property of the Royal                Society of Edin
burgh, that several       donations from the Society's funds were made
towards covering         the  expenses     of the preliminary          observations
before    the   erection of the permanent Observatory,                and that the
direction of the Observatory is largely in the hands of the repre
sentatives    and Fellows of this Society.           The Society has, therefore,
a deep   interest in all that concerns       the welfare of this unique high-
class Observatory.
   As you     are aware, the Observatory was erected            in  the summer of
1883, and formally opened           by Mrs Cameron Campbell              of Monzie,
the proprietrix of the land, on 17th October;             immediately thereafter
Mr Omond and two           assistants   went into residence, and the regular
work of hourly        observations began in the end of November                 ; the
Observatory was equipped with the best instruments that could be
obtained, several       of these being of    a   novel character,     suited to the
peculiar climate of the Observatory and to the new lines of observa
tion it was proposed to carry out.
   Ben Nevis was selected          not merely as the highest mountain in

1886.]                         Chairman's Address.                                13
Great Britain, and situated in the very track of the south-westerly
winds     from      the Atlantic,      which exercise      so  preponderating     an
influence on the weather of Europe, but because it rises to a height
of 4406      feet    so close to the sea that a sea-level          station may be
placed at about 4 miles from the summit — a consideration which
gives a value altogether        unique to the observations.
    The low-level station       was established at      Fort William, under the
charge of     Mr Livingstone, of       the  Public Schools,     at which    observa
tions   are made five       times each day, and       with  these are conjoined a
barograph and thermograph for the continuous record of these im
portant elements of climate — atmospheric pressure and temperature.
Three years' observations at this pair of stations have already been
made, and      it  is these which are now      in  the hands of the printer, and
will shortly     appear as a volume of the Society's Transactions.
    The climatic difficulties       were    great,   but they were successfully
surmounted (1) by the skill of the architect, Mr Sydney Mitchell,
who constructed the buildings, (2) by the heroic endurance and
fertility and readiness of resource displayed by Mr Omond and his
staff of assistants      in meeting emergencies as they arose.
    At  most,    if not all, other observatories only         a comparatively few
of the observations         are made    by the observers personally, the usual
course being to use continuously recording instruments from which
the omitted hours are interpolated.              But   on   Ben Nevis every re
corded observation is actually noted by the observers.                   Further, it
usually happens that the observations of the temperature,                 humidity,
and movements          of the air, and the rainfall are automatically recorded.
 But on Ben Nevis, during            the larger portion of the year, owing to
 the snow-drifts       and ice-incrustations formed on the instruments             as
 well as on everything outside the Observatory exposed to the wind,
 these   observations cannot,         and,  it  may    be confidently     predicted,
 never can, be made by self-recording instruments.               Hence,   if meteor
 ology and weather prediction are to make advances in those funda
 mental inquiries, which         can be successfully prosecuted         only by the
 help of high-level observatories,         the time   will never come when such
 heroic services as are now rendered to science by              Mr Omond      can be
 dispensed     with.      Even barometric observations could not be utilised
  in these  inquiries, unless there be conjoined with them observations
 of the temperature and the movements               of the atmosphere.

      The high expectations formed of the great importance of this
Observatory have already been more than realised.                          The following
are among        the   more       prominent of the results obtained from this
pair of high and low level stations              :   —
      1.   The rate of decrease            of temperature        with   height has been
more correctly ascertained.
      2.   The rate of decrease of atmospheric pressure with height for
the different sea-level pressures and air-temperatures has been ascer
tained with a high degree of accuracy.
      3.   The relations of the readings of the dry and wet bulb hygro
meter to the vapour of the atmosphere                    have been worked out, under
the extraordinarily         dry states of the air which are of such frequent
occurrence      on the top of the mountain, from observational data to
a degree      of accuracy not hitherto attained.
     These results will, doubtless,             in future        be incorporated       in all
books on meteorology              and general physics.
     As    regards weather forecasting, the Ben Nevis                   observations    con
tribute information           of such a value as no low-level observatory,
however efficiently equipped and superintended, can for a moment
lay claim to     ;   and   it is to   be enforced here, that when the Directors
are placed in a position to raise the five daily observations at                        Fort
William to twenty-four, the value of the Ben Nevis observing
system will be immensely enhanced. In other words, the Directors
of the Observatory attach the greatest importance to the establish
ment of a low-level observatory at                   Fort William, at which       observa
tions could be made with the same fulness                    as at the   Observatory on
the top of the mountain.
     The great value attached to the observations                 of high-level observa
tories is attested by the continued additions made                      to these stations
in different parts of the world, and by the observations made at
these stations many          of   the more important questions of meteorology
may doubtless be investigated.                  But      there   is no other high-level
observatory,     and its conjoined low-level station, so happily situated
as   Ben Nevis Observatory and the station at Fort William for sup
plying physicists with observational data.                   This   is due    to the fact
that the former is on a peak and the latter close to the                         sea,    the
ground sloping down to             it,   by which the effects of solar and tenes.
trial radiation are minimise'!.

1886.]                      Chairman's Address.                                15
    It  is only a few months ago that an inquiry,                  conducted on
scientific principles,     into the bearing of the observations at the
Observatory and at the base of the mountain could be entered upon,
and its completion       will  necessarily   occupy some time, owing to the
complex      character of the problems to be dealt with.
    The erection and maintenance of the Observatory during the past
three years      have cost over £7000, the funds having been obtained
solely    from    private subscriptions      and learned Societies.       During
this time the Directors have had to pay to the post office depart
ment a rental        of £133 per      annum     for the use of the telegraph
wire from       Fort William to     the top of the mountain.         In addition
to   this, the post office have received          considerably over £100 for
tourist messages forwarded from the Observatory by Mr Omond and
his assistants.       The daily despatch of the observations to the press
throughout the couutry is also a source of considerable income to
the post offi ;e department.         It  appears then that this Observatory,
established     solely for the purposes of scientific investigation, instead
of being assisted by the Government, is actually a source of revenue
to a Government         department.
    You are      aware   that   a  sum    of £15,000    is   voted annually     by
Parliament       for  general   meteorological purposes,      but more particu
larly the meteorology of the British Islands.             This grant is admini
 stered   by   a committee    nominated by the Royal Society of London,
called the Meteorological Council.           Although Ben Nevis Observatory
is certainly     the best and most important meteorological          observatory
in the United Kingdom, yet it has received               no support from this
grant,   if   we except    the    annual sum of .£100         which   is paid   on
condition of being supplied with a complete set of all the observa
 tions, — a bare equivalent        for the mere clerk work required.            In
 1884 an application        for £300,      from the £15,000       grant,  towards
 the expenses      of the Observatory was refused.
    The Meteorological Council          also intimated     to the Directors that
 they   did not    propose to have the observations at Ben Nevis wired
 to London       for  use in making up the weather forecasts,            until the
 result of    Mr Buchan's discussion of the observations          was completed    ;
 but they offered no assistance towards carrying out that discussion,
 although £1000 of the £15,300               is expressly stated to be for the
 purposes     of original investigation

     An application to the Government                       Grant     Committee       of     the
Royal       Society of London           for aid towards the expenses                   of the
Observatory has likewise been unsuccessful.
     The refusal of assistance              by the       London     Committees may be
partly due to the fact that there                      are many claims on the           funds
which they administer, but it appears also to be very largely due
to a want of proper knowledge                    of what has been done, and what
may be reasonably         expected          to be done       by the Observatory, there
being no observatory         in these islands that can compete                       with the
Ben Nevis Observatory for the accuracy and intrinsic                           value of the
hourly observations       ; and    absolutely no pair of stations anywhere
in the world that can be named                   alongside the Observatory and the
station at Fort William,         as contributing            data in furtherance of           our
knowledge of storms and the science of weather generally.
     The Directors have given much time and thought to the affairs
of the Observatory during the past four years, and to many of them
it has been a cause of considerable                      personal expenditure, for the
expenses connected        with frequent visits made to Ben Nevis for the
selection of the site,       during          the building          aud equipment of the
Observatory, and its subsequent                  inspections, have in no case been
charged against the Observatory funds, but have                        been borne by the
individual Directors.        Not only            so,   but it has happened          more than
once that some one of the Directors has placed considerable                                sums
to the credit of the Observatory in the bank, to enable the work to
go on without an hiatus.
     The time has now arrived when it is necessary                             to   place    the
Observatory on some permanent footing, but before another appeal
is made to the public, the Council                     of this Society has resolved           to
urge      the claims of the Observatory on the consideration of the
Government, and to ask for a substantial donation towards the
annual expenses.          In this,      I    feel sure, the Council will have                the
support, not only of the Fellows of the learned Societies of Scotland,
but of the general public.
     In   the infancy of science        it   was       possible,   with simple and inex
pensive     appliances,   to discover important facts which were                     lying    as
it   were    on the   surface,    hut no discoveries               can now be expected

is   that such scientific investigations cannot                     be undertaken even by
scientific men       with private fortunes, and               hence follows the necessity
for Government assistance.
     From the estimates it appears —
     1.    That the Royal Society of London and five or six other learned
societies are accommodated              in Burlington House              free of rent.
     2.    That the Eoyal Geographical Society receives a grant of £500
annually.
     3.    That there is an annual grant of £15,000 for meteorological
purposes,         administered       by a committee            of the         Eoyal Society of
London, £1000 of which is to be devoted to original investigations.
     4.    That a sum of £4000 is administered by the Government
Grant       Committee        of the Royal        Society of London                    for scientific
research, and although that society                is,   in   a    sense, the representative
society  of the United Kingdom, still its Council and Committees are
of   necessity composed of Fellows resident in, or within accessible
distance of, London, the Fellows resident                          in Scotland being practi
cally excluded         from active participation in the management                             of the
Society.
     That the Marine Biological Association has recently received
     5.
.£5000 from the Government, and the promise of an annual grant
of £500       for five     years, towards the establishment of                    a   laboratory of
research      in England.
     6.    That in Ireland        the Royal      Irish Academy            receives        a   grant in
aid of       £2000 annually, in addition to                       free   accommodation and
about £400 annually for allowances and                         maintenances           ;   the Royal
Zoological Society of Ireland receives                         a    grant in aid of £500
annually      ;   and the Royal Dublin Society appears, during the past
ten years, to have received considerable sums of money from public
funds; in addition there               is   a   large    sum        granted annually for            a
national library in Dublin.
      7.   That, with respect to Scotland, the only grant for scientific
purposes          in aid     of learned     societies         is    £300 annually              to the
Royal Society of Edinburgh,                 which        is   repaid to       a   department of
the Government             in   the form of rent.

Societies     and scientific men should be treated                     ao   niggardly       as com
pared     with     those in England             and Ireland.         It    cannot be because
she does no scientific work.                 It     is sometimes       said, indeed,        that in
literary matters        Scotland,           and especially Edinburgh,                is     a     mere
shadow of her former self               ;    but in science this is not the               case,    and
it is towards scientific       matters that the great ploughshare of human
thought and activity            is,   in this       age, directed.     I      question      if     any
country in the world, taking into consideration its size, can show                                   a
better record of scientific work, or                a   more excellent volume of scien
tific literature, than Scotland, during the past ten or twenty years.
     There can be no doubt that Scotland has                     a   great grievance            in the
fact that her learned Societies do not receive the same consideration
from Government as do similar societies in other parts of the United
Kingdom, and in the fact that the administration of all the grants,
in which she may be supposed to have                      a   right to participate,         is    cen
tralised in London and controlled by London Committees.                                   Scotland
was refused a representative                on the Meteorological              Council, where
the expenses of the members are paid.                       Two      representatives        of this
Society are allowed on the committee of sixty members, which dis
tributes the grant of £4000 for research; but when two members of
the Council         are sent twice      a    year to London           it    costs this Society
£50 annually, — considerable
                       a                        charge against its funds.             But there
is   a   unanimous opinion among                  Scottish scientific men that there
should be     a    grant in aid of the learned societies of Scotland, for the
purposes of scientific research,                analogous     to the Government grant
of £4000 to the Royal Society of London, which                               is   distributed by
a   committee      in London.         Several of the best qualified men in Scot
land hesitate        to apply for aid from the London                        committee,           and,
especially    as    many of the younger men have been frequently dis
appointed, there has sprung up                  a   firm belief that the only satisfac
tory arrangement           for the scientific men resident in the northern
part of Great Britain          is     that there should be           a    grant for scientific
research to be distributed by               a   committee     in Scotland, which would
be   fully conversant with the nature of                       the    investigations to bo
undertaken, and personally acquainted                     with the applicants.                  There
can be     little doubt that such           a   grant distributed locally would have
the effect of removing many of the barriers which at present impede
the progress of science        in Scotland.

     It is the primary object of our Society to promote the interests
  of science   and    literature in Scotland, more especially in all that
  relates to the extension of the boundaries of knowledge by the dis
  covery of new truths, as distinguished           from the making known of
 old truths.    It claims,    therefore, the right to memorialise the Govern
 ment on scientific affairs which it considers of national importance,
 and in purely        Scottish    matters   it holds that its President and
 Council, and not the President and Council               of the Eoyal Society
 of London, should be the advisers of the Government.
     The Council     has, at various times     in the past, called the attention
 of the Government           to the disadvantages       under which     Scotland
 laboured in respect of aid to research, but the result has never been
 satisfactory.     In    the attempt which the Council is now about to
 make     I would bespeak the co-operation          and support of all Scotsmen
 who believe it to be for the honour and well-being of the country
 that our scientific institutions should not languish, or our scientific
 men be discouraged,        but that both should be urged to new advances
 and greater conquests.
                                Hume Manuscripts.
     Before the reading of the papers           the Chairman made the follow
ing statement : —
     Some reference should,         I think, be made to the concluding para
 graph of a review of the life of Hume, which recently appeared in
 the Scotsman.        It is  as follows  : —
     " Dr Knight      has spared no pains to add        by his own independent
 research    to the information        given in    J. Hill  Burton's work.    He
                                  '
 mentions, however, that            he has not been able to obtain access to
the volume of Hume MSS. in the custody of the Royal Society, the
Secretary being of opinion that Mr                Hill  Burton   had sufficiently
examined these.'           Has the Secretary     of the Royal Society any such
right to bar the way to further genuine               research 1   How   does he
know that nothing          has been omitted and nothing has to be verified       1
This volume      was not given as a present to the Royal Society to keep
as a curiosity      in   a glass case for its peculiar benefit, but given to
them as custodiers for the public.              The decision of Professor Tait
amounts      to asserting that this volume is never more to be seen by
mortal eye.       It   is well known that Hume entrusted to the Society

his correspondencewith Rousseau (after offering it to the British
Museum), not merely in order that it might be preserved, hut that
the world might bo able to learn from it the true story of a famous
feud.        If   MSS. of purely literary or philosophical interest                      are to
be locked up jealously                 in the archives of          a Society which       is not
literary at all, but scientific, the purpose of the depositors is defeated,
and the insistance on the private right of the Society becomes                                 a
public wrong."
  As this article,           if    unanswered, might give rise to serious                   mis
apprehension         as   to the action of the Society and of our General
Secretary,        it is advisable to state—
     1.    The Royal Society of Edinburgh                   is,   by its constitution, quite
as much       a   literary as     a   scientific society.
     2.    The General Secretary            is   not responsible for the decisions of
the       Council   of the Society, except in so far as he                 is,   ex officio, one
of the twenty-seven members of Council.
   3.      The Hume MSS. were bequeathed                          to the Society by Baron
Hume in 1838, and they apparently contain papers which Hume in
his last will left particular instructions should be destroyed.
  4.       The Council of the Society has on several occasions since 1838
appointed committees to report as to the access that should be given
to these MSS.
   5.      The    Council,        recognising the duty             of making       public   the
contents of the Hume MSS., and at the same time being anxious to
prevent the dissemination of mere hearsay                           scandal,     affecting the
characters        of men whose           descendants     arestill among us, requested
the late     Dr Hill Burton — whose               competence no one will question —
to examine          the   MSS. and publish them                   so far as should seem at
once necessary        and prudent.
  6.       More recently     a    committee      of   experts appointed by the         Council
(on which are some of the most distinguished literary men in Edin
burgh) has for   considerable time been engaged in the laborious
                      a
work of reperusal of these MSS., with the view of deciding how                              far
further publication of their contents may now be possible.
  7.      Pending     the final decision of            this committee,         the Rousseau
portions of the MSS. have been for some time open to the inspection
of, and have been consulted by, investigators.

     In               printed in Tram. Soy. Soc. Edin., 1886, I
            a former paper,
showed that the recovery of the " special

                                            state by a gas supposed
to consist of equal hard spheres takes place, at ordinary pressures
and temperatures, in a period of the order of 10"' seconds,                                                  at
highest.
   This forms the indispensable preliminary to the present investiga
tion.  For it warrants us in assuming that, except in extreme cases
in which the               causes tending to disturb                    the "special" state are at
least nearly as rapid and persistent in their action as is the tendency
to recovery,           a   local   " special    "
                                                    state is maintained           in    every region of
the space occupied by                   a gas   or gaseous mixture.                   This     may bo, and
in the           cases     now     to    be     treated       is,   accompanied           by   a   common
translatory            motion of the particles (or, of each separate                               class     of
particles) in           the region —      a    motion which at each instant may vary
continuously               from region to region,               and may in any region vary
continuously with time.
     A     troublesome part of the investigation                           is   the dealing         with     a
number of complicated integrals which occur in                                  it,

as
 I       know) can be treated only by quadratures.                               All are of the form

such integrals are easy to evaluate                             ;     but it is very different when
the masses differ in two mixed                      gases.             In what follows, the merely
numerical factor of the expression above will be denoted by Cr, so
that the value of the expression                         is,   when the masses and diameters
are equal,          Cr/nirs2/?1'2,     and the introduction                       of different diameters
merely introduces another factor.    Here 3/2A      the mean square                    is

integrals cannot be simplified in the above way.                                            In this   case     the

 5.      Temperatures at Different Heights above Ground at Ben
         Nevis Observatory. By R. T. Omond, Supt. B.N.O.
      During part of        the recent        summer (1886), in addition                   to the
ordinary       temperature observations here, a set of readings were
taken in a Stevenson screen, at a height of                                  112    inches above
ground — that        is,   at about two and          a      half times      the standard eleva
tion of 48 inches.            The high level screen was mounted at the top
of    a   stand used to carry the thermometers                    in winter, and consisting-
of two stout upright posts or battens, with cross bars between them
at every          feet or so       the screen                       with the lower                  of

the back resting on one bar, and                           tied to the one above          it   or   to
the side posts.            The screen used on this stand                    is   smaller than the
standard Stevenson screen, but                it   is      constructed in exactly the same
manner,        with double louvred              sides           and the bottom          open.       It
measures       inside 10 inches broad by                    6   inches deep and 15 inches
high.        The low level screen, which                   is   mounted on four legs in the

 usual manner, is about the ordinary                size;     it    measures      15  by    10
by 15 inches.            Headings of both sets of thermometers                   (high and
low) were        taken hourly        during    part   of    July      and the whole of
 August.       During      the   month of      August,     as well        as these     shade
temperatures,          readings were       taken of a black             bulb     in    vacuo,
belonging to         Mr H. N. Dickson, and kindly lent by him for                         the
purpose.        In    this instrument       the thermometer inside                the glass
globe,     instead of being a maximum, is a common thermometer,
with the bulb blackened in the usual way.                         The hourly readings
of    this instrument          indicate the solar radiation              at the time of
observation,       instead of, as in the usual maximum black bulb, giving
only the greatest intensity since being last set.                    In  the first column
of the table, at the end, the mean hourly values of this black bulb
for the      month of August           are given.      It  is noteworthy           that the
maximum is almost exactly at twelve noon                         ;   but, as Greenwich
time is used,        it must     be borne   in mind that        the mean time of the
sun's meridian          passage is about 12 hours 20 minutes, the longitude
being some 5° west.             In  the second and third columns respectively
of the table are the high and low level shade                      temperatures,      and in
the    fourth    the difference      between    them,   for   the month of August
also.     The values of the fourth column                are shown graphically              in
the highest       line of the diagram.         The average temperature               for the
whole     day is the same in both            cases,  but the upper thermometer
has a    slightly     less daily range, reading about one-tenth of a degree
F. higher at night, and from one to two tenths lower in the after
noon.       The result is exactly what would               be expected,         the upper
thermometer          being further       removed     from      the ground          and less
exposed       to its radiation, while         the smallness of the              differences
between       the two can be          accounted     for by the exceedingly bad
weather      of last August       : during] the whole month there were only
two fine days.           A  comparison of the readings on these two days
(the    19th and 22nd), shows          a  much greater difference.             In   the fifth
column      of the table, the       mean differences     of the high and low level
thermometers        on the two days is given, and these numbers are                      also-
shown     in the lower part of the diagram by                the line which has the
greatest range.          Two days is of course far            too short a period to-
give a satisfactory          average   and a smooth curve, but the general
aspect of      the line shows that, from about sunrise                     till noon,     the

two days shows nothing calling for special note.                                                                     The range              is   greater

at  only two hours do they           exceed   one-tenth of a degree.          This
small difference    on the foggy days         fully   bears    out what    I  have
formerly   observed   on Ben Nevis, that in         a saturated      atmosphere  —
with mist or fog present, it makes no practical difference how the
thermometers are placed, so long as the air can reach them at all
and they are shaded from the direct rays of the sun.
              Differences  of High from Loiv         Thermometers.
   As the surface     of the   hill top    consists    entirely of broken rock
without   soil or  vegetation,    it  seems probable that a large amount
of the difference between      the two thermometers            is directly due to
ground radiation.      On a calm      day with bright sunshine          the stones
get so heated   as to be disagreeable        to handle, but        there were   un
fortunately no such days last August            ; still, the radiation of heat
during   the day and of cold at night during ordinary clear weather
must be considerable, and the          lower thermometer was much nearer
this source of heat and cold than the upper.                It   should, however,
be borne   in mind that,   as the     screens are only open         below and the
bulbs of the thermometers        raised about four inches above the lower

edge    of   the sides, they can only receive and transmit radiation from
and to that part of             the ground that would he visible to an eye
placed where the bulbs are             ;   and that in theory the greater distance
of    the upper thermometer from the ground                                   would      be      exactly
counterbalanced by the larger area capable of acting on                                  it,   and the
radiation effects would be the same in both                          cases.         The thermome
ters were so mounted that the difference                        in   the size of the screens
made      little   difference   in   the exposure            to ground         radiation.        If   the
screens themselves get heated and cooled by ground radiation, they
would correspondingly heat and cool the air as                                 it   passed through
the louvres, and thus affect the thermometers.                                In    this latter case
the heating and cooling ought to be inversely as the square of their
distances from the ground — that                       is,   the lower         screen      should be
affected nearly six times as much as the upper.
     The afternoon difference              may also be due to convection currents
arising      from the heated          ground;           these    would          affect     the    lower
thermometer more than the upper, but                           it    is   difficult      to see       how
any such cause could give the morning difference,                                     in which the
upper thermometer reads above the lower.                             It   is   possible,      however,
that in fine weather the layer of air next the ground                                    is   so much
cooled by contact with the ground that there                                    is    a continuous
gradient of temperature              rising with height above                      ground, at least
as high      as the level of the upper screen.                      I      hope       to repeat        the
experiment under more favourable conditions of weather,                                       and also,
if   possible, when the ground             is   covered       with snow.

        President.
   It  is well known that the solution of the mathematical problem
of the motion of liquid arising from the motion through it of
solids has been effected in comparatively few instances, and in
these, such as the sphere       and the ellipsoid, the surface is defined by
a single equation.        In the following          investigation, however, we
seem     naturally to   come     across  cases where        the solid might     be
described as     "a compound body," consisting               as it  does of parts
defined     by different    equations.     It   is possible     that the method
employed might lead to the solution of analogous                     problems   in
Sound, Heat, or Electricity.

 rather complicated,           perhaps     it will  bo better to leave          them as they

 velocity which at infinity is              - c.    For simplicity, we shall suppose
the     latter     case.     First, considering the reflection of the liquid

We        are concerned                   with values of               0 only from 0 to ir.                          We can

prove that a is the radius of curvature at B, and that C is the

exactly the above                         series,        which      verifies the work,                       and we may
observe         that the expansion would be true even at the limits, for
0   - \tr sin 0 vanishes when                            0 = 0 and 0 =              W.
     It   will     be found on examination that                                     if AB,            instead of being a

    Remembering        the known relation
and examining the general               term of (5), we see that (5) is an exact
differential.      Therefore integrating we shall get for the equation of
the stream     lines
    For the particular stream line, which passes through the point
B, the      above     must      be    satisfied   by  p=l,    0 —      or x = 0, and

    For distant points        p is small, therefore     for such points neglecting
all the positive powers of p in the above, we can readily prove that
y= */(2)a is        an asymptote,         and that the curve lies below it.        It  is
interesting to      see   whether at      B the   curve goes up or down.         To this
end, in (6) put a + 8r for r and \it + SO for 0, expand and retain not
beyond the first power of Br and the second power of 80.                         It will
be found that we shall get

     In  order    to get the terms after the 3rd in this series, we must
 take n from       3 to    infinity.      There seems to be no doubt that the
 value    of the series in the square brackets is zero, although it is
 rather    difficult to prove it algebraically, for the expansion (4) is
 true even       at the limits.            Moreover the expansion (4) is never
 differentiated,     therefore     d<pjdr is zero for     r— a  even at the point     B,
 therefore,     as  in   the case of the circular cylinder, the stream              line
  through    B must      touch the circle at       B;  assuming    therefore    that the
  series in (7) is zero, the remaining terms show us that the curvature
  at B is upwards, and the radius of curvature equal to a.                   The same
  figure therefore as was employed for the circular cylinder                will  do for
   this case, provided that we make OC =                J(2)a   instead  of  2a.

   2.     Note on Knots on Endless Cords.                   By A. B. Kempe, Esq.
                    Communicated by Prof. Tait.                 (Plate     I.)
        1.  Each crossing divides the cord into two loops.
       2.   Any other      crossing    cither lies on both these             loops,   say is
   linked to the former crossing, or on one loop only, say is not linked
   to the former crossing.
       3.   It  can be shown without        difficulty that    if crossing a is linked
   to crossing 6, then crossing        b is linked    to crossing a     ;  and therefore,
   also,   if crossing   a is not linked to crossing      6, crossing     b is  not linked
   to crossing a.
       4. Hence      pairs of    crossings   are of     two sorts, viz., linked and
   unlinked.
       5.  We     have the two following fundamental laws             : —
               (a) The number of crossings linked to each crossing is even.
               (b) If two crossings are not linked to each other, the number
                    of crossings linked to both is even.
       6.  We     may represent    a knot diagram matically thus           : —
      Represent the crossings by small circles or nuclei.
      Join pairs of nuclei which          represent    pairs of linked crossings by
  lines or links.
      No lines     are to be drawn in the case of unlinked pairs of crossings.
      7.   In   these diagrams,     in conformity with        sec.  5, the number of
 links proceeding from a nucleus must be oven, and if two nuclei are
 not joined by a link, the number of nuclei joined by links to both
 must be even.
      8.   This   mode of representing knots has the advantage of indicating
 the degree of complexity of the various knots.                    Thus, the diagram
 representing two distinct knots on the same string will consist of
 two entirely detached          portions, and nugatory crossings will be re
presented        by nuclei having no links proceeding from them.
        9.  In   the plate   the various knots of three,         four,    five,   six, and
seven crossings       are indicated    in outline on this plan.
     10.    It will  occasionally be convenient to represent pairs of cross
ings which are unlinked by pairs of nuclei joined by                       a  dotted line
or link, pairs of crossings which are linked not being joined at all.

 The advantage of this mode of representation is that it involves a
 smaller number of lines than the former mode, and thus the dia
 grams are simpler and clearer.

not   diminish the generality of our problem, because the motion at

the motion at the surface,                  with   b = c.

      In (36) and its                   consequence (31), we supposed                          t    so large

 where         m      is   a       large    positive numeric.                     Thus, remarking that cay

and therefore, when m and n are each very large, Q=0.     Because
n   large we still, as in (36), have R=0 and therefore the motion
     is                                                                       ;

Q   has attained half its final value.             The point x where this con
dition   is fulfilled    at time t may be called              the   mid-front     of the
procession.       It   travels    at the     velocity   \gl<»,    or half   the    wave-
velocity   ;  which agrees with the result of Stokes.
    We    may    arbitrarily     define    "the front"        as the    succession      of
augmenting waves         which pass between           the   times    corresponding to
m = +10 and m =          - 10 (or     any other considerable number instead
of 10).      Thus the time taken by the front, in passing the place
x = n\, is 40(u_1 jZirn.           The space travelled by the mid-front in
this time is    20<7(o~1  J2im, which         may, arbitrarily,     be defined as the
length of the front.         It  increases    in proportion      to   *Jn ; and there
fore in proportion to         Jt,  as  said above.      The effect upon phase of
the changing waves         in  the front ; due to the fluctuations of e,              and
to the law of augmentation of Q from zero to its final va lue                    ;  is to
be illustrated     by calculations and graphic representations,                 which    I
hope    will  be given on a future occasion.
    The rear of   a  wholly    free procession    of waves may be quite readily
studied after the constitution of the front has been fully investi
gate,   by superimposing           an   annulling     surface-pressure       upon      the
originating pressure represented            by (12) above, after the originating
pressure     has been continued so long as to produce                  a procession     of
any desired number of waves.

    2.  Chemical Affinity and Solution.             By W. Durham,         Esq.
     In continuation of my inquiry into         the evidence   which thermo
chemistry gives of the truth of my theory of chemical affinity and
solution,    I  would direct attention to the sulphates.
    In  the first instance,  consider the well-known definite compound
sulphuric acid H„S04.         The heat which is evolved on building up
this acid from its elements is 192920 units. When it is dissolved
in    a  large   quantity  of water the mixture        evolves   17850 units,
making in all 210770 units.           Now, consider how this is made          up.
First,   we have    H20 with    a combination heat of 68360 units, then
S03 with 103240 units.           Further, we know that S combines with
H2, evolving 4740 units of heat, and let us assume, according to
my theory, that all the affinity of the S for O is not exhausted              on
the combination       S03, but that part remains in a less intense form
which can act on the O of the water, and in conjunction with H2             can
evolve 34413 units more, this being its average action on                    the
three atoms      of O already combined.       Add   these numbers     together,

and we have            almost exactly the heat of formation and solution of
HjjS04.         Thus—
           [HsO]           =      68360                 [Hs,   S, 0*]        =192920

           [S, H2]         =       4740

Now, of course,            I   have assumed        that S will develop 34413 units in
addition after combining with three atoms of O.                              Let   us see, how
ever, how this way of looking at the combination helps us as we go
on.  Take next a very different sulphate, viz., BaS04. In building
this salt up from its elements, 338070 units of heat are evolved.
Analysing this in the same manner as in the case of H2S04 we have
[Ba, 0] = 124240 units of heat,       0s]
                                          = 103240 units, together
                                                      [S,
equal to 227480 units, leaving 110590 units to be evolved on com
bination of BaO with SOs. Whence do these 110590 units come                                     1
We have the answer at once when we know that [Ba,    = about                        S]
109600.          It   is     evident the       S   acts upon the        Ba with as much
energy as    if       BaS were actually formed, and this                is   the cause of the
combination.            In     accordance      with    my theory, the        S   cannot act to
                  on the              of the BaO owing to the energy with which

68360 as     in the        caseof H20.           Thus we have —
                                                                            O4] 338070

      Further, consider how the heat of neutralisation                      is   accounted   for.
BaO, on being dissolved                 in   water,   evolves 34520 units of heat, SOg
evolves    39153,       and       the difference      between    the sum of these and
110590     is    the heat of neutralisation.                Thus —
                                       [BaO, Aq] = 34520
                                       [SO3,   Aq] =39153

Now, hoth these salts are insoluble in water for the same                                 reason,
viz., that the full affinity of the                 S   for the metal         is   exercised, and
nothing     is    left for the H2 or      O    of the water.
     Let   us take next          CaS04,        and we      shall find some still              more
remarkable results.             In building this compound up 318370                      units    of
heat are evolved.              Tabulated in the same way             as    in the other       cases

Now in this          case the difference         84200     is   not equal to the heat             of
[Ca, S], which           is   92000.     The    S    therefore      is    not held with          the
full strength of its affinity for              Ca.      There are 7800 units to               spare.
What       becomes of them?             Consider the       following —    :
                                       [CaO, Aq] = 18330

  Now this exceeds 84200 by 4423, which is the heat of solution,
  Viz., 4440,     and accounts       for   so  much of the difference;          but the
 remarkable       thing now comes in, CaS04 combines with 2H20, and
 in doing      so   evolves 300 units of heat more than the heat of solu
 tion, viz., 4740, which is exactly the heat of combination of                     SHy
 We see, therefore,       that owing to the whole affinity of the S for Ca
 not being      exercised     in the compound CaS04, the S can exercise its
 normal affinity towards
                                  H2 of the water, and        as a consequence       we
have CaS04 slightly soluble, while the other two analogous salts are
 insoluble.       Further, when this compound CaS042H20 is dissolved
in water, the excess of its heat above that of solution appears as
a negative      quantity, therefore its heat of solution is           - 300.       Now
this admirably illustrates the meaning of these negative                      heats of
solution, and also two points to which                 I  drew attention      : — First,
the    lowering of intensity of affinity.            We  have   in this   case  affinity
represented by 300 units of so low a tension                  that its presence can
only be detected         when     acting     on two molecules     of water.       On   a
larger quantity it has no effect so far as temperature                  is concerned.
The second         point is that every molecule of water exercises affinity
on every     other molecule, but          as the work done and undone must be
equal    everywhere,        there    is no change      of temperature; but it is
entirely     different    if   one or two molecules         be bound to         another
foreign body ; the balance             is then upset, and the result will be a
change      of  temperature      in    one direction or the      other.     There are
still about 3000 units of heat to account for.                 Now,    I  am not pre
pared     to say exactly where           these  will be found.    According to my
theory the affinity of the S is now so reduced                  in intensity that it
cannot make          its presence known by evolution of heat in the ordi
nary way.         It   may be, however, that here we have the explanation
of the facts pointed out           in my former papers regarding the precipi
tation of clay suspended            in water, by the addition of a very small
quantity     of a soluble salt.
    Take one more example               as  extremely interesting for the fresh
light it throws on the          subject— consider NajS04.          In building this
compound         up from its elements 328590 units of heat are evolved,
and in addition          the    compound combines          with ten molecules         of
water with an additional evolution of 19220 units.                    Proceeding      as
in the other cases we have          —

Now, how          is   this difference          of 144810       units accounted                for?     We
have  first [Na2S] = 88200, and then we know that Na^O on being
dissolved in water evolves 55500 units of heat, which on my
principles are due to its unexhausted affinity for the                            O    of the       water;
this affinity acts upon the               O     of the SOs.         Thus we       have —

The balance of 18760 units of heat in the formation of the crystal
line      salt appears          as   a   negative       quantity      on solution              as in the
analogous lime salt.
I         have    made    a     few determinations of the quantities of                               some
compounds          dissolved in water                 to see   how far these conclusions
derived      from thermo-chemistry are borne out by actual quantities
dissolved.
     In    my last paper    I        stated that the heats of solution                    of    chlorides
varied directly         as the       affinity of the metal for O, and inversely                       as its
affinity for CI.          Consider the following table                :   —

    Now,   it  is apparent     at once that the quantity dissolved is almost
    exactly   inversely    as the difference       of heats, which is in complete
   accordance      with the laws laid down in my former paper.                 With the
   nitrates the same         relationship      cannot     be   made    so clear, as the
   metals     are    in combination with O, and the               data   obtainable are
   insufficient to trace the various affinities.             The results, however, are
   quite in accordance          with    the above, although the range           is much
  greater.       Thus we     have —
                              Quantity of JI(NO,)3 dissolved.
                                     Ca=    111 grains.

  The differences are        in  the same proportion as in the chlorides.            The
  sulphates      I  have already noticed.
      The salts     of those metals which form insoluble oxides or hydrates
  I  leave   for future treatment,        as the data obtainable are defective for
 my purpose.           So far as they go, however,              they are in complete
 accordance        with  those laws     I have    stated.
      These facta seem to me to prove,               without doubt, that solution is
 entirely due to chemical affinity, and that chemical affinity does not
 act, as has        hitherto been supposed, in units, but in all proportions
according         to the circumstances,        and that in chemical combinations
 of all degrees         every atom      acts upon every other atom according to
 its affinity       and the position in which it is placed.                This way of
regarding          chemical     affinity   reduces     a perfect chaos of empirical
results     into an orderly       and systematic       arrangement.

     The object of this paper is to describe               a  new thermometer     screen,
and to      give the results of        6ome trials made this autumn and winter
with a Stevenson screen              as  generally used, and one modified in the
way      described in a previous part of this investigation.*                    Also to
give     comparative        readings taken with those screens and with the
new one.

     Before entering on the subject of the paper,                 I wish     to make        a  few
preliminary remarks on the cause of the difference                         in the readings
given by different screens and by other ways of protecting                                      the
thermometers           ;   also to call attention to the interpretation                   we    are
entitled to put on curves of temperature                   drawn from readings taken
at longer or shorter intervals of time.
     All   the methods           in use for taking the temperature                  of the air
give different results.               One cause of this difference           is the more or
less perfect         way in which the thermometer is protected                        from      the
effects of radiation ; so that, while all tend to read too high during
the day, some read higher than others.                       But in addition to this,
there is another reason why the different arrangements                         give different
results.         This    second      disturbing    element    we    will, for want of              a
special       name, call the inertia of the apparatus.                   By    the   inertia      of
the apparatus            is simply meant the resistance              offered     by the ther
mometer           and its surroundings            to change      of temperature.               The
inertia may, therefore,              be measured by the        time taken by the ther
mometer          to acquire the temperature           of the air for a given amount
of change of temperature.                    For   example,   suppose the temperature
of the passing              air to rise one degree, it would              almost       instantly
heat up any small body, such as a cobweb,                      to its own temperature,
but it would take a much longer time to heat up                               a  larger body,
though similarly exposed.                   The time required        will depend          on the
mass and specific heat of the body, and on the shape and amount                                   of
surface       it  presents to the passing air.           We  see   from this, that          if  the
arrangement           of apparatus we use to take the temperature                    of    the air
has a small inertia,              it  may,    if the   temperature      is rising,       indicate
 at first a higher temperature               than an arrangement          having a greater
inertia     ;     and,    if  the    temperature     does   not     remain      long      enough
 at   its      highest       point,     the    apparatus    with      small       inertia      will
 indicate         a  higher       maximum        temperature      than the          other.       To
 illustrate this point, let us first consider a purely imaginary                             case.
 We know             that the temperature           of   the air during the forenoon
 of a summer's day is constantly changing.                       It   does not rise          regu
larly, but rises to a certain extent, then falls, then rises and falls
 again   ;    and though the general tendency may be upwards, there are

in which the air is heated.                           In PI. II.                fig.    1,    the cufve         A    is
supposed to represent                the changes in temperature                              of   the air, drawn
to a scale         on     which          the   vertical             lines represent                half minutes,
while the         horizontal            lines represent               half degrees.                 During          one
minute the temperature                     often rises or falls more than one degree.
For      convenience            of       illustration,              this    curve,           representing           the
temperature          of    the air,       is shown as a smooth curve.                                    In    reality-
it is not       likely to       be so, but in all probability                            is a very irregular
one.        Suppose then the curve                   A   represents             the temperature                of the
passing air, then the curve representing the temperature                                              of any very
small body, snch as a cobweb,                            will follow this                    one very closely.
But    if   the body is of any size, then the curve of its temperature                                             will
be something             like   the curve B.              Its       temperature              will rise and fall
with that of the passing air, but the two curves will not rise and fall
together, because the temperature                         of the body will go on rising after
that of the air has begun to fall, and                           it will continue to rise so long
as the      air is the hotter of the two.                       In the curves, the temperature
of B is shown to be rising for more than                                   half    a    minute after           A    has
attained its maximum, and                      it   is not      till A      has fallen more than half
a degreee,        and has the same temperature                             as   B, that the latter ceases
to rise, and       the curve of its temperature                            becomes           horizontal.        After
this    A   and    B both fall, but            A     more quickly                than B, and B does not
attain its lowest point                  till after A      has passed                  its lowest, and risen
to a certain       amount, and acquired the temperature                                       of B, after which
both curves rise,           but      A    more quickly than B.
  The points to be noted here                            are    :    First, that if               the top of the
curve       A   had been the maximum                      for the day, then the inertia of B
would have prevented                      it acquiring              the maximum                   temperature,       so
that any        arrangement of screen having a large inertia will tend to
give a      lower reading than one with                        a    small inertia.
     The second point             is,    the effect of the inertia                     in retarding       the time
of     maximum            temperature.              The curve              B    does         not arrive at its
maximum           till   some time later than the curve                            A.         These considera
tions       help to explain why the daily maximum temperature does
not occur about             mid-day, when tho sun                          is   at its highest, but at               a
later hour.          If    we suppose the             curve AA', continued                          as   shown by
tbe dotted         lines in the figure,                  to represent             the intensity               of solar
radiation, then            the curve BB' will represent                            its heating effect                on

the air.     When the       sun   is at its highest the air is receiving its
maximum heating effect, but owing to its inertia it does not acquire
its maximum temperature           till a  later hour,   till near two o'clock, at
which hour the amount of heat received                 is balanced     by that lost.
After that     the temperature      of the air falls, but the curve represent
ing its fall is later than A, owing to the inertia of the air, which
affects   a  falling as well     as  a  rising   temperature.        The same ex
planation applies to the yearly maximum, and shows why it does
not occur in June, when the sun is highest and the greatest number
of hours daily above the horizon, but at             a later date, when its heat
ing power has considerably diminished.
     The curve C in the figure            represents    the   effect which     a  still
greater    inertia has on the rise of temperature              in    a body heated
by the air.        As  the temperature        of A  never falls quite to that of
C, the curve C never falls, but only varies               in the rate at which it
rises.     It will    be as well     to note here, that all these effects of
inertia in checking and retarding the heating of large bodies                      are
 quite apart from the question of radiation and its effects on large
 and small bodies, which, as has been shown in a previous paper,
 acts   in exactly the opposite        way,    and tends to heat large bodies
 to a higher temperature        than small ones.
     Let  us now turn to the practical consideration of the subject, and
 see    what the effect of inertia really is on the readings given by
 different arrangements         of apparatus.      On    PL II.   fig. 2, are shown
 curves of temperatures          drawn      from readings      given by different
 arrangements,      each having a different inertia.         The curve     FB shows
 the readings of a very fine bulbed thermometer.                This   thermometer,
 as was    explained in a previous part of this investigation, was con
 structed to be used as a standard of air temperatures,                  with which
 to compare the readings given by the different screens.                 The bulb of
 this instrument is 25 mm. long, but it has             a  diameter of only about
  1 '5 mm       When in use, it is exposed         under a horizontal sunshade
  in  the manner described       in Part    II., and the bulb is protected from
  radiation by means of        a sheath    of pure silver, which fits it closely,
  but does not press upon it.
      The readings     given by this instrument were              considered to      be
  nearer   the true temperature        of the air than those given by any
   other arrangement,     as  they always kept lowest while there was any

radiation.         It   will, however,     be evident that its inertia is very
small,     and when exposed           either without    its silver sheath or when
covered      with chemically deposited silver, its sensitiveness is very
remarkable,         its indications showing constant fluctuations in the
temperature         of  the air,   as the   mercury is in a continual state of
pulsation whenever there is any radiation                   effect.     These changes
amount       often to more than        a degree   in less than a minute, even        in
an October day, and are much greater in bright summer                          weather.
The fluctuations do not seem to be due to variations in the radia
tion,    as   they are observed         even when radiation appears to be con
stant, either under a clear sun or after it has been under a dense
cloud for a time.           These changes of temperature            would seem to be
due to the       air that is    heated on the ground and on other radiation
heated bodies not being perfectly mixed with                      the  colder air, one
part of the eddy formed by the passing air having                      more heated air
in it than another.*
     The curve        FB,  fig. 2, is drawn from      temperature given by this
 fine-bulbed      thermometer without any silver covering.                   The curve
 LB    shows     the readings of another thermometer               with  a larger bulb,
 eiposed     bare, alongside the fine-bulbed one.                Its bulb is    22 mm.
    *
      This conclusion seems to be confirmed by observations made by Mr Dickson
 with this instrument      at the top of Ben Nevis. He informs me that he never
 observed any of these rapid fluctuations at that station.            The air heated on
 the slopes  of the mountain will be carried away sideways by the wind, and the
 small amount      of heating effected by the limited area of ground at the top does
 not seem   to be sufficient to give rise to these changes.
    Professor Langley,      in his celebrated researches with the bolometer, has
 observed    certain fluctuations in the intensity of the solar radiation from
niinute to minute.         As these fluctuations were ten times the instrumental
errors, he is satisfied they have a real existence.      He says the solar radiation
would have been constant, but that the amount transmitted varied from minute
to minute even in what appeared a cloudless            sky.     It is evident that the
fluctuations    observed by Professor Langley and those indicated by the fine-
bnlbed   thermometer are not of the same order, although they take place at
about the same intervals.        The variations given by the thermometer are much
too great to be due to variations in the amount of transmitted heat As we have
a satisfactory explauation of the fluctuations indicated by the thermometer,         it
seems possible      that Professor  Langley's fluctuations may be due to the same
cause.    It  is very difficult to suppose a want of uniformity in the upper air so
great as to cause these     fluctuations in such short intervals of time. It seems
 more probable     that the variations observed with the bolometer are due to the
 imperfectly mixed hot and cold, moist and dry air near the surface of the
 earth, which will affect the readings of that instrument by absorption and
 by radiation.

long and       7 mm.    in diameter.       It has therefore    a greater inertia than
the other.         A and B are the curves of temperature              for two Steven
son screens, one with the bottom open and the other                    with it   closed;
while C is the curve of temperature                    given by the        new screen
presently to be described.              The temperatures        shown in fig.     2 were
taken on the          1 8th  October.       There were a few passing          clouds at
the time, and a strongish north-east wind was blowing.                    The readings
 were taken simultaneously              by two     observers, at intervals of one
 minute from         11-59    to 12-20, when they were stopped              on account
 of the radiation effect falling to zero, and all the different ther
 mometers       reading nearly alike.
     It   will  be seen from an examination of the curves that the fine-
 bulbed thermometer            moved      much    more    rapidly    than any of the
 others.       This   is not shown so well in the curves as               it might     be,
 as the    interval of one minute is much too large to show the fluctu
 ation of this instrument, for in the interval between two observations
 it often indicated         temperature       much above or below the recorded
 readings.        In   the first rise of the curves        from    12   to 12.2,    there
 is no very great difference             in their   steepness.      This is probably
 due to no observations being taken at                   12. 1 j but take the rise
 beginning        at 12.4,     and here       the  effect   of   the   inertia   of the
 different arrangements            is very marked.         From     12.4   to 12.5 the
 fine-bulbed thermometer             rose 0°-8, and the large bulb 0°-3, while
 the screens only rose about 0°*1.              During    the next minute the rate
  of increase of temperature           of the fine bulb greatly diminished, as it
  was near the temperature             of the air, while the rate of the others
 increased.        It will  be noticed that the two exposed              bulbs   FB   and
  LB arrived at       their maximum and began to fall before                the screens
  A and B got         to their maxima, and so long as the               full continued
 they kept falling in advance of the others.                 In  the rapid fall which
 began at 12.11, in one minute the fine bulb                  fell 0°*9, the large one
  0°-7  ;  while the screens      A   and B fell only about 0""3, and they took
  four minutes to fall the 0°-9 lost by the fine bulb in one minute.
  One effect of this is that while the fine bulb,               if read at very      short
  intervals, would give         a  curve like the edge of a saw, with irregular
  teeth    set at intervals       of less than one minute, the inertia of the
  screens causes them to smooth              over  these irregularities, and to give
   a curve with fewer and less abrupt changes.

     It will  be observed        that while these curves               show fairly well the
effect    of inertia      on the rate of the heating and cooling of the
thermometers,         yet they do not show that                     the   arrangement          with
smallest inertia gives the highest readings,                       as we   concluded from          a
consideration        of  the curves      in     fig. 1.      The reason for this is that
the curves     in   fig. 2 are   complicated by radiation effects.                     The large
bulb and one Stevenson screen                     read higher than            the fine-bulbed
thermometer.            This    was    caused         by those         arrangements          being
more affected by radiation than the fine bulb.                          If we     take   readings
given by the screen C and the fine bulb — the two which                                 are least
affected    by radiation — it will          be observed           that the fine bulb rises
above and      falls below C,       somewhat           in the manner indicated in the
imaginary curves fig.           1, only    it    rises    too high, owing to its being
more heated       than C by radiation.
    It may    be as well to note here that the two thermometers                           exposed
under the sunshade did not give more                           correct    temperatures         than
the screens,     but it must       be remembered             that they were not coated
with silver when these readings were taken.                          It  may be interesting
to note     that     the fine     bulb    gave       lower      readings      than     the    large
bulb, though similarly exposed                ;  this will be seen from an examina
tion     of the     curves     FB and LB.                All   the    curves     in this     figure
follow     each other more         closely than they would under many con
ditions.      The    reason for their comparative closeness on this occasion
was     doubtless the amount of wind that was blowing at the time
tho    readings     were taken.        It   is evident that a quick circulation of
air   will have     great influence      in reducing          the time necessary to heat
or cool the screens,           and   will have very much                  less    effect   on the
exposed bulbs.           I   much regret           I    was    unable to        return to this
investigation       till  late  in   the season, by which                time the radiation
effects    were    greatly reduced,          and,       owing to the amount of bad
weather, very few observations were                      made.       The curves        shown in
fig.   2 are   the rasult of the only one-minute observations                              I   have
been     able to make.          If  these     readings       had been taken in spring
or summer,         and when there was                  sunshine       and    little wind,        the
fluctuations     would      have    been much more marked,                  and the relative
steepness     of the different curves better brought out.
    Turning now to the consideration of the question                                as   to what
 interpretation      we are entitled to put on curves of temperature                          made

from observations taken at longer or shorter intervals of time, a
very little consideration         will show     us that these curves, as geuerally
constructed,       are in  no sense curves of temperature.
     An examination of          the one-minute observations            given in fig. 2
shows us that the curve of daily temperature                 is much too complicated
to be capable of being represented              in the manner it generally is.          A
few detached          observations     at hourly      intervals tell us really very
little about the matter, and to attempt to draw a curve from these
 can lead to no good, as the curve appears to give definiteness where
 in fact almost        all is unknown       ; this is particularly the case when
 there    is any radiation.          Observations taken at intervals so wide
 apart     as   one    hour   really    tell us      nothing      about   the   state   of
 matters in the intervals, and yet by connecting these hourly read
 ings by means of curves we not only indicate the temperatures                          in
 the interval, but we may even represent                 the temperature     at the hour
 of observation to be rising or falling                 when in reality it may          be
 doing quite the opposite.
      To illustrate the small value we are entitled to put on curves
 drawn from hourly observations of temperature, the curves in PI. II.
  fig. 3, are drawn from one of the few 6ets of observations taken
  recently at regular intervals.             The curve       A   is drawn from obser
  vations taken at five-minute intervals, and it will be seen that
  during the two hours while the observations were made, there
  were     great   fluctuations     in the temperature.            An   examination      of
  fig. 2  will,   however,   show us that even during five-minute intervals
  considerable      changes may have taken place.               The curve A, fig. 3,     is
   therefore    not so variable      as  the actual state of the air was            when
   these five-minute readings           were    taken.        Suppose    now that,      in
   stead of taking the temperature            every five minutes,       we had done      it
   at hourly      intervals.     If, for   instance,      we   had selected,      not the
   hour but five minutes to the hour, for the                     time for taking      our
   readings,     then we should have             got   the   curve   B.    If, however,
   we had      selected five minutes past the            hour for our observations,
   we should have got the curve               C, while     if  the readings     had been
    taken five minutes later the curve would have been D.                     This latter
    curve would have shown            a  higher maximum for the day of               2° "75
    above    that given by curve          B.     This   difference    might have been
    brought about,       as  stated,    by    the    hour at which         the    observa

tions were made, or        it might    have resulted from the hour at which
the high maximum happened              to be reached, or      it might   even have
been produced       bj   an error   in our  time-keeper,     either advancing or
retarding the time of observations,            while keeping them at hourly
intervals.      It is evident, therefore,    that curves of temperature drawn
from readings        taken at intervals, unless      very short, have but little
value, and      may be most misleading.           It  would be better therefore,
instead of curving the results, simply to connect               them with straight
lines, so as to enable the eye easily to catch the successive readings,
it being understood that these lines give no information                  as  to the
state   of matters between the observations.
                                      New Screen.
    In Part      III.   of this communication           (Proc.   Roy. Soc.    Edin.,
No.   121) reference       was made to some         attempts    made to check the
entrance      of radiant   heat through the air passages into the draught
tube screen.        The most successful        results were got by introducing
small screens between the bulb of the thermometer and the source
of radiation, and so arranging the air circulation                 that all air that
had touched the radiation-heated surfaces was drawn away through
side passages,      and only the central         core    of unheated    air allowed
to pass     on to the centre of the screen, and come into contact with
the bulb       and its surroundings.           The plan, however, which was
found     to work well in       a room,   in still   air, was found to be quite
unsuitable for observations in the open air, owing to the wind
causing      eddies inside the screen which interfered with the proper
circulation of the air, and mixed the air heated on the screens with
 that entering the centre         chamber    ;  an attempt was therefore        made
to see     if  the principle could not be modified to enable               it  to  be
 applied    in  a form suitable for open-air observations.
    A number of complicated forms            suggested     themselves,   but as all
 of them seemed likely to give rise to eddies inside the screen, they
were abandoned without             trial.  At last     the simple form shown        in
fig.  1   was designed,       and    a screen   of this form was constructed
 at the beginning         of October.       The    figure shows      a vertical   sec
 tion through        the centre.       As will     be 6een,     it is of extremely
 simple construction.         The circulation of air through this screen is
 entirely affected by the natural movements               of the air.   No rnodifi

cation       of it with         draught         tuhe has        yet been       attempted.            The
screen consists of two distinct                    parts,     — the lower, or       screen proper,
surrounding the bulb of the thermometer, is constructed to protect the

thermometer          from all radiation from below, while the upper part pro
tects the lower screen from the direct rays of the sun.                                 The upper
part consists of         a square sunshade               AA    made of wood, and supported
in a horizontal position at the proper height from the ground by
means of four wooden supports                      LL attached         to the corners, and fixed
firmly in the ground.                 If   the direct rays of the sun fell on                    AA it
would get highly heated, and would heat the air on the under side
of    it,   which might affect the readings of the thermometer.                               To pre
vent this, another piece of wood                       MM      is   placed over    AA   parallel to
it,   but with an air space between                      the two, to check the passage of
heat downwards.                 The lower part of the screen consists of the three
plates       C,   D, and    E,   fixed parallel to each other and to the lower
side of the sunshade                 AA in the position shown.                     The plates are
held in their places by long screw nails passing                               through the fonr
corners.          These plates may be made of any substance that                            is   a   non
conductor of heat           ;   wood       is   the only material yet tried.             The bulb
of the thermometer              t   is   placed   in     the space between         the two plates
C     and D, where         it   is   protected from all radiation both from above
and below,           and   to protect        it   from the horizontal radiation,                  it   is
surrounded by the annular piece                        F      shaped   in    the   manner     shown.
The stem of the thermometer                       t      passes upwards through             the      sun
shade, and         is   protected     by means of the louvred box N.
      When        the screen was first used, the sunshade                    part consisted only
of the two pieces            AA and MM, but when the sun                           got very      low in
winter       it   was found to affect the                 correctness       of the readings,         and

the small     vertical sunshades         00       were    added to the screen.            These
pieces      of wood are fixed in a sloping position, to prevent any air
heated on them from passing downwards towards the thermometer.
As these pieces        will slightly interfere with the air circulation, it
is possible      the screen will act hotter without them, if observations
do not require to be made                when the sun is very low.                      They are
not, of course, required on the north side of the screen, or where
houses or trees        shut out    a   low sun.          The best size for the sunshade
has yet to be         determined.       If    made       larger than shown, say           3 feet
square,     then only a very low sun could have any effect on the read
ings.       This screen for future reference is called screen C.
     Let us look at the action of this screen when placed in the open
air.      It will   be seen that the air has a very free circulation                     through
it   ;   the plates being horizontal and placed                   at a distance       from each
other, the air has a perfectly free passage through                          it from whatever
direction     it may     blow.     It will        be further noticed that the bulb is
perfectly protected from radiation from all bodies outside.                              Turning
now to the          manner in which the heat absorbed                     by the screening
surfaces is prevented from affecting the readings of the thermometer                                 :
First, the large sunshade              AA    prevents any part of the screen proper
from being heated by the direct rays of the sun, and                          it   has thus only
the diffused radiation to contend with.                         The under side of        AA will
be a good        deal heated, but the hot air in contact                     with it will pass
between          AA    and C, and not come into                    contact     with the bulb.
The plate        E, with   the air space between            it and D,        prevents    the heat
radiated from the ground passing                     upwards to the upper surface of
D.        If D   was a perfect         non-conductor,           E would       be unnecessary.
The only hot air that really gets into the screen surrounding                                   the
bulb is the air heated on the under surface of C and upper surface
of D, and also that heated on the upper and under surfaces                                  of F.
As will be seen from the construction of the screen, very little heat
falls on the surfaces of           C and D,         bo   they   will   be but little heated           ;
but the air that gets heated on these surfaces does not come into
contact      with     the bulb, but tends to flow straight through and out at
the other side of the            screen, keeping to the             surfaces       of the plates.
This       will not   be the case      when the wind is strong, but when the
conditions are trying, that                 is,   with little wind,      it    seems probable
that the heated air         will    pass through without mixing much                     with   the

     cold.          It will      be seen from this that the radiant heat which                                        will
     affect the thermometer                  will   be that absorbed                  by the two horizontal
     surfaces of           F, and     the heat absorbed at the outer surfaces of                                  F, and
     conducted through the wood into the inner chamber                                                   surrounding
     the thermometer bulb.                    The amount of heat received from the first
    of these sources will                  be very small, as the horizontal surfaces                               of F
    receive          most    of their        heat    at       second       hand, that              is,   after being
    radiated and reflected                   from   C     and D.            The amount received                         by-
    direct radiation               from without               is   very small, and               is      represented
'
    by the angle             KIH      in the figure       ;    from which              it   will     be seen that
    these surfaces have               a    verv limited exposure                  to outside objects,                 and
    the amount conducted through                     F        is   probably very small.                      It will    be
    seen from the sketch that the annular piece                                  F     has its outer surface
    groove-shaped.                The object of this groove                is   to prevent the air heated
    on   it    from flowing into the inner chamber, the groove conducting                                               it
    round the outside.                   How    far this groove                 is.   necessary,         or to what
    extent          it    improves the readings,               I      cannot say, nor can                    I        say
    whether the double bottom                       is    necessary,         or whether the passage
    between          F     and    D     might not         be abolished, and                    the       screen     and
    sunshade             thus made smaller.              It   was thought advisable to take all
    these          precautions,       as    there   was        not        time this            season        to    work
    upwards from the simpler to the more complicated;                                                these points
    were therefore            left for future consideration.
         It   may be mentioned               that this screen has been tried without the
    annular piece            F,   and   it   was found to work                  very well, but did not
    give quite such low readings                    as    with       it   in, and its inertia was also
    much less without the ring.                     When             the piece        F   is   out, the bulb            is
    freely exposed to radiation from all surrounding objects                                       ;     but as the
    space between            C    and   D    can then be reduced,                 the bulb           does not get
a    very wide view of the outside.                            Its    readings         without the annular
piece were very much more correct than the Stevenson                                               screen.         This
at first may               seem strange, as the bulb of the thermometer                                       in   it   is
much more freely exposed                       to radiation than the one in the Steven
son screen.                The reason for its lower readings would appear to                                           be
that          it    is   exposed      to the radiation from trees and other objects
high up, freely exposed to the wind, and therefore                                          cooler       ;   whereas
the bulb in the Stevenson screen                              is   exposed            to the highly heated
grass.             This new       screen without          the ring has not been                          tried in      a

 situation exposed to walls and other large surfaces                that get highly
 heated   in the sunshine.
    Owing to the lateness of the season, no trials with this screen
have been made under severe test conditions.                 In   the beginning of
 October    it  was   fitted up on the lawn, and near it was placed                  a
 horizontal sunshade        under which was placed the fine-bulbed ther
 mometer    with its silver    sheath, and a considerable         number of com
parative readings were taken.            This   was done on a number of days
and   in different conditions of      weather, and the screen has proved itself
to be considerably       in  advance of all the others.        Its   readings   being
quite as good as those given by the fine silvered bulb,                   I  shall not
attempt to say which gives           the lowest readings,       as   the conditions
of the trials have not been sufficiently severe or varied enough to
bring out any decided difference ; but under             all conditions yet tried
the screen was quite as low as the silvered bulb.                It   is unnecessary
here to give any detailed account           of these trials by themselves,         but
I   shall presently give some comparative readings                 taken with this
screen,   with the   Stevenson      screen  with    the bottom open,        and with
it closed, also with the silvered bulb, showing that the new screen
gives much       lower and more         correct  readings than either of the
other screens, and,       as the circulation      through it is very free, these
lower temperatures cannot be due to the high inertia of the new
screen.
                                  Trial of Screens.
    In  the first and second parts         of this communication the results
were given      of some trials of different methods of protecting the
thermometer       against     the   effects   of  radiation.     The     conclusions
arrived at were, that the most           correct   readings   were given by the
thermometer      placed   in  a strong current of air produced          by a suction

these two methods        agreed    very well with each other, and either of

these standards,      the   ordinary Stevenson        screen was found to give
readings of from l°-3 to 2°-8 too high, when there was much radia

error was greatly reduced.
    After     these tests were made, the Scottish Meteorological Society
took up the matter, and made                          a    number of comparative                         trials with
the apparatus.             The first of these tests were made at G ronton                                          in
the summer             of 1885 by Mr H. N. Dickson.                                  After the Granton
work was concluded,                Mr Dickson took                      some of the screens to the
top of Ben Nevis, continued                     the investigation there, and produced                                a
most careful and elaborate set of observations                                      under the conditions
existing at the top of the mountain.                              The Ben Nevis work has not
yet been published, but Mr Dickson                                  communicated                    some    of    the
results of his work at Granton to the Royal Society                                           of Edinburgh.*
In this communication                  he gives curves of the temperatures                                 for two
days.       These      temperatures            were taken by the fan apparatus,                                   the
silvered bulb, and               one    Stevenson             screen       with bottom                   open     and
another      with it closed.              On examining these curves                                 I    was much
astonished         to find that           they confirmed                 none            of the conclusions
arrived at from trials made here.                           At Granton           the fan and silvered
bulb      did     not give        the         best        results   ;    the        silvered            bulb     read
highest throughout the whole of the second day, and further there
was      little   to    choose between,                   in the readings                of    the       Stevenson
sereens with open or closed bottoms.
    These results obtained by                   Mr Dickson              at Granton are so different
from mine, that              I   thought it necessary to reconsider                                     the matter,
and again go over my work, under the conditions existing here.                                                     In
my first trials        I   had only one Stevenson                       screen       ;    its readings           were
compared with those               given        by the fan apparatus                           and the thermo
meter      with silvered          bulb    ;    and,        comparing           the        readings        with the
standards         when the bottom                    was     out and           when            it   was     in, the
result was greatly in favour of the observations made                                                     with the
bottom closed.             Mr Dickson            made his trials with two screens, —one
sent by me with louvred bottom                              and     double top, and another of
the ordinary pattern,             that    is,    with bottom open.
    In    the     autumn, my old screen with                              its louvred               bottom       was
returned from the trials at Granton and Ben Nevis, and                                              I     obtained
a   new one of the standard                     pattern       and exactly similar, only                         witli

1887.]             Mr John Aitken on Thermometer                            Screens.               67
following is called screen A, and the old one B.                               The screens were
fitted upon the lawn at a distance                   of about      15    feet apart,    in   as nearly
as    possible      similar exposures to sun and wind.                       This was done on
the       14th    September,     and in order to make sure that both screens
gave the          same    temperature,           comparative        trials were         made     with
them, the bottoms of both being open.                          Though         the day was not a
very suitable one for the test, as there was not much radiation,                                  still
the old screen           was found          to give higher readings              than the other
by about half a degree.                    This   was owing to the paint being dirty,
and the surface           of its louvres being better absorbers of heat than
the louvres of the new and clean one.                       The screens were now painted
white, after which they looked nearly alike in whiteness,                               and on trial
with both bottoms open were found to give readings nearly alike.
     As it would      be almost        impossible to set up the two screens in posi
tions exactly alike with regard                    to exposure      to wind, radiation,           &c,
both screens         were provided            with movable bottoms,               so that either
could be worked with the bottom closed while the other was open.
When testing the screens, sometimes the same screen was kept closed
throughout the whole day, at other times first the one then the
other would be closed, while the external conditions                              remained        con
stant, so as to check any difference                   in   temperature         due     to position
or condition of screen, direction of wind,                       <fec.
     In   these trials the ordinary thermometer                  used for taking wet and dry
bulb observations was employed.                        The wet bulb with its apparatus
was removed,          and the thermometer              in each screen was placed where
the wet          one usually     is,   the index of the instrument                     being turned
slightly round, so that           it    could be read by opening the door to only
a    very small extent.          The object of this was to prevent radiant heat
entering and altering the readings while they were being taken;                                   also
to prevent radiation heating the inside of the screen.                                 The thermo
meters with which most                  of the observations were made had round
bulbs      about    8    mm.   diameter,          but others      with smaller bulbs were
occasionally        used.      All     the       thermometers        were graduated            on the
stems,      had wide scales, and were easily read.                          In addition        to the
Kew corrections,            they were all carefully compared with each other
in    water at intervals of            5   degrees or less.          The room          where    these
comparisons          were      made        was    heated    to     the     temperature         of the
water, so        that the temperature of the large volume of water surround

ing the thermometers        might be kept constant,        and   the errors due
to   imperfect mixing he        as  small   as   possible.     It  may    be  also
mentioned that the         same thermometers       were not kept in the same
 screens, but they were changed from time to time, to check any error
that might arise from any unknown difference in the thermometers,
and every       precaution that could be thought of was                taken    to
check the results.
    The maximum thermometers used were all graduated on the stems
and   placed    vertically in tho screens with their bulbs in the usual
 position.    They were held in their places by spring clips, to prevent
 the position of the index being altered        by shaking,    a source  of error
to which the metal-framed        instruments loosely hung are very liable.
 The instruments were         carefully tested with their stems vertical.
 The    common      maximum thermometers            with    metal   frames    and
 placed horizontally were discarded,       as  they were found to give most
 uncertain results, and never agreed with the others in the same screen,
 owing to the index in these instruments moving too easily, and
 more   or less easily at different parte of the bore,          thus forming a
 longer or shorter air space at different parts of the scale.           Further,
 under certain conditions they gave different readings            from the ordi
 nary thermometers       with freely exposed bulbs.         They read too low
 if the high temperature       remained    only  a  short time, owing to their
 greater inertia  ; and in the open Stevenson screen they read too high
 when radiation remained         Btrong  for any length of time, owing to
 their larger surface causing them to be much more heated than the
 thermometers     with freely exposed bulbs,       as the frame     and thermo
 meter really act as one surface.       The maximum thermometers             were
 changed    from screen to screen, generally every day or second day,
 as an extra check on possible errors.
    A  great number of observations        were    made, extending from        the
 15th of     September     to the   end   of November.          On many days
 when there was much radiation,          a great    number of readings were
taken at short intervals, and on as many other days as possible the
temperature     was taken by maximum thermometers.               The result has
been entirely to confirm my first conclusions.               The closed screen
always gave lower readings than the open one.
    The fan apparatus was not put on trial,          as  there were too many
readings   to be taken without it.      In   a trial like this the readings      of

ali    the instruments        ought to be taken at the same moment, owing
to the constant changes            of temperature in             the air.        In   practice   it    is
therefore       desirable to make the number of thermometers                          to be read as
few as possible.           The silvered bulb was, however, again put on trial,
and as before,        it   gave readings        much below the Stevenson screen;
considering the season, its readings were as much below the screen
as was      observed in the first trials already mentioned.
     On 2l8t September a number of readings were taken from time
to time     during most of the day with the two Stevenson screens,                                 the
bottom      of A being closed, while B was open. These readings                                    are
marked      off at the top of PI.       III.,   and the different readings connected
by straight lines.           The day was fine, with passing clouds, a little
wind, and radiation fairly strong for the time of the year.                                 It will
be observed, that          till after mid-day        there was but little difference                  in
the readings of the two screens ; this was owiug to there being but
little radiation      before that hour.           At       a   little   before   12 o'clock the
open screen was only 0°-3 above the closed one.                              A little     before       1
o'clock     the bottom        was taken out of                 A, and by         1    o'clock both
screens read nearly alike.
     The bottom was again put in A, and when the next reading was
taken at 1.15 the open             screen read 0°-5 higher than the closed one,
and during the whole day the open one gave the highest readings,
the amount varying according to the radiation at the time.                              The black
parts at the top of the diagram represent sunshine; they cannot, how
ever, be very correct,         as they are      drawn from the notes taken at the
hour the readings were             made, and thus only represent                     the condition
of    matters     at that time,       no intermediate record                 being taken.             A
sunshine        recorder would have enabled                    me to put in these curves
more correctly.            The general result        is,   however, very easily seen from
the record given.           It will   be noticed,          that whenever there was sun
shine the open screen read much higher than the closed one, and that
during the absence of sunshine they tended to read alike, but                               it   was
not    till after radiation had entirely          ceased that they read quite alike.
At    the   2   o'clock and the 2.5 readings the open screen was 0°'9 higher
than the other, while          a   little   before    3    o'clock      the difference      was as
much as         11.

placed where the wet bulb usually                    is,   and which gave the readings

shown on PI.     III.,  another thermometer        was hung up at the back of
each screen, with its bulb in the place where the bulb of the maximum
thermometer     is usually situated,    and readings of these thermometers
were taken at the same time as the others.                These readings      showed
that the thermometers       placed at the back of the screens indicated on
this occasion a greater difference than those placed at the sides.                The
one placed at the back of the screen with open bottom was as much
as  l0-4 higher than the one at the back of the closed screen.
   The readings given in the middle of PI.               III.,   taken on the 25th
September,    show that the open bottom affects the readings                not only
on fine sunshiny days, but also on dull ones.                    On the 25th, the
sky was uniformly covered         all over with a dense mass of clouds,
through which the sun          was   never visible.         But though clouded,
there   was a good deal of heat reflected and radiated from the sky,
the surfaces    of all exposed bodies were hotter than the air, and the
temperature    of the grass rose     as  much     as   twelve degrees above the
temperature    of the atmosphere.       At  the beginning of this trial screen
A  was open, while      B was closed.     At   11   o'clock, when the first read
ings were taken, there was but little difference in the temperatures
given by the two screens, but at 11.35 the open screen read 0°-5
higher than the closed one.           After   the 11.35        reading, the bottom
was taken out of B, and put into A.             After which it will be seen
that the lines connecting the temperatures              cross each other, and B,
which at first was closed and read lowest, now that it is open reads
higher than the closed one by 0°-6.           These readings         show that even
on a   dull day   there may be a considerable          difference    in the readings
given by the two screens.
   The third sot of observations        at the foot of        PL  III. show a series
made on the      7th October with the two screens                A  and B and with
the new screen C.        In  these curves, as well as        in those taken on the
 25th September,     there is a curve    marked G.           This curve represents
the temperature      of the grass, and was taken by means of a thermo
meter placed with its bulb on the grass underneath the open screen.
This   curve  is not drawn to the same scale as the others, as there
 would not be room for it        ; the temperature         rises so high     it could
 not be represented      within  the limits    of the plate.          For this  curve
each space between the lines represents           1  degree, instead of 0°-2 of a
degree, and as the disturbance produced              by the hot grass will       be in

proportion to the excess of its temperature above that of the air, the
lowest curve — namely C, in the 7th October observations — is taken
as the base line, and the excess of the temperature of the grass above
C is marked off. For instance, at 11.30, the temperature of the air
as given by C was 57°, while the grass was 70°, or 13 degrees above
 C. Read in this way, the G observations show us that at 12.10 the
 grass was 18 '5 degrees above the temperature of the air.
     No curve is given of the silvered-bulb observations, though they
 were taken at the same time.                The reason for this is that they would
 only confuse        the figure, as they were practically the same as those of
 the screen C, only they were sometimes                   a  little higher and    at other
 times a little lower than C, owing to                     the smaller inertia of the
 silvered bulb.
      The day on which this trial was made was fine, with some wind
 from the south-west till near mid-day, when it fell, the air was clear,
  and there      were a few passing clouds.            It  was not thought advisable
  to take readings till near          11  o'clock,   as   the Stevenson      screens were
  quite wet in        the morning, and         tended     to read low, owing to the
  evaporation.         At  10.45, when the readings were begun, the bottom
  of screen A       was open, and     B closed        Headings were taken with the
  screens in this condition        till 11.45.     After which      screen  A  was closed,
  and B       opened.     At   12.30    the condition of the screens            was again
  reversed, B being closed and            A  open.
       It  will  be noticed that from 10.45          to 11.45 there was not much
   difference between        the open      screen   A   and the closed one B, even
   though      the radiation     effect   was   strong,     as  will  be seen from the
   amount of sunshine indicated by the black area below                        the curves
   and by the curve G. The maximum difference between                            A   and B
   amounted       to only    0°'5 ;   this was probably due             to the strongish
   wind blowing        at the time.      After   11.45, when the bottom of           A was
   closed, and B opened,          the lines connecting the temperatures               cross
   each other, and       B now, instead of being the lower,               becomes     much
   the    higher, the open ecroen showing a maximum difference                      of l°-5
    at  12.10.     This  great error    in  the readings of the open screen             was
    doubtless due to the wind             dying away at this hour.              After   the
    bottoms were again reversed, the lines again cross each other                 ;  but as
    the   sun did not again come out, and the radiation curve                 G fell very
    low,    there was not much difference          in   the two screens ;      but it will

72             Proceedings     of Royal Society of Edinburgh,                 [us.     17,
be observed,      that as long    as  the readings were token, the open               one
always read      a little higher than the closed one.
    The curve C shows the temperatures               given by the new screen,
fig.   1.     It will    bo   observed     that its readings      are    very much
below those of either of the Stevenson                screens.     This      difference
varied from time to time, according to the amount of radiation, but
it always     remained    during the whole time of the observations a good
deal    lower than the others.           At  12.10  it attained its         maximum
difference, being at that hour 2°-3 lower than the ordinary Stevenson,
and 0o,8 lower than the closed Stevenson.
    In addition to       the observation      6hown    on   PL   III.   a  number of
others have also been taken, but the particulars need not be given
here.     The general result has always been the           same.    The Stevenson
screen with closed bottom always read lower than the open one, and
the C screen lower than either, the amount depending on the radia
tion, wind, &c, at the time.              The observations on PL            II.   fig.  2,
show the readings of the three screens on the 18th October.                      On thie
occasion the difference       in the screens was not great          It will     be seen
that the open Stevenson            only went 0°-5 higher than the C               screen,
while the closed one was only 0°-2 higher.                 This small        difference
was due to the lateness of the season, the small amount of radia
tion at the time, together with the strength                and direction of the
 wind.      The wind was fresh, and from the north-east               ;   it  therefore
entered     by the cold side of the Stevenson            screens, and tended to
 keep    the side of the screen         on which the sun was shining colder
 than   if it  had come from the opposite direction.
     Further,    in   addition   to    these observations,     made at short           in
tervals of time with the ordinary              thermometers,      the temperature
 has been taken almost every day in the three screens by maximum
 thermometers,      and the result is always the same.          On very few days
 do they all read alike     ;  only when there is stormy weather and               dense
masses of clouds ; at all other times            there are differences,         but the
 three screens always keep the same relative position,             C being       lowest,
 and the closed screen lower than the open.               It may be mentioned,
that in these trials with            the maximum      thermometers,          the    same
instruments were not always kept in the same screens, but                            were
generally changed every morning, to equalize any instrumental errors,
and screens A and B were worked alternately open and closed.

    Even    so late as the beginning of November,             I was astonished     to find
that the three screens gave very different readings,                   as  will  be seen
from the following maximum temperatures                    observed on 31st October
and 1st and 2nd November:               —

     On   these   three days      the   weather was very fine, with sunshine
and little wind, and on all of these the ordinary Stevenson gave
readings of from       1° to   l°-2 higher than        the C screen.
    These differences       in   the readings astonished          me greatly at the
time; and when on the 16th of November a difference of more than
a degree     was again recorded         in  the  readings of the Stevenson            and
the C screen,       I  began     to have some doubts as to the correctness
of the results,       as  I  thought that long before             November arrived
 radiation would be so weak that it would not interfere seriously
with    the correctness     of the readings given by the Stevenson screen;
and yet the observations showed that on some days                     in this month
 the error was very considerable.             It was, therefore, thought advisable
 to make some more trials of the screens by means                   of ordinary ther
 mometers,     and taking readings at short intervals.                  The morning
 of the 17th November being fine, with little wind and a cloudless
 sky, readings were taken at five-minute interval*                  On this occasion
 it was not found           possible to        make   a comparison        between     the
 ordinary    Stevenson screen and            the modified form, because,           owing
 to the lowness     of   the sun, the shadows          of the tops of one or two
 distant   trees   passed    across the screens,         sometimes    one and       some
 times the     other being in the shadow             ;   and   as the   screen    in  the
 shade   always read lowest, it was impossible to compare                     the open
 with the closed one.         They were therefore          both worked open, and
  the readings   taken of the one in sunshine.                 These readings,       with
  those given by screen C, are shown in the middle series of observa
 tions in PL    IV.     The readings were begun              at 11.15   a.m., but the
  Stevenson screens not being dry, no readings                were taken    with    them

74                Proceedings                of Royal Society of Edinburgh,                             [jak.    1",
till    11.45, at which                 hour there was                a    difference       of 0°"9     between
screen C and the                   Stevenson.             At     1 2.5      the difference was          as much
as l°-2, after which                it fell    to about 1°'0 at 12.30; after this hour the
weather changed, the sky clouded all over, the radiation effect gradually
fell, and the readings having no further interest were stopped.
     The following              day, the 18th, being a most                          perfect day, the trials
were continued.                On this         occasion the sun rose in a cloudless sky, and
shone brightly               till it    set.        The sun was warmer, and the wind                            less
than on the previous day.                           All   the conditions were                thus favourable
for a trial of this kind, as they tended to bring out in a                                                  marked
manner any differences                       due     to radiation.             As on       the previous day,
the         readings        were taken at five-minute                        intervals, with two               short
breaks.           They         were          begun     at        10.15       a.m.,     and continued till
3.15         p.m.; the temperatures                   are all shown             in    the lowest series of
curves         in PL IV.                 It will       be      seen        that on this          occasion        the
difference           was      often more             than 1°0, and attained a maximum
of      l°-85     at        2.20    p.m.        The       wide        separation           of the curves          at
this hour was due to the wind dying quite away, so that,                                                    though
the louvres were not exposed to so strong a radiation                                            at that        hour
as they had been at an earlier part of the day, yet they got more
highly heated, as there was no wind to cool them.
       It   may be mentioned that the fine silvered bulb was also on trial
on these two days.                      It    is,   however, impossible to enter its readings
on PL         IV.,     as   they were almost exactly the same as screen                                C,   scarcely
ever varying from                  it   more than 0°-l            ;       only once    it   was observed to
vary 0°-2, but generally the two readings were the same.                                                We      may,
therefore         look on the readings                      given by the              C     screen      as nearly
correct on those days, and those given by the Stevenson as too high.
       We now come to the consideration of the cause of this very                                              great
error in the Stevenson screen, so late in the year, when radiation                                                 is
so much reduced.                    As       the error    is     principally due to the heating                    of
the louvres             by solar radiation, and                       as    the temperature             to which
they are raised depends                        on the amount of heat received                           by    them,
and the rate at which this heat                             is   carried away by the air, we shall
consider          these two points separately.                              First,    as    to the radiation.
On the two days on which these trials were made, two different
kinds          of radiation             thermometers              were       exposed        to   the    sunshine.
One of them was                        an      ordinary vacuum black-bulb                        thermometer,

and the other was one of my radiation                   thermometers      having     a plate
14 inches       square.      The following          are the maximum          readings     re
corded     :—
             Date.               Vacuum Thermometer.                 14" Black Plate.
        November 17                          81°-5                         96° -5
                     18                      91"                          113°-5
     These radiation temperatures              seem high for so low an elevation
as the sun attained at that date, for we must remember                            that the
temperature of the air was low at the time.                      Suppose it had been
a warm summer day, and the temperature                       of   the air 75°, then the
same      solar radiation       as  that of the 18th would have                 raised the
temperature of the vacuum thermometer to 121°, and the other one
to 143°-5.        Still stronger radiation         effects were observed      on the 2nd
December; the air on this day was 32°, vac. 81°, and black surface
 111°.      This   seems to point           to a wonderful        diathermancy of the
air in winter compared                 to   summer.        I write without sufficient
observations, but         I imagine       an  equally low sun in summer would
not have anything like this heating effect.*                   Then again, the louvres
of the Stevenson screen are exposed almost perpendicularly to the
 rays of a low sun ; they therefore receive                  more heat than from an
equally hot but higher sun in summer.
     As  stated,   owing to shadows passing over the screen, it was not
 found possible to make              a    comparison during the winter months
 between      the   ordinary      Stevenson and          the modified form.            This,
however,      does not seem to be a matter of much importance, as we
 can scarcely expect to find much difference                 in their   readings    at this
 season.      The daily maximum readings                  up  to. the   16th November
do indicate an advantage                in favour of the closed form            ; but this
    *
      The greater   diathermancy of the air in winter than in summer               has been
 observed by M. Soret at Geneva, and Professor            Langley has carefully measured
 it. He finds the greater transparency in winter to be chiefly for rays of short
 wave lengths, and he finds a close relation between the diathermancy and the
 amount of vapour in the air.        I much regret I have no low-sun summer observa
 tions with which to compare my winter ones, but the difference in this, climate
 seems   to be very much       greater than that observed by M. Soret           or Professor
 I^nglcy.     This  difference   will probably    be due to the position of my observa
 tions bring much further north than Geneva or Mount Whitney,                  and subject
  to greater extreme*    of dryness and moisture.

76           Proceedings      of Royal Society of Edinburgh,                [jak.  17,
may possibly be the result of accident,              and due to the open screen
being more frequently in sunshine than the other, at the time the
maximum temperature           was attained.      The sun at this season being
very low, its rays strike so nearly horizontally they scarcely heat the
ground, all thoir heat being received              by trees and other vertical
surfaces.    There   will therefore     be but     little  heat radiated into the
screen from the ground, and there        will not     be much reflected.       While
the observations were being made on the 17 th and 18th November,
no thermometer       was    placed  on the grass, as its indications would
have    been   valueless,    owing to its showing           a great    difference in
temperature     according to the situation of the bulb.              It would have
read high and above the temperature           of the air      if it happened to     be
in sunshine, but if       shaded   by the grass it would have read much
below the temperature         of the air,  as  it  was observed      that the small
hollo ws in the grass which had got frozen during the night remained
frozen all day.     It  is evident from this that a thermometer placed on
the grass would not enable us to say whether an excess or deficiency
of heat was radiated in through the open bottom of the screen                    ; but
of course   some heat would be reflected inwards, however cold the grass.
    We may here refer to a point of some interest observed                       when
making these trials in November.               In     the  previous parts     of this
 communication       frequent     mention    has      been   made     of the     quick
 fluctuations in the        temperature    of the       passing    air, as revealed
 by the constant pulsations of the fine-bulbed thermometer.                     It was
 observed in these last trials that these quick              changes    were almost
 entirely absent.      The mercury in the fine-bulbed thermometer rose
 and   fell nearly    as   steadily as the      one     in the    C screen,    seldom
 varying from it      more     than 0°'l.     The      apparent dulness        in  the
 movements      of this instrument       would seem to be caused by the
 entire  change in the manner in which the air is heated                     by solar
 radiation in winter compared to summer.                 When    the  sun is low the
 ground is but little heated by its rays, and there is no layer of ho:
 air near its surface swept along by the wind, and imperfectly mixed
 with   the   colder air above,     to  give    rise    to a succession     of warm
 and cold parts;       and the heating received            by vertical surfaces        is
 distributed through a much greater depth of atmosphere, and is more
 easily and perfectly mixed with the passing                air.    The air passing
 the   thermometer      has therefore    a much more uniform             temperature

with   a   low than with a high sun.                  If     this is the correct explanation,
then     it confirms our conclusion that                    the fluctuations observed             in this
thermometer          in summer           were       due to imperfectly                mixed hot and
cold air, and not to variations                  in   the radiation.
  "We      now come to the consideration of the second point, namely,
the power of the passing air to check the effects of radiation.                                     It     is
very evident that this                 will depend on the                  rate at which         the      air
passes      over    the radiation-heated surfaces.                         Now,       in    summer,       we
have — apart        altogether from what we                      call wind — an unstable               con
dition of the atmosphere                 which acts quite locally.                     Owing to the
heating of the ground, the air over                    it   is rarefied and tends to rise ; its
stability is thus constantly disturbed by slight movements.                                       But in
winter we have            a    totally different condition of matters.                        Eadiation
from the earth being now                  in    excess of that towards                 it,   the surface
of the ground gets cooled, and the air on                            it   tends to become denser,
and so keep closer to the ground, and                           if   the country       is   fiat, there    is
no tendency         as    in   summer      to local movements,                  but on the contrary,
the tendency         is   towards stability.              We thus         see   that the solar radia
tion effect    in summer         is   to cause — in addition to winds proper — slight
local airs, which prevent the surface of the louvres                              in the     screen from
being      highly     heated     ;   whereas        in winter the tendency owing to                       the
lowness of the sun              is   the other way, and we have degrees of calmness
in winter, quite unknown and impossible in summer.                                           "With these
two things, namely, the high heating power of even                                 a   low winter sun,
and the great calmness of air possible and frequent at this season,
we     seem to have the explanation of                           the somewhat              unexpectedly
great error        of the Stevenson            screen observed during the winter season.
The        error at       this season          is   due      principally         to the heating of
the louvres, and but                  little    to heat radiated            in through          the open
 bottom.
     In connection with the                    more perfect calms which take                     place     in
winter       than in summer, and as showing their effects on the com
parative cooling produced by them at the different seasons, we may
here refer to the readings given by the two forms of radiation ther
 mometers       in this investigation, namely,
                used                                                            the    ordinary black-
 bulb thermometer in vacuo, and the flat black                                  surface thermometer
 having an area of 14 inches square.                            The ordinary black bulb gives
a    very complicated result, indeed                  it   is   extremely difficult to interpret

  78            Proceedings     of Royal Society of Edinburgh,           [jar. it,
  its readings.     It measures, however, chiefly the intensity of the solar
 radiation that is received at the surface of the earth, as modified by
 the surroundings of the bulb.          The flat black surface, on the other
 hand, gives the intensity of the solar radiation            as modified by air
 currents   ;  the stronger    the wind the lower the temperature        recorded
 for  a given intensity of radiation      ;  whereas the black bulb     in    vacuo
 is not much affected by wind, though it is affected by other and
 rather obscure influences; the flat black surface             therefore gives     a
 better indication        of the climate than the        black    bulb.    In   fine
 summer weather        it  was found that the flat black surface        generally
 read about       12 per cent, above the black        bulb; but in winter this
 difference has been found to be very much greater, on account               of  the
 more perfect calms at that season permitting the exposed surface to
 be more highly heated.
     But further, it    is found that there is a close relation between the
 difference   in the readings of the two radiation thermometers           and the
 errors  of the Stevenson screen.           An examination of the readings
 taken in December show that          as the  ratio of the temperature      of   the
 black surface to that of the black bulb increased,             the error   in   the
 screen increased along with it.        When the ratio of the black surface
 to the vacuum black bulb was under           1 -5, the error of the Stevenson
screen    was about      1  degree, and as the ratio increased,     the error     in
 creased along with it.       This error attained its maximum,      as far as was
 observed,    about    mid-day on the 13th of the month; at that hour
 the temperature      of the air was 34°, the vacuum black bulb 64°, and
the flat black surface        93".   The black bulb was thus 30° above the
temperature       of the air, while the black surface was 59°, or           in the
ratio of nearly two.         At that hour   the Stevenson screen reached          its
maximum error for the day, being 2°-9 above the standard.                  It   may
be noted that when the error of the screen was at its maximum the
vacuum thermometer           did not register the maximum temperature for
the month      ; indeed it was one of the lowest on the bright days, but
owing to the entire absence of wind at the time, the difference              in the
heating effect of the sun's rays on the two forms of radiation thermo
meters, and the error of the Stevenson screen attained their          maximum.
     While   on this subject,    it may be as well to consider an effect           of
these two tendencies        of air when heated and when cooled,       — the on*
to instability and currents, the other to stability and calmness.           Gives

a  condition    of weather in which           there is no wind, then         in  summer
the effect    of heating      the air on the ground is to cause ascending
currents of hot air.         There is thus an influence at work in summer
tending to keep the air near the ground at nearly the same tempera
ture at all places      within    a considerable distance      ;  while the effect of
cooling the air in winter is precisely the opposite,                as   the cooled air
tends    to sink       down     into hollows       and remain there,           where its
temperature       is further reduced        by contact with radiating surfaces.
The cooling of the air in winter, therefore, in the absence of winds,
will   tend to give        rise to differences       of temperature,         which may
amount to some degrees            within    a limited area.
    From the above         we can    see   that on    a  day on which there is no
wind, the temperature of the air in an exposed situation, and where
the sun is shining, may be some degrees warmer                     than the air in a
cup-shaped       hollow,    into which the sun's rays do                not penetrate,
 provided always that the sky overhead                 is clear and radiation into
space    strong.      Take the case of the 18th November                  :  on that day
 the temperature of the air was                45°, while the grass that was not
 exposed to the sunshine was under 32°.                     We   can easily imagine
 conditions    in which      the air resting on grass at 32°         in   a hollow into
 which the sun does not shine might easily be cooled                      some degrees
 below the      temperature       of the air above.         These    observations are
 suggested      by    the peculiar       condition    of    matters     reported     from
 different   parts of London            on the 24th November.               In  one part
 of London       the maximum           temperature      was 40°, while        at another
 it did not rise        above     32°,   a difference of      8°,   which       might be
 accounted    for in    the way above stated, as there was no wind at the
 time.
    A   record     having been kept          for   some    time of the         maximum
 temperatures        recorded    by the three        screens,   the    readings     taken
 from the 23rd September to the 25th November are marked off at
 the top of     PI.   IV.     The temperatures        were    not taken every day,
 but ev«ry      observation taken is marked.               Most of these are from
 the readings       of the maximum thermometers,              but on those days on
  which    the screens       were   under trial, the readings taken at short
 intervals were used, and the maximum recorded readings                          selected.
  As it was impossible within            the limits of the plate to record             the
  actual temperatures,        only the differences        between    the readings      are

 connected          by straight lines.                 It     will      be seen           that on only            two
 occasions did the screen                 C    give the highest readings,                         and on         these
exceptional occasions                it   was only 0°-l higher.                      As    the days on which
these       occurred       were    dull and windy,                the differences               were    probably
errors       of observation,           such      as    are     quite to be expected.                        It    will
be observed              that the close screen generally held an intermediate
position between               the     open         one     and screen               C,   its readings       being
better than the former, but not so good                                as the        latter.

high on two occasions,                    and       in November                it   was    a   degree or more
wrong eight times — in addition                           to the seven times shown on plate
there       was an error of                     on the last day of the month — and on
one occasion            in that month           it   was as much as l°-75 too high.                               The
differences        shown in PI.               IV.    are the differences                  in the maximum
readings,         but these are not necessarily the greatest differences                                    for    the
day.        Of    course, the differences              in     the maximum readings                      are what
are practically required, yet                   it    may be interesting to note that this
may not be the greatest difference for the day.                                       For      instance,    on the
21st November the maximum readings                                     for the day were 39°-6                      for
screen      C,    and 41°-2 for the open Stevenson,                             thus giving        a   difference
in the maximum for                    the day         of 1°'6          as   shown.             The day being
very trying,        a    reading was taken at                 1   o'clock, when the index of the
maximum thermometer                    in screen          C   was at 38° and in the Stevenson
at 40°-6, or        a    difference    of 2°'6.             This       great        difference     was due          to
there being        a     dead calm        a   short time before.
     The weather on the different days                         is    not entered on the plate,                      as
it   is   quite unnecessary        ;   the curves speak for themselvea                              Whenever
the reading of the screen                 C    was much below the others,                          the weather
was       fine,   and     it   was        only      during        cloudy            and 6tormy weather

the maximum           given by screen C.              The maximum difference for the
month was l*-75.                 The screens gave the same maximum on eleven
days, while the mean             maximum temperature                  for the month was 36°-78
by the Stevenson,           and 36° "25 by the C screen                     ;   that      is,   the   C   screen
gave an average           maximum temperature                     of fully half           a     degree below
the Stevenson.           Of   course, the average error                is   determined very much
 by   the number        of bright       days    in the month.                   Taking          the average
error for the fine days of the month,                it   was about             1   °-4, and     that would
have been the         error   if   the month had been bright throughout.                                    The
difference      for January 1887 promises to be very small.                                       Owing to
the   dull and clouded weather, the screens have read exactly alike on
almost       every day     of this month.             The observations for December
and    January are not entered in the plates.
     Returning       now to the consideration of why the result got by the
different     screens at Granton differ so much from those obtained here,
I   think I    have taken every precaution to ensure                                the   correctness         of
my results; and         yet we find, even so late as the middle of November,
that the Stevenson            screen     with open bottom gave higher readings
than      the closed       one    ;    also    that the thermometer with its bulb
sheathed      in silver gave, as in the previous trials, readings much
lower than      either of them, and yet the observations made at Granton
show no such           differences     ;      how   then are we to account for the
difference    in the results obtained               at the two places               ?
     The first thing        that suggests           itself as         a   possible cause of the
differences     is   the condition of the louvres                  in     the two screens.                 Was
the    one    dirtier than the other, or were the absorbing powers                                           of
the paints      on the two screens different                  1       We    have seen that, on                a
not very      trying day, in September,                   the absorbing powers                        of the
two screens used         in my        last trials caused          a   difference          of about 0o,5.
On    a   bright     day, such as those on which the Granton trials were
made, this difference            would be greater         ;   and     if    the closed screen was
in the Granton trials              the better       absorber          of the two, this might
have      neutralised      any advantage             arising          from          its   being closed.
With regard to the explanation                       of the high readings given by
the silvered         bulb at Granton,          I    have great difficulty.                       No doubt,
any imperfection         in the       cleanness      of   the silver would increase                         its
absorbing     powers      and      so raise the temperature,                    but doubtless care

would be taken to keep                  the   polish in as perfect         a condition       as
possible.
     In addition, however, to            these possible sources           of   error, there is
in the situation of       the two places where the observations                   were nude
an essential    difference       which would affect the results.                 The site of
the screens at Granton was very freely exposed                       to every breath of
wind, being on      a   knoll in        the middle of a field near the sea shore,
perfectly open to the west, north, and east, while the land rose a
little to the south, and the screens were at a great distance from
trees or anything that could obstruct the free circulation of the air.
The site on which the screens are placed here is very different, and
not so good in many respects, though                    I think it will   compare favour
ably with the site of many screens in daily use.                          Here the screens
are on a lawn, and surrounded at no very great distance by trees.
As the surroundings of                the screens     seem to be a matter of greater
importance than might at first be thought, it will be as well that
I   state   more   fully       the    conditions surrounding         the       screens    here.
Standing at the screens, the view in the different directions is closed
in principally by trees.              The view to the south and round by west
to north-west is closed in by a narrow line of trees running north
and south, at a distance              of 26 yards at the point where it comes
nearest to the screens.              From the north-west to the north-east, at                a
distance    of about 24 yards, there is a holly hedge 8 feet high, and
also a few trees.        From north-east             to east are trees at a distance
From east to south-east a holly hedge running north and south, and
coming at its north end to within                  12   yards   of the screens.           From
south-east   to south are stables and kennels at a distance of 35 yards.
The ground slopes slightly                down to the north.            The      screens    are
placed east and west of each other, and all the ground                            in view     is
under grass.       It   will    be seen that, while          the position       is somewhat
sheltered    from winds blowing from east to south-east,                         it is fairlj
open to winds from south to south-west,                    as well as from north-west
and north-east.         But, on the whole,              it is evident   the site     is   much
more confined than the Granton one.
    An evident result of             the opener      exposure   of the Granton site           is,
that the Stevenson screens would                be    kept cooler there, on account           of
the freer circulation           of    the air     through the louvres,           the screens
would thus be both more nearly correct, and therefore nearly agret

    with each other and with the silvered bulb, at the more exposed
   Granton site than at the more confined one here.                  Further, on both
   days    on which      the Granton        trials were    made,    the wind    entered
   the screens from the cold side.              This of itself   is a most    important
   point, especially      if the sky is clear, as the cold sides of the screens
   may be below the temperature                of the air, and the passage of the
   air in that direction prevents the advance inwards of the heat from
   the sun-heated       louvres.      I  have noticed in the trials here that on
   all  occasions on which the wind was north of east or west the errors
   were comparatively small.            It  therefore seems possible that the more
   open exposure of the Granton site, together                with    the  direction of
   the wind at the time the two sets of the Granton observations                   were
  made, are the principal causes            of  the difference in our results.
       Since this paper was given in, Mr Dickson, who has continued
  his trials with the Stevenson            screens at the top of Ben Nevis, has
  very kindly       furnished me with an abstract of the result obtained              in
  that situation.         He  says the readings       for thirty-four days gave the
  following     mean maxima        : —
             Stevenson,                  Open bottom,                   41°-45.

  Thus showing a difference in favour of the closed bottom of nearly
  half a degree, a result confirming the conclusion arrived at in this
  and a preceding paper.
     The    site here being surrounded by trees in almost every direction,
 may in part explain             the    reason why screen        C, even when       the
 annular piece       F  was removed,       gave such correct readings.         We have
 seen that on the 7th October the temperature                  of the grass rose 18*
 above the temperature           of the air.       Now that is the temperature       to
 which the       thermometers        in the Stevenson screen with open bottom
 are exposed,        while screen C, by its construction, cuts off all this
 radiation and exposes the bulb to the radiation from the trees, which
 will never       be so    highly    heated    as the grass, as they have a freer
 circulation      of air through them.            This, combined with the very
free circulation of air through the screen, and the method                     adopted
for preventing the          heated air touching the thermometer,          would seem
to account for the low readings              given by this screen even when the
piece    F  is removed.

     There would appear to be an advantage in favour of the C                            screen,
which may be referred to here.                We    have seen that when the louvres
of the Stevenson          screen get dirty, they absorb more radiant heat, and
so   increase     the error of the readings.            Many       screens in daily use
must,     from this cause, give too high readings.                    The screen C               is,
however,        not much affected from this cause; indeed,                I    am not quite
certain    but that the screen will act quite                 as   well   if   certain parts
are black.         For    instance,   the sides     of the plates         C   and   D     which
are exposed           to the bulb of the thermometer               might perhaps with
advantage        be blackened.        I   have not yet been able experimentally
to determine           this point, but many of my observations                     have been
taken with        a    largo black patch      in    the centre of each plate.                 My
reason for testing this was, that              if   these surfaces         are white, they
will    reflect to the bulb some of the heat which falls on them                          ;     bat
if   they are black, they will absorb this heat; and                  it   seemed possible
that the increased amount of heat radiated by the blackened                                   sur
faces, together with           the greater    amount to which the air in                 contact
with    them     is   heated, might affect the thermometer            less than the           heat
reflected by the white.           It was   not found possible to settle this               point
by readings taken with the screen under the two conditions and                              com
paring them with the silvered bulb,                as the   inertia of the two arrange
ments     is   so different, and the effect sought for very small.                  This, with
many other matters connected with this screen, will be best settled
by means of two screens similar in all points save the one we wish
to test.        For    these   trials, however,      we must wait another warn
season.         Although       this new screen has acted very satisfactorily
up to the present              time, giving    readings      almost       exactly the      same
as the     fine silvered bulb         standard,     and much        below those of the
Stevenson        screen, yet    it   would be rash to conclude              that    it   will    be
superior under all conditions of climate.                      The various influences
to which thermometer              screens are exposed          are so numerous                that
the unexpected           has many opportunities of happening and upsetting
our hopes and expectations.

                                   (Abstract.)
   The present      instalment     traces   some   of    the consequences       of
assuming the hard spherical            particles of   a   gas to exert intense
molecular forces when at distances comparable             with their  diameters.
The effect of the new term in the virial in counteracting and at
last obliterating    that due to the impacts, is traced           as the gas is
gradually   compressed.
   Next, the spheres       (still supposed to attract one another) are
regarded as capable       of absorbing energy in a vibratory form, and
of losing   it directly by radiation.         In  such a case the        relative
translatory   energy may be so reduced that pairs of spheres may
remain   within molecular distance from          one another.       The bearing
of these results upon condensation,        dissociation,   &c, is given.

      municated by Professor Armstrong.
   There are two main distinct          methods of attacking the problem
of the retaining     wall    The first in chronological order is due to
Coulomb, and is variously         named,    perhaps   most commonly as the
method   of the Wedge of Least Resistance.            Briefly characterised,   it

86             Proceedings     of Royal Society of Edinburgh,              [jak.  31,
might be said to depend          upon the mathematical artifice of finding
the resultant force due to the mutual action of the earth mass, and
the wall     a  maximum, the earth being supposed to yield incipiently
under the action of its weight, and in opposition to friction and the
reaction in question,        along an inclined plane determined            so as to
fulfil that     imposed     condition.     Coulomb's method         has been      de
veloped by various writers, and may be regarded as complete.
    The second method is due to Rankine.                 It is   based upon      two
general dynamical principles, both of which are really involved                    in
Coulomb's treatment, but which are there drawn upon                     as   it were
incidentally      rather than appealed        to  as  fundamental       principles.
Rankine's first principle is merely         a statement     that the well-known
propositions in regard to the laws of static              friction apply      in the
interior of a granular mass of earth           ; and,  in particular, that there
is a coefficient     of friction for earth    upon earth of any given kind.
That   some sort of physical datum of this nature with respect to any
given kind of earth may            be  properly assumed does not admit of
question    ;  but how far it answers to an ordinary physical constant,
or even an ordinary coefficient of friction, is by no means certain.
 However, objections of this kind apply to Coulomb's method with
even    greater    force,   and the author proposes to attempt to push
 Rankine's theory farther on its present bases, rather than to discuss
 preliminary difficulties.       If, therefore,  he shall be fortunate enough
 to arrive by a path not altogether            mistaken at certain results, he
 would merely say that such are the consequences of adopting these
 fundamental principles.
    The first of the principles just referred           to enabled     Rankine to
 formulate the conditions of equilibrium in the interior of an earth
 mass generally,      and in terms of       certain data for particular         cases
 occurring in practice.
    When      he comes to deal      with  the action of the earth       on a    wall,
 Rankine      refers  to his second     principle, which was first distinctly
 laid down by the late Canon Moseley.               Briefly it is merely    this :
 When     a system    is in equilibrium under a set of forces,        those which
 are called into existence        by the action of the others are the least
 possible    consistent with the given conditions          ;  or, among a      set of
 forces, active and passive,      in equilibrium, the      passive forces    are the
 least possible.

    Rankine      uses the term granular mass to indicate that the                                 earth
is assumed to have no tenacity or cohesion.                        Some kinds of material
might fairly claim to be              so described,        but in ordinary practice it is
quite common          to meet       with   earth which         will stand with          a vertical
face for a considerable               time   ;   but since        the    action of time and
weather will inevitably              result in the material ultimately assuming
a slope more or less constant for that particular kind,                           it is not only
prudent but necessary to allow for the almost total failure of tenacity
or cohesive strength with lapse                    of time.         In     the   retaining wall
problem the effect of assuming any degree of tenacity being clearly
operative in reducing the resultant force representing the mutual
action of the earth             mass and the wall, Rankine                  makes no scruple
to discarding tenacity altogether.
     It   may be remarked that Coulomb's                          method implicitly takes
account of some degree of tenacity.                      Nearly all direct experiments
have shown considerable               divergence      between the actual overturning
moment      of   the earth          pressure on the wall, and that calculated by
Coulomb's or Rankine's method (employing the accepted methods
for determining the principal constant),                       the divergence           very com
monly amounting to upwards of                       50      per    cent,    in   excess      of     the
observed     value.        The discrepancy        in the author's opinion, in
                                                     is,
great part clearly due           to the ignoring in the mathematical investi
 gation   of the   effect of tenacity.           On the ground that no satisfactory
allowance could be made on account of                      a   quantity which           is   at once
a    function of time           and weather,       Rankine, as has been already re
 marked, expressly rejects the tenacity from consideration, so that,                                 in
 the case of Rankine's formula at least, one ought not to be surprised
if   the calculated should exceed                the actual overturning moment                      of
 the earth pressure        to   a   considerable    extent.
     But granting this, or at any rate taking leave of                            it,   there     still
remains the experimental evidence                     that Coulomb's method in its
 complete form, though much more                     unsatisfactory from            a     physical
 point of view, gives better            results than Rankine's.                  Attention         has
 consequently      been    redirected to Rankine's method with the object
if   possible of removing this anomaly              ;    and, accordingly,         it   has been
 pointed out that Rankine               simply applies the conditions of equi
 librium,   obtaining at        a   point in the interior of the earth mass, to                      a

roughness        of the actual wall to be, in effect, reduced to this valne.
It    is impossible to conceive                            that by a process such                         as    this    the

between         the earth             and the wall adds to its stability, failure                                      may
be brought about by simply allowing the degree of roughness to fall
ever so     little below                  the     critical value — the value,                      that        is,   which
corresponds        to the actual value of                        y3   when the wall             is   in   the critical
state.     Hence           /?    has      a   value such that the stability of the wall                                    in

additional advantage of having been selected by Mr Flamant for an

     Mr Baker                says — "When the wood paving                      was recently laid in

broken stone ballast required for the concrete substructure.                                           In   one
instance            (Example         I.)   the author noted that               a   wall of pitch            pine
blocks,       4     feet high and          1   foot thick, sustained           the vertical face            of  a
bank of old macadam materials which had been broken up,                                            screened,
and tossed              against     this wall, until the bank had attained                         a   height
of   3   feet       9    inches,    a   width      at the top of about              5   feet, and slopes

disease is rather the result of one or more              compounds formed          by
the life-history of a micro-organism, than the mere presence                  of that
micro-organism itself.         By looking      at certain cases       in the above
light, we can well understand why persons                suffering with cholera
die so rapidly.        The alkaloid or ptomaine (discovered by Pouchet
in 1885) which the Comma bacillus secretes or forms is rapidly
absorbed into the blood, long before the bacillus itself is capable
of being absorbed        by the mucous       membrane      of the intestine, and
then into the blood.           It is a well-known        fact that most        micro
 organisms     multiply with    great rapidity     in the media      in which they
live, and      if particular   organisms     can    be destroyed,      the   harmful
effects    of the products produced by their              life-histories     will  not
 increase, and the disease      will  soon be at an end.
     Of   course,   I am  fully aware that it must not be supposed that
 because     we   find in the blood and tissues of man and animal?
 (suffering from a contagious disease)           certain micro-organisms, that
 these micro-organisms are necessarily           the cause, or even        indirectly
 the cause, of that disease.          Not until     we have     obtained     by pure
 cultivations,     in an artificial sterilised medium, the         organisms in a
 perfectly pure state, and then,           by an injection into the blood of
  man or an animal of the purified organisms,               the disease is repro
 duced,     can we say that a        particular disease is the result of the
 life-history of any particular micro-organism.
     It  is not my object here to describe            the methods        adopted by
 physiological chemists to obtain pure cultivations of any given micro
  organism,    although no interpretations can be given of any experi
  ments unless the experimenter has worked with                 purified organisms
  obtained by artificial cultivation with all its precautions,
     I  wish to detail what appears to my mind the most reasona'bb
  method for the treatment of those contagious diseases whose " seat
  of war " is in the blood itself.           I have already had the honour
  of presenting to the        Eoyal Society of Edinburgh a paper " On
  the Action of Salicylic Acid on Ferments

    examination with high powers, that the salicylic acid solution had
    acted upon the form             of cellulose forming            the external      wall of   these
    lowly organisms,         perforating        it,   and ultimately destroying the life
    of the organisms.
      During the last nine months                   I      have turned my attention to the
    actionof this salicylic acid solution upon other living micro-organisms.
      First of all,     may state that when the above quantity of sali

    cylic acid was added to 1000 c.c. of sterilised wort, and then pure
    cultivations       of Myeoderma            aceti       were    introduced     into the wort
    contained in an ordinary two-necked                           Pasteur's flask (fig. 1), no
 change took place in                it,   not even after         a   month had elapsed, and
 the vessel kept all the                     time     at    the   most     suitable    temperature

(32° to 38° C.) for the life-history of the organism.   After month                        a
had passed,    small quantity of this wort was transferred (with all
                     a
physiological caution) into        second  Pasteur's flask containing
                                               a
sterilised wort minus the salicylic acid. No change was observed
in the        least, not after         the elapse of         a    month.    I   experimented in
a     like manner with Bacillus butyricus, Bacterium lactis, and
obtained similar            results.        From these experiments, and my previous
microscopical            studies,
                                I         draw the conclusion that the salicylic acid
solution        is   an antiseptic agent destroying these low micro-organisms.
In     the case of Bacillus butyricus,                     I   found that the said salicylic
acid         solution not only destroyed                    the organism,      but    its spores as
welL    My friend, Mr W. L. Gadd, F.C.S. (Principal Chemical
Assistant to Dr W. Thomson, F.R.S.E., of the Royal Institution,

   The     spherical     micro-organism     {Micrococcus      prodigiosus)    which
has been found upon cooked             and raw meat kept in the dark,             was
found on        transplanting      into   1000   c.c.   of sterilised    beef-broth
(neutral) to grow well in the dark, and formed a thick pellicle on
the surface of the liquid.          On the addition of 0-2 grm. of salicylic
acid to the broth, the growth ceased; and on transferring a                  portion
of this broth into          another flask containing        sterilised   broth,     no

development        took place, not after remaining             in this fluid     at a
temperature      of about 34 C. for two weeks.             I may say in      passing
that I have found that the red pigment produced by this
                                                                         "  chromo-

genic micrococcus                            compound of iron.              treating
these organisms        upon a slide under the microscope,            with    a weak
.solution of potassium sulphocyanate, a deeper               red colour was pro
duced,     no   doubt due to the         formation     of ferric   sulphocyanate.
Again, when a solution of potassium             ferrocyanide was run       between
the slide and cover-slip containing           Micrococcus      prodigiosus, a blue
coloration was        obtained of " Prussian blue."          It appears   from     the
above     that the colour       produced by this        micro-organism is       some
iron compound.

  do not produce any growth, and ultimately die.               The salicylic acid
  solution destroys      the spores of these two micro-organisms, although
  their   spores are said to withstand a temperature         of 125° C.
                        3.  Micrococci found in Diarrhoea.
     The micrococci found largely in secretions from the bowels of
  persons suffering with diarrhoea were transplanted into sterilised
  beef -broth contained in a Pasteur flask (No. 1), and kept at 40° C.
  They multiplied rapidly during two days. Another flask (No. 2),
  containing    sterilised beef-broth and salicylic acid (in the proportion
  of 0-2 gnn. of the acid in 1000 c.c. of the broth), was taken and
 inoculated with these actively growing micrococci, but their growth
 was stopped.         On inoculating another flask (No. 3) with some of
 the contents of flask (No. 2), and keeping it about 40° C. for three
 weeks, no further growth took place.             This  proves that the salicylic
 acid had killed the micrococci in question.             I  am  fully   aware  that
 it has not      been thoroughly       ascertained   whether this micrococcus
 is the cause of diarrhoea, yet, for my purpose, the above is to show
 that   the said salicylic acid destroys      this micrococcus.
                 4.  Leptothrix buccalis and Bacillus subtilu:
    These non-pathogenic forms found in the healthy human mouth
 are also destroyed by salicylic acid.             When examined under the
 microscope,      there was the appearance         of the solution of salicylic
acid perforating the cellulose wall of Bacillus subtilis, and                    so
destroying      the organism (fig. 3, B).          At first we notice the cell-
wall   becomes thinner on the side that the salicylic acid solution is
being run in between            the   slide and cover-slip, and is then per
forated.

   The micrococcus               vaccinia?,   which is the active principle of              the
vaccine     virus (as shown by Pasteur, and not the fluid medium in
which these micrococci live their life-histories), is also acted upon
by salicylic          acid,    for the     lymph     so   treated     loses    its  power of
inoculation.
                          7. Micrococcus urea          (Von Tieghem).
    Micrococcus           urece,    or the     zymogenic      ferment of urine which
 splits up urea into ammonium carbonate,                        is found in dumb-bells,
 chains,    and      in   the     zoogloea   state.    If   urine is allowed to           stand
 until it begins to smell of ammonia,                   and then a drop of this           urine
 examined microscopically, the Micrococcus ureos will be found                                 to
 be present.           If  now fresh urine (sterilised) is treated with salicylic
 acid, and then inoculated with Micrococcus ureos (from the putrid
 urine), no change at all occurs                 in  the urine, not after the elapse           of

sixteen days.            Therefore,       I   conclude that the said acid has acted
upon this organism in a similar manner to those already mentioned.
         8.   Protococcus vulgaris and Protococcus pluvialis (fig. 4).
   These two species of Protococcus are not acted upon by the solu
tion of salicylic acid, and a much stronger solution of the acid has
no effect upon them.               It    appears       that there is a difference         in the
                                                Fig.   i.
atomic structure of the cellulose forming the cell-walls of these two
species       of Protococcus and              the    various micro-organisms alluded to
in this paper;           that     is,   the    cellulose of Protococcus          is    more   like
the cellulose    of the higher forms of plant life, which                         is   not acted
upon     by the acid in question.
  So far, we have seen that salicylic                       is   an antiseptic agent, capable
of attacking or acting upon their cellulose walls.
  This acid, and acids generally, appear adverse to the life-histories
of certain micro-organisms.                   It will       be remembered      that M. Boche-
fontaine       swallowed         secretions         from choleraic patients containing
Comma         bacilli,   made     up in the form of pills, without any serious
consequences.            There    is    no doubt the acid properties of the gastric
juice in the stomach had acted upon these micro-organisms in some
way or other, and so prevented them                              living their life-histories in
the   intestine.
   The practical outcome of this piece of research (although far from

104            Proceedings      of Royal Society of Edinburgh.              [jan. si,
completed) may prove a remedy (placed upon                 a  scientific basis) for
certain contagious      diseases whose organisms reside         in the blood.
    I   may allude, in passing, that there is no science on such an
unsatisfactory       basis   as    medicine,    and    the present      method     of
administering       medicines (in such diseases as above) is first of all
into the stomach by means of the mouth The medicine has to
pass    through a good portion          of the alimentary canal before          it is
absorbed      into   the blood.       The   medicine may become             changed
(before    it is  absorbed)     by the various secretions       pouring into the
alimentary canal.          Hence, for those contagious        diseases whose seat
of action is in the blood (the blood being their soil), we ought to
apply our remedy directly to the blood itself by injections.
    With this idea in view (and from analogy of                     the  action    of
salicylic     acid upon a large         number      of   micro-organisms),      it  is
most     probable that the above         salicylic   acid solution will destroy
Micrococcus erysipelatosus,        Micrococcus scarlatina;, Bacillus malarict,
Bacillus     tubercidosis,   &c.    These micro-organisms have been proved
to be the cause of the diseases in which they are found in great
numbers in the blood.            Swine fever, cattle plague, pleuro-pneumonia
have also been proved to be the results of different species of micro
 coccus.      All   these   organisms reside       in the blood of man and
 animals suffering with these diseases.
    In   tho case of     Bacillm    tuberculosis,   according to    Dr   E.   Freund
 {Nature, vol. xxxiv.        p.  581, Oct.  14,   1886),  of Vienna, this micro
 organism appears to form cellulose          within    the blood of tuberculous
 persons.       This cellulose is    a product of its      (B. tuberculosis) life-
 history, and we have seen in numerous cases that the salicylic acid
 attacks micro-parasitic cellulose,        if   I   can so   use the expression.
 Therefore the hint may be given, that salicylic acid may prove a
 successful     remedy in tuberculosis, when injected directly into the
 blood of diseased patients.
     It may be asked     — If the salicylic   acid solution is injected into the
 blood, will it not destroy the red and white corpuscles ? On April
 28, 1886, I opened a vein in my left arm, and injected into the
 blood the solution of salicylic acid, and with the exception of                      a
  headache or so there were no abnormal results.
     A microscopical examination of the blood (two hours after
 injection)     revealed    that the blood corpuscles        were in a perfectly

                                            (Abstract.)
     In    the course       of some remarks on the design proposed for                                  the
Forth Bridge, the author of this                   paper       had enunciated the               remark
able theorem,         that any symmetric structure built on a                            rectangular
base, and depending on linear resistance alone, is necessarily                               unstable.
The proof of          it,   given in the eleventh volume of the Transaction*                             of
the    Royal     Scottish      Society      of   Arts,    is   derived from considerations
affecting      the special case       ;   but this theorem             is   only one of           an ex
tensive class, and therefore the subject of instability among                                      linear
structures in general           is   here taken up.
      In   the case of regular or semi-regular arrangements,                              having        the
comers of an upper supported from the corners of an under                                       polygon,
it   is    shown that when the figures are of odd numbers the                                structures
are stable, while those              with   even numbers are unstable                    ;   unless      in
deed the polygons be placed conformably,                            in which    case the stability
extends       to both classes.
      The     paper    ends     with the following admonition                   : —These            cases
of instability in open structures have been elicited by means                                      of   the
simplest considerations in geometry                           and statics   ;    they lie         indeed
on the very surface             of mechanical inquiry.    They do not occur as
isolated examples,            but are arranged in extensive groups and, being        ;
found in those classes of structures which may be called                                        shapely,
they stand out as warning beacons                        to those engaged           in    engineering
pursuits.

2.  On the Increase of Electrolytic             Polarization with Time.
   By W. Peddie, Esq.             Communicated by Professor Tait.
   In  a paper communicated to this Society last Session        I described
some    preliminary    experiments    on  this subject,   which led to the
approximate empirical formula connecting current-strength and time
                              i = a + ot
where a,   b, c, d, and e are constants  of positive sign.   The electrodes
 used were   of platinum, and had a surface area of about         5 sq. cm.
 Subsequently     I  have used platinum     electrodes  having an area of

 108          Proceedings of Boyal Society             of Edinburgh,        [feb.    7.
rather more than 60 sq. cm.           The curves        I obtained   evidently    pos
sess, to a  considerable extent, symmetry about an axis.              They roughly
resemble hyperbolas, but have rather more curvature near the vertex.
A   few of them are represented          in lig.    2.    Time is measured hori
zontally, each scale-division representing 6£ minutes. The numbers
on the vertical scale, when multiplied by 0-267, give the current-
strungth in amperes.         I used in each   experiment a battery of 3 tray-
Daniell    cells, the electromotive force of which remained constant
during the experiment.           The battery was coupled in circuit with             a
Helmholtz      tangent galvanometer and              the   electrolytic celL      The
reduction factor of the galvanometer is 0-267.                   The needle of the
galvanometer ceased vibrating           in about half        a minute after com
pleting the circuit, at which time the first reading was taken.                  The

that represented       by the equation formerly given.               It possesses to a
certain extent symmetry about an axis.               In  fig. 3   I have  represented
a  group of curves having this equation, passing                    through a given
point on the axis of t, and having a common              asymptote.        The curves
which pass to the left of the axis of             i  cannot,     of course, represent
the physical       phenomena, but they show the axial symmetry well.
If another group is drawn, the axis of i being                  a tangent,   and each
member having a different horizontal asymptote,                  a close resemblance
lietween    it and   the group    in fig. 2 is evident.
    If
                                                                  ....
        equation (1) holds, we have
                             log(i— a)   -ci = log    b — Jet                    (2).
 Hence the      quantity on the left-hand side of this equation plotted
against time should          give a straight line.       The group of points in
fig. 1   is obtained in this way from the curve in that figure.                     The
near coincidence of        all  the points    with    a straight line shows that
the curve     is closely represented     by an equation of the form (1).
    I  have also made an experiment with only one tray-Daniell cell
in the circuit.        There was, consequently,         no decomposition of the
electrolyte     (an aqueous solution of sulphuric acid).              In this case the
constant a must be zero.           The equation
                                i = 0-4168«
represents the results of observation almost exactly, the difference
being well      witbin   the  limit of possible     errors    in drawing     the curve
free-hand through the observed            points.    For small values of        t there
is considerable discrepancy between             the results of observation and
calculation in both experiments, so that the formula (1) must not
be applied when t is below a certain limit, which, for the results
tabulated     above, is about 5 minutes.

                               (Abstract.)
   Many of the victims of the dynamite explosion, a year or           two
ago,  in the London   Underground    Bail way, are said to have lost   the
drum of one ear only, that nearest to the source.         This  seems to
point to a projectile, not an undulatory, motion of the air       and    of
the gases produced by the explosion.       So long, in fact,  as the dis
turbance   travels faster than sound, it must necessarily be of       this
character,  and would be capable of producing such effects.
   Another curious fact apparently connected      with the above is     the
(considerable) finite diameter of  a flash of forked lightning.      Such

a flash     is always photographed             as a  line of finite breadth, even
when the        focal   length is short and the focal adjustment perfect.
This cannot be ascribed to irradiation.                  The air seems, in fact, to
be    driven outwards from the track of the discharge                      with such
speed as to render the immediately surrounding                   air instantaneously
self-luminous by compression.
    Such considerations show at once how to explain the difference
between       the    effects  of dynamite and those of gunpowder.                 The
latter is prepared        expressly for the purpose of developing its energy
gradually.         Thus while      the flash of gunpowder fired          in the  open
is due mainly to combustion of scattered                  particles, — that produced
by dynamite is mainly due to impulsive                     compression    of the sur
rounding air, energy            being conveyed to          it much    faster  than    it
 can escape       in the form of      sound.

 question, set       in the Ferguson Scholarship Examination (Glasgow,

     In   the many theories             that have been advanced                 to explain the
comparative constancy               of solar radiation in long past                  ages       as evi
denced by geological history,                it    has been generally assumed that the
temperature         of the sun has not varied much, and to account for
its not falling in               temperature         a   number of theories            Lave been
advanced,         all suggesting different sources from which                        it   may have
received        the energy which            it   radiates as heat.        Since the chemical
theory was shown to be insufficient to account for the vast amount
of   heat radiated,         other theories,          such as the meteoric             theory and
the conservation of energy theory, have been advanced.
     In all     these theories    it   is   generally assumed that in order that the
radiation from the sun may be constant its temperature                               must also be
constant,       that, in fact, radiation from the sun                is   in proportion to its
temperature       ;   and that     if   the temperature         of   the sun falls, its radia
tion effect at the earth's               surface      will fall in direct proportion to

1887.]                 Mr John Aitken on Solar Radiation.                                           119
its loss of heat.           Now       there      are certain physical facts which                have
induced me to think that this is not necessarily                                so.    Nay, it   seems
even possible that the amount of heat radiated by the sun might
go on increasing while its temperature                          was decreasing.
     The facts which seem to point to this conclusion are —
  First, We know that different forms of matter vary greatly in
their power of radiating heat. For instance, a non-luminous gas
flame radiates         far less heat than a luminous one, though actually at
a   higher temperature, and a red-hot surface of platinum radiates far
less    heat    than an oxidised surface                   of iron of the same area and
temperature.
     Second,      "We know           that elementary             bodies generally radiate far
less heat      than compound ones.                  It has      been shown that the radiating
powers       of substances            go    on     increasing with the increased                  com
plexity of their constitution.
     Third, We know that                   at high temperatures               compound bodies are
decomposed or broken up into simpler forms.                                  Or, to put it in another
way, and as a solar inhabitant would                            put    it,   bodies which have an
affinity    for   each     other do not combine unless their temperature                               is
below    a   certain fixed point for the substances.
     Combining these statements we                        see   that in the sun, owing to its
high temperature, matter must be                      in much simpler forms than                  it   is
on the earth, and all recent                     investigation points markedly in this
direction.        It   seems therefore             in    the highest degree probable that
the average radiating power of the matter                             in     the sun   is   much less
than that       of   the matter of the earth.                   Again, the hotter the sun the
simpler      its constitution will            be, and the weaker its radiating power.
From this we see that there                   is   no necessary proportion between                  the
temperature          of   the sun and the amount of heat                     it   radiates, as change
of     temperature        is   accompanied              by change of constitution, and in
crease     of radiating power.
     These     considerations lead us on, and suggest that the store of
energy from which the sun has drawn                        in long past ages may possibly
be     its own internal supply               ;     that the sun in its earlier ages was at
a    much      higher       temperature          than     it    is   at present,      but, owing to
its simpler constitution,             it    radiated only about as much heat as                      it
does     now, and that          as   its temperature            fell its matter        became    more
compound,         and its radiating power increased, which enables                             it   now

to keep up about the same radiation effect, though its temperature
may have fallen greatly.
      It   is evident that much of this is purely theoretical and formed
on rather a weak basis; we have so few measurements                                      to go by.
Though it is a law that compound bodies radiate more than simple
ones, yet we do not know enough of the constitution of the                                     sun    to
say how much the increased radiating power, due to increased                                    com
plexity, would compensate                    for the fall of temperature.              I have said
it might actually              more than counteract             the    fall of temperature and
cause an increased              radiation effect.         It   may, however, only balance
it,   or    it   may even only reduce the rate of decrease of radiation,
and        make    it   only   a    little   less than proportional to the             fall in tem
perature.
      The whole of these remarks are almost pure speculation.                                    The
principal cause for their being written                   is   to point out that the          radiat
ing power of the sun may have varied in quantity and quality from
age to age        ;   that its amount may not be directly proportional to its
absolute          temperature      ;    and further,      that   it    is   extremely doubtful
whether we can apply to solar matter the radiation measurements
which have been obtained of earth matter, so that any estimates we
may make of the temperature                       of the sun           from measurements              of
solar radiation must be received with considerable                              hesitation.

      Sir William Thomson               has shown that the sun has                   within itself
an     enormous         store of energy          due to its high temperature.                   This
energy       is   altogether apart from what we on the earth are accustomed
to     consider       as   the energy stored           up in          a   hot    body.    He      has
shown that the shrinkage or falling in of the great mass of the
sun due to cooling             is   capable of developing             a   very great amount of
energy.           His calculations           show, that   if    the shrinkage was so great
that the surface of the sun was to descend at the rate of 35 metres
per year, or 70 kilometres per 2000 years, there would be developed
about the same amount of energy that                      is    radiated by the sun accord
ing to the measurements                  taken by Pouillet.
      Forbes has shown Pouillet's measurements                            to be much too small,
and        that the amount radiated by the                       sun      is    l-6 greater than

1887.]           Mr John Aitken      on Solar Radiation.                       121
Pouillet    supposed.    Professor Langley,       by more perfect methods,
has shown       that Forbes's figure is also       too small, and       there   are
evident reasons for supposing that even Langley's measurements                  are
too   low.     The sun will therefore     require to shrink a good deal
more than 35 metres per year to develop from gravitational sources
alone the energy radiated by it.
   Apart, however, from the energy developed by shrinkage, there               will
evidently be energy developed       within    the sun    in another way while
it is cooling.     The falling temperature     will   be accompanied      by com
bustion, though not in the manner supposed in the old combustion
theory of solar energy.        There will, however,         evidently be a de
velopment of energy due to the combination or falling together of the
molecules    which will ensue on the decrease of temperature.                 Here
we have a field for the chemist to come           in and   do for the chemical
part of the subject what      Sir W. Thomson         has done for the gravita
tional.    It   must, however, be confessed that his task is a far more
difficult one, at least at present, as we know very little about the
condition of matter in the sun, and almost nothing                     about the
 amount    of energy developed when          the    simpler forms of matter
combine.
    Now, though the sun may receive an enormous amount of energy
from those      two sources, yet  it is evident they        can never keep the
temperature      of the sun   constant,   because,      before   energy    can   be
developed     in either of those ways, the temperature         of the sun must
fall, and the energy developed       will  be   in proportion     to the amount
of the fall.

   Hoar-frost is generally described       as   frozen dew, and is supposed
to be  deposited in the same manner and under the same conditions
as  dew ; the only difference    being in the temperature          at which   it is

deposited.         Though in a general way this may be                               so, yet    there       are
certain differences        in the conditions, and                       the manner in which                 the
vapour is condensed            at the different temperatures,                       which seem worth
referring to.
  If    we examine         a surface,            such as a sheet of glass, exposed hori
zontally near the ground on                        a   dewy night, we shall generally find
that the windward edges are dry.                              This indicates that          the air itself
is not cooled to the dew-point, though the surfaces of bodies exposed
to radiation are, and            the air has to travel some distance over the
cold surface before its temperature                       is reduced to the dew-point.                       If,
however,      we examine        this same surface when the temperature                                  is low
enough to cause the deposited                      moisture          to form hoar-frost,            we shall
frequently find a marked difference.                            The sheet of glass is generallj
not only covered           with        the deposited               vapour up to the windward
edges,      but     the    deposit is heaviest                     along these          edges,      the ice
crystals growing furthest out in that direction.                                    This peculiarity in
the deposition of the hoar-frost may also be observed on almost all
objects     — such    as branches            of trees, iron fences, &c.                    The heaviest
deposit will often be found on the windward side and not on the
top, where we might expect                        to find      it,   owing to the stronger radia
tion from that surface.
   The question then             is,   What         is   the cause of this difference               ?    Why
should no vapour be deposited along the windward edges of surfaces
when the temperature                is     above 32°, while               the heaviest          deposit       U
formed on these edges when the temperature                                     is   below the freezing-
point   1     The dryness           of that part of the dewed surface where the
air first touches         it   is   caused by the air not being saturated, and
requiring to travel some distance                         over the cold surface             before       it    u
cooled below its dew-point.                        When, however,              hoar-frost      is   forming,
the air seems generally to act                           as   if   it   were    supersaturated          :    the
crystals growing most towards the wind seems to indicate that the
air does not require to be cooled                             before     it    deposits    its moisture.
But    is   it   possible for the air to be supersaturated                          ?   Under ordinary
conditions we know this                                                 Owing       to the vast amount
                                         is is
                                                 impossible.
of dust in the air there  always plenty of free-surface present to
prevent this happening so long as the temperature       above the                          is
freezing-point.           When, however,                  the temperature               falls below thi*
 point, we have        a   much more complicated condition of matters.

1887.]                  Mr John Aitken         on Hoar-Frost.                         123
     A   considerable      time ago it was suggested         by Professor James
Thomson and by Kirchhoff that the vapour pressure of ice might
be     less   than    that of water at the same temperature                ;   Professor
Ramsay and         Dr Young have shown that this is             the case,*' and they
have experimentally measured               the comparative temperatures            of ice
and water under the same vapour pressure.                 This they have         done to
a temperature         of   9  degrees    below the freezing-point        ;  lower they
could not go, as the water always froze when its temperature                          was
reduced to that point.             They found that the ice and the water had
the same temperature at 32°, and under a pressure of 4*6 mm.                          But
when the pressure          was  still further  reduced, the water became colder
than the ice ; and when the pressure was about                3*20 mm. the water
was     at a temperature of about 23°,            while the ice was about 24°.
The water was thus about a degree colder than the ice.
     It  is evident, therefore,       that  if by any   means the ice had been
cooled to       the same temperature          as the water,      its vapour-pressuro
would have been less than that of the water.                So that      if   we have a
water-surface and an ice one at the same temperature                    and near each
 other,    vapour   will tend    to pass from the water to the ice, because,
the vapour pressure of             the water being higher than that               of   ice,
 the    air which is saturated         to a water surface     is supersaturated          to
 an ice one.
     Something like this seems to take place when hoar-frost is form
 ing.     When the air is       cooled, condensation takes         plane on the dust
 nuclei, resulting      in  a foggy condensation.       This moisture        condensed
 in the air seems always to keep the            liquid form    ;   at least we do not
 see    during    frosty weather any indications of the particles being
  frozen.     In   the fogs formed low down in our atmosphere there are
 no    optical or other phenomena such             as we  might expect to find            if
 they were      frozen.      That the temperature     of the air is far below the
 freezing-point      is no evidence that the fog particles will be solid,            as   it
 is  well known that water, even when in contact with solid surfaces,
 and    with what seem favourable nuclei for forming freezing centres,
 may     yet   remain liquid at a temperature            far below the freezing-
 point       Thin films      and small drops seem difficult to freeze ;           I  have
 frequently seen my night-radiation thermometer               cooled many degrees
  below the      freezing-point, and yet the film condensed on its surface

was in a liquid state.       It  seems, therefore,   quite in keeping with oar
knowledge that these fog particles in frosty weather may be liquid.
     Such being the      case,    we   have   water particles floating in the
atmosphere      during frosty and foggy weather,           and the pressure         of
the vapour in the air          will  correspond   to that of a     liquid   surface ;
it will    therefore   be greater     than that of an ice one at the same
temperature.        Under these conditions the air       will rapidly unburden
itself of part of its vapour when it comes             into contact with aa ice
surface.      This   seems to be the reason why hoar-frost grows               in  the
direction from which the air is moving, because the air, being super
saturated,     unburdens      itself on the first ice surface with which it
comes into contact, and does not, as when dew is forming, require
 to be brought into a condition to cause         it to give up its vapour.
     In  the foregoing     I  have taken extreme        conditions under which
 dew and hoar-frost are formed,          as they are better Buited to illustrate
 the point.      There   are,   however,    many intermediate conditions             in
 which both dew and hoar-frost appear to be deposited in nearly the
 same way.        On some nights the sheet of glass is dewed all over and
 up to all the edges, and there are some nights on which no hoar-frost
 is deposited     on the windward         edges of  the plate, the air     having to
 pass some distance       over the cold surface before         its temperature is
  low enough      for it to deposit      its moisture.    The conditions         under
  which the plate is dewed          to its edges are when there          is no wind
  and the air nearly saturated; and the conditions under which do
  hoar-frost is deposited along the windward edges are when there is
  some wind, a clear sky, and the air not saturated.
      So  far  as  my memory        and recorded     observations go, we never
  have a heavy deposit of hoar-frost when the sky is clear, or                in  those
  conditions in which we have our heaviest             deposits of dew.          On all
  those   occasions    on which     trees and every exposed         surface    become
   clothed in crystal garments,         and all nature in a single night he-
   comes changed to a wondrously pure and fairy-like              scene,   the trans
   formation seems always         to be accomplished      in a thick and          fo^y
   atmosphere,    which requires      the morning's sun to dissolve the              Tel
   and disclose    its beauties.      The thick and foggy state seema             to be
   the general condition of our atmosphere           during the growth of thee*
   heavy deposits      of hoar-frost, and it is a necessary one,           if   the   ex
   planation we have given is correct.

   It will         be observed           that these thick and foggy nights, when heavy
deposits      of hoar-frost          are formed,       are the very nights on which                 little
or no dew would be deposited,                      because the radiation would be checked
by the fog.             These,      however, are the very nights most favourable
for the deposit of hoar-frost,                     because the air has a large               amount of
vapour        in     it, —   is    in fact saturated.            And further, while            dew re
quires that the surface on which                       it   is   deposited       be cooled    by radia
tion,      this    is   not so necessary,             and indeed may be absent,                 in    the
formation of hoar-frost                  ;   because    the fog particles radiate and cool
the air to the saturated temperature                         of vapour at           a   water surface,
and the passing air discharges                       part of its vapour on all ice crystals
or other nuclei             with which        it   comes in contact          ;   the passing air at
the same time absorbs the heat of crystallisation, while the heat of
condensation            is   balanced        by the heat absorbed                by the evaporation
from the water particles.
    But, further,           it    will    be observed       that not only are those nights
on which hoar-frost                 is    most abundant not similar to the nights on
which       heavy          dews     are formed, but              they are generally nights on
which there would be no dew at all                           if    the temperature           was above
the      freezing-point        ;   these hoar-frosty nights do not therefore                     corre
spond to dewy                  nights, when the temperature                  is   higher, but rather
to those          nights       when every object            is    wet and dripping, not with
dew, but wet               with    deposited       fog particles.

Graphic Representation          of the Amount of Ferric Oxide in the Aim km
     of plant8 after growino in an iron manure, and exposed to
     various Rays of the Spectrum, illustrating Root-Absorption.
   These  experiments therefore show that the most active rays for root-
absorption coincide with those of assimilation.           From the researches
of Drs  Draper and Pfeffer, and those of Cloez and Gratiolet, it is
evident that the most favourable rays of white light are those            lying
between   the yellow and green.          In  their experiments the greatest
amount   of    oxygen     was evolved in this part of the    spectrum,   there
fore  the    largest   amount of carbon is retained by the process of
assimilation.       From    our experiments we       obtain the largest     per
centage   of   ferric oxide    in the ashes of those  plants exposed    to the
 yellow  or yellow-green      part of the spectrum,  or between Fraunhofer's

 white light for root-absorption coincide with those for assimilation.
     In   the presence of light, or the different rays of white light, the
 two processes go on side by side.
                             Albuminoid Formation.
     The mode of formation of albuminoids in the vegetable                  kingdom
is said to be unknown.            We know, according          to Lieberkuhn,      that
the albumens have an empirical formula of C72Hu2N18SOss.                      As this
molecule contains sulphur, the increase of protoplasmic (albuminoids)
 matter in the living plants,       as   far as the sulphur is concerned, would
only have come from the sulphur of the ferrous sulphate,               as there were
no other sulphates present in the soiL             Moreover, we find the largest
percentage of albuminoids          in   the plants when they have been grown
in   the yellow part of white light, as the following table shows: —

Also, the percentage of sulphur (estimated directly) was the largest
in each case when grown in the yellow part of the spectrum.

found that in those plants grown by the aid of iron sulphate the rela

 (For further details,    see   Journal Chemical Society, Trans.,        1885,

phyll granules;      and recently Prof.      J.  v. Sachs,  in describing  the
symptoms     of vegetable    chlorosis, recommends      the salts of iron as a
remedy (Biedermann's         Centralblatt  fiir Agrikultur    Chemie, vol xv.
part 9).    It has been shown by one of us that crystals of iron sul
phate    have   been   found     near  to  the chlorophyll     granules  when
sections of plants are examined under the highest powers                of the
microscope    (Journal Chemical Society, Trans., 1883, page 195).
    Hence it appears that albuminoids, or, in other words, the proto
plasm of the    living  cell, is formed by the combined action of assimi
lation and root-absorption in the vicinity of the chlorophyll granules.
The sulphur required to complete the albumen molecule comes from
the decomposition of sulphates,        and the nitrogen from the nitrates
or ammonia salts (added to the soil or derived from organic matter)
taken into the plant by root-absorption.

whether ice so formed does or does not contain salt, experiment
would at once give a decisive answer.                               Yet, relying         on experiment
alone, competent              authorities have given contradictory answers.                                All
agree    that      ice, whether formed                  artificially       in    the     laboratory by
freezing    sea-water, or found in nature as one of the varieties of                                       sea-
water ice, retains, in one form or another, and with great tenacity,
some of the salt existing                  in solution in       the water.             The question          at
issue is whether this salt is to be attributed to the solid matter of
the ice or to the liquor mechanically adhering to                                  it,   from which          it
is   impossible to free it.                Most bodies, and especially those which
take    a   crystalline form,              are     easily purified          and        freed    from        all
suspected       foreign matter,             with    a    view to analysis,              by the simple
operation       of washing and drying.                     It    is   impossible to wash the
crystals,   formed by freezing               a   saline    solution, with              distilled water,
because they melt at                   a   temperature         below that at which distilled
water freezes.           The effect of the addition of                      a     small quantity of
distilled    water to         a   quantity of saline ice              is   at first the anomalous
one, that what was                     wet sludge    is    transformed into                  dry crystal
                               is, a
                                                                                         a
line powder.             It            of course, impossible to dry the ice by heat,
and to do so by more intense freezing would be begging the question.
The     experimental difficulties                  therefore        account        for some of the
divergence      of opinion on the subject.                      The mixed character                   of the
substances examined                has also much to do with it.                     As    a   rule,   it   may
be said that those investigators who have confined                                their observations
to the laboratory have concluded that the ice forming when saline
solutions of moderate concentration,                       including sea-water, are frozen,
is   pure ice, and the salt from which                    it   is   impossible to free         it   entirely
belongs     to the mother-liquor, while                    those who have                 collected        and
examined        sea-water         ice    in high latitudes           have come to the opposite
conclusion.
     During     the Antarctic cruise of the "Challenger"                          I    made    a    number
of observations          on the sea- water ice found in those regions,                              and, re
lying principally on the fact that the melting temperature                                      of the ice
was markedly lower than that of fresh-water                                     ice, and that         it   was
impossible by any of the ordinary means familiar to chemists for
freeing crystals from adhering mother-liquor to materially reduce its
salinity,  I    came to the conclusion that the ice forming                                   in freezing
sea-water     is   not   a    mixture of pure ice and brine, but that                          it   contains

 the salt found in      it in the solid     state either as a crystalline hydrate
 or as the anhydrous salt,             but most probably             as a   hydrate.        In
 dealing     with the subject,        Dr Otto Pettersson (Water and Ice,
 p.   302) quotes      my observations,          and also rejects         the    view that
 "  sea-ice is  in itself wholly destitute of          salts, and only mechanically
 incloses a certain quantity of unfrozen and concentrated                       sea-water."
 He founds his belief on the fact that numerous                       analyses of speci
 mens of sea-water ice have          shown that the constitution of the saline
contents of different specimens             of ice differs for each specimen, and
is always different from that of the                 saline    contents     of sea-water.
 Were the salinity due to inclosed unfrozen and concentrated                              sea-
water, we       " ought     to find by chemical          analysis exactly the same
proportion      between      CI, MgO, CaO, S03, &c, in the ice and in the
brine     as  in the    sea-water     itself."     He   quotes      numerous       analyses
of specimens        of  sea-water    ice from the Baltic and from the Arctic
Seas to      show that this is not the           case.    Calling      the percentage of
chlorine     in   each case 100, he found           in various      sea-waters     the per
centage    of S03 to vary from 11-49 to 11 "89.                   In]specimens of sea-
 water ice it varied from 12-8 to 76"6, and in brines separating from

    This argument appears conclusive.                   In order      to explain      all  the
phenomena          observed     in connection with            sea-water      ice    he cites
Gnthrie's      investigations,       which     went to show that,              in freezing
saline    solutions, under a certain concentration, pure ice is formed at
a   temperature       which     falls from 0°       C,   when the amount of salt
dissolved is infinitely       small,    to a certain definite temperature              wheu
the   solution contains a certain definite percentage of salt.                       Further
abstraction     of   heat then produces          solidification of the solution           as a
whole, in the form          of   a crystalline      hydrate,    of constant freezing-
and melting-point.           To such hydrates, Guthrie               gave the name           of
cryohydrates.         Pettersson quotes the following              as being    particularly

     Now      the bearing of Guthrie's experiments is to show that, while
at sufficiently low temperatures,                         and     with suitable concentration,
the water will solidify along with one or other of the salts in                                     solu

Dr Pettersson mentions in                   a footnote at p. 318, namely, that "a
thermometer         immersed          in a mixture of snow and sea-water which                         is
constantly stirred indicates               - l°-8 C."             If   this is true, it is clear     that
my melting-point observations                   proved nothing.               On repeating the ex
periment        I found   it   confirmed,        and took the opportunity this winter
of investigating the matter more closely.                              The paper now communi
cated to the Royal Society of Edinburgh contains the first portion                                     of
the results.        It   deals     with   the subject under two heads, namely,                         (a)
the temperature           at which sea-water                  and some other saline solutions
freeze, and the chemical constitution                             of the solid and the liquid
into which they are split by freezing                         and (b) the temperature

Forty        grammes of this solution,               in   a   suitable beaker, were          immersed
in   a   freezing    mixture of such composition                         as to   give a temperature
from      2° to 2°'5 C.        below the freezing                 temperature         expected.     The
temperature         at which ice began to form                     (if   necessary after adding        a
minute splinter of ice) was noted, and the freezing was allowed                                        to
continue with constant stirring till the temperature had fallen 0"2

determined before.              The beaker was then removed from the                            freezing
bath and allowed to melt.                  The temperature                 in all    cases rose during
melting exactly          as   it   had fallen during freezing.                      In the   following

     Sea-water resembles           a chloride of          sodium       solution     containing
 the same     percentage    of chlorine, and the resemblance is closer the
 greater    the dilution.        When         the    beaker was removed              from the
 freezing-bath, the temperature              rose during melting as              it had fallen
 during freezing.       In  these experiments, which had for their object
 the determination of the temperature                    at which the       crystals melted,
 as  well as that at which they began to form in the water, it was
 impossible to remove a sample for analysis large enough to enable
 the sulphuric acid to be determined                 in it.
     For this     purpose    a series         of    observations were            made,     using
 quantities of 300 grammes                of sea-water.          Freezing was continued
 usually until the temperature             had fallen 0°-3 C. below that at which
 crystals began to form.            The mother-liquor was then separated from
 the crystals     by means of a large pipette with fine orifice,                          before
 removing the beaker from                  the    freezing bath.            The magma          of
 crystals was then brought rapidly on a filter and drained by means
 of the jet pump.        The ice, thus drained, was then melted, and the
 three    fractions were      analysed.           In    the    following      tahle    (I.)   the
 results   of four experiments         are given.          In  the one column         (W) will
 be found the weight of the original water taken and of the fractions
  into which    it was split on freezing           ;  in the other (R) will           be found

to be remembered                     that in these experiments                           the water was frozen
gently — that          is,      the rate of abstraction of heat                              was low, the               tem

below the freezing temperature                            of the solution.                   Much of the                error
and uncertainty about                       the freezing of saline solutions arises from
the violence of the methods                             employed.               Judging then by                   the con
stancy of the relation of the percentage of CI to SO3, we                                                    see that         in

is    identical   ;    and we are justified in concluding that                                         it   is    probable
that the saltness of the ice                       is    due to unfrozen and concentrated                                sea-
water adhering to it.                       Ice forming in even very weak saline solutions

closely resembles                ice forming in air), and hasis                                                              the
same remarkable power of retaining mechanically several times                                                                 its
weight of water or brine.
      If we assume              that the ice formed in freezing                            sea-   water     is    pure       ice,
and that the saline ingredients are retained by the portion remaining
liquid, we can calculate the amount of ice which has been formed                                                                if

percentage        of chlorine.       The weight of the brine remaining after
any freezing         operation is found by multiplying the weight of the
original      water used       by the ratio of the chlorine percentage               found
in the original water to that found in the brine.                        The difference

weight of the ice formed.                In  Table    II.  the results of this calcu

    Sea-water,      like other saline solutions,        is easily   cooled several de
grees   below its freezing-point before           crystals begin to form.           While
cooling down to and below what was known to be its freezing-point,
simultaneous       observations of the temperature             of the sea-water        and
the freezing-bath were made from              half minute     to  half minute. From
these   observations, the rate of abstraction of heat for different differ
ences   of temperature of sea-water and bath was found.                      At   a given
moment a minute splinter of ice (weighing much less than a drop of
water) was       introduced.       Crystals immediately began to form, and
the temperature         rose  in from    ten to fifteen seconds        to the freezing-
point      During the freezing         the temperatures      of bath and       sea-water
were observed        at regular intervals.       The heat removed is thus made
up of that eliminated          during the few seconds when freezing began
and the temperature          rose to the freezing-point, which             is found     by
 multiplying the rise of temperature               by the weight of liquid,            and
that    removed        during    the   subsequent       cooling, which        is    found
 from the duration        of the operation and the rate of loss of heat,
 deduced     from observations       made during the cooling.              The specific
  heat of the    solution is taken as that of the water which it contains,

temperature         was    - 2° "05 for III.       and    - l°-05     forlV. The latent heat
of water freezing at          0°   is 79*25.        The specific heat of ice being 0-5,
the latent heat of water freezing at                      - 2°,05     is 78-22,          and that of
water freezing at           - l°-05      is 78'73.        In    Experiment            III.     the total
heat       extracted      during the freezing was                4230 x 0-965 = 4082 heat
units (gramme-degrees),                  and dividing this by 78'22 we find 52-2
grammes         as the weight of pure ice formed at                        — 2° -05    C,    equivalent
to this abstraction of heat.                In Experiment IV.                   the heat abstracted
was found to be             5193x0-9825            = 5102.          Dividing this by                  78-73
we find 64-8 grammes                as   the equivalent weight of ice formed.
   We        have calculated the weight of ice which would be found, first
on the basis of the salinity                 of the solution           ;     and second,         on the
basis       of the observed         thermal exchange,             assuming            in both         cases
that, in the act of freezing pure ice is formed.                            Thus —

      The      agreement      between        the two quantities                  of    ice   formed as
calculated by the different methods is as close                            as    could be expected,
and renders probable the truth of the common                                 assumption that the
solid body formed is pure ice.
      It    has, moreover,         been proved by Guthrie,                   Eiidorff,       and others
 that, in solutions            of the salts             occurring     in        sea-water,      ice    does
 separate out at first, and continues to separate                                out until the con
 centration has become many times greater than that of sea-water.
 Assuming that in sea-water all the chlorine is united to sodium, 85
 per cent, of the water would have to be removed                                      as ice    before        a
 cryohydrate would form, and                   if it      contained nothing but sulphate
 of    soda    in   the proportion corresponding to the sulphuric acid found
 in    it,   over 90 per cent of the water would have to go as ice, before
 the cryohydrate would be formed.
       In my experiments about               15 per cent,        of   the weight of the water
 was frozen out as ice, causing                a   lowering of freezing-point by 0°3 C.

1887.]             Mr J. Y. Buchanan            on Ice and Brines.                   137
In   nature    it is probable that the       ice forming at the actual freezing
surface does so at an almost            uniform temperature,        the local concen
tration produced        by the formation of a crystal of ice being imme
diately eliminated by the mass of water below.                    In the     interstices
of the crystals there will be retained             a weight of slightly concen
trated sea-water at least as great as that of the ice crystals.                    These
retain tbe brine       in  a  meshwork of cells, and,       as the   thickness of the
ice    covering    increases,    and the freezing surface becomes more re
mote, the ice and the brine become               more    and more exposed to the
atmospheric rigours of the            Arctic winter.      The brine will continue
to deposit ice      until its concentration is such          that, for example,       the
cryohydrate        of NaCl is ready to separate out.               It    probably    will
separate     out until it comes in conflict with, for instance, the chloride
of calcium       or the chloride of magnesium,            which will retain some
of the water, without solidifying,           even at the lowest temperatures.
At     the winter      quarters of the      "Vega" brine      was observed        oozing
out of sea-water        ice and     liquid at    a temperature       of   —  30° C.     It
was very      rich in calcium and especially          magnesium         chlorides.     In
fact,    it is probably        quite   impossible    by   any cold        occurring    in
nature to     solidify   sea-water.
    b.   Melting of pure ice in sea-water and other saline solutions. — A
large    number of experiments were made with solutions of concen
tration comparable         with that of      sea-water, and     in   one or two cases
the experiments          were    extended     to low    temperatures        and   strong
solutions.       As   a rule, from 50 to 100 grammes             of solution, cooled
 to 0°   C,   were mixed      with    an equal    weight of pounded ice, also at
0* C.      The thermometer        used for all these determinations was one of
 Geissler's normal ones, divided           into tenths of a degree Centigrade             ;
and its zero-point           was verified     almost    daily.      Along with the
thermometer,         a pipette of suitable capacity          was   immersed in the
 beaker,    and   used with the thermometer           for keeping the mass well
 mixed.       Its upper      aperture    was  closed  with    a  small cork, which
 was removed        from time to time to permit of some of the brine being
 sucked     up and allowed to run back again.                    The inside of the
 pipette was thus kept constantly moistened                with the slowly altering
 solution     in the      beaker.      The temperature        was read       after very
 thorough      mixing, and the samplo thereupon immediately removed
 and preserved       for  analysis.

 1887.]           Mr    J.  Y. Buchanan           on Ice and Urines.                     139
    On considering them,          it was at once evident that the lowering of
the melting-point        of  ice followed       the concentration of the solution,
but the law deviated in all            cases    from that of strict proportionality
to the amount of salt dissolved,                 in   some cases to a greater extent
than in others.        In comparing         the effects of different salts         in   solu
tion     on the   melting-point        of ice, no simple connection could he
traced between       their absolute weights and the effects produced                  ;  but
on comparing       chemically equivalent weights,              a very close   connection
was discovered.         This will      be evident from the inspection of the
tables.     In  each the first column contains the temperatures                  at which
pure ice melts      ;  and in the parallel columns the percentages                         of
chlorine,     potassium,       or hydrogen in the             solutions    of    the salts
indicated at the head of each column, when iee melts                         in   them      at
the    temperature      indicated.       The      figures  thus give numbers pro
portional    in each table      to the chemically equivalent weights of the
different salts.      They show at first that, whereas                 the presence of
equal     absolute weights in solution produces                  very different effects,
the presence     of chemically equivalent weights                produces   very similar
effects.     On closer inspection, it is seen that              the effects are almost
identical where the elements             to which the common              constituent is
united belongs to the same group of the periodic series, and differ
sharply where these elements              belong to different groups.               In    the
case of the    chlorides of sodium and potassium the number expressing
 the percentage     * of chlorine in          the solution expresses         equally the
 depression of the melting-point of ice                 in terms     of the Centigrade
scale.     The same depression          of melting temperature          is produced by
 10 per cent, less     of chlorine united           to hydrogen, and by 30 to 35
per cent more of chlorine when united to magnesium,                           calcium,     or
barium.
    The results obtained with sea-water are also given, for comparison.
It will    be seen that     it  behaves very approximately as a solution of
chloride of sodium containing the same amount of chlorine.
    It  is perhaps not very astonishing that               unit weight of      potassium
in saline     solution should produce              the same effect in lowering the
melting-point     of   ice, whether      it  is united to     CI or    I;  but it shows
clearly how independent this action is of the general character                             of
the     body in solution when we find                 the effect produced by unit

weight of hydrogen identical, whether it is united to such opposite
radicles as CI or OK.           Table     VI.   shows further the effect of valence.
While    a given       weight of hydrogen produces                    the same       effect in
solution, whether it be united to the very different but both univalent
radicles  CI  and     OK, its    effect is reduced by one-half when united to
the bivalent S04.          That valence is not the only factor is shown by
comparing the effects of hydrogen and potassium when united to
the common         element,       chlorine.        Hydrochloric         acid   in     solution
produces a markedly more powerful                    lowering effect on the melting-
point of ice than the equivalent amount of chloride of potassium.
Of all   the substances         that     I   have    experimented         on, hydrochloric
acid is the most energetic in reducing the melting-point of ice, and
with ordinary strong          acid and pounded             ice there    is no difficulty in
producing temperatures           as   low    as the   freezing-point of mercury.            In
the case of hydrochloric acid, sulphuric acid, chloride of sodium, and
 chloride of calcium,      I have    carried my experiments tolow temperatures
 and great concentration.            But    before passing        to them it is well to
 consider the more dilute solutions with regard to their density.
    That the mere density of the solution in which the ice is melting
 has no direct connection           with      the lowering of its melting-point              is
 shown by the          following        table,     in which        the   specific    gravities
 (at 15° C.)   are given      of   the solutions of different salts             which gave

    There are many similarities in the effects produced by greatly in
 creasing the pressure upon pure water and by dissolving salts in                            it
 First, there is an absolute diminution in the volume of the solution
 as  compared      with     the    sum      of   the    volumes of its components              ;
 second, in virtue of this compression                 by molecular forces it has be

    Experiments with              Concentrated     Solutions. — Several            series  of
experiments        have been made with hydrochloric                     acid,   chloride of
sodium,    and chloride of calcium, and also with                          sulphuric acid.
Table   VII.    gives the results, in the same form                 as   preceding tables,
for the chlorides.
    It will be      seen that, in proportion as the solution becomes more
concentrated,       further additions of salt produce                  a greater    effect  in
lowering the melting-point of ice, and at a temperature                         of   - 15" C.
equivalent weights of            NaCl and CaCl2        produce identical results.          In

    The temperatures           given in these tables are all in terms of the same
thermometer,         which has not been verified for this part of its scale
 by comparison         with     a standard   or with the air thermometer.
    We   have thus seen that, owing to its peculiar physical properties,
 it is impossible to prepare the crystalline solid which separates from

 142        Proceedings    of Royal Society of Edinburgh.              [mar.   21,
 sea-water and analogous       saline solutions in a condition to enable the
 question,  whether the salt does or does not form part of the solid
 matter of the crystals,    to be solved directly by chemical analysis.
    So far as chemical       analysis is applicable, it is in favour of the
 salt belonging exclusively to the adhering brine.              When sea-water
is carefully frozen artificially, the ratio between the chlorine and the
sulphuric    acid is tLe same for the solid contents of the original
water, the crystals,    and the mother-liquor.          It  is exceedingly un
likely,  if  part of the salt went into the crystals, leaving the re
mainder in the brine, that there would be no selective separation of
its constituents.
    It  has  been   shown that snow or pure            lake ice, which, when
 melting by itself or immersed in pure water at atmospheric            pressure,
melts at the constant temperature         called 0° C. or 32° Fahr., changes
its melting temperature        when immersed in a saline solution.           The
altered melting temperature,        however,    is the same for solutions of
the same composition (no doubt with some allowance for pressure)
and different for solutions of different composition.
   The temperature at which pure ice melts in a solution is identical
with that at which ice separates from the same solution on being
sufficiently cooled.
   "When    sea- water  is frozen     to the extent of 15 per cent,        of its
mass, and     the crystals    so formed are allowed to melt in the        liquid
in which they have been produced,             they melt exactly as they have
been formed.      If snow    or pure ice be immersed in the brine formed
by partially freezing sea-water, it melts at the same temperature as
the ice which had been formed by freezing the sea-water, so long as
the chemical    composition remains the same in each           case.
   The heat removed        in freezing     sea- water to the extent of 15 per
cent, of its mass accounted       for the production of the same amount
of ice as was given by calculation on the basis of the chlorine found
in the mother-liquor.
   When     some saline    solutions are cooled for a sufficient length of
time at a sufficiently low temperature,           there arrives a certain con
centration at a certain       temperature,     when further removal of heat
causes solidification of the brine as a whole (cryohydrate).
   The concentration necessary          for the solidification     of even   the
cryohydrate of highest melting temperature               is such that    in the

primary     freezing    of the   water of the         sea   no such     body can be
formed.      It  would follow from this consideration alone that the
first ice formed on the        sea   in Arctic regions        consists of pure ice,
and it is also certain that it would retain               a large    quantity of the
residual sea-water       in its   interstices.      During     the winter this         in
closed liquor would solidify         in    the interstices of the crystals to ice
and cryohydrates, in       so  far    as   the temperature       and the nature of
the salts in solution would permit.                From     my experiments with
chloride of calcium, and the existence of brines observed                     to remain
liquid   at  - 30° C. at the winter       quarters of the "Vega,"        it  is unlikely
that sea-water,      as a whole,       can    ever be completely solidified             in
nature.     The presence of unfreezable            or difficultly freezable         brine
in freshly -formed      sea-water    ice, explains its eminently plastic char
acter even at very low temperatures.
    The fact that cryohydrates of different             salts solidify and melt at
different temperatures,       sufficiently explains the various composition
 of different specimens of old        sea ice.
    The apparent expansion,         near the melting-point, of ice formed by
 freezing water which contains           any salt at all is perfectly explained
 on the hypothesis that in the act of freezing                    the water       rigidly
 excludes all saline matter from participation in its solidification.
    The residual     and unfreezable         brine which remains           in consider
 able quantity liquid when sea-water is frozen, must also remain in
 greater or less quantity when fresh water is frozen.                       All   natural
 waters, including rain-water,        contain some foreign and usually saline
 ingredients.     If   we take    chloride of sodium          as   the   type of such
 ingredients, and suppose        a water to contain a quantity of this salt
 equivalent to one part by weight of chlorine in a million                       parts of
 water, then we should have a solution containing 0-0001                        per cent,
 of chlorine,   and   it would   begin to freeze and to deposit              pure ice at
 a temperature      of   - 0°-0001 C;         and   it would continue to do               so
 until,  say, 999,000 parts of water had been deposited                 as ice.     There
 would     then remain 1000          parts     of residual water,        which     would
 retain   the salt,    and   would       contain,    therefore,    O'l    per    cent,    of
 chlorine, and would not freeze until the temperature                    had fallen to
  - 0°"1    C.   This    water   would then deposit            ice   at   temperatures
 becoming progressively lower,              until, when     900   more parts of          ice
  had. been deposited,      we should have          100 parts      residual water, or

brine as it might now be called, containing                           1    per cent, of chlorine,
and remaining liquid at temperatures                           above       - 1°-0 C.           When      90
more     parts of ice had been deposited,                     we should have 10 parts                    of
concentrated         brine containing 10 per cent, chlorine and remaining
liquid    as    low as   - 13° C.       In   the case imagined, we assume the saline
contents        to consist   of NaCl only, and with further concentration the
cryohydrate would no                doubt separate             out and the mass become
really solid. On reversing the operations,                     that       is,   warming the ice just
formed, we should, when the temperature                         has risen to about              - 13° C,
have 999,990 parts ice and 10 brine containing 10 per cent chlorine.
Now, owing to the remarkable fact that pure ice, in contact with a
saline solution, melts at           a   temperature         which depends on the nature
and the amount of the salt in the solution, and                             is   identical with the
temperature         at which ice          separates       from      a     solution of the same
composition on cooling, the brine liquefies more and more ice at
progressively rising temperatures,                 until,      as before,         when the temper
ature of the mass has risen to                     - 0°-l       C,   it     consists         of 999,000
parts of ice and 1000 parts of liquid water, containing                                        1   part of
chlorine.         The remainder of the ice will melt at                               a     temperature
gradually rising from            - 0o,l      to 0° C.
   The consideration of this example                      furnishes an easy explanation
of the anomalous             behaviour of ice formed                 from anything but the
very purest         distilled    water,      in   the    neighbourhood of its melting-
point.         This subject     has been studied with great care and thorough
ness by Pettersson.              The apparent expansion of all but the very-
purest ice, when cooled             below 0°         C,   is   ascribed          by him in part to
solid saline        contents     of the ice which exercise                       a    disturbing        and
unexplained influence on its physical properties.                                     Viewed       in the
light of the fact that the presence of even the smallest quantity of
saline matter in solution prevents the formation of ice at 0°                                      C,   and
promotes        its liquefaction at temperatures                    below 0°          C,     we see that
this apparent         expansion of the ice on cooling                           is   probably due to
the     fact that we are dealing, not with homogeneous                                     solid ice, but
with    a   mixture of ice and saline solution.                             As       the    temperature
falls    this     solution     deposits       more      and    more         ice, and its           volume
increases.        But    the increase of volume                is   due to the formation of
ice out of water, and not to the                        expansion of            a    crystalline solid
already formed.

   The volume (»j) of the ice and briue formed on freezing                                this
water is compared        with that (P) observed by Pettersson in freezing
a sample of the distilled water in ordinary use in the laboratory.
   It will   be seen that the volumes               observed      by Pettersson agree
very closely    with    those calculated         for a water containing           7 parts   of
chlorine in a million, on the assumption that the saline                          matter    is
contained entirely       in adhering liquid brine.
   The irregularities in the melting-points of                  bodies like acetic acid,
to which Pettersson refers, are without                    doubt due to a perfectly
similar cause.
   Also the very low latent heat observed                       by Pettersson for         sea-
water is to be explained by the fact that the salt retains                            a con
siderable    proportion of the water in the liquid state even at tem
peratures many degrees below the freezing-point of distilled water.
   Thus, he made two determinations of the latent heat of sea-water
containing    l-927 per cent. CI and 3'53 per cent. salt.                      The freezing
took place in the one            case   between      the    temperatures         - 9°'0   and
 - 7°-47 C, and        in the other      between       - 8°-35    and    - 6° 94     C,   and
the results he found were 52'7 and 51*5.                        The mean initial tem
perature in these two experiments is                - 8°-7     C,  and the mean final
temperature      - 7°-2   C.     At   - 70,2    C. ice would form on cooling, and
would melt on warming             a  solution of chloride of sodium containing
6*48    per cent    CI, which       represents     11-87     per cent, of the sea salt.

containing 11-87 per cent., 70 per cent, of the water in it must                       be
removed.        Hence in sea-water          freezing at a final temperature             of
 - 70-2    C.  there is formed          70 per cent,      of ice, and there      remains
liquid 30 per cent, of brine.            Freezing began at the mean       temperature
  - 8°-7  C,   and the latent heat of pure ice at this temperature                  is 75.
Calculating the latent heat of this mixture from the heat                      liberated
in the calorimeter         during freezing,        and    assuming   that the      whole
mass had       solidified, Pettersson's        results   give the mean      latent    heat
of this    sea- water    as 52"1.       Calculating the apparent       latent heat      011
the assumption        that 70 per cent of the mass solidifies into                    pure
ice and that 30 per cent, remains               liquid, we get the number            51 -5.
On all grounds          therefore      we must      conclude that pure ice is          tbe
primary product in          freezing sea-water        and saline solutions of mode
rate concentration.
    The plasticity of ice and the motion of glaciers receive a                     simple
and natural explanation when we                 see, as   in Table IX., that, if       the
water     from which this ice is produced contains no more than                            7
parts    of chlorine per millon, it will, in the process of thawing,
when the temperature has risen to                 -  0°-07  C,  consist to the extent
of   1   per   cent, of its mass of          liquid brine or      water.     The     water
 considered      in Table      IX.     is certainly not less free from foreign
ingredients than rain or snow.               It  follows, therefore,   that a glacier,
in   a climate where         the temperature        is for the greater part of          the
year above Of      C,    must have a tendency to flow, owing to the power
of saline solutions to deposit ice and to dissolve it at temperatures
below    0°   C.
    The     verification of thermometers              by comparison with the air
thermometer        is always        troublesome.       It   results from     the     above
 investigations that,       if   the temperature        at which ice melts in solu
 tions of a salt, such        as   chloride of calcium of different degrees                of
 concentration,     were once and for all carefully determined                by     means
 of a standard       air thermometer,        a thermometer could be indirectly
but satisfactorily compared with the air thermometer at temperatures
below 0° C. by immersing it in a mixture of ice and chloride of
calcium solution, and taking a series of readings of the thermometer
 and samples of the brine simultaneously.                       By determining the
chlorine in the samples the concentration of the brine is ascertained,
and the comparison          with the standard         effected.

melting-point       of   ice  in    saline    solutions affords         data for     mixing
freezing baths        of any degree of cooling power.                  With chloride of
sodium, for instance,          a  rough rule is to have such an amount of
salt dissolved       in the brine that the percentage                  of chlorine shall
give     the   desired    temperature        in   Centigrade degrees           below      the
freezing-point.        In my      experiments      in   freezing    sea-water    in quanti
ties of 300 grammes,          I   usually made up the bath of 500 grammes
pounded ice, 400 grammes                water,    and 45 grammes            common       salt.
When mixed, the liquid contained about                      4 per     cent. CI, and gave
a temperature        a little below       - 4°  C.     In  the course of an hour the
liquid would contain            3   per cent,     to    3-25    per   cent.  CI, and the
temperature       have    risen to     - 3° C.       By using such baths            freezing
operations can always be kept completely in hand.
3.    On the Distribution of Temperature in the Antarctic Ocean.
                                 By   J. Y.     Buchanan.
                                         (Abstract.)
     In  the regions of the Antarctic Ocean where icebergs are numer
 ous,   and where in winter the sea-water freezes, the distribution                          of
 temperature      in the deeper layers of water is peculiar.                 The facts are
 detailed     in the Challenger Narrative (vol.                i.).   The general result
 of her observations went to show that, from the edge of the ice
 pack, a wedge of cold water stretches                     northwards for more than
  12*  of latitude, underlying and overlying strata at a higher tempera
 ture than itself (p. 418).
     Although the conditions and              facts   likely    to throw light upon the
 cause    of this  phenomenon        are discussed, no satisfactory explanation of
 it is given.       One important fact is noticed at p. 421—" The fact that
 the cold wedge above referred to extended                    north just      as  far as the
  icebergs did      in March       1874 points to there           being some connection
 between the temperature             and the presence of melting icebergs."                  It
 is well     known that icebergs            consist     of land- ice, which is nearly
  pure     frozen    water,     and    melts     in    the    air at    32°   F.      It   was
   thought that        the   effect of     immersion of such             a substance      in a
   medium having          a temperature        3°  F. lower than its melting-point
   would be to indefinitely preserve                it — that, in fact, only the lower

fathoms would suffer any melting at alL                  The existence of the cold
stratum was ascribed           wholly to the cold brine, separated from the
ice on the freezing of the             sea-water,    sinking    downwards with an
initial   temperature       of from 28° -5 to 29° F.             This    cause,  though
existing and in operation,            is quite inadequate       to produce     the effect
 observed.       The facts related in the preceding paper furnish                 a com
plete explanation of the cold wedge of water in the Antarctic                      Ocean
 and the dependence           of its thickness and temperature             on the range
 of icebergs.       These enormous islands of ice, a very large proportion
 of which rise in tabular form to a height of 200 to 300 feet above
the    sea, float    in   many cases with their lower surfaces at a depth of
 from 250 to 300 fathoms.                The warmer and denser water coming
 from lower latitudes (see Challenger Narr., vol. i. p. 428) bathes
 these lower surfaces, the temperature of the mixture at the surface
 of   contact    falls, the heat abstracted from the sea-water melts a cor
 responding amount of the ice of the iceberg, and a saline solution is
 produced,     less salt, and therefore         lighter than the water away from
 contact    with the iceberg, and having             a temperature      which depends
 immediately on the strength of the resulting solution.                   Being lighter
 than the surrounding water, this resulting solution necessarily                     flows
 up along the sides of the berg to the surface, and its place is taken
 by fresh undiluted sea-water, which in its turn is cooled, diluted, and
 transferred to the surface.            The result is the production of a means
 of circulating and of cooling and equalising                    the    temperature      of
 the    water    within    the   reach    of icebergs.        As    there   is continual
 renewal of the ocean water brought into contact                     with the ice, and
 as its composition is constant,            the temperature       produced is practi
 cally constant,         namely,    28°-8 to 29°-0      F., or    -  1°7 to    -  r*8 C.
 The layer of lighter water              from 50 to 80 fathoms thick at the
 surface    is due principally to this melting of land-ice, though it is
  also due in small proportion to the melting               of sea-ice.

    The density (at 15°-56 C.) of the searwater which comes in contact
with the lower surfaces of the icebergs is P0255, which represents
a chlorine     percentage      of 1 -90.   Ice actually melting in this water
would produce a temperature of              - l°-92 C. "When ice is immersed
in this water it lowers its temperature, and a portion of the ice is
melted, producing dilution.            The concentration, therefore, or chlorine
percentage,      which      will determine the melting        temperature     of  the
ice,  will be a  little lower than that of     the original sea-water.     From the
"                 " observations we see
   Challenger                                 that, on the confines of the pack
ice, the    cold stratum of water has a uniform temperature               of 29° F.
(- 1°'67 C).          Ice  melts at this temperature     in  sea-water containing
1 "65   per cent,    of chlorine.       In this  process   ice is melted,    so that
100 grammes         pure warm sea-water become 119 grammes of diluted
 cold sea-water.         It  will  be observed     that the ice which has been
formed     in the    atmosphere     at a temperature    of 32°    F.  comes  in this
way to be melted at a temperature                 of 29° F.   ;   and the pressure
exerted by the 300 fathoms of sea-water, though                    it  may assist   in
the lowering       of    the melting temperature,      is insufficient to account
for the amount.

  n, for taking        i = Aw, A        a  given number however large, then            q is in
  definitely near to the very small value «-A, but nevertheless                       the last
  term       - J(a + i + 2)q2,        by taking n sufficiently large may be made as
  large as we please, and the value would thus come out negative.                            It

      Arrangement of the Lenses.                                 By Edward Sang, LL.D.
     In designing     a telescope                for a particular class of observations,                   it
was    found desirable to have a field-bar in the focus of the object-
glass, and, at the same                  time, to have an image of that object-glass
exterior to the eye-lens.                    These desiderata              cannot      both be got by
the achromatic arrangement                       of two lenses made of one material                  ;   they
are combined        in    the ordinary four-lens eye-piece.
     "While   investigating the action of the four lenses with a view to
a    third condition, found, however, to be unattainable,                                   I was    led to
notice a porism altogether new to me, and which                                        guides       us to a
new arrangement               of the lenses.                   Believing       that this porism has
hitherto escaped notice,                 I   venture to submit it to the Society.
      Let B, C, D,       E    represent                  four thin lenses, all of one material,

  With this         one condition of achromatism among the seven quantities,
we are at liberty to conjoin                other conditions, subject of course to
their possibility.             The most obvious collateral condition is that the
combination             DE    be achromatic        in itself,       so that      it   may       be used
separately as an inverting eye-piece.                      This achromatism is              expressed

   This equation (C) shows that                    the pair B,        C cannot         be made self-
achromatic at the same time with the pair D, E, because this would
imply        the    condition        f1+f2- 2it        = 0,     and would             necessitate       an
infinite value for            b2.    The equation (C) may be written in the form
                                                                                 - 26,)

     Now, in arranging               a   Huygenian         eye-piece, we         may assume any
ratio between    and /4. If we wish to use
                         f3                    field-bar, as in sur       a

                                              /4
make       /4   the lesser, because then the image of the object-glass                           is    out
side of and close to the lens               E,   and so       a   large   field of view          is   had.
In    this   case      it     important that the Khoita's                 lens   D    be well out        of

particles on its surface may be out of view.                          One maker may prefer
the ratio two to one; another maker may adopt that of three to one.
     If    then we have fixed upon some ratio n, and resolved to make in

    An     eye-piece constructed    in this way     has the several    advantages
belonging to all four-lens ones.           It shows  the objects  in their natural
position     ;  it allows of  a field-bar across which cobwebs         and micro-
metric scales may be placed          ;  a stop   between   the lenses     B  and C,
having its aperture equal to the image of the               object-glass,   cuts off
all extraneous light ; we may introduce there                a sun-screen,    which
shall not be heated so intensely as that usually placed outside of the
eye-lens       E.     But this particular     arrangement     superadds    another.
 Our inverting Huygenian         eye-pieces having been all constructed to the
same      ratio n   , we screw on the      portion B, C, D, or uprighter        as it
may be called,          and are then at liberty to use any one of our
battery, the magnifying powers being at the same time considerably
augmented.

    At night      the cobwebs   of the telescope are invisible        for want of
light   ;   we have to illuminate      either the field or the wires, so as to
 make them visible          by contrast.       At noon   the   astronomer     meets

with     the same        kind of difficulty from          an opposite cause          ;   the intense
sun's light       has to he ohscured              by a dark glass, which, at the same
time, completely obliterates the spider-lines                       ;   these are only seen on
the sun's face.           In    consequence,         the advent of the sun's edge to a
wire cannot be observed                ; the     line must be fairly on the sun's face
before we can see             it,   and thus the noted instant                is   necessarily too
late,   — too    late by   a   quantity depending on the power of the telescope
and on the skill of the observer.                     Hence the estimate of the sun's
apparent        diameter from observations of the meridian passage may
bo expected           to err        slightly in      defect,     while      the    thence-deduced
right ascension must be too great
     But,   if   a   thin cloud       pass before us, we use            a   paler screen and            see
the wires over the whole field while the sun's edge remains                                distinctly
denned      ;   the observations are then satisfactorily made.                           It   occurred
to me that, at all times, we may make an artificial cloud, and, to
day just four weeks ago,              I   laid   a   thin muslin over             the object-glass
of my alt-azimuth, and got all that                      is   needed.

I     described two species                 of Acanthodrilus                — A.    novae-zelandice and
A. dissimilis      — very closely allied in structure, and agreeing in a
number        of points to diifer from the third species, A. mulliporus. A.
dutimUis           is distinguished           from A.          novce-zelandim              mainly        by the
character          of the       sperm athecas ;         these      organs      are    present           in both
species       to the number                of two pairs.               In A.       novce-zelandice each
?permatheca,             which is somewhat                  pear-shaped,           is provided with                  a
number of small diverticula                       arranged round its external orifice                           ;    in
A. dissimilis, the               spermatheca         has but a single pair                     of diverticula,
which are of very considerable size.                            The former species is also fre
quently provided                 with      a double dorsal blood-vessel                    ;    this character
is,   however, not absolutely distinctive of A.                                novoe-zelanduB          ;    some
individuals             agree    with A. dissimilis               in    possessing       a       single dorsal
vessel      I       may state         that the condition of the dorsal vessel                               is      no
criterion         of the age of the individual.                        In   the largest specimens                    of
A.     nowe-zdandicB dissected                    by me the dorsal vessel was double,
while those specimens                   in which       it   was    represented           by     a   single tube
happened to be              very small.
      On again looking                through the collection of New Zealand earth
worms         which Prof.             T.   J.     Parker kindly sent me,                 I        find that         I
have confounded                  two apparently distinct species under the name
of    Acanthodrilus             dissimilis.
      As there are        a     large number of individuals of A. dissimilis which
fall into two series,            I    think that     I      am justified           in making        a   specific,
or    at   least   a    subspecific        distinction, although the point wherein the
two series         of individuals           differ     is   after all rather         a     small one        ;       but
it    6©ems       to me that          a    differential character,            if    it   be constant                for
&
    large number           of    specimens,       is   of importance, however small.
      The accompanying                 drawings illustrate              the difference              to which        I
refer.
      In   fig.    1,   which represents the anterior segments of the body seen
Tentrally, there are              a   pair of genital papillae situated on segment 10.
For this variety           I       shall retain the name A. dissimilis.                                In   fig.     2
the genital papillae              occupy      a   different position          ;    they are situated on
the 8th segment.                 For this variety      I     propose the name of                  A.   neglectus.

      On looking over             a   collection of earthworms which                  I         have received

 158          Proceedings       of Royal Society of Edinburgh.                    [april   4,
 from New Zealand by the kindness of Prof. T.                         J.  Parker,  I  found
 a single      individual      which differs from the rest in a number of
 characters.       The remaining specimens belong to three distinct new
 species which       I  have lately described,* referring them to the genus
 Acanthodrihis.           The    specimen       which      forms the       subject   of the
 present     communication appeared at first sight to belong to                          the
 species Acanthodrilus dissimilis,            F. E. B., though considerably            more
 slender     than any of         the   individuals       of that species        which    the
 collection contained.
    The     setee are disposed      in four      series of pairs, and the nephridial
 pores alternate       in position precisely         as   in Acanthodrihis dissimilis.
 The clitellum occupies a similar position, and extends over an equal
 number of segments, viz.,            5  (13-17).         Instead of there being two
 pairs of spermathecal           apertures,    there is only a single one situated
between the 7th and 8th segments, on a line with the inferior                           pair
 of  setre.     The male generative pore is placed upon the 17th segment,
and each pore is continuous with                   a groove      upon the integument,
 which extends          over    the   following       segment,      and    ends upon     the
 middle of the 19th segment                 I could    not, however,       detect a second
pair of male generative pores upon this segment.                         In Acanthodrilus
dissimilis — at       least   in  many    individuals — there         is a similar groove
connecting the genital pores of the 17th with those of the 19th
segment       entirely similar to that of Neodrilus.                  It  is possible   that
this supposed         new genus       Neodrilus is really an Acanthodrilus, in
which the posterior            pair of male generative             pores, together     with
their glands, have not yet been developed.                        I am    not aware, how
ever, of any similar instance              in the genus         Acanthodrilus, and the
present species is        fully  mature.       In favour of this supposition, how
ever, is the condition          of certain other peculiar accessory generative
structures      which    I have lately described           +  in a species     of Acantho
drilus from New Caledonia              ; these are sometimes            present and some
times absent       in  mature individuals.           Another possibility is that the
present individual is abnormal,             and it is principally for these reasons
that   I have    hesitated in making           a  new genus      ;  though there can be
no doubt of the specific distinctness of the worm.
    The     male    generative       pore    is continuous with            a long, coiled,
tubular prostatic         gland, the proximal           region    of which is a slender

    Spermathecce.     — In    the 8th     segment       are a pair of oval          spermar
thecse, which open on to the exterior in the groove which separates
this   segment from the one in front.                  As is    so  generally the       case,
they are provided        with    a diverticulum.           The diverticulum of each
spermatheca      lies in the segment in front of that which contains the
spermatheca      itself, and is remarkable in being actually larger than
the spermatheca.          In   most,  if not in all,      the genera of earthworms
which     are included     in Perrier's two      groups, Intraclitellians and Post-
clitellians, the spermatheca? open close to the anterior boundary of
the segment which contains them.                  In   certain species of Lumbricus
 and other Anteclitellian         genera, the position is sometimes different,
 the 8permathecal        apertures     being situated near              to   the posterior
 boundary      of their      segment.       In   one     instance,      at any rate,      the
 spermatheca;     actually perforate       the mesentery        bounding the segment
 which contains them on their way to the exterior.                        In   a species of
 earthworm lately described          by myself in a note communicated                       to
 the Eoyal Society of Edinburgh,*               this is the     case   with    one or more
 of the seven pairs of spermathecae which are present in that species.
 It   might be imagined, therefore,              that in Neodrilus             the  anterior
 larger portion of the spermatheca                really corresponds           to the sper
 matheca,      while the       posterior     smaller portion         is    the   homologue
 of the diverticulum so constantly found in Perichceia,                     Acanthodrilus,
 and in other genera.             "Without      an     examination         of the    minute
 structure of the        two regions         of the spermatheca,             it would       be
 difficult   to say which was spermatheca                   and   which diverticulum.
 In   three   species of Acanthodrilus          I   have described,          I  believe    for
 the first time, a very marked difference in minute structure between
 the   spermatheca      and the diverticulum, which is correlated                  with    the
 fact that the spermatozoa           always appear to be stored                  up in the
 diverticula.      In the     present    species    I   find an identical difference
 in the structure of        the spermatheca        and    its appendage, which leads
 to the inference that the anterior            sac    is the diverticulum.            Seeing
 that in many        cases,   especially    in  Pvrichceta,     the diverticula of the
 spermathecaa extend into the segment                   anterior to that which con-

 tains the spermatheca          itself, the disposition of these structures in

    The Nephridia have exactly the same structure                as  in Acanihodrtlus
 dissimilis,    and,    as  already    mentioned,     alternate     in position from
 segment to segment          in  the same fashion.         This fact      cannot, how
 ever, be regarded as a proof that the two worms belong to the same
 genus.     1  shall have occasion to point out in a future paper that an
 Australian earthworm, Cryptodrilusfletcheri, n. sp., possesses nephridia
 which are in every respect similar to those of Acanthodrilus                      and
 Neodrilus in structure and in position, and other instances are there
 mentioned.

    The present description is the outcome               of an investigation into
 the structure of an Australian species of the genus                 Urochasta.    The
 specimens     were   kindly given      to me by     Mr S. Prout      Newcombe,    and
 come    from Queensland.            I have been able to examine a large
 number, all of     which     were   in   a very fair state of preservation for
microscopical examination.
    The genus        is at present        known     to inhabit     Brazil, the "West
Indies,    Java,     Sumatra,      and Australia,     and    comprises      only three
 species at most.        The first of these was originally described by Fritz
Miiller,* who      met    with it in Brazil, under the name of Lumbricus
corethrurus.       The specific name " brush-tail " was given to the worm
on account       of the irregular disposition of the           setae  at the posterior
end of the body ; the segments are              in this   region of the body very
close together,     and the setae being usually (at least          in   the contracted
state   of the body) much            protracted     and directed      backwards, the
aptness     of the name will be very evident to any one acquainted
with these worms.           Fritz Miiller did not thoroughly investigate the
structure of the worm, and was therefore                unable to      see  any reason
for removing it from the genus Lumbricus.
    A  somewhat        fuller   account     of the same species was given by
Perrier in his " Recherches pour servir               a l'histoire des lombriciens
serrestres."    f   Perrier rightly created a new genus for the reception

of the same species                   in       the    New World            and         in Java is rather to
be explained             by its accidental importation into                              the latter country,

described          in the present               paper     — a native of Australia — is really
different       from Urochada dubia.
     A    second       species of the genus has been quite lately described                                     by
Br Horet,          f under           the       name of          Urochceta          dubia, from Sumatra.
Br Horst's description is necessarily                              — owing to           the poor condition
of his         material       — brief, and only                   refers      to       the more          important
points.
     The differences             between              Urochceta      dubia and U. corethrurus                  are
chiefly        in the position of the spermathecae (situated in segments
6, 7,        8, instead of 8, 9, 10) and in the fact that there are four
pairs of        modified clitellar                   setae, a    pair upon each of the segments
C. 18,
         19,    20, 21,         instead   of the single pair (on segment 20) of
         corethrurus.           It   appears also that in Horst's species all the
segments         anterior to the clitellum are furnished with                                   setae,    while in
U. corethrura the               first three segments are devoid of these structures;
furthermore, the irregularity                          in the     arrangement           of the        setae begins
to be evident            in segment 10 in U. dubia, and not until segment 14
in   U. corethrurus.
     The clitellum            is   very readily                 to be made out                 with      specimens
of    the Australian               Urochceta,           and occupies               about eight segments,
commencing              with       the     14th and             ending with              the     22nd.       Very
often        the      first   and last of these                    segments            were     only partially

invaded by glandular substance.                   In fully   mature      individuals       the
clitellum was perfectly developed                on the ventral as well          as on the
dorsal side of tbe segments               pertaining to      it     A   remarkable        fact
about the clitellum         of this species is that the glandular                substance
is entirely undeveloped            between      the segments,      so   that this      region
of the      body is just          as  plainly segmented         as   any other       region;
indeed,     the contrast        between      the    thick glandular         appearance       of
the segments         themselves,       and     the deep     furrows which           separate
 them, renders the segmentation              if anything rather       more conspicuous
 than elsewhere.
     It is to be noted      that the number of segments occupied                      by    the
 clitellum     and their position is the same as             in  the other two        species
 of Urocliceia.
     The    disposition      of    the   setae    is remarkable;        in the      anterior
 segments of the body, comprising the first eight segments, the                           sete
 are arranged,     as  in Lumbncus, in four series of pairs               ;  the two set*
 of each pair        are   closely approximated to each                  other, and         the
 intervals between the pairs are not widely different.
     In   the   9th segment there is already               some     little   difference       in
 the   seta? ; the   two    setae    of each of the ventral pairs are at               a little
 greater distance       from each other than in the preceding                    segments ;
 the dorsal pair of seta? of the right side is completely similar                              to
 the same pair of        setae   in the foregoing segments          ;  on the left        side,
 however,     the two setae have become               widely separate, the          distane*
 between      them being much greater than that which separates                              the
 individual     setae of the ventral pairs.
     In the next     segment the two setae of each of the ventral pairs                      are
 somewhat       more widely separated from each other, but the two set*
  of each of the dorsal pairs are again quite close together, as in                          the
 earlier segments.
     In   the next few segments the two ventral pairs of setae remain
  exactly   as   in the segments just described            ;  the innermost           seta; of
  the dorsal pairs correspond           exactly in position to the innermost                    of
  the same pair of setae in the earlier segments.                 The outermost            sete,
  however,     vary very much in position, being sometimes                       nearer        to,
  and sometimes        further away from the innermost sete                    ;  moreover,
  the two halves of the body are not symmetrical                   in this respect

   after the clitellar segments,          if  not earlier,      the setee have         a partly
   regular, partly irregular arrangement.                  The ventral          setae   of each
   pair have a fixed position, and correspond                      for a large number of
   consecutive      segments     ;  the    dorsal    setae    of each pair are, on the
   contrary,    quite irregular in their disposition.                   There appears to be
   no regular     alternation in their arrangement               ;   it  sometimes      happens
  that    the   seta    of two       consecutive       segments         will   correspond       in
  position,    sometimes      the     setae   of one segment,            and the next but
  one   or next but two,           &c, that it is impossible               to lay down any
  general statements.        The two halves of the body are not symmetrical
  in respect     of their    setae.     In the hinder part of               the body there is
  a perfectly    regular alternation of the          setae   from segment to segment;
  each    seta    of   one  segment        is exactly between              two    setae   of the
  preceding and consecutive              segments    ;  and this statement applies to
  all the setae      in that region of          the body, hence            there   are exactly
 sixteen rowB        in this region of         the body,       while there are           a great
  many more anteriorly.
     In   U. eorethrurus the setae of the anterior segments are disposed
  regularly and       in pairs  ;  but the two      setae    of each pair do not appear
  from    Pel-Tier's   description to be        so closely applied          as in my species.
  They agree      in   the fact that in the posterior part of the body the
 aetae  regularly alternate, each seta being placed between two                          setae of
 the   preceding and succeeding                 segments.         Perrier, however,          says
  nothing     about the disposition of the             setae   in the middle portion of
 the   body.       I    must assume,         therefore,     for the        present    that the
 remarkable arrangement             of the    setae of my Urochceta in this, by far
 the greater      portion of the body, is peculiar to that species, and dis
 tinguishes      it from    Urochceta        eorethrurus.        Dr Horst's description
 of Urochceta        dubia seems to show that this species differs but little
 in this particular respect from U. eorethrurus.
     With     regard     to the shape of the             setae,     I   have    to record      an
important difference from                U. eorethrurus.            Perrier describes        and
figures the setae in the latter species                  as   being bifid at their free
extremity, and dwells upon the similarity                        in this respect to the
Naidea.         Horst says nothing            about the structure of the                setae  in
 U. dubia.         In my      species      I   did  not succeed in observing any
bifurcation of the distal extremity of the                  setae ; these structures         are,
in fact, precisely similar to those of other earthworms.                           This differ

 ence might be regarded             as of generic       value,    were    it not for       the
 correspondence        in all other    essentials of structure.
    Another       point of difference        from U. corethrurus concerns                 the
 genital     setae ;   not, however,      in their   general     shape, for    I    find no
 difference      in this   respect between the genital setae of my Urocheeia
and those figured             by Perrier.     But while        in   U. corethrurus         the
 genital     setae   are confined     to segment       20, where       they replace        the
 ventralmost       setae on either     side, my species has four pairs             of these
 peculiarly       modified setae;        they have       precisely the distribution
mentioned        by Horst in U. dubia, being found upon segments 18-21,
and occupying the position of the ventralmost                   setae.
    Intersegmental         Septa. — As in     so  many other        species and genera
of earthworms,          the present     species exhibits a thickening of certain
of the anterior mesenteries.                There are four of these               specially
thickened mesenteries,            the first of which immediately follows the
gizzard    ;   the   last forms the        posterior    boundary        of segment         10.
It   is in the segments bounded by these thick mesenteries that the
spermathecae lie.
    The hindermost of these thickened mesenteries,                     as already     stated,
marks off the 10th from the succeeding segment                       ;  the arrangement
of the mesenteries in front of this does not correspond exactly with
the    external segmentation.              The posterior     spermatheca        lies in a
segment       which is bounded anteriorly by the last but one of the
thickened mesenteries, and posteriorly by the last of these                       ;    exter
nally, however,         this segment is distinctly separated by a cross furrow
into    two segments;            and,   moreover,     the difference        between       the
external and internal segmentation                 is not only marked by a cross
furrow, but also by what is more important, namely, a distinctly
double row of setae.
    In   the median ventral region of the               body there are traces             left
of the mesentery             which    should divide        the 9th from the 10th
segment       on either side of the nerve cord             ; and symmetrically dis
posed     in relation       to the nerve cord and to each other is a muscular
band, which is attached above to the posterior                   stout mesentery, and
below to the furrow which marks                   the division        between      the    9th
and    10th     segments.       The stout mesenteries are everywhere                at their
insertion on to the body wall divided into separate muscular bands,
two of them only being left between segments 8 and 9.

    A              of the above description with that of Perrier (loc.
          comparison
eit., p. 390) will show that there is some little difference in these
points from U. eorethrurus.     Perrier, in fact, states that in his
species the specially thickened mesenteries                                      are inserted on to the
posterior margin of segments 5, 7, 8, 9, and                                     1 1 ;    two segments, viz.,
6   and     10, appear            therefore to have lost the posterior mesentery,
instead of only one segment, as                         in my         species.
    There is some difficulty in making an exact comparison between
the two species, because                         Perrier's figure     (pi. xv. fig. 28) does not
agree     with his description.                       In    the figure referred to there are but
four     thickened mesenteries,                      which seem to correspond                      exactly in
their arrangement to the mesenteries                                    of the Australian              species.
There      seems,           however, to be a slight difference                             in position   ;    the
last     thick mesentery in my                       species forms the posterior margin of
segment 10,            if    the commencement                   of the clitellum has been rightly
referred         by   me to the             1   2th segment.            It     is,   however,     not an easy
matter to differentiate the two or three                                     anterior segments          of the
body; and, as Perrier had living specimens                                           at his disposal,        it   is
probable         that his enumeration of the segments                                 is   more correct than
mine.       In        this case the clitellum                   in my species begins               a   segment
later than  in his.
    Integument. — Perrier's memoir contains                                  a   detailed account of the
structure        of    the integument (pp.                  382-400), illustrated by numerous
figures.    I         cannot, however, altogether reconcile                              his description and
figures,     in       so far as they rofer to the structure of the epidermis,
with the appearances                   presented by my own sections.
    In    fig.   1    Perrier gives             a   general view of the epidermis or surface
view,     in which           it   is   seen to be marked out into polygonal areas,
separated by           a     certain amount of interstitial matter                          ;   some of these
contain granular bodies (lettered                           a in his figure), while others are
without them.                  Between the             setae are        certain          very peculiar struc
tures     (j), which          appear        in     section to be contained                 in sac-like diver

Vrochceta,              I    have           met with         these     peculiar structures in abund

appearance of being formed of some resistant substance,                                               being fre
quently indented; they lie at the base of the epidermic cells, just in
the      position in which Perrier has figured                                 them (loc. cit., pL xii.

several        seta of            a    segment,         being but rarely disposed                    irregularly,
in my          species          the contrary            is   the      case; they are very frequently
irregular           in      size as well as position,                   though they form always                  a
continuous row between                            the    setee,      and are not, as far as my ex
perience            goes, found              elsewhere.             Perrier      is   quite right in stating
that the polygonal areas in his figure correspond                                            to cells, but has
overlooked the fact (which was not known at the time when he
                " interstitial " substance also cellular, and consists
wrote) that the                                                             is
of elongated                narrow cells, the polygonal spaces being occupied by
large         glandular cells with granular contents which do not stain.
In     fig.    2,   pL       xil    of Perrier's memoir,               a    transverse       section    through
the epidermis                is    figured, which does not at all represent the appear
ances presented                   by my sections.                In Perrier's         figure are represented
a   series of columnar granular cells, among which are                                         a   few peculiar
rod-like bodies; these latter                      I      am unable to identify                in my    prepara

representation of the large                             glandular           cells,     which    appear        to be

       Excretory Organs. — My species                                of Urochcela          possesses,    like U.
corethrurus,                a     pair       of   large       glands         in      the   anterior     segments
of      the     body,           which         have      been        termed        by Perrier         "glandes     a

 the    external orifice,         Perrier    remarks     (loc.   cit.,  p.  460)   : — " En
faisant des coupes dans la région                  antérieure du corps, nous avous
constamment rencontré dans l'épaisseur même                          des téguments        un
canal circulaire entouré d'une sorte de sphincter et présentant des
cils vibratiles      très-reconaissables        môme sur des individus desséchés.
.Nous avions d'abord pensé que nous avions sous les yeux la coupe
de la portion du canal excréteur des glandes                   à mucosité    qui est logée
dans les téguments           ;  mais nous n'avons pu nous             convaincre de l'in
exactitude [exactitude 1] de cette appréciation.                    Dans nos coupes ce
canal s'est toujours montré unique, et les glandes à mucosité ont
dee orificiee excréteurs          distincts   ; de plus, le canal en question nous a
paru occuper la partie la plus antérieure du corps                    ; et ces  faits sont
contraires     à   la supposition qui nous était d'abord venue à l'esprit."
If   M. Perrier        means      to state    in the above-quoted         words that the
excretory      duct of the "glande à mucosité"                     is furnished        at its
termination       with     a    "sphincter" like that which surrounds the
aperture of the        nephridia,      I am in a position to confirm the correct
ness of his statement                By a series of transverse          sections,    I  have
been able to trace on both sides of the body the duct of this gland
to its external opening, and              I find  that the latter is surrounded by
one    of  these peculiar bodies which               Perrier was the first to record
in the     case    of the nephridia.            On the other hand, the duct never
traversed the body walls except,                  of course, at the point where            it
perforates it on its way to the exterior, and the two ducts were both
perfectly distinct.            M. Perrier    does not mention whether the single
duct which he found in the transverse section was situated laterally
or  in the median line.             I cannot     detect  any trace of cilia in these
canals, which, indeed            seem    to be hardly needed, as they are physio
logically    replaced       by the       muscular walls.         The presence        of the
" sphincter     "
                     is evidently         an    important     additional      resemblance
between the glandes à mucosité and the nephridia.
   With      regard       to the      nephridia,    I   am unable        to find in my
species     what       Perrier     states   to be the relations of the internal
funnel in     U. corethrvrut.           He  says (loc. cit., p. 438)   — " Les pavillons

     M. Perrier        figures       (loc. cU., pi. xvi.             figs.   38, 39)            the    isolated
nephridia, which obviously could not be detached entire                                         if tbe   funnel
were       not situated in the same segment                           as     that which            bears     the
external pore.              Nevertheless, in my species                    I observed           in numerous
cases that the internal funnel of the nephridium                                     is situated in          the
segment anterior to that which bears the external pore.                                          I was      able
to prove this point conclusively by a series of longitudinal                                           sections.
It   may be that Perrier's specimens                   and mine differ in this                          respect,
which       is certainly         rather remarkable.                  Perrier's         assertion          about
Lumbricus          is evidently a slip.   The funnel (figs. 6, 7, 8) of the
nephridium          recalls that of Dendrobcena rubida (Vejdovsky, System
u. Morph. d. Oligochmten,                 pi. xiv. figs. 15, 16) in the extraordinarj
development of cells, doubtfully regarded by Vejdovsky as                                         peritoneal
cells, at the apex of the funnel.
     A   series    of remarkable          structures,       termed           by       Perrier         " glandes
posterieures,"        and described           by him as a portion of the                              excretory
system,      now remains for consideration.
     These bodies           are found as      in    U. corethrurus              in   the    hinder       region
of the body, but appear to be more numerous than in that                                                species,
which has about forty pairs occupying                           as   many segments.
     M. Perrier gives       of one of these glands (loc. cit., p. xviL
                              a figure                                                                         fig,
47), which only partially indicates their structure, as seen in my own
preparations.              They are somewhat           pear-shaped,              and terminate              in   a
long slender          peduncle, which disappears                       among          the coils of           the
nephridial         tubules.         Perrier   supposes          that they open in                      common
with       the latter on to the exterior, but was                  unable to detect the
orifice.      Mr Benham* has detected                                             "

minute structure agrees pretty closely with my own observations                                                  ;
these glands open              in    Urobenus ventrally of the lower pair of sete,
while the nephridia open by the dorsal                           setse.

that its structure            is    closely similar to that of the same glands                                in

permeated         by blood                 capillaries derived           from the vessels which
supply the nephridia.                        The pear-shaped             glandular              region of the
pyriform vesicle has the structure just described                                    ;    distally      it    com
municates        with        a    slender muscular duct, which passes                                 gradually
into the substance                    of   the gland.       The latter          is    bent upon itself,
as    indicated in Perrier's figure, so that the duct runs parallel with
the gland.            But while in               U. corvthrurus and in Urobenus                         the duct
is    directed    towards the nerve cord, the flexure in my Urochceta                                              is
exactly     in the           opposite        direction.         The rounded cells lining the
lumen gradually decrease in importance,                             and the granular substance,
with its interspersed nuclei lying                          to the        outside of these                   cells,
eventually       disappears            ;   coincidently with these charges the duct of
the    gland acquires             a   delicate muscular coat, and the lining epithelium
finally becomes               a       flattened     layer of cells.           I       have traced              this
muscular sac to its opening on to the exterior in common                                                with   the
nephridium.                Fig.    4       shows the termination                of the duct in the
rosette-like          organ which                here    as elsewhere          guards the orifice of
the nephridium.                   The pyriform vesicle,              therefore,           is    anatomically
a   diverticulum of the nephridial duct in this species.
     Spermaihecae.          — These          organs       are     present       to       the      number           of
three     pairs   ;       they are           situated in segments                7,       8,     and     9,    and
the aperture          is     in       each   case placed          quite close to                the     anterior
margin      of        the segment.                  The         spermathecae             of      this    species
are    excessively delicate organs,                       and      are        often for this             reason
difficult    to           distinguish        ;   they are also           of     very           small size,         as
compared         with            the spermatheca            of     many other worms.                           The
smallness        of        size    is      manifest rather          in their breadth than in
their length      ;       when stretched                out they reach rather further than
across the segment                which contains them.                   These organs                 are some
what club-shaped             ;     the distal region       is    extremely narrow, but widens

out gradually passing backwards, and finally becomes dilated into an
oval sac.       The spermathecse           sometimes      lie straight, and are some
times coiled into a circle.                 The walls       of   the   spennathecse           are
very thin, owing to the slight development of muscles                                and the
character     of the lining epithelium, consisting as it does of flattened
cells  ; these structural features, together             with the superficial covering
of rounded,        vesicular, peritoneal cells, and the general shape of the
organs,     gives    the spermathecse           a very    strong resemblance            to the

spermathecse        and    such diverticula,        it is worth while to record th«
points of similarity           between        the two series of organs.             Further
more,    I  may remark that         in   a large number         of individuals, all fully
mature,     there was no increased              development visible in the sperma
thecse, which undoubtedly have a certain appearance of immaturity.
    The general        shape    of the spermatheca:           is very like that of the
8permathec£e of DiacJueta,^ but they appear                         to be    considerably
smaller in the present            species, and also differ in that their aper
tures    on to      the   exterior     are at the        anterior, instead of at the
posterior, boundary of their respective segments.
    In   Urochceta      corethrurus      J   there are also three pairs          of  sperma-
thecs not unlike            those   at present under discussion            in    shape, and
opening like them at the anterior margin of their segment                                ;  they
are situated,       however, rather further back (in segments                     8, 9, 10) ;
further, in both Urochceta and Diachmta the spermathocal                           segments
contain nephridia.

    This   species is represented          by eight individuals, of which four are
sexually mature, with           a  fully    developed     clitellum.

same colour as the ventral surface ; the clitellum also is distinguish
able on the dorsal surface by its yellowish tinge.
    It  is interesting to note that the colour of this species is exactly
that of a species of Perkmyx,               from the Philippine Islands,                 the
characters      of which     I have recently described          in   a paper   communi
cated    to the Zoological Society of London. *
    The preoral lobe           does   not    divide       the   circumoral      segment.
Dorsal pores are present between                  all   the   posterior segments           of
the body;      in the four mature individuals             the first pore is situated
between       the   5th    and    6th segments        ;   the   clitellum    is marked
anteriorly and posteriorly by          a  conspicuous pore.
   The setw, as in other species of the genus,                      are  disposed      in   a
continuous      series, occupying the middle line of each segment                  ;   they
are present     on the clitellar segments.
   The clitellum occupies three segments, Nos. 14, 15, 16                     ; as   in all
species    of Perichaeta it is      developed    round the whole circumference
of the body.
   The male and female generative pores are placed in exactly the
same     situation as in other species.          The female pore is placed upon
the 14th      segment,   within     the   row of     setae  in the middle line        ; the
male pores      are upon the      1 8th  segment, at some         little distance from
each other,     also within the row of        setae.
   The apertures of the spermathecw are between 7-8 and 8-9.
   A very striking external character of this worm is caused by the
great   development of genital papilla1..
   These are developed on the preclitellar segments (fig. 10), as well
as   on    the segments        which     immediately        precede,     and on      those
which     follow the 18th      segment.
   The arrangement of the preclitellar               papilla?     presents   some     indi
 vidual variation, which is probably duo to the fact that some of the
specimens are more         fully   mature than others.
    In  one example the papilla? were more                numerous than iu any of
the others.       The 13th segment is furnished with a single papilla in
 the   ventral median line; the 11th and 12th segment                        have      each
three papillae     close together,    one being median,            and the other two
disposed symmetrically, one on either side;                   the   10th segment        has
 four papillae,     of which     the middle      ones     correspond in position          to
                         *

the    median papillae      of   the     two succeeding         segments;    the   9th
segment    has a single papilla, corresponding in position to the outer
most right-hand one of the 10th segment, the others being indistinct ;
the 7th and 8th segments           have each a single median papilla.               In
another example the 12th and 13th segments have a single median
papilla;   the 10th and 11th         segments        have each three papillae;     the
7th, 8th, and 9th a single median papilla.
    Two    other examples        present an          arrangement     of the genital
papillae   nearly identical with that last described,             the only difference
being that the papillae on segments               7 and 8 are wanting.
    In  every   case  the papillae        present    the appearance     of a circular
disc similar in colour to the clitellum, and surrounded by a whitish
line  ; the greater part of the disc is placed              in front of the row of
setae.
    The postclitellar papillae        are not so distinct         as the preclitellax.
The whole of the ventral integument on the 17th, 18th, and 19th
segments     lying between       the    male aperture       is whiter in colour than
the rest, which      renders    it very difficult        to map out the position     of
 the papillae.     The 17th segment appeared to have a row of these
 papillae;   in the 18th and 19th               segments    I could  only distinguish
 two pairs of papillae, one placed               outside of the male pore on the
 18th, and in    a corresponding position on the 19th segment, and the
other placed      below, and both inside of the male pore.                  The 20th
 segment    has a median row of papillae                (3 or 4), the   21st segment
 has three median papillae.        The postclitellar papillae are considerably
 smaller than      the   preclitellar.        I   am   inclined   to think that the
 whitish   appearance     of the integument between the male generative
 pores is due to the crowding             together of      a  row of papillae, which
 become distinct and separate on the 20th, and especially on the 21st
 segment.
    The large pharynx extends back to about segment                   3 ; the  gizzard
 occupies segments 4, 5, and 6          ;  it  is important to notice that    in every
 case the segments       in which      the gizzard lies are separated from each
 other by distinct, though rather delicate,                 mesenteries ; this fact is
 worth recording, because in many species of Perichata (and other
 genera)    the gizzard      occupies          two segments, and the median
 mesentery     has disappeared      ;   there     seems to be, however,     some con
 nection between       this  condition          and the position of the gizzard.

In   the present species the gizzard lies anteriorly to the spermathecae                                             ;
in those species where                      a mesentery          has disappeared            the gizzard lies
further back, and in the same segments with some or all of the sper
mathecae.
  Calci/erotis glands are present in segments 10, 11, 12 ; they are,
however, rather dilatations of the lumen of the oesophagus than
distinct and separate glands.
     The       testes    are situated in                the     10th and 11th segments,                        close
to the nerve cord                   and on either side of it.                  Dr Bergh              is perfectly
right in his statement                      * that       the testes and vesiculae seminales                        of
Perieheeta           are     in     all     essentials         similar   to    those           of    Lumbricus.
The testes in the present species are small digitate glands, and are
enclosed by the vesiculae, as is also the nerve cord.                                      The vas deferens
passes         along the body just below the testis                            ;    the funnels of the
vasa deferentia                open        into the vesiculae            seminales,             which      organs
extend from the 9th to the 12th segment.
     The ovaries are very large, and are situated in the 13th segment.
     The prostates occupy the usual position.
     The spermathccm                      are    present        to the     number              of    two       pairs,
situated        in      segments           8 and 9        ;    the large       somewhat             pear-shaped
pouch is provided with a small diverticulum on the dorsal side.
     The only species of Perichceta recorded                                  from Australia            are two
species,       P. australis and P. coxii,                     described recently by             Mr Fletcher, f
It   is evident that my species agrees with these two in a great many
points     ;    in      the first place, there                 appear    to be no intestinal               caeca ;
secondly, the shape and location of the spermathecae                                            appeal's to be
identical        in all three species.                   The first point of agreement                    is,   how
ever,      of more importance than the latter.                                 In      a   good number of
species        of Perieh&ta there are two pairs of spermathecae situated in
segments         8      and       9,   and each furnished with                     a    slender cylindrical
diverticulum                        will    be      interesting to know                if   the absence            of

genus.
     The present             species, however,                 differs   from both its Australian
 congeners in the presence of vesiculae seminales                                  in all of        the segments
 from      9-12 inclusive.                      Fletcher       states    that these             structures are

absent    in segments     10 and 11       in his species    ;    if this difference is
not really due to difference of         age, it is clearly of       great importance
as a distinctive character.
   The arrangement      of the nephridia is apparently very like what
has   been described     in P. amtralis and           P. coxii, particularly          in
the latter species.     Fletcher's description is as follows : — " The              seg
mental organs consist of tufted glandular masses, which are large,
stalked, and dendriform in some of the most anterior segments, but
smaller and inconspicuous elsewhere."             I found these structures very
conspicuous indeed,        and in     the   14th and a few succeeding               seg
ments they have a very strong superficial resemblance                  to the ovaries,
with which     organs their position almost exactly corresponds.
   The most characteristic point of difference                 between     my species
and the other two is the number and position of the genital papilla:                     ;
a comparison of my description with that given by                     Mr Fletcher of
P. australis and P. coxii will show that the species differ greatly
in this respect     Mr Fletcher like myself appears to have examined
a considerable number of specimens.
                        PericluBta upoluentis, n. sp.
   This   species of Perichceta,    like the   last, is mainly characterised         by
the number and arrangement of the genital papillae.                     It is a native
of  the island of Upolu,       in the South Pacific       ;   I  am indebted to      Mr
R. Damon, of Weymouth, for              the opportunity of examining three
specimens.
   It  is an average-sized species, measuring          5  or   6  inches in length.
   The apertures of the spermathecas are between 7-8 and 8-9.
   The single aperture of the oviduct is upon segment 14.
   The pores of the vasa deferentia are upon segment                       18.     Each
pore is surrounded by a circular area of integument which is marked
off from the rest.
   The clitellum consists of only two segments, Kos. 14 and                    15.
   The genital papilla? are very small, compared,                for example, with
those of the last species       ; they occur in the neighbourhood of the
spermathecse as well as of the male generative              apertures.
   There is a single papillae on segment 9, situated in the median
ventral    line and anteriorly to the row of            setae.      The rest of the
genital papillae (so far   as my specimens enable me to speak positively)

1887.]          Mr Frank E. Beddard on Earthworms.                          175
are   situated  after the clitellum, t.e., in the neighbourhood of the
male generative     openings.   Each of the segments 16-20 (inclusive)
is furnished with a single median papilla, which occupies a precisely
similar position to that occupied by the median papilla of segment
9,  that is to say, it lies near to the anterior border of the segment
(see fig. 11).    The 18th segment       possesses,   in addition,   a pair of
papillae, situated just within and close to the male generative orifices       ;
these papillae are almost     on the border line between         this and the
following segment.        The next segment (No. 19) has also an addi
tional pair of genital papillae ; these are placed below and a little
to the outside    of the  generative   pores  ; hence    they are placed very
close   to the anterior border of their segment.
    In its internal structure this    species does not present any remark
able features.
    The gizzard is in segments      8 and 9, and    as usual these segments
are  not separated by    a mesentery.
    In the   same two segments are situated       the spermatheae     (fig. 12),
 which (see p.     173) are not very different      in  shape to those of the
list  species.
    The vesiculce seminales are in segments      11  and 12.
    The ovaries are in segment 13.
    The termination of the vas deferens is furnished with a prostate
 gland,   which  has the usual lobulated structure.
    The hearts are in segments 12 and 13, as is generally the            case in
 PericJueta.

    This   species has been described     by Baird from a specimen in the
 British    Museum in the following         terms  : — " Body consisting of
 about    180 rings.   Setae, surrounding the body, short, black, rather
 distant.    Rings not keeled   ;  larger and more distinct at the anterior
 extremity, closer at the posterior end, and all smooth.             Length    7
 inches."     Capt. F. W. Hutton, in his

 described   Worms of New Zealand,"* mentions this species, which is
 a native of New Zealand, and simply quotes Baird's description.

    It   is perfectly clear that the above-quoted                 specific   diagnosis     is
entirely insufficient          to discriminate       the   species  from many          other
Perichcetce     ; but     an examination of the specimen itself leads                 me to
believe     that it is      a    distinct   species.     I  am   unable to       give    any
anatomical description, but the worm exhibits an external                       character,
overlooked by Baird,              which is of some value            as an     aid    to dis
criminating        the    species.       The   male    genital    pores    are    as usual
situated     upon the 18th segment of the body, and at some                        distance
from each other;           the 17th and 19th segments are each furnished
with     a single     median      genital papilla placed exactly in the               centre

number and arrangement                of the genital papillae seem to           be, so far
as our knowledge goes, good characters                    for discriminating        the dif
ferent species of Perichaeta             ;  although the number is apt              to vary
somewhat        (see p. 171) at       different stages of maturity         ; the number
of papilla?       in  the    present     species  would have to be very              largely
increased      to come       up to the number which are characteristic                      of
PericfuBta newcombei (p. 171), the only other species                      of  Perichata
which has genital papillae in the median ventral line on the                            17th
and 19th segments.

                      Professor      J.  Geikie.        (Plate    VI.)
                                  I. Introduction.
    The observations        recorded    in this    paper have reference chiefly to
the coast-sections       at St Abb's      Head and Coldingham              Shore.     The
district was       geologically surveyed some twenty-five years ago by
my brother,       Dr A. Geikie, and subsequently               described     by him in
the Memoirs of the Geological Survey.*                     Since the publication of
that memoir,        no further      examination of the ground in question
appears to have been made.              During the past summer            I  visited the
neighbourhood,        principally for the purpose of studying the igneous
rocks which are so well exposed               in sea-coast sections.        At  the date
of the    Government Survey of Eastern Berwickshire                     the aid of the
microscope       had not yet been invoked by field-geologists                    for the
purpose      of determining      rock-species,     and   I was therefore      curious to
compare the igneous rocks of that region with those of similar age
which      I   had studied elsewhere           in Scotland,     and   more especially
with the bedded and intrusive              porphyrites and tuffs of the Cheviot
Hills and the Sidlaws.
   The rocks of the district under review belong, as my brother has
shown, to two great systems           —the Silurian and          the  Old Ked Sand
stone.      From Pettico Wick Harbour in the north,                    to Coldingham
Bay in the south, the coast cliffs are composed                   almost    exclusively
of rocks      of Old Red Sandstone age — Silurian              strata appearing      only
for a short interval, a little to the north of Coldingham Shore.                      The
latter reappear on the south side of Coldingham Bay, and continue
along   the shore to Callercove Point, in the neighbourhood of Eye
mouth.        Inland from St Abb's Head              and Coldingham         Shore they
titend for many miles.            (See Map, Plate        VL)

   To the description of the Silurian               strata  given in the Geological
Survey's      Memoir,    I  have very     little  to add.     They consist chiefly
of greywackes        and    shales,   generally inclined at high angles, and
arranged      in  a series of more or less sharp           anticlinal   and synclinal
kids, which have an average N.E. and S.W. trend.                         In their   least

altered    condition, they are well seen in the magnificent                 cliffs that
extend westward from Pettico              Wick Harbour.         Between      Colding-
ham      Bay and Callercove Point they are often much                         crushed,
crumpled, twisted, shattered,           shifted, and confused        — the    irregular
puckcrings and convolutions forming an interesting study.                           They
are minutely cracked         and fissured     in all directions, the      fine cracb
and fissures being most frequently filled with white quartz,                     or with
haematite and limonite.             Where the strata are most highly                 con
torted,    they frequently become seamed with a close, irregular                      net
work of small veins and mere threads of quartz, the meshes                     between
which are often less than the 16th part of an inch in diameter.
   Intrusive     Felsite in     the   Silurian. — Through         these   excessively
contorted     rocks   ramify here and there tortuous dykes and                  veins oi
felsite.     The junction between those dykes and the rocks                  traversed
by them is generally well marked.               But   here and there       it   is  much
confused    — the  fine-grained     greywackes     being baked and altered,            and
haviug the same pale-grey colour             as  the felsite, so that the line            of
parting between        the two can hardly be distinguished               by      the un
assisted eye.      Under the microscope,           however,    the crystalline         and
fragmental rocks are readily discriminated.               These felsites        are con
fined to the Silurian       areas.     Nowhere, so far      as   I  saw (and        I   tra
versed a considerable       area round Coldingham and Eyemouth), do                     any
of the felsitic intrusions penetrate rocks of Old Bed Sandstone                       age.
   The rock of these dykes is grey or pale pinkish-grey                     in     colour,
compact, sparingly porphyritic,           with   microscopic     crystals of quarU
and felspar,    — having, in       short,  the appearance of         typical       felsite.
Here and there veins of white quartz                 seam the dykes.              Viewed
under      the   microscope      the    rock    exhibits   a    microfelsitic         base,
scattered through which          are abundant small crystals of orthoclase,
and a few larger ones of the same mineral.                Oligoclase also appears
in well-developed        crystals,   and   to the same       species some          of    the
smaller crystals of felspar seem to be referable.               Both felspars show
alteration into saussurite, but this is most frequently the case with
the orthoclase.        Crystals of quartz, often much corroded, but                      not
unf requently showing well-defined pyramidal forms, are common                               ;
and they generally contain fluid cavities, sometimes                   in very        great
abundance.         One or two thin          spicules of      a dichroic         mineral,
probably mica,       were    seen,    but only in one section.             The        most

remarkable feature                presented     by tbese felsites is the appearance of
minute veins which traverse the felsite irregularly, not infrequently
crossing and anastomosing                     with     each other at all angles.                          They
vary in width from a mere line up to -fa or                                    -J-   of an inch in dia
meter, and           consist chiefly of quartz and felspar,                            apparently ortho-
clase.      The quartz undoubtedly predominates,                                but here and there
felspar,      or saussurite          which replaces             the felspar,             forms the chief
ingredient             The     quartz occurs in irregular crystalline aggregates
and granules,             often    crowded with fluid                cavities, and frequently
containing enclosures               of saussurite, and occasionally epidote.                                The
felspar       also     forms       irregular     crystalline        aggregates,             but     is     most
usually replaced             by    saussurite.         Not infrequently                  it   forms inter-
growths       with the quartz, so              as to    give the veins               a   micropegmatitic
structure.           Sometimes the walls of the veins are smooth and even                                      ;
at   other times  the quartz and felspar (saussurite) seem to indent

the   walls, as in the so-called " segregation veins      granite. The
veins now          described appear to be confined,                      as   a      rule, to the felsite,
hut      occasionally        they      pass    outwards           from the latter into                       the
adjacent      greywacke.

     The rocks assigned to the                 Old Red Sandstone                      are principally of
igneous       or     aqueo-igneous        origin.           There    is        one       small patch of
conglomerate,          however, which forms the upper portion of Bell                                     Hill,
near the       village of Coldingham                 Shore.         This        is     indicated on the
Geological         Survey's map as of Upper Old Red Sandstone                                        age.    I
think    it   really belongs to the lower division of the series                                    ;    at all
events    it   is    older than the bedded                  igneous rocks to be described
presently.           It   rests directly upon the Lower Silurian, and                               is   in fact
composed           exclusively       of rounded fragments                       of greywacke^               Sec.,
derived       from that formation.                   It     nowhere overlies                  the    igneous
rocks referred            to, nor does   it    contain any admixture of fragments of
these.        Its junction with           them       is,   in   short,   a      dislocation or fault,
which has     downthrow to the N.E. (see fig.

                               (a) Rocks            of   St Abb's Head.
     The headland of St Abb's Head extends from Pettico Wick south
east to the    White Heugh — picturesque cliff and favourite
                                           a                                                   resort    of
sea-birds   — about   J       of   a   mile north-west of Coldingham Shore.                         The
headland     presents to the sea                a   bulwark of wild rugged precipices,                  in
dented with numerous                   little   bays and coves, only       a     few of which           are
accessible from the land.                   It   is   separated     from the rolling Silurian
uplands behind by            a   well-marked hollow that extends south-east from
Pettico Wick in the direction of the White Heugh.                                      The headland,
as   thus defined,      is    described         by the Geological Survey as consisting
in the south-east           partly of fragmental igneous                  rocks, and partly                  of
intrusive " felstone "             ;   while between            Horsecastle Bay and Pettico
Wick the      area    is   coloured as intrusive felstone alone.                  Various sections
laid bare since the time the ground was examined by the Geological
Survey show that the northern part of the headland                                       is   made tip
chiefly of bedded porphyrite with some intercalated layers of tuff.
Of     the latter the only good                     exposures      seen are at         Pettico     Wick
Harbour       and on the side of the road leading thence to the light
house.      The dip of these rocks                       is   clearly towards the south-east,
the    whole forming an ascending                         series, from Pettico          Wick to         the
Wuddy Hocks, with                      an approximate thickness of                     1200 feet        (see
fig. 2).     Towards the south-east the beds are invaded by larger and
smaller masses and dykes of intrusive crystalline rock.                                   As the        dip
of the igneous series does not exceed 18° on an average,                                it   is obvious
that the junction              between           these rocks and         the vertical           Silurian

Hill would thus appear to be the oldest member of the Old Red
Sandstone series.         It  consists principally of water-worn shingle and
gravel, set   in   a matrix of arenaceous and argillaceous              matter.     The
stones, as mentioned already,           have   all  been derived from the con
tiguous Silurian strata.          The lower appear to be upon the whole
coarser than the upper beds, stones            6 inches and more           in diameter
beiug common in the former, while the latter are rather conglomer
atic and pebbly grit and sandstone              than conglomerate.           The beds
dip towards the south-east, but are turned up against the N.E. and
S.W.    fault, while they trend steeply down towards the N.W. and
S.E. fault.     The series is probably about 100 feet in thickness.

                                   — The lowest beds seen on the north
6ide of the N.W. and S.E. fault is a bedded porphyrite which is
overlaid by    a   thick layer of agglomeratic         tuff.     Above this comes       a
succession of bedded porphyrites, about 250 feet or so in thickness,
and these beds are succeeded               by 40 to 50 feet of various tuffs,
which     dip in their turn under             a second      group of porphyrites.
These last do not appear            to exceed 250 or 300 feet in thickness,
and are overlaid by some 400 feet of bedded tuffs.
   Bedded Porphyrites.         — These rocks having all          the same character,
one general      description will suffice.         They      are for the most       part
fine-grained,    purplish-blue or greyish-blue in colour, but frequently
stained    brown       or   red  with much        diffused      ferric  and hydrous
ferric oxide.       The joint-faces especially        are often coated with          hss-
matite    and    limonite, while       thin veins and         threads    of the    same
minerals    are common.         The rocks do not differ in general appear
ance    from    the    porphyrites      of   Old   Red     Sandstone       and Lower
Carboniferous        age  which occur elsewhere          in Scotland.        Thoy are,
upon the whole, not          so markedly porphyritic with plagioclase as the
porphyrites of other districts, but closely resemble such fine-grained
rocks as that of Blackford           Hill,  and similar rocks met with           in the
Braids and Pen Hands.               They are often highly            scoriaceous    and
amygdaloidal above and below, and not infrequently contain,                        both
in their upper        and   under portions, irregular areas of fine-grained
tuff,  consisting of amorphous,          dust-like material,        and   comminuted
debris and small lapilli of highly porous                 porphyrite (see fig. 4).

a    way as to suggest              that it may prohably consist of portions of the
shattered        scoriaceous crust of the porphyrite, broken up and incor
porated      in the underlying                   mass while          that was still in a fluid or
pasty    condition.            Occasionally so much of this tuff-like matter is
enclosed         in the porphyrite                that one is sometimes                  in doubt        as to
whether the whole rock is not fragmental.                                         Microscopic examina

phyrites     are      all    more or less weathered                   and earthy to some depth,
and    it   is   thus difficult to obtain very fresh fractures.                                They form    a
series      of    low broken                  escarpments           facing    the      north-west,       each
escarpment         marking the outcrop of                       a   bed.     The beds appear to be
of    variable        thickness, some measuring about 15 feet, while others
may reach as           much as 50 feet or more.
      Examined under the microscope, these rocks show                                     a    ground-mass
of    colourless microliths and minute lath-like crystals of plagioclase,
diffused through which                        there    is   visually more or less non-differenti
ated red         ferritic     matter.           In     some cases the ground-mass                  seems to
be composed             chiefly of this unindividualised                           matter,      with micro
liths and small rods of plagioclase                          scattered less abundantly through
it.     This     is   more especially             the case      with       the amygdaloidal parts of
the rock,         where occasionally the ground-mass                                consists     almost ex
clusively         of non-differentiated                     matter,        only    a   few recognisable
microliths         making their appearance.                           There can be little doubt
that     this unindividualised                  substance       is   simply the result of devitri

 fication, and that originally these rocks contained no inconsiderable
proportion        of glassy    matter,    especially     in their upper and under
portions.         In  a number of         the   sections     examined,     however, no
trace of devitrified        matter was observed, the ground-mass                 in such
cases    consisting of an aggregate of microliths and minute crystals
of plagioclase,       closely    felted together, but containing interstitially
abundant granules of ferrite, or magnetite                 passing into ferrite, along
with minute granules of pale greenish-yellow, and yellow serpentin-
ous matter and limonite, which                 are doubtless alteration         products
replacing hornblende or pyroxene,                  or both.       The porphyritic       in
gredients of these rocks are seldom                  prominent.        Small and large
lath-like      crystals of plagioclase          are   not uncommon, the             larger
crystals seldom         exceeding     1  mm.     in length, and they         are mostly
broken.        They sometimes         show fine zonal structure.             The larger
crystals seem to be most common when the ground-mass                             is com
posed     chiefly of devitrified         matter,     with very minute microliths.
Pseudomorphs after hornblende and augite                        appear    more    or less
plentifully.         These     consist partly of yellow            or greenish-yellow
serpentine,      sometimes veined with chrysolite, and partly of limonite.
Not infrequently the pseudomorph is                    composed       internally of ser-
pontine,      the outlines of the          crystalline      form being defined          by
limonite, or magnetite          and limonite.        Very often the limonite forms
a meshwork of veins running through the serpentine,                       and occasion
ally   these veins approximate           in direction to the         cleavage-planes     of
the original mineral.           In many     cases the shape       of  the pseudomorph
gives one no        hint  as to whether the replaced            mineral was augite or
 hornblende.         Very often,     however,     the   form is that of hornblende.
This is specially         the case    with    such    pseudomorphs        as have    well-
marked ferritic          borders.       In   these     one    sees   that the    original
mineral must have been               broken, and more or less             corroded, the
ground-mass         having often eaten into the heart of the crystal.                    A
few pseudomorphs            show very distinctly           the form of augite,        and
some of these also contain inclusions of the ground-mass.                       Many of
the pseudomorphs             are quite     amorphous,        some     composed     almost
entirely of serpentine,         others   almost exclusively of limonite           :  what
 proportion of these may represent hornblende, and what proportion
augite,    it is impossible to say.          Of pseudomorphs having more or
less definite      forms, those after hornblende appear to be the most

numerous,      and this is probably the case           with the amorphous ones
also.     Fluidal structure     is occasionally marked,         the microliths and
lath-like    crystals of plagioclase        being grouped round            the    larger
porphyritic     ingredients.       In  some of       the rocks minute amygdal-
oidal cavities abound, and this even at               a distance    from the upper
and under surfaces of the flows.             The cavities are filled generally
with calcite, or with calcite and quartz, or chalcedony.                  More rarely
zeolites are present.       The larger amygdules          in the more scoriaceous
portions    of th9 rocks consist of the              same minerals, calcite          pre
dominating.        Most    of the rocks are more or less deeply stained
with red ferritic matter.
   The tuffaceous areas in the             porphyrites      afford    an   interesting
study.      Occasionally    they consist of broken or crushed                scoriae   of
one and    the same kind of rock completely embedded in porphyrite.
These small      lapilli  or scoriae are     generally finely and abundantly
porous, and show a dark devitrified               ground-mass      in which minute
microliths     are  more    or less     plentiful.       They    might     quite well
represent fragments of the more scoriacous                 and glassy portions of
the same    rock as that in which they are enclosed                  In  some places
the tuffaceous    matter consists    of finely comminuted debris of           the same
or some    closely similar rock, together          with finer grit,     and    rounded
pseudomorphs       of    serpentine and         limonite     after   hornblende        or
pyroxene.       The larger    scoriae and     lapilli rarely exceed       a hazel-nut
in size.    They are enclosed in the          porphyrite in such         a way as to
show    that this rock was in a fluid or pasty condition                 at the time
they became      embedded,     for the crystalline and microlithic             ground-
mass lies     between     and among       them.       The tuffaceous       areas now
described appear to be confined to the upper and lower parts of the
lava-flows,    hat they occasionally occur            nearer   the middle.        They
are   generally distinguished         from     the    rock    in which      they are
enclosed    by their deeper      red colour, a character which they have
in common      with  the beautiful red tuffs of Horsecastle Bay.

lowest bed of tuff is seen at Pettico Wick Harbour.              This   is a coarse
tuff or agglomerate     of fragments of porpbyrites, which are generally
dark     purplish   blue and red in colour, and more or less highly
amygdaloidal.       The stones are angular and subangular in form, and
show no regular arrangement             They vary in size from small lapilli
up to blocks of more than        1  foot across — some measuring          2 feet   in
diameter.       Examined under the microscope,          these porphyrites show
the same structure and composition as those already described.                    The
tuff rests upon a very irregular surface of porphyrite, and is overlaid,
in  a like irregular    manner,    by a bedded      porphyrite, which is very
vesicular and amygdaloidal at the line of junction.              The junction is
somewhat      confused in places by minor slips and faults.
    On the side of the road leading from Pettico Wick to the light
house     various porphyrites are exposed,         — some of which show the
curious vein-like      and irregular inclusions of fine tuff already de
scribed.      These beds are overlaid by a considerable thickness of
 well-bedded shaley tuffs, generally red in colour — the tuff being fine
grained, and composed of comminuted debris of porphyrites.                     Some
 of the beds contain many lapilli of larger size scattered through their
 mass.     They rest upon a dark purplish-blue amygdaloidal porphyrite,
and are traversed intrusively by a thin sheetof fine-grained porphyrite.
 The junction is slightly confused,         as at  Pettico Wick, by faulting.
     But by far the     most   extensive succession of tuffaceous          strata    is
 that which occurs at the south-east end of the headland of St Abb's.
 These rocks are generally well bedded,             and have a prevalent red
 colour.     They vary in texture from tuffaceous mudstones,              in which
 only grit and small lapilli         occur,    up to coarse-grained        tuffs,   in
 which the included fragments may reach              1 foot or more in diameter.
 The most common         rock is a tuff composed         of comminuted debris
 and small lapilli, often not larger than         a hazel-nut in size, but some
 times measuring      2 or 3  inches across.       The grit and lapilli are of all
 shades of red, purple, yellow, and blue — the red strongly predomi
 nating — so that the resulting tuff is finely mottled.            In  many cases
  decomposition products, particularly calcite,           permeate    the rock       in
  all directions — giving rise to irregular white splatches, veinings, and
  tangled thread-like areas — which show well on the warm red ground
  of the tuff.    Other parts of the tuff might be described          as a breccia
  of subangular and         angular    fragments,      chiefly  of   amygdaloidal

porphyrites     — the  stones being set in a meagre matrix of comminuted
debris.     These rocks dip      S.E.   at 18° to 20°.     They are abundantly
pierced and traversed by dykes and irregular                 sheets    and masses
of porphyrite, which will be described later on.                 In   some places,
especially    in  the area extending from Haven's Brae to Horse Castle,
the tuffs have       been considerably baked and altered,            so that   it is
sometimes difficult in hand-specimens to distinguish                between    what
is tuff and what intrusive porphyrite.             The fragmental character of
the altered tuff, however, is quite apparent under the microscope.
    The fragments        in  these   tuffs appear    to consist exclusively of
varieties of porphyrite       ; at all events    I  could find no other rock.
Most of the      lapilli  are vesicular and amygdaloidal — very many are
highly   so,   and have all the appearance of         scoriae.    The amygdules
being usually white are generally very conspicuous.                A   microscopic
examination       of many of    these included fragments shows that "'.they
consist exclusively of porphyrite— the ground-mass                being generally
vitreous, stony, or devitrified,         but occasionally microlithic.          The
description      given above     of the small lapilli,      which    occur   in the
tnffaceous areas of the bedded porphyrites, holds equally true of the
lapilli of these bedded tuffs.          A  great  number of the small stones
are  evidently fragments of a vitreous scoriaceous porphyrite, and from
 their highly      vesicular character      they might well have floated          in
 water at   the time of their ejection — they are, in short, mere cinders.
 The fragments       which show a microlithic ground-mass            often contain
also pseudomorphs        after hornblende or pyroxene, and are evidently
true   porphyrites.      Red ferritic matter saturates most of the stones           ;
 but not     a few     of these are dark grey or blue, and              it is such
fragments which         show best the original vitreous character            of the
ground-mass.         Here and there amongst the fine comminuted matter,
 or  dust    aud   grit, of the tuffs,     small patches       of serpentine and
 limonite occur, and these,        in  some cases at least, almost certainly
represent hornblende or pyroxene.
    The tuffs are thus composed         essentially of volcanic detritus.        In
 none   of the specimens examined by me did            I meet with any trace of
 ordinary    terrigenous sediment.          Even the finest-grained portions
 appear   under the microscope           to consist of minute fragments of
 porous scoriaceous      vitreous rock.      There is no admixture of quartz-
 grains and    argillaceous matter, such as might have been derived from

of   a   compact fine-grained blue porphyrite, which                           is   often    reddened

large crystals of plagioclase,              and here and there more or less abundant
pseudomorphs of limonite                          and        serpentine     after hornblende               or

two places, near their junction             with   the latter, patches     of tuff and
agglomerate occur upon the foreshore,               as  if resting directly upon    the
Silurian    ;  but these patches are evidently of an intrusive character,
and appear to        occupy vertical fisures in the surrounding greywackes,
which are extremely           hardened and altered and very much reddened.
The actual       junction of      these greywackes with the main mass of the
igneous rocks presently to be described              is likewise strongly suggestive
of the intrusive character of the latter.                Similar    appearances   mark
the junction        between      these rocks and the Silurian           greywackes on
the shores of Coldingham               Bay.     At that    place  the greywackes     are
much jumbled, broken, and hardened,                  and saturated with red ferritic
matter.       The Old Red igneous rocks do not overlie, but are intrusive
in the Silurian        strata.
    These igneous rocks consist partly of tuffs and                  agglomerates   and
 partly of porphyrite.            The fragmental rocks are, for the most part,
 quite unstratified, although here and there some trace of rude bedding
 may be noted.           They are of a dull red colour, and are made up of
 angular      and subangular fragments of all shapes and sizes up to
 blocks measuring over a yard in diameter.                   These are set in a matrix
 of smaller stones         and comminuted debris.              The whole appearance
 of this coarse tuff, which           in many places is quite an agglomerate          —
 that is to say, a coarse breccia of large stones and blocks — is similar to
 that of those tuffs and agglomerates which elsewhere                   in Scotland are
 found occupying the necks or throats'of                   old volcanic orifices.    All
 the   fragments       consist of varieties of porphyrite — a great many of
 which are precisely similar             to the bedded       porphyrites of St Abb's
 Head    ; others, however, are more markedly crystalline and porphyritic,
 especially      with   plagioclase     felspar.    A number of        these fragments
 were     examined        under the microscope,           but    no new features      of
 importance        were    disclosed.      Highly amygdaloidal and          scoriaceous
 fragments are common               enough,    but are not so strikingly prevalent
 as  in the well-bedded tuffs of Horsecastle                 Bay, &c.     One may say
 that, while      in  these latter scoriae      predominate     and fragments    of less
 porous rock do not abound,             in  the agglomerates of Coldingham Shore
 it is just the reverse.         From the lapilli and blocks of this agglomerate,
  however,     I  did not succeed in getting any fresh specimens.               Most of
  the rocks are      much altered, so much so indeed that all one can deter
  mine is the     fact that clouded crystals of plagioclase occur more or less

numerously in a dull ferritic base.                     Patches and irregular         aggregates
of ferric oxide are common enough also, and probably represent                               horn
blende or pyroxene.             The less altered specimens often show a                   devitri-
fied base, crowded with microliths and small crystals                          of    plagioclase.
Scattered through              this    ground-mass            are many larger crystals             of
plagioclase.         Upon the whole, highly porphyritic                      rocks    appear to
be of more frequent occurrence                      in this   agglomerate    than they       axe in
the bedded series of porphyrites and tuffs at                      St Abb's Head.
      The unstratified agglomerate                  is irregularly       traversed by        masse
of close-grained          porphyrite, which has the same general                        character
as the intrusive porphyrite                 near     St Abb's Head.          This    porphyrite
is,    for the most part, much reddened                       with iron oxides, and              con
siderably weathered,           so that fresh fractures are not readily obtained.
Where least weathered,                it   is   a   somewhat compact blue or            purplish
rock.      Here and there plagioclase                   felspar   is   conspicuous      as   a    por
phyritic ingredient, and now and again pyroxene (augite or                              diallage)
or pseudomorphs           after pyroxene are visible.               Thin veins and        threads
of limonite and haematite are common.*
IV. General Conclusions                     as   to the Old Red Sandstone                 Semes.
   The basement beds of this series, consisting of the                          conglomerate
of Bell Hill, are         a    mere fragment, and we cannot say much about
the conditions under which they were accumulated.                  They show us,
what indeed may be learned                  in many other parts of Scotland, that
the    Lower Silurian strata had already been folded, Crumpled,                                   and
contorted,     and     excessively denuded before Old                        Red      Sandstone
times.       As the conglomerates                   contain not      a   single fragment            of
igneous      rock,   it   is   most        probable that their           formation      preceded
the outbreak of volcanic action                  in this neighbourhood.
   The coarse tuff and agglomerate of Coldingham Shore fill up                                      an
old volcanic orifice,           from which             the porphyrites       and porphyrite-
tuffs of St Abb's had previously been ejected.                           The great intrusions
of porphyrite which penetrate,  not only the agglomerate       the                           of

a closing stage           in the same period of volcanic activity.                   The dykes
of Bell        Hill    and the harbour are certainly of much more recent
date,    and need not be considered in the present paper.
   The south-east            dip of the bedded igneous                 rocks of St Abb's              I
take to be due to the two large faults which form their boundary
lines.        The original inclination              of the strata, which need not have
been great,         would necessarily           be away from the neck of Coldingham
Shore.         It   is quite impossible to say what the extent of these faults
may be, but         it is probably          considerable,    as the following considerations
will show.            Neither the top nor the bottom of the bedded rocks is
seen,    but the actual thickness displayed is not less than 1200 feet.
At    present        the beds dip towards             S.E.    at about 15°.        If,   therefore,
we take the beds at              Pettico       Wick   to represent the basement beds of
the igneous         series, which they certainly are not, then, to restore the
beds to       horizontality, it is evident that the tuffs at the south-east end
of the headland of St Abb's would require to be                           lifted up for        some
1200 feet.          But, on the supposition that all these bedded rocks have
been     derived from the volcanic neck at Coldingham Shore, and would
at first, therefore,         have a dip towards the north, it is obvious that the
subsequent downthrow produced by the                            N.W. and S.E. fault must
considerably          exceed 1200            feet — say,    1300 or 1400 feet. A glance
at the section           seen at Pettico        Wick, however,        shows us that the beds
there     are not the basement beds of the series, for they are faulted
down against the Silurian.                    The actual base of the scries is submerged.
If,   therefore,       the present S.E. dip of the porphyrites and tuffs be due
mainly, as      I      believe,    to the fault at present            referred to, the down
throw     of that dislocation must                 increase    from   N.W. to S.E., until           it
reaches       not less than 1300 feet.                To the effect produced by this fault
we have         to add that of the fault at Ualterem's Loup, which has                               a
downthrow to N.W., and has therefore had its share in bringing
about the           S.E. dip of        the bedded porphyrites and tuffs.                  It   is   im
possible,       however, to form even an approximate estimate of the
amount of downthrow produced by this latter fault.                             From the fact
that     it   seems to cut off the other, no trace of which                    occurs       in the
rocks to the south,              we may infer that its downthrow              is   considerable.
 Be that as          it   may,    it   is   quite certain that the tuffs of Horsecastle
 Bay occupy          a    much higher horizon than the agglomerates                        exposed
 upon the beach at Coldingham Shore.

 192          Proceedings      of Royal Society of Edinburgh,              [april   4,
    While the geological structure of St Abb's Head thus                    leads to
the   conclusion that the bedded              tuffs and porphyrites        formerly
dipped in      a northerly     direction, and may thus have been ejected
from the volcanic focus in their neighbourhood, the petrological
evidence     lends additional support to this conclusion.                Fragments
of precisely    the same porphyrites as those           of St Abb's Head occur
abundantly in the rock at Coldingham                Shore.     A few blocks and
fragments      of greywacke        were   observed     in the    agglomerate,    and
may,    perhaps,    be    more   plentiful      than they    seem    to be, for,    of
course, the agglomerate         is only partially exposed        ;  but with these
exceptions all the stones        I  saw were      porphyrites.      Sections of the
finer-grained portions of the tuff examined under the                    microscope
showed     in like manner that       these are composed       of the comminuted
debris of porphyrites.
    From the fact that tbe bedded porphy rite-tuffs of St Abb's Head
have    evidently been arranged         by and accumulated         under water, we
may    infer that the whole series, so far            as  that is exposed,     is  of
subaqueous      origin — that, in the rocks now described,             we have    the
relics of an old subaqueous        volcano of Old Red Sandstone times.           The
bedded porphyrites offer many analogies              with those of the Cheviot
Hills,   the Sidlaws, and other regions of          Old Red Sandstone volcanic
rocks.     They are, in fact, only altered andesites, which, in their micro
scopic structure, reproduce         exactly what one      sees in the andesites of
the Western Territories of          North America.         The intrusive porphy
rites, however, which intersect the agglomerate and the bedded rocks
hardly resemble the intrusive masses of the Sidlaws, the Cheviots,
<fec, those   of the Sidlaws being mainly          diabase (altered    basalt-rock),
while those of the Cheviots are chiefly granite and felsite.                 Again,
tbe bedded       scoriae-tuffs  of St Abb's Head are hardly paralleled by
any tuffs    met with either in the Cheviots, the Sidlaws, or any              other
region    of Old Red Sandstone volcanic rocks known to me.                         Of
course,   lapilli of highly porous and amygdaloidal porphyrites occur
commonly enough in many of those districts, but nowhere, so far
as  I have seen, have       we such a depth of fragmental materials con
sisting almost exclusively of           scoriae   or cinders.      These form     the
highest beds of the series, and possibly represent the latest ejections
from the adjoining volcanic orifice.           But they   have suffered great de
nudation, and certainly attained a greater thickness, and overspread

a much      wider area than they now occupy.                 This is evident from     the
appearance at the surface of the intrusive porphyrites near St Abb's
Head.       These, there        can be   little doubt,     cooled   and consolidated
under the        surface — the tuff which formerly            covered them has been
washed away.           The intrusion of these porphyrites marks the closing
stage   in the volcanic activity of Old Eed Sandstone                 times.      It was
not    until after lavas and fragmental materials had ceased to be
erupted, and       the throat of the old volcano had become plugged with
angular    debris and blocks, that the rocks in question were injected.
They evidently cooled under some pressure, but were                     probably not
of very deep-seated            origin.    Whether      they ever rose to the actual
surface    of the      old volcano and overflowed, we cannot tell, for the
whole     of that surface          has of   course   disappeared.      It  is obvious,
however,      that the molten masses from which they came must have
been    of essentially the same composition as that from which the
bedded     porphyrites were derived.
                               V. Glacial Phenomena.
    The district described           in this   paper has been entirely overflowed
by ice.     This is proved by           the generally glaciated       contour of the
 rocks,   which are smoothed            from N.W.       to S.E.     The escarpments
 of porphyrites       that faced the ice-flow have been bevelled               off, and,
 notwithstanding         the weathered      character    of the rocks, well-marked
 striae are    met   with     here and there, the trend of which is           E.   35 S.
 Glaciated      stones    and clay occur in patches           in the hollows of the
 headland, and        a considerable      mass of     till occupies the hollow that
 separates     the headland         from the Silurian        uplands.    This is well
  exposed    in section at Pettico Wick!              It   presents  no features that
  require to be       noted here, but is made up of the debris of rocks
  which have come          from the west or north-west.

     1.   The           summations referred               to        in the       title depend on two
theorems           — one           already    known, the other not hitherto published.
The first of these                    is   to the effect that the quotient                     of any   simple
Alternant by the difference-product                        of       tlie variables       is   expressible as       a
determinant                 whose dements are sums              of     homogeneous products             of   the

second,    third, and fourth figures from the series                                                   5, 4, 3, 2, 1 ;                  that
is, by deleting these columns successively                                               from the corresponding
matrix.      We      may further observe that                                   if   we increase by unity one
index in the left-hand side of (C), the sum of the resulting alter
nants is obtained by increasing by unity the elements of                                                                 one         column
in the right-hand           side, thus giving the identity (4)                                                   ;   while an in
crease in two and three indices produces respectively a corresponding
increase in the elements of two and three                                            columns,                thus furnishing
equations (5) and (6).
  3. To obtain the Extensions involving any number (v) of indices
we should thus assume the corresponding results for v  1 indices,                                                        -

 5.    Xote on Cobaltic Alums.                                By Mr Hugh Marshall, B.Sc.
     From    a   peculiar change of colour observed in the electrolysis of                                                           a
solution of copper-cobalt potassium                              sulphate, the author was recently
induced to make some experiments on the behaviour of cobalt sul
phate solution when electrolysed                           in    such      a   manner that the reducing
product of the decomposition could not act on the solution.                                                                      For
this      purpose     a   divided cell was used, so that the                                        two electrodes
were practically in separate                        vessels.          The apparatus                  will             be     fully
described in        a   future communication.
     It   was found that an acid solution of cobalt sulphate alone                                                                   is
not changed           when submitted to electrolysis in the apparatus.                                                              If,
however, ammonium                    or potassium sulphate be also                                       present,                the
solution      passes      through         a   series          of changes              of colour, ultimately

of the cobalt from the cobaltous to the cobaltic state.           This    seemed
to point to the probable formation        of an  alum.     Experiments were
therefore made in order to obtain crystals.         The action was allowed
to go on for several days, so as to concentrate         the liquid  ;  when, in
the solution with ammonium sulphate, dark blue crystals separated
out.     These were octahedral, showing also faces of the cube and
rhombic dodecahedron.          The analysis of these showed that they
were ammonium-cobalt alum.

     When thoroughly dried the crystals        are not unstable,       but when
 dissolved in water are quickly reduced.         The solution in sulphuric
 acid is not so soon decomposed.           When the acid       has been      com
 pletely removed from the crystals, water seems to resolve them first
 into the constituent sulphates.       The oxygen liberated during decom
  position is partially in the form of ozone.
     No satisfactory result     was at first obtained     with  the potassium
 sulphate solution, chiefly owing to the slight solubility of that salt
  If  sufficient be not added      the  alum is decomposed.           If,  on the
  other band,     too  much be added,      it crystallises out.     The happy
  medium can only be obtained by the addition                of one or other
  salt.   After   several experiments,   crystals were obtained similar         to
  those of the ammonium alum, but they could not be separated from
  the potassium sulphate with which they were mixed.                Afterwards
  a finely crystalline deposit was obtained, which on analysis appeared
  to be the alum mixed with potassic sulphate.
     Under similar conditions, nickel sulphate          undergoes     no change
  whatever.
      Other salts of cobalt undergo oxidation in presence of correspond
  ing alkali salts, forming evidently double salts      ; these are    at present
  undergoing examination.

6.    On the Effect produced on the Polarisation                                      of Nerve by
                      Stimulation.             By Mr G.             TS.    Stewart.
     In   this short paper          I wish     merely to give a summary of the chief
results of experiments made by me in February and March last in
the       Physiological          Institute     of Berlin.            Du Bois Eeymond                     has
recently made an elaborate investigation of the galvanic polarisation
of   muscle.         Many years ago he made similar observations                              on nerve.
The question which                occurred    to me was,           How     does tetanus affect the
amount of polarisation in nerve                    1    Apparently            there    has been no
previous work at this subject.                    It   is not necessary to describe                    here
the arrangements                used, nor the manner of making the observations,
as a detailed account, with discussion of the facts brought out, will
appear in the Journal of Physiology.                               "When      a current is passed
through         a   living      nerve,   the polarisation            produced may be either
negative or positive.                When it is negative, the polarisation current
is, of      course,      in the     opposite     direction to the polarising                   current.
Positive polarisation               gives    a current        in    the same direction as the
polarising stream.                It depends     upon the
                                                                   " density " of      the polarising
current, and upon the time of flow, whether the deflection                                         due      to
the polarisation is purely negative,                         purely positive, or of double
sign.       When it is of double                  sign, there is first a negative                      kick,
which is followed by a more persistent positive deflection                                             As   a
matter of fact, there is every ground for believing, that in                                       general
the two polarisations exist side by side in the polarised nerve.
     The influence of stimulation                  on the polarisation, so far as my
experiments go, may be stated thus                      :   —
     1.   In    every      case     the effect    produced by stimulation                     is in the
direction of diminution of the,                  positive polarisation. — One                 says       "in
the direction of," because increase                         of negative        polarisation would
equally well explain the result.                   It is     probable, however, for reasons
which       need not be given here that                      it is the positive polarisation
which is affected.
     2.   The   effect
                          is,   within limits, greater          the longer      the time      of flow       of
the   polarising         stream.   — This     has only been shown for weak currents,
because strong currents depress the                     vitality of         the nerve when they
are allowed to flow for any length of time.                               If, in the   case   of   a   weak

polarising stream, a curve be constructed whose ordinates correspond
to amount of change                of the polarisation, the abscissa representing
time of flow, this curve is found to have a maximum                                        ;   i.e., when
the current is kept constant,                the effect first increases               with the time,
and then diminishes.                  Here the stimulus             is,   of course, also kept
constant.
  3.      The    effect    increases,       within limits,         with         the   density      of    the
polarising        stream.       — The curve plotted with current density                                 as
abscissa, and amount of stimulation effect as ordinate,                                  also reaches     a
maximum, when the time of flow                      is   kept constant.
  4.      The   effect
                          is   less, as   might     be expected,     the        longer    the    interval
between     breaking        polarising current and closing the galvanometer
                           the
circuit. —The        persistency of     sometimes, however, astonishing.
                                            it is
  5.      The   effect    increases with the strength              of     the    stimulus. — Result
No.   1   has an important                bearing on Hermann's explanation of the
apparent diminution                 of resistance        in   a   tetanised nerve,              which    I
propose to discuss at another time.
I     must add that, in the case of                  a   strong current, result No.               4   does
not always hold, the nerve apparently requiring some time to regain
its maximum of excitability.

leave to England, where he arrived in February 1854.                         He next
obtained the post of engineering superintendent of the Arthington
Extension       Waterworks        under    Mr Hawkesley, with whom              he   re
mained      till the completion of the work, when he received a flatter
ing letter from Mr Alderman Hepper, chairman of the Leeds Water
Works Committee, expressing the                 great   satisfaction of that body
with the manner in which              he had conducted the works.           Returning
to    London,       Mr Rumble         experienced     some    difficulty   in finding
employment to his taste, and was, for short periods, draughtsman
in the    offices of Messrs Conybeare and Brikinshaw,               the London and
South- Western Railway Company, the Admiralty,                      &c, till in   1857
he   •was  appointed engineer to the Atlas Steel Works, then entirely
in the hands of Mr (now Sir) John Brown, in which capacity he was
entrusted with the conduct of many transactions requiring much
tact and diplomacy.             In   1858    Mr Rumble      was    elected   Fellow of
the Society of Engineers            ;  in 1860 a member          of the Institute     of
 Mechanical Engineers         ;  in   1861 a member of the Institute          of Naval
 Architects     ;  and in 1866 a Fellow of the Royal Microscopical Society,
 in the proceedings of which body he was always deeply interested.
     During       these years    Mr Rumble had          opened    an office   in West
 minster, and was practising            as a  civil and mechanical      engineer,   and
 was fortunate        enough   to secure much good work.             In  1869 he paid
 a  second visit to the United States, and spent six months visiting
 many engineering shops and acquiring a thorough knowledge of the
 recent mechanical improvements.                  Shortly after his return to Eng
 land,  Mr     Rumble had the honour of two interviews with his late
 Majesty the Emperor Napoleon, who was pleased to express his satis
 faction with the plans, drawings, &c, submitted for his approval.
 On   New Year's Day,        1872,     Mr Rumble      was again    in New York, and
 visited the various Safe Deposit Companies in that and other cities,
 with the view of obtaining information for the National Safe Deposit
 Company,         then  about to be formed in London.               He visited Phila
 delphia, Boston, Halifax, &c, and the ruins of Chicago, then scarcely
 cold after the great fire, and examined the vaults and safes remain
 ing intact. He returned to London on the 28th January, and was
  for the rest of the year employed in designing the safes, strong-rooms,
  buildings,      and other arrangements           of the National       Safe Deposit
  Company, which were afterwards carried out under his superintend

                                                   82
enoe at the corner of Queen                  Victoria       Street.    The extravagance            of
his partner at this time considerably involved                          Mr Rumble, and in
1875 he dissolved the partnership.                         In   1876   Mr Rumble obtained
the position of chief engineer                   of the Southwark and Vauxhall Water
Company.    His unceasing energy and untiring industry gradually
brought this company, from the state of confusion in 'which he
found       it,   to such   a    state of order that the dividends                 rose from       2£
to    7£   per cent.        In    1877 he was admitted member of the                    Institution
of    Civil Engineers.               In   1878    he successfully laid        a    30- inch     main
under the Thames at Richmond without the aid of dams — the only
feat of the        kind accomplished              at that date    in England.            Under Mr
Rumble's direction               a   trench was dredged across the bed of the river
a    few feet below Richmond Bridge.                        The lengths of the pipe, made
on the ball and socket principle, were joined                          on the banks of the
river, and in the early morning of                      July    3rd were shipped on board
three barges strongly lashed together,                     carefully brought into position,
and safely lowered into the trench.                     When the       necessary connections
at either end were made, the main was charged, and has ever since
been       in full work.
                     During the year 1879 the Directors of the
Southwark and Vauxhall Water Company determined to supplement
the supply of water derived from the Thames by sinking well into                        a
the chalk.         In conjunction with Professors Prestwich and Ansted, Mr
Rumble selected             a    spot   in the Manor Park, Streatham               ;   a   trial bore
hole was made, and in 1881 the sinking                           of the well begun.               The
work       is   still in   progress, but so far            fully justifies   the hopes formed
for its success.             Struck by      Mr Rumble's manner of handling the
matter, and entirely without his knowledge, Professor Prestwich and
Professor Ansted proposed him as Fellow of the Geological Society,
into which he was admitted in December 1879.                                 In February        1881
he was elected   Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.
   Towards the end of 1881 the excessive overwork and heavy
responsibilities of his position began to tell on his health, which
steadily though very gradually failed, and he developed                                    symptoms
of pernicious anaemia which                       defied     every effort     to       overcome    it.
 In December               1882      Sir William Jenner           recommended              immediate
and absolute           rest of body and mind for six months.                                Leave of
absence being unanimously granted by the directors of the company,
various places were visited in search of health, until on the 5th

                                       83
 April    1883   he returned    to Bonchurch,      Isle of Wight, where        he
 rapidly grew worse, and died on Saturday, 21st April, surrounded
 by nearly all his family.        He was huried      in the New Churchyard,
 Bonchurch, on 28th April.
    Mr Bumble       was twice    married, and has left a large family to
 mourn his loss.        In business Mr Bumble was straightforward            and
 unerringly     honest to his employers,        often nervous about small
 matters, but without       fear in cases of grave       import, when he was
 always calm and self-possessed.         The rapidity and clearness       of his
 perceptive    faculties amounted almost to the gift of second sight, and
 led him to form swift conclusions which rarely proved false.                His
 firmness in dealing with faults in those              under   his  charge   was
 moderated      by great kindness to his men when suffering under any
 affliction, illness, or distress.    He   was considered      by them always
more as a friend than master, and they showed their appreciation of
his   goodness by presenting him      with  a  testimonial on the celebration
 of his 50th birthday, 26th December             1882.      In private life Mr
Bumble's       genial spirits, shrewd observations,        and   witty remarks,
endeared      him to a large circle of friends.       Indeed, his critical con
dition was almost to the last         concealed     by his courageous     efforts
 to appear better than he was, and thus relieve the anxiety of his
 family.     He  possessed a most retentive memory,        and had the faculty
of readily assimilating those portions of the books he read which
 were likely to be useful to him in his professional work.                   His
travels over the greater part of Europe and America naturally en
larged his ideas, and he drew full benefit from the varied experience
thus     acquired.     He had deeply studied         the legal as well as the
technical points of his profession,      and so was particularly well fitted
to   fill the various appointments    he held during his lifetime.
              Joseph Liouville.         By Professor Chrystal.
    Joseph Liouville was born at St Omer on the 24th March 1809.
He     came of a family of Lorrainers, more than one of whom were
distinguished      for talents beyond the common.             Liouville's father
held     a public   office under the Empire, and an elder brother,         Felix
Silvestre Jean Baptiste,         was   a  distinguished      Parisian  advocate.
Joseph      gave   early indications of mathematical ability, and entered

                                           84
  upon that stereotyped        course    of training which has been          famous
  for the nurture .of    so  many Frenchmen of genius.              At   the   age of
 sixteen he entered       the Ecole Polytechnique, and on leaving it                in
  1827 was classed as an engineer            in the Department of Roads           and
 Bridges.     After two    years he forsook engineering for the cultivation
 of the higher mathematics.             He speedily distinguished        himself    in
 his chosen     career; for     as   early  as  1829   we    find a paper of       his
 (" Demonstration d'un Theoreme d'Electricit6 Dynamique") in the
 Annates     de Cldmie et de Physique; and in 1831 he became •
 repetiteur, and seven years later a professor, in the Polytechnic
 School.     In  the interval     he bad performed perhaps             his  greatest
 service   to his favourite science        by starting in 1836 TTie Journal
 de Maihemaiiques        Pures   et   Appliquees.      This journal     came     most
 opportunely to fill the gap left by the discontinuance of the              AnnaU*
 de Gergonne    ; but it could     scarcely have attained its     brilliant  success
 had it not been for the many excellent qualities of its editor,               whose
 critical discernment, that enabled          him to enter so readily into         the
 spirit of the works of other mathematicians, and to assist                   at the
debut of so many men of distinction, — whose amiability, candour,
and freedom from national prejudice, — whose own inexhaustible
 powers as a contributor of original memoirs,            all combined to fit     him
uniquely for the post which he filled            so  admirably for nearly       forty
years.
    In   1839   Liouville    was    elected   a member       of the Academy          of
Sciences    in succession     to Lalande, and the year following             he was
put upon the Board of Longitude, in whose proceedings                     he took     a
lively interest    to the end of his life.          In  1852 be became         a pro
fessor   in the College de France, and continued to lecture in                   that
capacity until about a year before his death.
    If  we except his continually recurring successes as a teacher and
as an   investigator in the most recondite of all the sciences, and               the
honours accorded       to him by the scientific world in token of their
appreciation,    Liouville's   public career was uneventful, as the           career
of a devoted man of science usually is.              On one occasion, however,
he departed     from the "even tenor of his way."                In 1848, a year
of much tribulation        for France, he received         a flattering    mark     of
widely spread popular esteem by being elected a member                       of   the
" Constituent                        He promptly                     this call
                  Assembly."                            answered                    of

                                           85
public duty, and served            his alloted time with efficiency       if  without
special     distinction.     When, however, his        mandate      expired, instead
of seeking re-election, he betook himself             once more to the uninter
rupted      pursuit of the career for which his abilities          best fitted him.
     Liouville was as fortunate in his private life as           he was successful
in his public career.          He lived     to a good     old age in the happiest
domestic       circumstances, until a cruel accident deprived him of his
wife.       His son,   a councillor   in the Court of Nancy, died         soon after
wards, and the aged mathematician never completely recovered                     from
 the    effects   of this double    bereavement.       Although his health gave
 way,     his intellect remained unclouded; and it was only in the
 beginning       of 1882 that     he gave up his favourite work of lecturing
 at the    College de France.          He still continued, however, to attend
 the meetings       of the Academy, but expressed to his friends his con-
 tcioueness that the end was near.              He died on the 8th September
  1882, as he himself said,
                                    " in his turn " ; for, since the death of
  Chasles,    he   had been      the patriarch    among European            mathema
  ticians.
      Some idea     of the extent of Liouville's mathematical writings may
  be obtained       by consulting      The Catalogue of Scientific Memoirs
  published      by the Boyal      Society of London.          The entries under
  Liouville's    name number 379, and cover some twelve pages.                  Many
  of these     are merely remarks made on contributions              to his journal,
  or notes     appended to works by other mathematicians which he
  edited; yet,      brief as  they are, they frequently         contain matter       of
  much importance.         As   specimens    of this part of his work, we may
   mention    his " Notes on Two Letters of Mr Thomson relative to                 the
  Employment of a New System of Orthogonal Coordinates                     in certain
   Problems     in the Theories of Heat and Electricity, and in the
  Problem      of the Distribution of Electricity on the Segment of a
   Spherical    Shell of Infinite Thinness" {Jour.          d.  Math., xii. 1847),
   in which he draws attention to the analytical and geometrical im
   portance   of the method of Inversion, which had just been brought
   under    the   notice of mathematicians         by   the    brilliant    use  that
   Thomson     had made of    it in his physical    researches.
       In another note {Jour. d. Math.,          xv. 1850) he enunciates          the
    important theorem that the equation
                       dx* + dif + dz1  = X(rfa2 +  dp* +  rfy2) ,

                                                            80
where x, y,          z,    X are functions             of o,       /8,   y, has for its unique solution
the stereographic                  or inversion transformation.
     The following rough analysis                        will give some                  idea of the territory
covered by his more elaborate                           memoirs —        :
     One       of the            earliest subjects that                      engaged         his attention was
Generalised Differentiation ("Differentielles Indices Quelconques").           a
The subject      developed at considerable length in five memoirs
                          is
printed in the 13th and 15th volumes of the Journal de TlZcok
Poll/technique (1832-37).
   Some of his most important work relates to the Integral Calculus,
more       particularly             that part of            it   which deals with the theory of
elliptic and other transcendental functions.
     The earliest memoirs on the subject are two in the                                               Journal    de
l'£colePoli/technique (xiv. Cah. 1833, see also Comptes Rendu*,
1837), "On the Determination       of Integrals  whose value                                                     is
Algebraical."               He       here       follows      up the researches                 of Abel on the
same subject;                  and arrives, inter alia, at the following important
results —  :
     1.   If  x   he any rational function                       of x, then fdx^J-^,            if   algebraically
expressible at all, can be expressed                                     in the form            Pv'xi    ^    being
rational.            And, farther, that the integral                               /dx^x        can    always be
reduced         to the form                6j           where      T     is   a    known       rational integral
function, and              6   a   rational integral function whose                            coefficients   have
to be determined.                   This     theorem         enables us at once to find the value
of the integral,            if   it   is   algebraically expressible                    ;   or else to show that
it   has no finite algebraical value.
     2.   If   y   be an algebraical function of x, i.e., connected                              with x by
means of an equation                       F(x,    y)   —   0,   which        is   rational and integral in
both      *    and y, then,             if   the integral          fydx            is   expressible explicitly
in finite       terms          by means of algebraic,                        exponential, or logarithmic
functions,         it     will    be expressible            in   the form
                  fydx=t            +   Alogw      +B       log# +        ....          +Clogw;
where         AB     ....           C   are constants, and                    t,   «,»,....           w algebraic
functions of x.
     Among           the       other        memoirs on the                     present subject           may be

      Some of     Liouville's        most     important work was in the department
 of   applied mathematics.                   When,        in    1834,      Jacobi enunciated his
 theorem that          an   ellipsoid        with      three      unequal axes            is    a    possible
 figure     of equilibrium for         a    mass of rotating fluid, and challenged the
 French mathematicians to give                   a   proof, Liouville at once published
 one   in the     Journal       de I'Scole       Polylechnique, xiv., 1834.                      He after
 wards      returned to the problem, and, in continuation of the work of
 Meyer on the same subject, showed that Jacobi's form                                    is   not possible

                                                88
unless     the ratio of the angular              momentum to the            mass          exceeds
a    certain limit. — Comptes Rendus, xvL,                   1843 ;     Jour,        de    Math.,
1851.
     In   the Journal        de   Mathematiques for 1855 we have                      a    farther
contribution  to this branch of hydrodynamics in the memoir
entitled " General Formulae relating to the question of the Stability
of the Equilibrium of a mass of Homogeneous Liquid                                        rotating
uniformly      about an Axis."              The memoir,          "On    a passage          of the
Mecanique        Celeste relating          to the Theory          of the Figure            of the
Planets" (Jour,         de    Math., ii.,    1837),      in which      he points out            and
corrects an error of Laplace, should also be mentioned.
     On dynamics we have three memoirs in vols, xi.,                      xii,   and xiv. of
the Journal      de   Mathematiques, dealing with certain cases in which
the equations of motion of a material point, or of a system of such,
can be integrated.           The equations are transformed by the substitu
tion      of various systems           of generalised coordinates (mostly elliptic
coordinates), and then the form of the Force Function (Potential) is
so specified that integration in finite terms shall be possible. The
third of      these    memoirs,         which    deals     with   a system       of material
particles, is interesting              mainly as regards          the theory of Abelian
integrals.       In   addition to these there are memoirs,               " On    a    particular
case of the     Problem of Three Bodies," Jour,                  de   Math.,   i.,   1856   ;   and
" On Developments of               a     chapter in Poisson's Mecanique," Jour,
de   Math., iii., 1858.
     Liouville    made several contributions to Planetary Theory, among
which which we may specially mention his memoir,                          " On the Secular
Variations       of the Angles between the straight lines that form the
Intersections of the Orbits of Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus."                                 Jour,
de    Math., iv., 1839.
     In   a variety of scattered notes are to be found some very important
additions to our knowledge of Theoretical Dynamics.                              Perhaps the
 most striking of these           is   that " On     a   Remarkable Expression of the
 Quantity which in the Movement of                    a   System of Material Particles
connected        in any way       is   a   minimum        in virtue of the principle of
 Least Action."         Jour,     de    Math.,   1856.      If    we take the         case      of   a
single free particle, and use Cartesian coordinates,                     Liouville's result
for    the form of the integral which expresses the action                       is  —

                                         89

where 6 is a function        of xyz, which    satisfies the equition
    Liouville gives this theorem in          terms     of generalised        coordinates
for any system of particles, and points out that                  it opens up a new
method       of treatment leading readily          to all    the known        results of
Theoretical Dynamics.
    During the latter part of his life, Liouville's                  researches      were
almost     entirely directed to the Theory of Numbers.                  From      1857 to
 1S73     we have a list of over 200 notes and memoirs                on this subject,
all published        in his own journal.        A   few occur with earlier dates,
 for examples the following         :—
     " On the equation       Z2" - Y2" = 2X»."        Jour. de. Math., v., 1840.
     " On a Theorem of the Indeterminate

 de   Math., x., 1845.
     The most important of all the memoirs on this subject are the
 series    entitled   " On  some General     Formula which           may be useful in
  the    Theory of Numbers."          Jour,     de   Math.,    vols,    iii.-viii., New
 Set, 1858-1863.
     Very few of the longer memoirs            are devoted to Pure Geometry               ;
 but     many interesting      and novel geometrical            theorems       occur in
 cidentally in Liouville's mathematical writings.                  A full account of
 these will be found in the third chapter of Chasles'
                                                                      " Report on the

  de*  Lettres   et les Pr ogres des Sciences en France, Paris, 1870.
     We may mention here some of the results arrived at in two
  memoirs,     " On     certain general   Geometrical Propositions,               and on
  the  Theory of Elimination in Algebraical Equations (Jour,                   de  Mailt.,
  vi., 1841), and "Developments           of  a  Geometrical Theorem"              (Jour,
  de  Matli., 1844).      The following      results among         others are arrived
  at:—
      1.  The points of contact of a geometrical              surface     with all     the

                                        90
tangent planes       parallel to a given plane      have a fixed      centre of
mean position whose position is independent           of the  direction of the
given plane.
   2.   The centre of mean        position of the meeting points          of two
algebraical    curves is also the centre of mean position of the meeting
points of the asymptotes       of one of them with the other or with its
asymptotes.
    3.  If  through the points of intersection of a curve and             a circle
normals to the curve be drawn, these normals intercept on                a trans
versal through the centre of the circle segments measured               from the
centre, which are such that the sum of their reciprocals is zero.
    If  the circle bo drawn to touch the curve at          P, and   we take for
the transversal the normal at         P, this proposition gives       us    a con
struction for the centre     of curvature at P.
    4.  Considering all the tangents to a curve parallel to a given            line.
The centre of mean position of the points of contact is the                  centre
of mean position of the interventions of the asymptotes.
   The centres of curvature corresponding to the points of                 contact
have    the   same centre    of mean position as the points of             contact
themselves     ; the sum of all the corresponding radii of curvature                is
zero, and the same is true      of the sum   of their inverses.
   5.   Considering all tangent planes to a surface parallel to            a given
plane, the sum of the principal radii of curvature at the point*                    of
contact is zero, and the same is true      of the  sums of    their  reciprocals.
   The work of the scientific teacher is scarcely less important                than
that of the scientific investigator, although the record of the             former
is more perishable, being at best an oral tradition           handed over           by
the immediate disciples of the master.            It would appear that in
this walk Liouville was worthy to rank with his illustrious prede
cessor Monge, whose        pupils shed such lustre on the French              school
of mathematicians.          M. Faye, in his funeral oration, says, "M.
Liouville     was one  of the most brilliant professors that ever lectured.
So   lively  was   my youthful impression of his lectures that to                 this
day I have     a  vivid recollection of the captivating clearness that            was
so  peculiarly his own.      Accordingly, when in later years          I   had     the
good fortune to hear him speak at the          Institute,   I  was the less        sur
prised at the effect which his words produced on my
                                                                colleagues,       who
 marvelled at being able, for a moment, under his
                                                            guidance, to        pcne

                                          91
trato the most difficult questions of the higher analysis.              No  one,
with the exception perhaps of Arago,            ever    produced this effect in
the same degree."
     His lectures at    the College de France were        attended hy the elite
of French mathematicians, and doubtless did much to keep alive the
ardent spirit of pure mathematical research which still lives among
his countrymen.          Among those who either were his pupils or were
indebted to his encouragement            and patronage may be reckoned Le
Verrier, Hermite, Bertrand, Serret, Bour, Bonnet, Mannheim, all of
 whom are or have been pillars of French science.
     If  we compare Liouville as an investigator with other great con
 temporaries whose rolls of achievement like his own are already
 closed,   we can scarcely put him in the highest rank of all, along
 with Abel and Jacobi, whose fortune it was in the course of their
 discoveries to open up new fields of research and create new branches
 of the     analytic   art.   Nevertheless, so profound are some of his
 isolated contributions,     and so elegant is all his mathematical writing,
 that   it will   be long before the traces of his handiwork       vanish from
 the fabric    of mathematical     science ; and  it  seems certain that future
 generations      will accord   him all but the highest rank in the temple
 of mathematical fame.
     Robert Wilson.           By Professor Fleeming Jenkin, F.R.SS.
                                     L. and K
      Mr Robert Wilson       was   born in 1803     at Dunbar.     In  1810 he
  lost his father, who was connected         with    the royal and mercantile
  navies.     This brave man, after having twice reached the wreck of
  the   " Pallas " frigate in the Dunbar life-boat, was drowned in the
  third attempt to reach the ship and rescue the remainder.
      Mr Robert Wilson        was apprenticed to a joiner, and,      like many
  other distinguished Scotchmen of the same generation,            he owed his
   high standing as a mechanical engineer almost entirely to his natural
   genius,  since   he does not appear to have received         any special ad
   vantages   in respect of education.
      During his apprenticeship, and at a date considerably prior to the
   successful introduction      of the 6crew propeller into our navy, he

                                     92
made models of boats with various forms of screw, which, worked
successfully.   He himself considered that the first idea of the screw
propeller had occurred to him as a mere child          ;  his first model was
that of a ship    2J  feet long, and a drawing which he published of
it in later life shows   a very good     four-bladed screw propeller ; he
attempted unsuccessfully to drive this by a windmill on the boat.
In  1821,  after seeing the    "Tourist" paddle     steamer, he made some
further experiments, but having to leave the sea coast he dropped
the subject.   In  1825  he returned to Dunbar, and again             attacked
the problem, trying first four blades, then three, and then two, driven
by the main-spring of a clock.        At    first the screw was placed in
front of the rudder, and the sketches since published by           Mr "Wilson
show the exact arrangement       now usually adopted.         He abandoned
this plan, however, in consequence of leakage at the stern tube          ; and
in order to get the opening above         water line he used two single
blade right and left propellers immersed for less than half their
diameter and driven in opposite directions, being placed one behind
the other, and connected     by bevel wheels.
   In 1827 young Wilson       was introduced to the      Earl of Lauderdale,
whose son saw a small boat about        3 feet   being driven in this way.
Lord Lauderdale    appears to have brought the         matter to the notice
of the Admiralty, but the young inventor           met   with no encourage
ment in official quarters.     He next exhibited his       model    before the
Dunbar Mechanics' Institution.         A   record of the exhibition was
made in the minutes of the institution         for October 18, 1827      ; and
the Edinburgh    Mercury of the 29th December 1827 alludes to the
invention.    The Highland Society of Scotland in 1828 appointed a
committee,   which after   seeing the small model made a grant         of £10,
to enable   Mr Wilson to      have  propellers made       on  a larger scale.
Consequently a boat 25 feet long was fitted with a pair of these
screw blades, to be driven by two men with winch handles ; the
committee,   which included two captains in the Royal Navy, reported
very favourably on the performance of this boat, during a trip               in
Leith Roads, lasting 17| minutes.         The model became the property
of the Highland Society.
   In 1832 a committee of the Society of          Arts reported favourably
on the trial of another model 18 feet long, fitted with the same
arrangement of two blades revolving           in opposite directions.      The

                                            93
prize committee        of this Society awarded him a silver medal and a
prize    of five sovereigns, pointing out in their report that the stern
paddles,      as they call the propellers,       " can be kept altogether under
water and       out of   the reach of surf, and answer equally well         in rough
as   in smooth      sea."
    Mr James Hunter of Thurston had introduced the invention                      suc
cessively      to the Dunbar        Institute, the Highland Society, and the
Society of Arts.          Notwithstanding      the encouragement      received from
those Societies        and the support given by various influential men,
the    Admiralty, to whom he again applied, declined to make any trial
of the plan, and Mr Wilson had the mortification of seeing the
simple screw introduced into the navy by               Mr Smith of Hendon.
     Mr "Wilson      was, however, by no means the first who had thought
of a screw as the propeller of a boat, and             it must  be admitted that
 he pushed       the right and left hand geared screws in preference to the
 simple plan       which    was ultimately successful.        He met with       some
 reward     indirectly,   becoming known to many influential persons as an
 ingenious and able young mechanic ; and ultimately                in 1880    he had
 the    satisfaction of receiving a sum of £500 from the Admiralty for
 the use     of his double-action screw        propeller  as  applied to the fish
 torpedo.
     In   1832    Mr Wilson     was   in business  as an engineer   in Edinburgh,
 in the    North Back of       the    Canongate.    A   few years afterwards he
 went to Manchester, and             in 1838   he was manager       of the famous
  Bridgewater      Foundry at Patricroft.        That   he should,   with no edu
 cational advantages,        have attained this position      at thirty-five    years
 of age, is perhaps as high a testimony to his             ability  as his connec
  tion with the screw propeller or even           with his  steam hammer itself.
  It  is universally admitted that the conception of the steam hammer
  was    due    to   Mr James Nasmyth, but Eobert Wilson                   was    the
  inventor     of important      details    which   he   considered     essential   to
  its success.      On the     one    hand, we must remember         that a steam
  hammer at Creuzot, suggested by            Mr Nasmyth's sketch, worked suc
  cessfully    with  no assistance     given by Mr Wilson ; but on the other
  hand, there     is no doubt that some details largely used in connection
   with the hammer,       as commonly made        in England,    were due wholly
   or in great part to    Mr Wilson. There was unfortunately some dis
   agreement between       him and Mr Nasmyth on this point ; and indeed

                                        94
it is nearly impossible, when men are working              together   at the im
provement of a machine, to appraise with any exactness                 the precis*
share of merit due to each.
   The first steam hammer        made     in England was delivered to            the
Lowmoor      Iron Works in        1843.     Mr Wilson left Patricroft,          and
became engineer      to the Lowmoor Works, where in 1853                 he added
what is known      as the circular-balanced valve to the original         machine.
 This invention     was patented     by    Mr Wilson.       In   185G, when Mr
James Nasmyth retired from business             to follow the scientific        pur
suits by which he has greatly added to his reputation,              Mr  R. Wilson
 was recalled to Patricroft,    where he became the managing             partner of
Messrs Nasmyth, Wilson, & Co.
    Mr Wilson did not take much part in local               affairs, but    was for
some years president      of  the Patricroft     Mechanics' Institution.           In
 1873 he was elected a      Fellow of    the Royal    Society of Edinburgh
 He continued to apply himself to the management of                      his works
 until his death, which occurred on the 28th July 1882.
    A list of no    less than    thirty   patents  stand in his name,         either
 solely or jointly with others.
    Mr Wilson will     be remembered       as worthy of mention among the
group of able Scotch mechanicians who, by their power of invention,
 energy, and business      capacity, have not only won distinction                and
 wealth for themselves,     but have added to the resources and            strength
of   the empire
        James Young,      LL.D., F.R.S.         By Dr Angus Smith.
    James Young was born in Glasgow, and on leaving school                        was
engaged for some time in          a joiner's shop.      It   is characteristic      of
his energy     that at this time he would, during his" holidays,               make
long journeys      on foot, having      on   one occasion      walked as far        as
 Aberdeen, and on another having walked the greater                   part of      the
way to London, visiting places of historic interest on his way.                   His
occupation in the joiner's shop was the occasion                of his    becoming
 a chemist.      He attended the        class   of chemistry in Anderson's
College, and his skill as a workman led to                his being employed
by Professor Graham, who then taught the class, in constructing

                                             95
pieces      of apparatus      for the experiments.           By his     usefulness   and
intelligence        he eventually      became    assistant    to Professor Graham,
and lectured         when the Professor was absent.             He held the assistant-
ship for seven years, and accompanied Professor Graham to London
when the latter obtained a chair                in University       College.     Among
his friends         at Glasgow        were  Dr Stenhouse, F.R.S., Dr Lyon
 Playfair, and Charles          Griffin, an eminent manufacturer of chemical
apparatus.
     Young       now engaged         in the    great   enterprise     from    which    be
became       widely known       as a  public benefactor, and which was destined
 to bring     him both fame and profit            One   Mr Oakes mentioned to Dr
 Lyon Playfair        that there was oil flowing from a pit at Alfreton in
 Derbyshire.          Dr Playfair then told this            to Young,     who at once
 perceived      what an improvement might be made in the system                         of
 domestic      lighting by     the utilisation     of this natural product.           The
 flow of     petroleum, small though it was, from the source in question,
 and the     results obtained from it by Young, were the means of leading
  the  Americans to avail themselves            of the vast supplies of this useful
  substance     that are to be found in their own continent.
      The discovery, however,          with which his       name is most      intimately
  associated,    was his mode of obtaining oils from coal and shale, by
  which he succeeded         in producing an illuminant oil at a price which
  enabled     him to compete with the oil that was latterly obtained in
  such   quantities from the petroleum springs in America.
      Young did not discover solid paraffin             ;  two little bits bad been
  produced before his time ; but he saw that                   it could   be profitably
  made on a       large scale, and, by the methods he introduced, hundreds
  of   tons    of solid     paraffin    are   now made        annually, and by         his
  improved        processes    in   tbo   manufacture       of   this   article   he   has
   transformed the candle, as he had previously by the introduction                     of
   petroleum transformed the lamp.
      He founded         a  chair     for the    advancement         of   Technical     or
   Economic        Chemistry     in Anderson's       College, Glasgow, whilst be
   liberally    contributed to the endowment of professorships in other
   branches     of  science  in that institution.
       When he worked in the laboratory of Professor Graham, solid
   i-austic   soda, as now manufactured on a large scale, could only                    be
    made    in small quantities in silver vessels.              Dr Young first       made

                                          96
it in iron    vessels,  and caused to be recalled an order for a silver
vessel to cost .£1500,      by showing how that alkali could be prepared
in iron.
    He had the     degree of      LL.D. conferred         on him, and   became   a
Fellow of     the   Koyal Society. He was elected a- Fellow of this
Society on April 1st, 1861.             He was Deputy-Lieutenant for Kin
cardineshire.     Though his successful enterprises had brought him
wealth, he was unostentatious in his habits, and of a kindly and
hospitable disposition.        He died in May         1883.
                       John Miller, M.Inst.C.E.
    Mr John Miller        was born at       Ayr   on the     26th of  July  1805.
 He was educated         at  the   Academy of his native town, and on
 leaving it entered    a   solicitor's office ; but feeling no liking for the
 legal profession, he determined to abandon                it for that of a Civil
 Engineer.     After making himself well acquainted with               the theory
 and practice    of engineering, he became a partner of               Mr Thomas
 Grainger,    M.Inst. C.E.,     whose     office  was    in Edinburgh.     Whilst
 in partnership with that gentleman,            he was engaged in constructing
 roads in various counties       in Scotland, and in the south of Ireland,
 and    was acting engineer       for   the   Dundee     and Arbroath    Railway   :
 the   Glasgow, Ayr, and Kilmarnock Railway                 ; the Edinburgh and
  Glasgow North     British    Railway.       He  also  designed and constructed
 the North British Railway, Edinburgh to Berwick, and the Edin
  burgh and    Hawick Railway       ;   the Dundee and Perth        Railway  ; the
  Stirling and Dunfermline         Railway.        Mr Miller    was also engineer
  for many other lines, both in Scotland and England.               In  November
  1845 he deposited     in Parliament plans for upwards of 1500 miles
  of railway.
     On the above railways          there    are  probably some of the finest
  viaducts in Great Britain,           notably the Almond Valley Viaduct,
  consisting of 46 arches of 50-feet span           ;  the Dunglass Viaduct, the
  centre arch of which has a span of 135 feet ; whilst the centre arch
  of the Ballochmyle Viaduct has             a span     of 180 feet    Mr Miller,
  however,  always considered         the Lugar Viaduct,       with nine arches of

                                         97
 50-feet span, and four of 30-feet          span, as his greatest work.         The
rails of that viaduct are 150 feet above the           Eiver Lugar.
    Mr Miller retired from      the profession of      Civil Engineer in      1850.
In  1868 he -was returned to Parliament as one of the members                    for
the city of Edinburgh,       but lost his seat at the General Election in
1874.     He purchased      the estates of Leithenhopes          in Peeblesshire,
and Drumlithie      in Kincardineshire,       and devoted a great part of his
time to improving them.          He died on      the 8th   May    1883.
   Mr Miller at the time of his death was Senior Member of the
Institution of     Civil Engineers, and        was elected     a  Fellow of this
Society in 1841.
                        Charles Adolph Wurtz.
   Charles   Adolph      "Wurtz    was    born on     November 26, 1817, at
Wolfheim,    in Alsace.      He   studied at the University         of Strasburg,
where he    completed the medical curriculum            by taking the Doctor's
degree   in 1843.        From    Strasburg he went to Paris, where                he
occupied   several positions successively,         until   he became      in  1883
Professor at the Ecole        de   Medicine; and in         1866   he was made
Dean of the Faculty.        In  1867 he was elected member de           l'lnstitut,
in preference    to Berthelot, who was his only serious opponent.                He
died on   the 12th May 1884,           having only three weeks previously
pronounced     a  brilliant and     affectionate    Sloge   at the tomb of his
great master    Dumas, whose successor as perpetual Secretary of the
Academy he was, on all sides, designated            to be.
   Few chemists have done more or more remarkable work                         than
Wurtz.     His first publication is        on the nature of hypophosphorous
acid, which he explained       ; and    in  the course    of his studies on the
compounds     of phosphorus     he discovered the oxychloride.        In hydride
of copper he discovered       the first definite combination of hydrogen
with a metallic body.        In  1848 he made        perhaps   his most import
ant  discovery, namely, that of the compound 'ammonias,                 which did
w much to assist in establishing the type-theory of his countryman
and contemporary       Gerhardt.      It  was extended by his discovery of
glycol and the consequent         introduction of the idea of polyatomic
alcohols.    The controversy on the constitution of lactic                 acid, in
                                                                        9

                                        98
•which   Wurtz took     an important part, had the effect of clearing up
the distinction     between     the atomicity and the basicity of an acid.
In   1855    he discovered     the mixed     alcoholic radicals by a method
which has       since   become     a standard      one   for  the synthesis of
hydrocarbons.       His   researches   on   aldol, a body uniting in itself
the properties of an alcohol and an aldehyde,             bring us down to the
present date.
    It would be impossible, in       a notice   of reasonable     length, to give
any adequate idea of the importance of the work done by Wurtz
during the forty years of his active life             of investigation, and it
would be equally         impossible     adequately     to appreciate     the far-
reaching effect which the school which he founded around him has
had in the development of modern chemistry.                  Many of his most
illustrious    pupils remained to      the last workers in his laboratory,
influenced by the spirit of enlightenment with which he inspired
all who came in contact with him.                 The personal      charm which
Wurtz     exercised   on all who were associated          with him cannot      be
better    expressed   than in the words spoken at his grave by his
distinguished pupil and attached           friend Friedel.       After extolling
his rare powers     as a lecturer, he           "
                                        says — We       see  him in his labora
tory, receiving with unwearying kindness even the humblest of his
pupils, interesting himself in his work, and discussing his ideas as
with    an equal, sowing his ideas broadcast,        and   as  happy and proud
of a discovery made by one of his pupils               as  he was modest     and
unassertive    of his own.       Singularly   open to new ideas, and afraid
of no scientific speculation, however bold, provided it received the
sanction of experiment, he was peculiarly fitted to promote the
progress of science, and to lead        it over firm    and solid ground.       It
was owing to these rare qualities that he attracted so many chemists,
both French        and foreign, to his laboratory.            Of  these many    in
their turn have become masters, and all will unite in saying that
the time which they passed in daily association with Wurtz count*
 amongst the happiest and most         fruitful of their livea"

                                   Sir A. Grant.
    By the death      of Sir A. Grant on the 30th November 1884 the
Royal Society       of Edinburgh        lost one of its Vice-Presidents,         who
took   a constant     interest in its proceedings        ;  the University    lost  a
Principal who for sixteen years administered its affairs with remark
able ability and success, and         who has left a more enduring mark on
its history    than any Principal during the present century              ; and the
cause  of liberal education       in Scotland lost   one of its most enlightened
and consistent supporters.           Although of Scottish extraction, he was,
unlike all previous Principals            of the University,      neither born nor
educated    in Scotland     ;   and when invited at the age of forty-two to
assume    his position in Edinburgh, he had already gained distinction,
in two    widely separate spheres of usefulness,           as a scholar and writer
on philosophy,       as a teacher      and lecturer,   and as an administrator
of education.       From the time when his own University course was
finished,   his whole life was devoted to the practical work or to the
organisation     and administration of education : first, during ten years,
from   1849 to       1859,    in the University      of Oxford; next, for nine
years,   from     1859 to 1868,         in the Presidencies of Madras            and
Bombay; and finally, for sixteen years, from 1868 to 1884, in the
 University of Edinburgh.            In Oxford     and in India, as well as        in
 Edinburgh, his influence is         still felt and his loss regretted by many
friends.
   By birth he belonged,           on   the father's   side,   to an old Scottish
family, the   Grants of    Dalvey on Speyside.          His   mother was of mixed
French and Scottish extraction, and was the daughter of a planter
in the    Danish      West     Indian Island of       Santa    Cruz.   The family
estate   in Morayshire         had   been sold by his grandfather,          and   the
whole    fortune, which       had been invested in West India property,
had been      lost before       Sir Alexander     succeeded      his father   as  8th
Baronet     in    1858.      He     was   born in New         York on the 13th
September       1826, and passed two or threo years of his childhood in
the  West Indies.        The principal part of his school education              was
received at      Harrow, which he entered in 1839, and left              as head   of
the school      in  1845.      In November       1844 he had been elected to a
Kalliol scholarship,      and he entered        on residence     at Oxford    in the

                                          100
Easter term of the following year.                He  came up to the University
an excellent classical        scholar of the type produced hy the great
English public        schools, and      with   the social tastes   and disposition
which are fostered in those schools.               He was especially eminent in
Greek and Latin composition,              and the faculty of lucid and graceful
statement developed        by these accomplishments          proved of invaluable
service   to him     in  the various administrative          duties which he was
called   upon in after life           to   perform.     He    combined    with   his
scholarly attainments an appreciative taste for modern literature, and
especially    for the great English poets, and his interest in the philo
sophical,    which are combined with the more strictly literary, studies
of the University, and in the speculative             questions  by which Oxford
life  was powerfully stirred in the years succeeding the great religious
movement       of which   Dr Newman          was the centre, was soon awakened.
He    read   widely and discriminatingly, but with no special eye for
examinations      ;  and thus    it    happened    that his name is remembered
among     those of a select few (including           Clough,   Mr M. Arnold, Mr
Froude,      Mr   Freeman,      M.      Pattison,   and others),   who, by     their
subsequent      eminence, justified        the opinion that the second class      in
Litterm     Httmaniores      often     contained men of greater         power and
promise,    if of  less minute knowledge, than the first.            He graduated
in 1848, and in the following               year he was elected, out of a large
number of candidates,          to an Oriel Fellowship.           As circumstances
had made       it necessary for him to support himself from this time
forward by his own exertions, he immediately became one of the
private tutors, a class somewhat             like that of   the privat-docenien   in
the German        Universities,    who performed        a  much more important
part in Oxford         education     in those days than they do at present
The preparation of the best men for their final examination in philo
sophy was almost entirely in their hands.                 Although most of them
were men of         older standing, he very soon was recognised              as  the
most eminent of the body, and amongst his pupils were several men
who have since obtained distinction in various walks of life, who
acknowledged the benefit            they derived from his instruction.           He
lived with his pupils on the most easy and familiar footing, and
attached     them    to himself by his friendliness and social            geniality.
At   the same time, he taught his subject — the Nicomachean               Ethics of
Aristotle — more thoroughly than it had                been taught    in England

                                                 101
before his day.            While fully realising            the living interest which the
book, regarded          as a treatise on human nature, has for all times, he
was one        of the first to recognise             the truth, now universally acted
upon, that       it   was to be interpreted, not vaguely and arbitrarily                             in
accordance       with any theological              bias     or with the moral              sentiment
of our own time, but historically in accordance with the evolution
of Greek thought and the conditions of Greek life, and with the
whole       system    of   the Aristotelian philosophy.                     The mature       result of
his study     and teaching was his edition of the Ethics of Aristotle,
the    first volume of which was first published in 1857.     It is on
this work,      of which a fourth edition appeared                      a   few weeks before his
death, that      his reputation           as a    scholar and a writer on philosophy
mainly rests.           Though it is more than                   a quarter     of a century since
it was      given to the world, and though during all that time the
subject      has been        assiduously studied and taught at Oxford,                              his
edition still remains the standard one, and among English scholars
his name        is as familiarly          associated        with      the Ethics      of Aristotle
as    that of Conington       with Virgil, and of Munro with Lucretius. In
proof     of the      estimate still formed of its merits by those who are
constantly using           it,
                            I     may be allowed to quote the words of one of
the    most    competent          among     the younger tutors at Oxford.                        While
admitting        that      the    work    is     exposed         to   some     criticism in the
present       day, he
                                 "
                           adds — We           are too apt not to realise how much
such    a   work has done directly and indirectly for the appreciation                               of
Greek       philosophy in this country.                     It    was the first and           it   still
remains the       only attempt in any language to unite                        a   scholarly study
of    the very    difficult text with         a   literary and philosophical apprecia
tion    of the treatise           in its relation to the whole history of Greek
thought         Certainly         no one of the German editions attempts any
thing so extensive,              and only one of them         (in Latin) has     philo       a
sophical      value."       He    goes on   a    few sentences later — " In Edinburgh
his name       will always         be associated          with    a   most brilliant       period in
the history      of the University.               Throughout            the world of English-
speaking scholars he              will   be remembered            as one      of those who have
set before       themselves         and others         an    ideal of scholarship which
excludes       neither philosophical thinking                     nor   a    regard    for literui-y
excellence.           We   are sometimes          apt to boast that this              is a   specially
English        or even       a    specially      Oxonian ideal;               we   are     too   often

                                                   102
reminded that few even endeavour to attain                          it,   and any of these few
can   ill   be missed."         *
    It   is   no paradox            to say that even the defects of the work, such as
they are,       as      well   as    the great merits which         make     it    the best intro
duction to the study of Greek ethical philosophy, are connected
with what was his greatest quality                     — the   largeness and breadth of his
nature.            It   was not possible          for him to become        a   pure specialist —
a   mere scholar, or abstract                thinker, or man of letters.                A     complete
change        in his       circumstances,         which     took place shortly after the
publication of this work, made                     it   clear that he was rather          a    man of
great general capacity,                 fitted to obtain success and eminence                   in   any
important province of life, than one born with the special bent and
genius        of    a   scholar or philosopher.                During the last twenty-five
years of his life              it   was to the sphere of action more than to that of
thought and research that his energies were directed                              ;   and, however
great may have been the loss to the                         University of Oxford, and                 to
classical      learning,            caused by this diversion of his powers, there                      is
little doubt that his own                    capacities    were expanded           by   it,   and that
he was enabled to do more useful work in the world than                                  if     he had
been appointed to the Professorship of Moral Philosophy in Oxford,
for which he was an unsuccessful                        candidate   in    the year 1859.             His
marriage in that year with the daughter of Professor Ferrier                                     of St
Andrews, and the grand-                    daughter of
                                                       " Christopher North,"                   was the
immediate cause of his seeking                         a   new career in India,               and was
probably the remote cause of his final connection                          with the University
of Edinburgh.                  He    accompanied       Sir Charles Trevelyan to Madras,
and began his career in that Presidency                           as Inspector of Native
Schools.            From        Madras he was soon called                 to the Presidency of
Bombay, where in rapid succession he filled the posts of Professor
of History and Political Economy in the Elphinstone                                     College, of
Principal of that College, of Vice-Chancellor of    University of            the
Bombay, of Director of Public Instruction, and of Member of the
Legislative Council in the Presidency.  The best work of his life
was probably that which he gave to          India, during the nine years of
his active            employment there.  His name was soon as familiarly
associated           with Bombay as   had been, and still

                                                                      " his extensive
 influence with, the public in the matter of endowments and bene
 ficiaries."      Great as his intellectual gifts of organisation and adminis
 tration were, the power of his personality was              still more remarkable.
 Along with         his general   interest in Indian education he combined
a    warm personal interest           in individuals,     and the aid which         he
 afforded     to the advancement        of able and deserving men among them
 is  still gratefully remembered          by natives of India.
     He entered on hisduties        in Edinburgh in the beginning of        the winter
 session    of 1868-69, and continued during the remainder of his life to
 perform them         with ever-growing capacity and knowledge, and with
 the moat       loyal attachment to the institution to which he came              as a
 complete       stranger.    With his sound practical sagacity           he combined
 a   high imaginative        faculty, and while minutely           attending to and
  mastering the details of business, be set constantly before himself the
  i'leal of what the University ought to be as a nuraery of intellect and
  character, and as an organ            for the elevation of national life.         He
  gained      the entire     confidence     of his colleagues       in  the   Senatus,
  whether they agreed or disagreed             with him on particular questions,
  by the impression he produced of absolute devotion to the good                     of
  the  University.        He  gained the regard and admiration of the students
  by his     frank, dignified, and cordial bearing in all his relations with
  them, and by his genuine sympathy with them                   in their aspirations,

                                                  104
 their work, and their              amusements.         He wished every one              to feel as
 he did, proud of his University,                 and determined to uphold its                 credit
 by intellectual effort and by honourable conduct.
      Although          the   pursuits of the last twenty-five years of                       his life
 tended to force him into the groove of action, rather than of                                letters,
 yet they were by no means barren                       in literary     results.         In    India,
 besides         delivering several interesting addresses, which may still                          be
 read        with   pleasure and instruction, he was a frequent contributor                         to
 the English newspapers               published in the Presidency.                 His    recently
 published History of the University of Edinburgh is the most im
 portant literary product of his later years. Inspired and pervaded by
 his idealising love of his University,                 it   is a work at once of          learned
 research and of strong human interest in its record of many of                                 those
 by whom the chairs in the University                        were filled at various            times.
 His Lives of Aristotle and of Xenophon, undertaken for Blackwood's
 series of Ancient Classics, are written with scholarly taste and
 simplicity,        and with        that insight and vivacity of feeling                      which,
 without vulgarising            it,   can   invest an ancient theme               with    modem
 meaning.           His last    address     to the students,       delivered only             a   few
 weeks before his death, affords more than his more elaborate works                                  »
 true image of the man,          in his intellectual     power, his serious enthusiasm,
his large-heartedness,           the dignity and simplicity of his bearing.                         It
produces          an indefinable impression of greatness.                   His    colleagues        in
the University, certainly, will always think of him                     as    their   " greatest,
yet with least pretence."             ,
   No        record of his career would be complete without some reference
to the services which he rendered when                        a   member      of    the       Scotch
Education Board.              His   most eminent colleague on that Board ascribes
to him the chief credit in preparing the First Scotch Code, which
was      "                                                   of the kind previously
             a   great improvement on anything                                                    pre
pared."           He adds     — " My own        clear impression      is,   that no   man ever
knew about educational                organisation from top to bottom better                     than
Grant."           His   eminence      as    a   scholar and administrator was                  recog
nised by the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge, of Edinburgh
and      Glasgow,        which conferred on him their honorary degrees                              of
D.C.L. and LL.D. The most enduring monument of his Principal-
ship will be the New University Buildings, which owe more to his
active       services    and his personal influence than to any other                              in

                                          105
  stru mentality.      The great     Tercentenary celebration of 1884 will,
 through all the future history of the University,            be associated    with
 his name.       The conception of the celebration was altogether his,
 and its successful     realisation owed more to him than to any one else.
 The    shock    of   his unexpected death,        on the 30th of November
 1884,   following     so  quickly on the memorable events of the pre
 ceding    April, is still fresh in the memory of his colleagues in the
 University and in this Society.
  James     Napier.       By Eobert    R   Tatlock,   F.LC, F.C.S., F.R.S.E.
    James    Napier     was   born in the village of Partick, one of the
suburbs     of Glasgow, in 1810.        His father    was a hand-loom weaver
in humble circumstances,         and his mother was      a sempstress.      At the
age   of seven or thereby he was         sent   to a small day school       in  the
village,   kept by Mr Neil, a medical student, where in leas than
 twelve   months he learned        to read    with comparative fluency.         On
account     of the straitened means        of his parents, however, he         was
then sent    to work, and found employment as a            " tearer " in  a  calico
printing works, his remuneration being Is.              3d. per week.        When
he was    between     twelve and thirteen years of      age he was put to his
lather's trade,    and, being conscious       of the limited character      of his
education,     he eudeavoured      successfully to earn a little money, by
extraneous     efforts of various kinds, to enable him to attend a night
school    for two     winters, by which his writing         and knowledge of
arithmetic were greatly improved.
    Owing to dulness in the weaving trade, he betook himself to that
of a dyer,    and was employed by the Messrs Gilchrist at their works,
Meadowside, Partick, where, at the age of eighteen, he was promoted
to the   post of foreman      "piece dyer," his wages being then         lis.  per
week.      When     only twenty-one years         of age he married, on the
slender income      of 13s. per week.      About the year 1833, on account
of the   dull condition of the dyeing trade, a trades-union was formed
among the     workmen, in which he joined, and would not be dissuaded,
even by offers     of extra remuneration from his employers,           in   conse
quence    of which he was dismissed.            He was next employed as a

                                              106
dyer at Glasgow Field Bleach Works, -where he remained for four
years, after which, his health failing, he endeavoured                           to earn a   sub
sistence     by keeping a lending          library,       but without             success,    and
ultimately returned to the dye-works where                        he was first employed,
in   the capacity of a clerk.       Prior to this Mr Napier had written                           an
essay of great excellence       on dyeing, which              had attracted the notice
of the late Mr John Joseph Griffin, who combined the business of
a dealer  in chemical and philosophical apparatus                            with that of          a
publisher, in Glasgow, and afterwards in London.                             He accepted          an
appointment in this establishment to prepare                             and bottle chemical
reagents,     and   to make up apparatus            — an employment which                         he
found very congenial,    as in some autobiographical notes which he
has left, he says : — " My position brought me into contact with all
sorts of inquirers ; people in different trades came, not only to buy
apparatus,     but to question about difficulties.                       I had    access to       all
kinds of chemistry books, and gave willing search to help them, thus
gaining a knowledge of different trades              ;    but       I wanted      system, and
to improve myself in this respect,             I    invited the members                  of our
Mutual Instruction Society to my house, and went through a course
of chemistry, following Graham's work.                        By     these means,       and by
nightly study,      I obtained   a pretty good knowledge of the principles
of the science."      It   was, doubtless, while       in this employment that
he made the acquaintance          of the late       Dr James Young, F.R.S., of
Kelly,     at that time laboratory assistant to the late Professor Graham,
of Anderson's College, Glasgow, who afterwards became Master of
the    Mint, which resulted in      a   life-long and most friendly intimacy.
In    the year 1839 the results obtained by               Mr Thomas Spencer in the
new art of electrotyping and electro-metallurgy excited much interest,
and    Mr Napier,    on    Mr Griffin's   account,       carried out some laborious
and important work with the object of applying the art to useful
purposes,     such as copying woodcuts and engraving plates,                            &c; and
in    1842 he was appointed to take a leading position                       in   the   London
electroplating      works of Messrs Elkington                      <fe   Mason, where,       it   is
needless to say, he discharged his duties                in   a   manner which reflected
the highest credit upon him, some of the work which he turned out
being truly very fine.       The interest he took in the process of copper-
smelting led to the discovery of great improvement in the refining
                                          a
and granulation of copper, by the application of soda ash, in which

                                          107
he encountered        much opposition, notwithstanding           which the process
was taken np and wrought                by  a private    company in 1847,        who
acquired     the Spitty Works at Swansea for the purpose, the result
of which was that at the end of the first year the books showed a
net profit amounting to £19,000,              or upwards of 55 per cent., £900
of which       fell to Mr Napier's          share.    In   1844   he   devised and
described a process         for extracting silver from its ores by calcination
with common           salt,   which    was,  in principle, identical       with   the
"wet process,"       devised by Mr William Henderson many                years later,
for the extraction of copper from poor ores.             He  also, some time there
after,   patented    a method      for the removal     of tin, antimony, arsenic,
&c, from poor Cornish ores.                 In  1852    he revised and extended
some magazine        papers which he had previously published, and they
were    published and issued by Messrs Griffin & Co., under the title
of    A Manual of         the   Art of Dyeing. This was succeeded by his
 well-known      book entitled A Manual of Electro-Metallurgy, which
 in 1860 reached a fourth edition.
     Mr Napier returned to Glasgow in 1849, and to his native place                —
 Partick — in 1852,        where he engaged      in literary work and interested
 himself    in its sanitary condition, analysing its potable             waters, and
 instigating the movement           which led to Partick being made a Police
 Burgh for its      own local government.            For   several   years  he thus
 occupied    himself, but retained his laboratory, employing himself as
 an   investigating and consulting chemist.             In 1860   he was requested
 by the   Marquis of Breadalbaue to visit and inspect a copper mine
 on his estate    at   Killin, on    the south side of     Loch Tay, which had
 been   worked for years without profit, the result of which was that the
 works were started on the spot, under             Mr Napier's superintendence,
  for preparation     of copper regulus and the manufacture of sulphuric
  acid and   artificial manures, but owing to the failure in the quality
  of the ore   from the mine these were soon suspended.                 In  1861 he
  returned to Glasgow, and commenced business as consulting chemist,
  where he    continued      till 1864, when he erected sulphuric acid works
  at Vinegar    Hill,  near Glasgow, the operations         of which occupied his
  time and    attention for six or seven years.           Being then relieved of
   the  active   management          by his son, he returned to his literary
   pursuits,   and    soon     produced     his Notes      and    Reminiscences     of
   Partick     (1873),      Ancient      Workers    in    Metals,    Manufacturing

                                               108
Arts      of Ancient         Times        (1879),     and     Old     Ballad    Folk-Lore
(1879).
     From the annexed list of his papers                   it will     be seen that     Mr
Napier       has    earned     for himself a recognised              position in general
science,       and particularly          in   the    special   branches      of technical
chemistry and metallurgical science                    which     were    so congenial to
him    ;  and that, with a more liberal              education, his mental activity
and aptitude for scientific study would have won for him a great
name in the scientific world.
     Mr Napier       was elected        a   Fellow of this Society in          1874.    He
was also a Fellow          of the Chemical Society, and took much active
interest in the local scientific societies .with which he was connected,
particularly the Philosophical, Natural                  History, and Archasological
Societies of Glasgow.             He was likewise           a zealous     worker in the
management         of Anderson's College, and of the                " Young " Technical
School, Glasgow, of which he was                   a trustee.     The loss of his wife
in   the year 1881 proved          a   heavy blow to him, from which he never
fully     recovered     ; and on         1st   December       1884     he terminated    an
active     and useful life at the age of seventy-four, esteemed                        and
respected by       all who knew him.

  Professor Thomas Croxen Archer.                   By   J.   D. Marwick,
                                    LL.D.
    Thomas Croxen Archer, Director         of the Edinburgh Museum of
Science    and Art, was born in Northamptonshire            in 1817, and was
educated    in London    as a surgeon.     When about twenty -five years
of age, however, he received an      appointment in the Import Depart
ment of the Customs at Liverpool, and in that service he remained,
receiving successive promotions,      till 1856.    Having     a natural taste
for botany, which he had zealously cultivated            as   a branch of     his
 medical studies, Mr Archer took a keen scientific interest in all the
 vegetable   imports of Liverpool,     and when the authorities of that
 city were invited by the promoters of the Great Exhibition of 1851
 to contribute to its success, and were      puzzled to know how best to
 do so,  Mr Archer      proposed   a scheme    which    met    with universal
 acceptance.     His  suggestion  was that Liverpool        should be repre
sented   by a complete       and  systematically    arranged     collection    of
 specimens    of all the   mineral, animal, and vegetable          importations
 into the Mersey, and this scheme was admirably carried               into effect
 under his own direction.       He was subsequently invited to write one
 of the official reports on the Exhibition.      The services       rendered by
 him in connection with this collection, and also        as agent      in Liver
pool for the Exhibition, were recognised         by a medal      ;   and in the
 following year he was appointed agent in Liverpool for the Crystal
 Palace Company, who marked their sense of the value of his work
for it during 1852-3 by conferring three medals upon him.                 In the
latter of these years    Mr Archer contributed    a  volume on      " Economic
 Botany" to a series of popular works on Natural          History published
by Lowell,      Reeve,    &  Co., of   London.      About      this    time   Sir
William Hooker       was forming the great museum of Economic Botany
at   Kew, and     had   much correspondence      on the subject        with Mr
Archer, who afterwards set himself, with characteristic energy, to
make a somewhat       similar, though smaller, collection for the Royal
Institution   at Liverpool.    His interest in botany also attracted him
to the   Botanic Gardens of the city, in which he took an active
concern,   and led to many excursions in the neighbouring counties,

                                          Ill
in the pursuit of his favourite study.               He     was appointed Lecturer
on     Botany in the Medical            School at    Liverpool,       and     afterwards
Professor      of Botany in Queen's College and in Blackburn                     College
of the same city.
     On    10th      May 1860,      Mr Archer   became       Director of the Edin
burgh      Industrial Museum,           a name which         was subsequently,         by
order     of   the    Committee of Council       on Education,           changed      into
that of the          Edinburgh Museum of Science              and    Art.     The office
had become vacant by the death of Professor                    George       Wilson, who
had done much, by the charm of his persuasive                       advocacy,    to com
mend the       objects of the museum to the public.             But    the state of his
health, and the want of any suitable building                in which    the necessary
collections       could be exhibited, prevented      much progress being made.
Shortly after        Mr Archer's appointment, however,              the requisite steps
were      taken by the       Government to proceed            with    the    erection of
a suitable        museum,     and in     1861   the foundation          stone    of   the
present  building was laid by the                     Consort. To
                                                lamented      Prince
all the work connected with that ceremony — with the subsequent
completion   of the structure — with the transference to it of the
collection     made by Professor George "Wilson, and also of his own
private collection        of upwards of two hundred specimens, chiefly
of   vegetable        products used in the Arts —and with the supple
menting and           completing of these collections,         Mr Archer        devoted
himself      with untiring energy.  What written appeals did not
succeed     in obtaining for the museum, personal solicitation at the
various centres of industry rarely failed to secure.                  The enthusiasm
of the    director      carried everything before     it,   and year after year he
vent over various countries             in Europe, visiting important            seats of
manufacture          and noteworthy art collections, and carrying back with
him, as purchases or free gifts, the results of his untiring labours to
enrich the museum           at Edinburgh    or South Kensington.              When     the
^astern    wing of the present building was completed,                 everything that
Mr Archer could do to hasten on the extension of the central portion
was done,       and when the central portion was completed,                  no effort on
his part was spared to induce the Government to complete                      the entire
structure      by    the erection    of the west wing now in progress.                This
he   had the satisfaction of seeing commenced.                 In    the arrangement
and classification         of the museum,       as   it   now exists,       aud in the

                                        112
 completeness      with which    every    exhibit  is made      to  tell its own
 story to the student,    there remains,    and will, it is to be hoped long
 remain, the evidence of Mr Archer's loving care and devotion to his
work.
     Mr Archer    was appointed one of the jurors        of   the International
Exhibition of      1862,  and,   along with     Mr Peterson of the       office  of
Crown Domains in St Petersburg, wrote an official report on the
vegetable    substances used   in manufactures shown       at that    Exhibition.
His   services in relation to this work were acknowledged by a medal;
and in the following year he was appointed a Corresponding Mem
ber of the      Ministry of Crown Domains of Russia.                He acted as
Associate Commissioner at the Paris Universal Exhibition of 1867,
and reported on the class of exhibits connected with forest products,
for which report he received three medals.            In 1870     he reported on
the International Exhibition in London; and in 1871 he was com
missioned by the British Government to attend the Exhibition at
Moscow and Copenhagen.              He was     appointed    a   member     of the
Committee for Selection       Of  the annual International         Exhibition of
1872, for which      Exhibition    also he acted as Deputy Commissioner
for Scotland.       In  1873   he was appointed a       juror at     the  Vienna
Exhibition held in that      year, and he prepared several        reports for the
British Commission in connection with it.                His    services  at this
Exhibition     were   acknowledged by tho decoration of a Commander
of the Order of Franz- Joseph           of Austria.    In the     same year he
was awarded       the gold medal       of the Russian Ministry of Crown
Domains; and, in recognition of literary and scientific merit, was
appointed Chevalier of the Order of St Hiago of Portugal.                       In
1876    Mr Archer    was appointed Executive         Commissioner for Great
Britain and Ireland, along with Colonel Sandford, at the Phila
delphia Exhibition of 1876, and in recognition of this service he
was awarded      a medal     In   1878 he acted      as one    of the jurors in
the Paris Universal Exhibition of that year.
    Mr Archer       was  connected      with many literary        and scientific
societies.    He   was a director of the Royal Institution         of Liverpool,
a  life member of the Liverpool Literary and Philosophical Society,
an honorary member          of the Liverpool      Chemists'      Association,    a
member of the Liverpool Microscopical Society (of which he was for
several   years secretary),   an    honorary member       of the     Birkenhead

                                        113
 Philosophical    Society,  a  president of the Botanical Society of Edin-
  hurgh, a member      of Council     of the Royal Society of Edinburgh,
  and a member of the Royal Society Club,             a president of the Royal
 Scottish Society of Arts,      a secretary   of the  Edinburgh Microscopical
 Society, an honorary member of the Edinburgh Geological Society,
 a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland,          an honorary presi
 dent of the Edinburgh Association of Science and Art, an honorary
 member of the Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain,                  and an
 honorary member        of the     Pharmaceutical Society of Austria,         the
 Philosophical    Society of America, Philadelphia, and the Franklin
 Institute of Pennsylvania.
     He was a liberal contributor to         the Transactions of the various
 literary and philosophical societies with which he was connected, to
 the  Art Journal, and Journal of          the Society   of Arts, to the eighth
 edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica, to Chambers's Encyclopaedia,
 and to other works.
     Called frequently to London on the business of his Department,
 Mr Archer had       occasion    to be there in February        1885,   and had
 arranged to return to Edinburgh          on the    19th of that month.      Two
 of his  daughters had joined him in the Midland Grand Hotel, and
 were proceeding     to breakfast, intending afterwards to           accompany
 him to   the railway station, when, without premonition           of any kind,
 he fell down in the hall and expired.                He  was predeceased      in
 1879 by his wife, and is survived by one son and four daughters.
 His eldest son and a daughter predeceased him.
    Mr Archer was a man of great energy of character, and of wide
and varied information.          Throughout      life he enjoyed    exceptional
facilities for becoming acquainted with an infinite variety of men
and things in this country and abroad, and these facilities he utilised
to the fullest extent.        His retentive memory supplied him with
inexhaustible    sources of interesting conversation,         and — underlying
occasional    apparent    sharpness     of manner     — there  were   unfailing
kindness, a high sense of honour, and, to those who knew him
best,   a depth    and tenderness      of feeling which       were  irresistibly
attractive.
    The writer of the present notice enjoyed Mr Archer's friendship for
five-and-twenty years.        He had    the privilege of accompanying him
in travels   abroad, and enjoying his close friendship at home,              and
                                                                      h

                                       114
the result of that long and intimate knowledge entitles him to say
that no    more    faithful   public servant,      no truer   or more reliable
friend, could be desired than        Mr Archer     was.
    P.S. — Since this notice       was prepared     the writer has had placed
in his hands the following             letter   from   Colonel   Donnelly,  the
secretary   of the Science         and Art     Department, to      Mr Archer's
 son  :—
                        Science and     Art Department
                                                               3rd March 1886.
    Sir, — The Lords of Committee of Council                on Education   have
 directed me to convey to you and the other members of his family
 their sense of the loss which has been sustained by the Science
 and   Art Department by the         death   of Professor Archer.
    My Lords deeply         regret  losing so valuable an officer;      and, in
 desiring me to express their condolence           with  those who are mourn-
 xng for him, have instructed me to place on record their appreciation
  of the exceptional zeal, energy, and ability with which he at all
 times discharged     the important duties intrusted to him at the         Edin
  burgh Museum of Science and Art.
     They consider that it was mainly owing to his exertions that this
  Museum, which may almost be said to have been created by him,
  attained such popularity and importance since it was opened to the
  public under his direction          in   1860.  —I   am,   Sir, your obedient
  servant,
                                         (Signed)          W. D. Donnelly.
       Cecil Archer, Esq.,    20 Greenbill
             Place,  Edinburgh.

                                          115
                               Joseph Mitchell.
    Joseph Mitchell,       civil  engineer,  for long resident      in Inverness,
 and latterly in London, was born at Forres on the 3rd November
 1803.     His father, John Mitchell,       was appointed,     under   Mr Telford,
 as inspector of works, in connection with the extensive road works,
 which, with the other great works then being carried out by                     Mr
 Telford,   were   the  first means of opening up the Highlands              to full
 access   with  the southern parts of Great Britain.           Mr John Mitchell
 held    the general    inspectorship of the extensive           system    of com
 munication      known     as  the Highland      Boads and       Bridges.     It  is
 worthy of remark that Mr John Mitchell                 attracted    the attention
 not only of Mr Telford, but also of the poet Southey, who wrote
 in   terms  of high commendation,           both of his talents        and moral
 qualities.
    Joseph    Mitchell    seems     in many respects to       have    inherited his
 father's energy     and abilities.      He was educated        at the celebrated
 Academy of Inverness, which for many years was under the charge
 of the well-known Alexander Nimmo, C.E., who                   was long the per
 sonal friend of Telford and of Sir David Brewster, for whose Ency-
 clopatdia he wrote several articles.
    Mr Mitchell      became a Fellow of this Society          in  1843.     He   be
 came a civil engineer under the immediate auspices of                 Mr Telford,
 who    caused him to engage in the practical masonry             of the lockgates
 of the Caledonian Canal         at  Fort Augustus, after which Mr Mitchell
 not only    became an apprentice in his office, but an inmate               of his
 house,    a striking     proof of the      high opinion      which     that great
 engineer had formed of his personal qualities.              Here he made the
first survey of the St Catherine Docks, which were carried out under
Mr Telford's superintendence.
    In 1824, when only twenty-one years         of age,  the whole of the High
land Boads and Bridges          system was, on the death of his father, put
under Mr Joseph Mitchell's charge, a fact which shows how great
a trust was reposed in him by Mr Telford.              During the long period
of thirty-nine     years he had these roads, extending over the rugged
and difficult    counties   of Inverness, Boss, Cromarty, Sutherland, and
Caithness,     not only to inspect but to provide additional roads and

                                          116
bridges over      the   most difficult     ravines and passes and the moat
formidable kind of rivers.           There was in all this difficult country
ample room      for varied engineering practice, which was throughout
of a most     successful    type.     Besides   all this Government work, he
carried on an extensive private practice, involving             the expenditure
of about £180,000.            He    was   also  employed by Government          to
design and erect forty churches              in outlying districts and lonely
islands.
    In  1828 he was appointed engineer to the Scottish Fishery Board,
 and designed and superintended the execution of very many useful
 harbours,   as for example at Burnmouth, Coldingham, and Dunglass,
in Berwickshire,       at Buckhaven and Cellardyke on the          Fife  coast, as
 well  as at  various fishing stations on the coasts of Caithness and
 among the Hebrides.          The large fishing harbour at Dunbar, which
 cost nearly £40,000, was also one of Mitchell's,            as well as Lybster,
 on the Caithness coast, where, in order to avoid as much as possible
 conflict with the open        sea,  he preferred to recess the      basin land
 wards of high water, instead of carrying the works outwards.                  He
also designed       improvements at Wick on the same principle.                Mr
 Mitchell   is well known as having been the engineer of the extensive
 work known as the Highland               Railway between     Perth and Inver
 ness, as well as of most of the railways to the northward              of Inver
 ness.     Mr Mitchell,       in    conjunction    with   Messrs William      and
 Murdoch Patereon, was engineer for the Skye line.
    Mr Mitchell      has left behind him so many works of a varied, and
 some   of them of a difficult       nature, as to prove    his natural sagacity
 and skill.      He    was   always highly esteemed         by his professional
 brethren for his geniality and high professional honour                as weB  an
 his ability.      True and genial as a friend, his death was felt by
 many as    a personal    loss, both    in Scotland   and in London, where      he
 principally    lived in later years.          He died in London         on 26th
  November 1883, at the advanced age of eighty years.

  Professor HENHY CHARLES FLEEMING                     Jenkin.      By W. H. P.
    Professor Henry Charles Fleeming Jenkin, only child of Captain
Charles   Jenkin, R.N., of Stowling Court, Kent, and his wife (Cora
Jackson), a Scotchwoman and a novelist of some mark, was born
in Kent on the 25th of March 1833.                Fleeming Jenkin was at the
age   of seven taken to Scotland, when he went to                    Dr Burnett's
school at Jedburgh.          There he stayed for three years, and then for
other three years attended the Edinburgh                Academy.      In  1847  he
went to school in Paris, where he saw the Revolution                   of 1848, of
which he was wont to give vivid and interesting descriptions; and
after the   June riots      he left for Italy,  where he attended      the Univer
 sity of Genoa     in   the  Arts Faculty, taking his        degree as Master of
 Arts in 1850.        It  was at Genoa also, in a locomotive shop, that he
 began  his distinguished career as an engineer, under Philip Taylor
 of Marseilles.      In  1851 he returned to England, and was apprenticed
 to Fairbairn's     in Manchester for        three    years.    His first practical
 work was done under           Mr Hemans,     on    a survey for the Lukmanier
 Railway, in Switzerland         ; then he went to Messrs         Penn at Green
 wich ; and     then to Messrs Liddell & Gordon, in railway work.
 Thence    he went to Messrs Newall (Birkenhead), while they were
 engaged   on making the first Atlantic cable in 1857.               He   was very
soon   entrusted with the chief management              of the    Messrs  Newall'a
 engineering    and electrical business.          His work included superin
 tendence   of machine construction in the factory, the designing of
 picking-up and paying-out machinery, the fitting up of steamships
 for  submarine cables         and the electrical testing.         This work    he
continued     to do during the making of part of the first Atlantic
cable,  of the Red Sea cable, of a cable from Singapore to Batavia,
and of several        Mediterranean      cables.     In 1859, the year of his
marriage    with Ann, daughter of the            late Mr Alfred Austin, C.B.,
he was    elected Associate I.C.E., and           began   to write on scientific
subjects,    encouraged        thereto   by Professor        (now Sir William)
Thomson,     whom he had first known through Mr Gordon, of Liddell
 tc  Gordon.       In     1860   he   took   out a patent       jointly with Sir
 William Thomson for signalling apparatus               through long submarine
 cables, and     in   1861    he entered    into a partnership, which lasted

                                         118
seven   years,   with Mr H. C. Forde for                general      and telegraphic
engineering.      In the     same year he       acted tas second        in command
under Sir "William Thomson at the establishment of the British
Association Committee on electrical standards.                   Of this committee
he was appointed secretary,         and he wrote their reports             for several
years.     He   also carried      out most      of the     committee's      important
experiments in conjunction with Clerk Maxwell                       and others.       He
was   juror for Physical Apparatus at            the 1862     Exhibition, and was
named     Reporter      for   Electrical    Apparatus.           In   1865    the late
C.  F. Varley joined Sir William Thomson and Fleeming Jenkin in
an agreement to work at the development of the signalling apparatus
through long submarine cables already referred to.                     The apparatus
devised by the three inventors was used by                all  the great companies,
and   Jenkin displayed      a remarkable business faculty in the commercial
management       of the patent.       In this    same year      Jenkin    was elected
a   Fellow of      the   Eoyal Society, and in           1866     he was appointed
Professor of Engineering         at  University College, London.              In 1868
he dissolved partnership with Mr Forde, and resigned his post at
University College, in order to accept the Chair of Engineering in
Edinburgh University,         which chair he filled until his death.               After
accepting    this post he entered         into a new         partnership with Sir
William Thomson, under            the  provisions of which Sir William and
he acted as    joint    engineers    to various submarine cable            companies.
Among the lines which were laid under their direction were                         those
of the Western         and Brazilian      Telegraph Company,             the    Platino-
Brazileien    Telegraph       Company,      the West        Indian      and    Panama
Telegraph Company, and the Mackay-Bennett or Commercial Cable
 Company.        In    1871     Fleeming      Jenkin      was     President      of the
 Mechanical Section of the British Association, which met that year
 at Edinburgh; and in         1873 he went to Brazil in the interests             of the
 Western and Brazilian Telegraph Company.                     In   1877,  in   a lecture
 at Edinburgh given for the Edinburgh               Philosophical      Institution,    he
 took occasion to propose the establishment of a Sanitary Protection
 Association.      In  consequence      the Edinburgh           Sanitary    Protection
 Association was started, and succeeded so well that its example has
 since been followed       in many parts both of Great Britain and of the
 United    States.     To most of these associations in Great Britain
 Fleeming Jenkin was consulting engineer.                   At    the Paris     Exhibi

                                               119
tion of    1878   he was         juror in Engineering, and in 1884 was juror
in Electricity in          the    Health Exhibition in London.    From 1879
onwards to the time of his death                        ho was     Vice-President         of the
B.S.E., and from this Society               he had the      Keith Prize for          the period
1877-79.    This, the Society's highest distinction, was awarded for
his paper on " The Application of Graphic Methods to the Determina
tion of the Efficiency of Machinery," a continuation, full, however,
of originality, of the subject treated in Eeuleaux's Kinematics
                                                                   of
Mechanism^           In   1882 he took out his first patent for "Telpherage,"
a system of electrical carrying of burdens,                      or at need of passengers.
The Telpher line is              a conductor,      which may be either flexible or
rigid, of electricity supporting              an electric motor and train of steps or
of travelling chairs,            which hang below          it,   and itself supported by
strong posts.         The line      is   in electrically distinct        sections, and the
train, itself     a   continuous conductor,              and larger than any section,
bridges over the interval between                  successive       sections    as   it   passes.
The power       is    derived from        a   fixed engine and dynamos placed                  at
convenient distance              from the line.          The " Telpherage Company,"
whose first working line was opened at Glynde, four months after
Jen kin's    death, which took place               on the 12th of         June       1885, was
due to   Jenkin's joining forces with Messrs Ayrton         Perry, who         &
were, like him, turning their attention to the application of electricity
to locomotion.    His death was due to the unfortunate result of                               a
surgical operation,         slight in itself.
     Apart from his own             most      special    work, and from the sanitary
engineering work which has been referred to, and which has had
wide and good influence,                 Professor Jenkin took          a   deep and keen
interest in Technical Education                  (he was for many years              a   Director
of   the   Watt Institution) and in              science generally.         Witness among
other instances his reviews of the Origin of Species (North British
Review, June 1867) and of the Atomic Theory, an article supported
by Munro'8 Lucretius (North British                      Review, 1868).         Both Darwin
and Munro, in subsequent                 editions of their works, acknowledged the
value of Professor Jenkin's criticism.                    In the fine    arts, and notably
in dramatic art in its widest             sense, his interest       was equally keen and
wide   ;   but by the world at large, outside his own belongings and
friends, he     will      be remembered         best for his special           and admirable
work in electricity and            engineering.

                                        120
                          John "Watson Laidlay.
   John Watson Laidlay         was born at Glasgow on the 27th of          March
 1808.     At an early age he went to London, and began his education
at a private school at Blackheath.
   After    passing   through the ordinary curriculum            there,  he com
menced a brief course of technical study, preparatory to going                out
to India, and with this view entered the laboratory of Faraday, by
whom he was initiated in practical chemistry.               At the     same time
he studied Hindustani         under  Dr Gilchrist, and it      was here that he
made the acquaintance         of Bishop Heber.
   This period     was, however,     very short  ;  when he reached only his
seventeenth     year  it was decided to send him out at once to            India,
and at this point his normal education may be said to have ended,
his subsequent learning, the varied extent and scholarly accuracy of
which was known          only to his intimate friends, being entirely the
result of self-imposed     study.
   In the end of      1825    he reached Calcutta, and joined         his uncles,
Messrs John and Robert Watson, merchants                 and indigo planters,
Bengal, who subsequently purchased from the East India Company
many of their        best  silk filatures and indigo         factories,  such as
Berhampore, Rampore-Beauleah, Surdah, &c,
   He    was now constantly      in charge of one or other of the filatures,
and succeeded in introducing          several valuable improvements        in the
machinery for winding silk.
   His   spare time he devoted to studying science and natural history,
but, above all, the Oriental languages,            for which    he had a very
decided talent    ; and,  in addition     to the native dialects,     soon made
himself familiar with Persian, Arabic, Sanskrit, and subsequently
Chinese.
   He originated the Bibliotheca Jndica,              a serial   publication   of
native literature, which has proved a most valuable work, and is
still continued.
   His love of deciphering inscriptions on            ancient   monuments was
great  ;  and, with a view to assisting the labours of those             engaged
in this work in India,         he translated The Pilgrimage          of Fa Hian
from the      French     edition of the Foe        Koue   Ki,   with additional
notes and illustrations      of his own.

                                        121
    He made a valuable collection of coins, including many uniques                ;
a portion     of these were unfortunately          stolen,   but the   remainder,
together    with his collection of shells,        he presented    to the British
 Museum.
    His most numerous literary and scientific publications               appeared
from time to time       in the Journal of     the  Asiatic Society,  to which he
 acted as co-secretary,    and afterwards vice-president and secretary to
the   Natural History Department.
    He also compiled a comparative dictionary of Chinese words, and
made    translations of several Persian poems and other works, which
 were never    published.
    In   1839 he visited     the Straits of Malacca for his health, and
there he made        the acquaintance of Rajah Sir James Brook.                He
went home      to England in 1843, where he married, and returned the
following year.
    The remainder of        his time in India, until his         final return to
 England in 1850, was spent         at Calcutta, where he associated with
the leading     scientific and literary men of the day, together             with
many other notable people.
    On leaving     India   he gave    up active work, and shortly settled
down at     Seacliff, Haddingtonshire,      where he spent the remainder of
his life.
    He was now elected a       Fellow of    the Royal Society of Edinburgh,
in whose proceedings he took a          lively interest, although      prevented
by uncertain     health from taking an active part in their             meetings.
 He also became a member         of various other societies in this country.
    At all times of a retiring and unambitious disposition, he showed
little inclination to enter society afresh and without the companion
ship   of his former friends, but preferred rather to cherish and extend
those   kindred studies which had been so much to him in the past.
In   the quiet  of his unostentatious life      at Seacliff,  he found a never-
failing source of pleasure     in his library, his laboratory, and in the
wider field   of nature.     His was essentially a pure love of scientific
truth for its own sake, and, although            furnished with introductions
which would have brought him              in contact with many        celebrated
hterary   and scientific men,      his extreme      humility and modesty of
self-assertion   prevented him from availing himself of these oppor
tunities   of bringing his own learning into greater prominence.

                                       122
    Thoroughly versed in the classics, he delighted to read and re-read
the works of the principal authors, most of whom he could quote
at pleasure.      Perhaps his favourite modern            language was Italian,
and Dante his favourite poet          Schiller and Goethe, too, he held in
high esteem, while in our own literature he was intimately con
versant with all the standard      authors.
    In the  sciences, chemistry, archaeology, geology, meteorology,             and
natural history, each afforded an inexhaustible field of research, his
varied reading enabling him to keep abreast of the latest discoveries.
   In medicine his knowledge         was      extensive   and    accurate, and    so
late   as his seventieth year      he    attended,     for his own pleasure, a
whole winter course of anatomy at the Edinburgh University,                   under
Professor Turner.
   Some time     before  his death    his eyesight began to fail, and thus
he   was reluctantly    forced   to abandon,       one by one, his favourite
studies; but his memory continued clear until his death, which took
place upon the 8th of March 1885.
   In private life    he was esteemed         by all who knew him for the
gentleness of his disposition, his kindness and unvarying courtesy to
all, rich and    poor alike  ;  but few, save his own family, knew hia
completely unselfish nature, his infinite goodness of heart

   Francis Brown Douglas, Esq.                   By Professor Duns, D.D.
    Francis    Brown Douglas was torn at Largs, Ayrshire, April 2,
 1814.      His father was Mr Archibald Douglas, advocate, Edin
burgh, and his mother was a daughter of               Dr Francis Brown of St
 Vincent.       He was    educated at the    Edinburgh High School, and for
a   short time     in England.        In early youth he went to the West
 Indies, where he was soon           called to undertake the management            of
 family estates.       On his return to Scotland            he   studied   for   the
 Scottish Bar, and was admitted an advocate              in 1837.    He practised
at the    Bar for a short time only.         Having an ample private fortune,
 he  felt himself at full liberty to follow pursuits to him more con
genial    than the hard work of his profession,              and accordingly he
 devoted    his time and energy earnestly to municipal, philanthropic,
and religious       work.    He    was elected     a Fellow of this Society in
 1839.      A man of       general    culture, he was intimately        acquainted
 with several branches of current literature, and took a warm interest
in public education.         He  was elected      a member of the Edinburgh
 ¦School   Board when it was formed in 1872, and continued to serve
in  it till last election.      Mr Brown Douglas          entered the   Edinburgh
 Town Council       in   1850, and, after having acted as a magistrate            for
several    years,   he was chosen        Lord Provost of       the  city in   1859.
 Two events occurred in the course            of his Lord Provostship which
may be      mentioned, viz., the passing        of the Annuity Tax Act, and
 the-laying    of the foundation      stones of the New Post Office and the
National Museum by the Prince Consort.                 Mr Brown Douglas         was
a  Liberal in politics.       He   stood for the representation of the city        in
 1856,    but was defeated.          Later, he became a candidate for the
St   Andrews Burghs, but was again unsuccessful.
    It was, however, chiefly        in connection with religious       and philan
thropic     work that      he  stood     prominently     out before     his fellow-
citizens.      For   more than forty years his name was associated             with
almost     all movements of this kind.           He threw himself with         great
earnestness       and zeal into the        Scottish ecclesiastical    controversies
that characterised      the decade ending      in  1843.    He continued till     the
time of     his  death  in August 1885 to take the most active and cordial
interest    in  the  work of the Free Church, both at home and abroad,

                                      124
and succeeded     Mr David Maclagan in         the convenership   of its Con
tinental Committee.
    Mr Brown Douglas       devoted   a great deal of time and attention to
some aspects of philanthropy which do not          bulk largely in the public
eye, but are   full of good to many.      He was for forty years president
of the     District Sick Society. He took an active             share  in  the
Society for Teaching the Blind in their own houses, in the Indigent
Old Men's Society, and other kindred institutions — bringing,                as
director    or as member,      to  their  affairs  sound practical wisdom,
excellent business     habits, wide views, keen sympathy, and helpful
liberality.
    Mr Brown Douglas         was twice married — first    in 1845, to Mary,
second daughter of the late Charles Maitland               Christie, Esq. of
Durie, and again, in 1852, to Marianne, second daughter of the
 late  Hon. Alexander       Leslie  Melville, who, with four sons and six
 daughters,   survives him.
      David Maclagan, F.E.S.E.              By Professor Duns, D.D.
    David Maclagan was born in Edinburgh on the 9th of October
1824.      His father, Dr Maclagan,        a  distinguished   physician,   had
retired from the Army Medical            Service after a noted career, and
had settled down to a      highly successful civil practice in Edinburgh.
His mother     was  Miss Whiteside of Ayr. David was the fourth of
seven    sons,  six of whom survive — Professor          Douglas   Maclagan,
M.D., Dr Philip Whiteside Maclagan, Berwick-on-Tweed, General
Maclagan, E.E., William Dairy mple Maclagan, Lord Bishop of
Lichfield, John Thomson Maclagan, Secretary of the Church of
Scotland's Widows' Fund, and           Dr J. M'Grigor Maclagan, Riding
Mill-on-Tyne.      Mr Maclagan      was educated    at the Edinburgh High
SchooL      He   began   business life in the office      of " The    Scottish
Union Insurance Company," and was appointed manager of " The
Insurance Company of Scotland" in 1847.                 He was an original
member of the Society of Accountants, a body which was incorpor
ated   by charter in     1854.     Mr Maclagan       removed   to London in
 1862, on his appointment as secretary          to "The Alliance Fire and
 Life Insurance Company."         In this position, his business associations

                                      125
brought him into close relations with the Rothschilds,            Mr Goschen,
Sir Moses Montefiore, and other well-known                   financiers.     His
acquaintanceship      with Sir Moses       soon ripened into intimate        and
lasting friendship.      Mr Maclagan returned to Edinburgh in              1866,
and entered on the      managership     of the Edinburgh Life Assurance
Company, an office which he retained           till his death   on the 30th of
March     1883, at Mentone, whither,       for health's  sake, he had gone to
spend the winter.      In 1848   Mr Maclagan married Miss Jane Finlay,
who, with five sons, still survives.
    On his return to his native city he threw himself               with    great
heartiness and zeal into religious and philanthropic work.               He   was
one of the most earnest promoters         of the Apprentice School Associa
tion,  a society which at the time did much good, both by supplying
the means of education to a much neglected class, and also by leading
the way to better arrangements for the same purpose.              Mr Maclagan
was elected a Fellow of this Society in 1872.
    A  man of academic     tastes, fond   of literature,  the intimate friend
 of many    engaged in literary and scientific work, and himself earnestly
 interested in the growth of knowledge, he yet found himself, in                 a
 great measure, precluded from practical literary effort by the onerous
 duties of his business    position, and the devotion to work necessary
to success in his profession.      He   had, however, as a relaxation and a
 delight, early cultivated the habit of the pen, and he has left good
 evidence of his scholarly accomplishments, intellectual vigour, and
 fine taste.    From boyhood almost          Mr Maclagan had taken          great
 interest in Scottish religious and ecclesiastical          movements.       The
stirring   events which preceded and immediately followed the Scottish
Church crisis of     1843 greatly influenced him.       He  entered into them
 with  an earnestness and fervour     in strong contrast with his wonted
quiet and placid habits of thought. And though some rough points
of his churchism may have afterwards been a good deal smoothed
 down,    there  was not, through      life, any abatement        of his    early
enthusiasm and zeal.       Yet few    men were      freer from sectarian nar
 rowness.     His toleration for the views of others was       as characteristic
of him as    the firmness with which he held his own.            The writer, as
Secretary of the Free Church College Committee, was associated for
more than ten years with         Mr Maclagan in work in which            he had
good opportunity to observe the breadth and the balance of his well

                                     126
 stored mind, the singular wisdom of bis counsel, his sound judgment,
 and practical sagacity.   Mr Maclagan    was for many years a member of
 this Committee, and the Convener of its Finance Sub-Committee by
 which the Committee itself is guided in its administration of College
 property and finance.     Reference is made to this to indicate the great
 business ability, tact, and shrewdness which    Mr Maclagan brought      to
 bear on it.  Mr Maclagan     was also for several years Convener   of  the
 Free Church's Continental      Committee — an office which     had  been
 previously held by Sheriff Jameson, and, later, by Sheriff Cleghom.
 He was an effective public speaker, and never spoke on any question
 of interest but when he had something to say, while his utterances
 were always clear, pointed,    earnest, and telling.    Notwithstanding
 the  engrossment    of business life, he did a good deal of literary
 work, mostly of a biographical kind.         His last effort was a brief,
 but hearty, appreciative notice of his friend the late       Mr Samuel
 Raleigh, written at the request of the Council of this Society.       The
 death of Mr Maclagan was the removal from a wide circle of friends,
and from the Fellows of this Society, of an accomplished Christian
gentleman.     In his able and touching   " Memorial Sketch" of Thomas
 Cleghorn,   "one of his    dearest  and truest friends,"   Mr Maclagan
 wrote of Sheriff Jameson    in  terms singularly applicable to himself     :
— " A mind well cultivated, and always fresh in thought and feeling
— a decision in religious matters, thorough and uncompromising,
 united with a large toleration of the views of others— characterised
him   ; while he was a lover of all good        men, and the blithest    of
companions in hours of relaxation and social fellowship."
     Dr John Alexander Smith.              By Professor Duns, D.D.
    John Alexander Smith was born in Hope Street, Edinburgh, in
June 1818. His father was the late James Smith, a well-known
Edinburgh architect. Mr Smith was educated at the High School
and the University of Edinburgh.        While still  a student he became
a  Fellow of the Royal Physical Society. He graduated in medicine
in 1840, was elected a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of
Scotland in 1847, a Fellow of this Society in 1863, a Fellow of the
Royal College of Physicians       in  1865,  and succeeded the late     Dr

                                                 127
Somerville        in the Treasurership of the College in 1874.                 Dr Smith
began      practice as a physician, and continued in it through life, but
his practice was never large.                Possessed of means sufficient to enable
him to follow          his   tastes    for natural science and archaeology, inde
pendently of professional income, these pursuits became the leading
work of his life.           But his professional brethren were never slow to
acknowledge           his skill in the diagnosis and treatment of disease.
Had circumstances             made    it  necessary    to devote     himself earnestly to
his profession,        it would hardly have           been    possible for him to have
done     half the work he accomplished in the literature of his favourite
studies and        in behalf of     the Societies of which he was a Fellow.
    "When      Dr Smith joined             the   Royal Physical Society it        counted
among       its working Fellows,             Knox, Captain Thomas Brown, Car
penter,    Edward Forbes, Greville, Simpson, Goodsir, George Wilson,
John Coldstream,             Sir  J.    G. DalyelL Charles Maclaren, and, later,
 Robert    Chambers,        John Fleming, Hugh Miller, and others who have
 done good work in Scottish Zoology and Geology.                          Dr Smith suc
 ceeded the late Sir "Wy ville Thomson as its Secretary, an office which
 he    held for more than twenty                 years.    In  addition to his work     as
 Secretary, he contributed many papers to the Society, some of much
 value.      More than a hundred notices of birds, many of them new to
 Scotland,     and some new to Britain, were written by him.                     In  these
 he put    on record      all peculiarities       as to time of visit, plumage,      food,
 &c.     In  the Proceedings of the same Society are between twenty and
 thirty notices       of fishes by him, including           remarks on the divergence
 of some      of the specimens from typical varieties in hermaphroditism,
 and other       highly exceptional           features.     But    he did not   limit his
 observation       to birds and fishes.         Insects, reptiles, and mammals were
 described      with equal interest and skill, while several                mineralogical
 notices    indicate his familiarity          with this branch.         On resigning the
  office  of Secretary       he was elected President, and            in November    1876
  delivered     the address       at the     opening of the 106th Session of the
  Society.       This    address     contains a complete          list of his friend Dr
  Strethill Wright's numerous original papers on Protozoa and Ccelen-
  terata,   and     in  a somewhat incisive           way he states his opinion         of
  Darwinism, and          frankly avows his belief in the doctrine of special
  creation and       in the Bible views of the natural history of man.
       On the 16th of          April     1866    Dr Smith       read   to this Society   a

                                          128
          entitled   " Description of Calamoichthya,           a  New Genus of
 paper
 Ganoid Fish from Old Calabar, Western Africa, forming an addition
 to the   Family Polypterini."       This paper, which is illustrated by         two
 plates,  is published in the Transactions for Session 1865-66.                    It
 affords an exceedingly good         proof of    Dr Smith's ability    as a natur
 alist.    Several specimens of both sexes were examined.               The    char
 acteristics  are precise, and embrace the minutiae of every part, while
 much interesting information           is given concerning the habits and
 food of these forms.
    Dr Smith       also    contributed      papers    to   the  Edinburgh       New
 Philosophical     Journal,      the   Annals      and Magazine      of Natural
 History, and the Journal        of Anatomy.
     Dr Smith was Secretary of the Society of Antiquaries from 1852
 till the time of his death, with the exception of two triennial
 periods,    1870-75 and 1875-78, when he held the office of Vice-
 President.      Between      1850    and    1882,   he   contributed   forty-five
 papers to its Proceedings.        For many      years he acted as joint-editor
 of the Proceedings,       first in association     with his intimate        friend
 David     Laing,   and     afterwards    with    Dr Arthur       Mitchell.      Dr
 Smith's archaeological contributions are all interesting, and many of
them valuable additions to the literature of Archaeology.                     They
illustrate the wide range of his knowledge.                  And all who       were
acquainted     with his conscientious habits of study, with bis devotion
to true scientific method, and with the thoroughness of the investi
gation brought to bear on the subjects              in hand, will not think it
too much to affirm that he         dealt with each of these subjects as if it
only had ever held the chief place              in his thought        His   papers
might be grouped         thus, — Prehistoric Remains, Roman Remains,
Mediaeval     Remains, Antiquarian        Literature, Rock Sculpturings, and
Archaeo-Zoology.         His contributions       to   the last group are very
able and important.         They bear emphatic testimony to           Dr Smith's
great attainments       in Comparative Zoology.             With characteristic
precision he identifies the bones of mammal, bird, and fish, and
skilfully uses the articles found in cave, or grave, or gravel heap in
association   with  them, to serve for deductions touching the         industrial
conditions of the time,        or for supplying      a key to the age of the
deposits themselves      in which they      occur.    He did much, along \rith
others who survive, to apply the recognised              principles of historical

1.   The Objective Cause of Sensation.               Part    III. — The     Sense
              of Smell.        By Prof. John Berry Haycraft.
   The end-organs of the special senses are all built up on the same
type.     The history of their development           from simple ectodermic
cells suggests    that similar agencies have been at work to produce
them.      Both  sapid and odorous       substances,   and indeed all gaseous
and  liquid    molecules,     are now known to be       in constant vibration,
and    this vibration     is more or less characteristic of the substance
examined.
   The above considerations have           led me, for the last five years, to
teach   that, in all probability, it will be possible       to connect     quality
of taste   and smell with the kind of vibrating stimulus, and that it
will  be   possible to demonstrate,     as has already    been done in the case
of sight     and   hearing,     the truth   of this  general    statement  — that
 quality    of sensation will depend (the sensorium being in a normal
 condition)     upon the kind or character of the vibrating stimulus.
 There is nothing       very new in this idea.        Without seeking for its
 germs    at an earlier period, we find it clearly enunciated by both
 Hobbes and Hartley         ;  and in more recent times    Mr Herbert     Spencer
 has   lent the weight of his great authority in the same direction.
 But of experimental proof,         without which we cannot rest content,

nothing has been advanced.            Casual allusions to the probable or
possible relationship between the tastes or smells of bodies and their
chemical    natures are sometimes though rarely found           in the text-books
of physiologists, but nothing more.           While    so much important -work
has been carried on during the last few years by Helmholtz,                Preyer,
Maxwell, Eayleigh, and others, in connection with both sound and
sight, no one,     until quite recently,    has turned his attention to the
investigation of either taste or smell.
    In  a most   interesting and suggestive article in Nature (June 22,
1882), Prof. Ramsay brought forward many facts tending to demon
strate the dependence       of smell upon the vibratory motion of odorous
particles.     He drew attention to          the   fact that many gases and
vapours of low specific gravity — their molecules             vibrating therefore
with great rapidity     — are perfectly     odourless,    and he saw in this an
analogy     to  the   rapid   vibrations of the        ultra-violet rays of the
spectrum,     and the rapid vibrations of an insect's wing, both incapable
of producing any impression on the eye and ear.                 He  also described
classes of substances alike      in chemical and physical         properties,   such
as the alcohols or fatty acids, as having generic smells              ; the higher
 members      of the groups     producing     sensations     more   powerful and
characteristic    than those of the lower ones.         It will  be my endeavour
in the    present   paper   to extend more       fully this inquiry, and to de
 monstrate     by experimental methods         the fact that smell, like sight
 and hearing,     depends    for its production on the vibrations of the
 stimulating medium,       the quality of the sensation depending,             in all
 cases,  upon the kind of vibration which produces it.
    In  a paper read before the     British Association in      1885, and printed
 subsequently in     the Proceedings     of  the Royal Society      of Edinburgh
 (1886),   I was   able clearly to demonstrate       these points for the sense
 of taste.     That paper and the present         one   will  be found to run on
 exactly parallel lines   ; one   is almost a recapitulation of the other, for
 what is true of taste is also true of smell.             In order to    avoid    un
 necessary recapitulation,     I  have touched       lightly   on many questions
 more   fully  discussed  in  the other   paper, which       should therefore be
 consulted.
    An investigation into the       odorous properties of substances          is to a
 certain extent limited, as many of them are without smell, especially
 those found in the inorganic world.            In  a description    of odours one

    1M7.]        Prof.  J. B. Haycraft on    the Sense    of Smell.            209
   is met   with this difficulty, that there is no nomenclature       familiar to
   every one.     Hundreds of terms expressing      the well-known colours of
   familiar objects, enable one to describe by a single term almost any
   tint and shade.      We   have cardinal, rose, magenta, maroon, carmine,
   crimson, scarlet, and a dozen other shades of red alone,             and all of
  these can be expressed        by words.    The smells, however, and espe
  cially those of the chemist's museum, are so unfamiliar, and often              so
   peculiar, that we are forced to speak of them simply as the odours of
  the substances      which produce    them, or to say that they are like,
   though    never identical,   with that of   some other and better       known
  substance.
      Xo   two observers quite agree in their descriptions of a given odour,
  and the information readily at hand in the text-books,               but culled
  from a hundred sources, is therefore        not reliable.      I have,  for this
  reason, availed myself freely of the kindness of my colleague Prof.
  Tilden    and my friend Prof. Ramsay, who have placed at my disposal
  their private collections of chemical       compounds.        In almost    every
 case the description of a smell given in this paper is derived from
 personal observation.
      In  the first place, let us study those few substances found among
 inorganic compounds which have distinct smells.               It is well known
 that many substances, like arsenic, chlorine, sulphur, bromine, and
 their compounds, have characteristic odours.            Can we associate the
 odours of these substances with any chemical or physical properties
 they may possess, and show         that when similar odours        are produced
 by two or       more substances,   then we have some similar chemical           or
 physical property present at the same time          ?
      In  recent years a remarkable discovery of Newlands             has opened
np     a fresh    point of departure    in the science of chemico-physics.
 His    observations    led him to formulate a law which he termed              the
 law of     octaves.   Lothar Meyer, Mendelejeff, and Carnelley, extending
his work,      have shown that the "periodic-law,"       as it is now    called, is
one of vast application and importance.           The nature of this periodic-
law     is now so well known, thanks to the many recent              publications
of Professor Carnelley, that it would        be superfluous     to attempt more
than roughly to sketch out its main            features.    If   we arrange the
elements in the order of their atomic           weights,   beginning with that
which       has the lowest, and passing to that which has the highest, we

 210          Proceedings      of Royal Society of Edinburgh.                    [mat  2,
 shall find  a periodic recurrence of property or function in the series.
The first element is a monad, the second a dyad, the third a triad,
and the fourth a tetrad.           Then we find the fifth        a  triad, the sixth    a
 dyad, and the seventh once more a monad.                   Then follows a second
series of seven elements, showing the same variation                     in atomicity    ;
this repeats itself right through the list of elements.                  This periodic
recurrence    of function is seen not only in the case of atomicity, but
it  may be also observed        in  the atomic volumes, the fusibility and the
electrical and other properties of the elements.                     There is then a
general resemblance         in physical     properties   between the first, eighth,
fifteenth, &c,       and     between       the    second,    ninth,    and    sixteenth
elements.      Mendelejeff has arranged the elements in the convenient
tabular form given on the opposite page, which indicates these and
some other important facts.
    Those elements which resemble               one another,     and which we can
pick out by taking every eighth one from that one from which we elect
to start, form what he calls             " group," and      are arranged
                                       a                                     vertically.
The sets of seven elements each, arranged                horizontally, form twelve
"  series."
    There is yet another point of importance.                    The elements       of a
" group," which       are in an even         "  series," are especially     related to
one another     ;  so  in like   manner      elements    in    an odd series      of the
same group are similarly allied.               Thus Li, Na,      K, Cu, Eb, Ag, Cs,
Au,   have   all these properties         in  common     ;  but in this group Na,
Cu, Ag, Au are most alike, and Li,               K, Rb, and Cs, in like        manner,
are most closely related.
    In  the   paper     to which      I  have    already    alluded    I  was   able to
demonstrate      the fact that elements           in the same group are capable
of producing similar or related tastes.               The power of producing a
given taste is then        a property       which, like the ordinary physical
qualities of the elements, follows the periodic law.                  As will now     be
shown, the same obtains for smell.
    In studying      the facts     of  the case, let us start with Group            VL
We find      here,  in odd      series, three      well-known      substances     whose
compounds       have strong       and    characteristic     odours.     Sulphuretted,
selenietted,   and teluretted hydrogen have all a disagreeable                    odour
like that of rotten eggs.           The compounds          of the elements of this
group with methyl and ethyl are disagreeable                    and alliaceous.       In

  'Group     VIL    chlorine, bromine, and iodine have very similar smells,
   and    so hare the acids       they form with hydrogen, and their com
   pounds with methyl, ethyl, ethylene, &c.              Although similar in all
   cases,   yet they are not the same.        One can   distinguish the odour of
   iodine from that of bromine or chlorine.              It may be described as
   having more flavour, and not so chlorous.          Bromine is like them both,
   having an odour intermediate between the two in quality.                  From a
   study of the above substances, this is seen to hold good in all cases,
    the odour uniformly changing, often to a alight degree, as we pass
   from the lowest to the highest member of a group.               A   very marked
   change is seen      in  the formyle compounds        of Group     VIL     Chloro
   form has a fragrant and characteristic smell.              So has bromoform,
•  but it has something else in addition, which is recognised               as  being
   the odour      of iodoform.      Bromoform thus connects         chloroform and
   iodoform, these latter substances being very unlike one another.
       There may then be so little difference            in the odours of com
   pounds of the same group of elements that they may with difficulty
   be distinguished.        On the other hand, the differences may be great,
   there being intermediate sensations         produced by intermediate mem
   bers    of  the group.     One is forcibly     reminded of the changes           in
    sensation    experienced    in allowing the eye to traverse the spectrum
    from one end towards the other.          In  a  drawn-out spectrum,        only a
    part of which is visible, one passes, say, from orange into yellow,
    and these colours are recognised       as  being different, and at the same
    time alike.       In  a shorter spectrum      the   eye may pass from the
    yellow into the red.         The two sensations      are quite different,     but
    the   orange     is seen to connect      them.      The    importance     of the
    above     statements   — and they    may   be verified    in  the caee     of the
    few odorous compounds          in Group V. — will become apparent when
     they are placed     in juxtaposition with identical facts mentioned in
    the previous paper on taste, and some recent observations of Pro
    fessor Carnelley.
        In  those groups of elements     whose    compounds are sapid, we find
     that the same change in taste sensation        is apparent as we pass from
     lower to higher members of the group.            Let us take     as an  example

    Potassium        fluoride is salt — like common salt in taste.               In  addi
tion    it is slightly saline — like nitre. Chloride of potassium has a
suspicion of a bitter taste as well, and so has potassium bromide.
Potassium iodide has lost the taste of common salt, being                        a saline,
and bitter.
    So far,     then, we have seen that the power of producing                       taste
is a property          or function      of elements.       Our knowledge of matter
is derived        from      its    power of      producing     sensation     within     us.
 In   the   case    of sight and hearing we               have   associated   quality    in
sensation     with     the   kind or    character   of   the vibrating    stimulus.      If
it can be shown that elements belonging to the same                        " group   "
                                                                                        are
capable      of vibrating        in a way which is similar or            related   to one
another, then we have               grounds upon which           to draw an analogy
between smell, taste, sight, and hearing.
    On account          of our incomplete knowledge of the ultra-red and
 ultra-violet regions of the spectrum,              a  final answer to this question
 cannot perhaps be given.               Only rough indications        are to hand, but
 these   point in the same direction.
    The chlorides of the alkaline earths have spectra which are nearly
 related.     The      spectra     of Group     I.  are    not dissimilar,     especially
 potassium and rubidium,             with the   five groups of lines.       Then, again,
 the   chlorides,      bromides, and iodides of calcium and barium are
 similar, the lines shifting          towards the red end of tlie spectrum in a
 way which is nearly proportional to the increase of atomic weight
     The colour of a substance            is an index to the pitch of the vibra
 tions    of   its    molecules.       In    a paper     on the colour     of chemical
  compounds         recently       published     in the      Philosophical     Magazine
  (July 1874), Professor Carnelley demonstrated the                     existence    of a
  relationship     between        the   salts of the       same    group of     elements
  in respect to colour.            The salts, say the chlorides, of a group of

metals may not be of the same colour, but we find that, in passing
to higher members of the group from the lower ones, a uniform
change in colour is to be observed.                                 This    change     is produced by a
gradual shifting                 of the        absorption           towards the         red    end of the

many wave-lengths                     of different pitch.             When       a   metal vibrates, and
one of its vibrations                  falls within the scale of the visible spectrum,
we         shall find the corresponding wave of another member                                       of the
same group in the                      neighbourhood.                If   a     higher member        of the
group,       it     will     absorb          the    light    nearer        the red end     ;   ifa     lower,
nearer the blue end of the spectrum.                                 Together with this alteration
of pitch, we have corresponding alterations in the sensations                                            pro
duced, whether they be of sight, taste, or smelL                                       Whatever reason
we have for associating                      quality of colour with the pitch of vibration,
we shall likewise                 have        for associating             quality of smell and taste
with the same physical cause.*
  Amongst organic substances                            many are so closely allied that they
fall into distinct               classes or groups.                 Thus we have the fatty acids,
alcohols,         &c.      If these be arranged              in homologous           series, commencing
with thai which has the lowest, and passing to that which has the
highest molecular weight,                     a     uniform change will be observed in many
physical properties                   on ascending           the series.         Thus the lower ones
may be gaseous, the middle ones liquid, and the higher ones solid.

 1887.]        Prof.   J.   B. Haycraft         on the Sense     of Smell.            215
    Professor Ramsay examined several of these groups, and came to
the following conclusions             : — In the first     case,  that the smell of       a
group was generic         ;  and, in the second case, that the smell became
more    distinct, and gained in flavour in ascending                 from the lower to
the  higher members.             My     ohservations    are not quite      in  accordance
with the first statement,           for   I do  not believe any uninitiated person
would     find any resemblance,              say, 'between       the odours of ethyl
alcohol    and octyl alcohol, or of acetic                and valeric acids,        -which
would prompt him            in any way to        class them together.         I find that
in ascending the organic series, as in ascending                   one of Mendelejeffs
groups the odour changes.                 This   change   may be slight, so that         it
may he     said with truth that there is a generic                  smell belonging to
the series ; or, more        frequently, the change is         so great   that it is only
by a  study of intermediate members that any continuity of sensation
can be made       out.
    These statements may be verified by a study of the following
tables.     They    are not as complete as          I could    have wished, owing to
my   inability to obtain some of the rarer acids and alcohols.

      The way in which the sensation                changes,      analogous     to that ob
 served    in studying MendelejefFs             groups,       can   in  a  similar way be
  explained on the vibration hypothesis.
      I am  not aware of any odorous              organic series possessing          at  the
  same time colour,       although some of them have very weak absorption
  bands.     From    a   study of these latter,           and from inferences        drawn
  from a study of other coloured series,                   it is   possible   to obtain   an
  insight into the state of vibrational activity of the substances in the
  tables  above.      Dr W.      J.  Kussell      has    investigated the absorption
  bands of ammonia,           alcohol, &c.         These      substances     absorb   light,
  but to so slight an extent that long columns of the liquids have                        to
  be examined before the bands are                    distinctly     seen.    Under these
   conditions, ammonia gives several              distinct and characteristic bands.

If now an         atom   of hydrogen of the ammonia be replaced by methyl,
the    ammonia bands are still visible, but they are shifted somewhat
towards the red end of the                  spectrum.       Replacing the hydrogen by
the larger molecule of ethyl, the bands are seen to pass                          still nearer
to the     end of the spectrum.

     In   the same way we find that common                      alcohol possesses absorp
tion bands, seen also          in  the higher members             of the group, but shift
ing towards the red end of the spectrum in ascending                           the group.

     In  the case      of coloured       acids, such     as chromic and picric acids,
the salts     too are coloured.           If the   bands of these acids be examined,
 and    if they be then         converted       into salts, the absorption         will shift
 towards the red end of the spectrum.                       It  seems that the molecule,
 having a certain vibrational              character depending upon its structure,
 is weighted         by  the added        metal,    the   vibrations      of which do not
 probably appear at all in the visible                spectrum,      and,   in  consequence,
 its pitch     is lowered.       If    an odorous substance            like acetic acid be
 combined        with another odorous             substance,     it is generally possible
 to detect      the two intermingled           sensations     in  the compound.         Ethyl
 acetate    is ethereal and acetous at the same time.                     Allyl sulphide is
 like allyl alcohol, and has the odour                of  a  sulphur compound as well.
 In this case        it is probable that         those   vibrations      in  each substance
 which produce smell are not so much lowered                         in pitch by the new
 substance       with which they          are combined as to change the character
 of the sensations          they are each capable              of producing.        The   am
 monia vibrations are shifted towards the red end of the spectrum                           in
  methylamine,         but not enough          to produce        another sensation.         In
  other compounds          of two odorous          substances     it  may not be possible
  to  distinguish the original odours, and for the reason that the pitch
  has shifted,      as we have    seen      it often    does, so as to produce quite a
  different    sensation.

218            Proceedings     of Royal Society of Edinburgh.                      [mat 2,
     It  may be urged as an objection to some of these conclusions, that
the same odours are often produced by substances,                     chemically speak
ing, quite unlike each other.              Thus benzoic aldehyde smells very
much like nitrobenzene.            In the     case of taste, too, there         are many
examples      of totally dissimilar bodies having indistinguishable acid
or sweet tastes.         In answer      to this objection one has only to re
member that there are instances,             equally numerous, of very different
substances       which    produce    the same colour sensations.                One may
produce      exactly the same     tint with either           a chromate,     a picrate,   or
an aniline       dye.    It  would be strange,           indeed,   if  among     the com
plex vibrations of a compound, or even of an element, some tones
 were not of the same pitch, as some of the vibrations                     of substances
 quite dissimilar in general properties.                When    these tones    fall within
 the scale of the visible spectrum,            the scale of taste, or smell sensa
tions, we have, according to the vibration theory, a similar sensation
 produced.
      In this   paper   I   have endeavoured           to avoid    all questions which
 are matters      of speculation.        I  have      dealt only with already ascer
 tained facts,      or those    which      can     readily be verified.          I  do   not
 attempt to offer any hypothesis to account for the action of vibrating
 matter     on the     olfactory    end-organs.           It  may or may not be a
 mechanical or       a chemical action.        This question is not          raised.     We
 know next to nothing as to how it is that' ether vibrations stimulate
 the cones of the         retina, still less can we guess at the action                    of
 vibrating atoms and molecules              of ordinary matter          on the sensitive
  end-organs     of the nose.     My aim      has been to establish the fact            that,
 just    as we have reason       to connect         differences    in colour sensations
  with differences in the vibration of the ether, so, in like manner we
  have reason to connect differences              in   smells   with   differences    in the
  vibrations which call them into existence.                    This analogy is estab
  lished upon the following grounds             : —
       (1) In passing from the lower to the higher members of one of
  Mendelejeffs groups, such molecular vibrations as have been investi
  gated tend to become lower          in pitch.         At   the same time the       colour,
  taste, and smell sensations        alter in character when present.
       (2) In passing from the lower to the higher members of an

   The noises considered         in this paper are uniform, continuous noises,
such as the     fricatives of articulate speech       : f, 6, s,  e>,  \, &c.  These
sounds are considered          by the author to stand      in a similar relation to
musical tones       as   lights with continuous spectra do to lights with
bright-line spectra.           Methods     were   proposed    for analysing these
uniform     continuous noises, and also for imitating them by synthetic
means.

   By a number of observations            made incidentally      in   the preparation
of two of the double salts referred             to in the heading,        namely, the
compounds        of sulphate of potash with           sulphate     of magnesia     and
sulphate    of ferrous oxide        respectively,   I  had long come to suspect
that these two salts at any rate are not perfectly stable in opposition
to water.      To   settle the question,   I have  caused   Mr James Robson and
Mr Andrew         Hodge, two young chemists working in my laboratory,
to  inquire into the matter          by systematic    experiments.        These were,
in general at least, conducted           according to the following scheme          : —

solved   in a proportion of hot water,* less than sufficient to hold the
intended double salt in solution after cooling ; there was then added
a  known weight of the di-valent sulphate amounting to exactly                     1  or
   *
      In the case of FeS04 the water was acidified      with a few drops of sulphuric
acid to prevent precipitation of ferric compounds.

 1-1 or 1-2     . . . 1-5 times    MgO or FeO        per 1K20       used, the solution
 filtered hot into a basin,          allowed to crystallise, and the crop of
 crystals produced examined.
      The results     were similar   in both    cases, but    I  prefer to state them
 in reference to the magnesia salt, because our experiments in regard
 to it were more exhaustive than those with the iron salt.
     The     crystals deposited     from a solution      containing one or even
 a little more than one MgO             per  1K20     may    look    perfectly normal
 en    masse, but      when examined more closely are invariably                  found
 to    be   contaminated with a powdery               coating which         looks like,
 and indeed substantially           consists    of, sulphate of potash.         As the
proportion       of magnesia       increases,    the relative quantity         of   free
 sulphate of potash         produced gets less and less, and at last vanishes
altogether.         With    1*3,  sometimes      even  with     1*2   times   MgO per
 1K20, we generally obtained normal-looking                    crystals, which con
tained the correct percentage            of water, and consequently consisted,
substantially at least, of the pure, unmixed double salt.
     Similar results were obtained in the case of the ferrous doable
salt ;    in its  case we   determined the percentage of iron (by perman
ganate) as a test for the degree of purity.
     In neither     case, however,     have   I  been able as yet to determine
the exact       conditions under which          a given     solution is sure to de
posit perfectly normal crystals.            Whether or not depends not merely
on the ratio between           the weights of the two bases, but also on the
proportion of water,          the temperature      at which the crystals separate
out, and other independent variables.
     I  refrain from giving any further details,           intending to complete
the investigation, to extend it to other double salts of the magnesia m
series, and also to the alums, and             then to present       a complete     and
detailed memoir.

    This paper     dealt only with     cases   in which the     electromotive
force used    is insufficient to produce     decomposition.    In such    cases
the electrodes act as condensers.        But   the observed law of variation
of current-strength       with time is not exactly that which holds in
the charging    of ordinary    condensers.     The author showed       that the
deviation could be largely accounted          for by the continual increase
of   transition resistance,    the existence     of which he proves        in  a
separate   paper on that subject.

         By W. Peddie, B.Sc.          (Plate    VII.)
    The question of the existence       of true transition resistance at the
 surface   of certain electrodes    in given liquids     has been    in  debate
 for many years, but has never yet been           conclusively settled.     It is
 admitted universally       that in certain cases such resistance           does
 occur, as, e.g.,  when a non-conducting oxide is formed on the surface
  of the metal ;   but the point in dispute is whether or not it occnrj

when no direct chemical action takes             place between           the metal     and
the products of electrolysis, or between            it and     substances       dissolved
in   the liquid.       The great difficulty in all experimental inquiry re
garding the resistance of electrolytes is the difficulty of distinguish
ing between the effects of true resistance                 and    the effects of true
reverse electromotive force of polarization.                 For,   if E   be the direct
electromotive force producing a current                a;   in  a conducting circuit
which includes an electrolyte and has resistance E, while                         e is the
type of the polarization electromotive force, so that 2(e) is the total
reverse electromotive        force, we have
                                    E-2(e) = Ba:.
 But,   if  e  contains   a term   proportional to x, we can write this equa
tion in the form
                             E-2(e')    =
                                           (E + 2(P))z,
where      p is    the constant    of proportionality.         This shows that the
value of the resistance         in  the circuit, as determined by any of                the
ordinary methods, may include a term which does not correspond                           to
a   true resistance      actually existing.      Hence, usually, in measuring
the resistance, polarization is prevented by the use of alternating
 currents — as in Eohlrausch's          method    ;   or an attempt is made              to
 eliminate its effects by keeping it constant while the resistance                         is
 varied—      as  in Horsford's    method.     And, in addition           to this, resist
 ance at the surfaces        of the electrodes      must be distinguished from
 other resistance in the circuit          Attempts have been made to do                this
 by means of measurements             of the  heat developed           at the surfaces;
 but this method is unsatisfactory,         as  there      may be development             of
 heat at the surfaces from other causes than the presence of resistance.
                               Method of Observation.
    In making experiments on             the law connecting current-strength
 and time, when one Daniell cell was placed, along with                       a  galvano
 meter,    in circuit with    an electrolytic cell having platinum electrodes
 and containing a solution of sulphuric acid,               I noticed     that the result
 was very different according as the platinum                 plates had been        newly
 heated to redness or had been left for some hours                  in  the liquid.       In
 the latter case the strength of current at a given time was, e<eteris
paribus, much weaker than in the former                   (see  first series of experi-

ments, and Plate         VII.).     This   was most probably due to alteration
of resistance or to alteration of capacity of the electrodes                  regarded as
condensers.        To   settle   the point,     I used a Helmholtz galvanometer
capable of indicating a current             of the    one ten-millionth        part of an
ampere.       It  was necessary to use an instrument of such sensibility                     ;
for the current, although          it started with a comparatively large value,
very rapidly      fell to     an exceedingly small fraction of its                 original
strength because of polarization.              Evidently      the    initial value of    the
current-strength       is independent of polarization            ;  and this constitutes
the great    advantage of the present            method.        In order     to bring the
first deflection    of   the index on the scale,          it was necessary to shunt
the galvanometer.           Of   course, the deflection       could not be read with
accuracy     for  some     time after joining the             battery in the         circuit
because    of oscillations of       the galvanometer         needle ; but, by proper
shunting, the interval could be made                 as  small     as 10 seconds      when
required.      Readings of the deflection           (to which the current-strength
is  proportional) were taken at short intervals, and the results exhibited
graphically.       The curve drawn through the points so obtained could
easily   be continued        backwards to cut the axis parallel to which
current was measured,           thus giving the initial value.             From this     the
amount of resistance           in the circuit could be obtained.                I did not,
however, actually determine the resistance in this way.                        I obtained
 the curve    for the case when the electrodes had been left unheated for
 some time ;    then   I washed     the plates and heated them to redness, and
 repeated   the experiment         under such conditions as to obtain a curve
 coinciding     practically with the         former.      The results showed that
 in all cases a considerable           additional resistance          had to be placed
 in the circuit to produce coincidence.               This   shows conclusively that
 a   transition resistance        exists;   and also gives          an   estimate    of its
 amount,    for the transition        resistance     must be equal to the resist
 ance added      in   the second case.         It  is necessary to remark that the
 resistance     of the electrolyte was the              same      in both     cases;   and,
 further, its total amount was very small                  in    comparison      with the
 resistance    of the rest of the circuit.             Since only one Daniell cell
 was used, the      liquid   was not decomposed,            and the current-strength
  after two   or three seconds was only of the order of thousandths or
  ten-thousandths       of an ampere.         Hence, although the temperature
  coefficient of the resistance         of the    liquid is    large,   it was quite im-

obtained are shown graphically in Plate             VII.   The series of points
marked a give the results when the plates                  were    newly heated.
Those marked        b give the results when         the plates had been left in
the  liquid for half    an hour after heating and performing the experi

plates were left    in  the   liquid for   a number of hours — about twenty,
more or less.      A Tray-Daniell        cell was used so    as to  give constant
electromotive force.         Half   a minute was allowed to elapse before
taking the first reading.

   These   experiments show that when the            plates   are left      in the
liquid for   a considerable time, some cause produces a great             diminu
tion of current-strength.          This  may be either due to increase           of
resistance    or to decrease      of capacity at the surface      layere where
" condenser-action"      occurs.    The above series of experiment does not
determine    to which cause the diminution is due, since half a minute
elapsed between      starting the current and taking readings          ;  but the
following    series shows that, whether or not there be alteration               of
capacity,   there is great alteration of resistance.      The galvanometer
was shunted, and readings          were taken every    10 sees, after      joining
the battery into the circuit.

   Other experiments         of the same kind were made, and gave nearly
the same result.        So that evidently in the course of 40 hours              a re
sistance   of about 40 or 50 ohms appeared in the circuit.                 The next
point to be determined was whether or not this resistance                   followed
the law    of inverse proportionality         to the surface.     One or two pre
liminary experiments were made, which                  showed that     if the   plates
were    connected     by  a short copper wire for 15 minutes,           all previous
polarization     was discharged,     — at    least so far as the galvanometer
could detect      it.   In what follows         the plates    were  raised   roughly
about one-half out of          the liquid,     so that the transition-resistance
should be approximately doubled               if it follows the above-mentioned
law.     The numbers in this series of experiments cannot be compared
directly   with   those in the first, as the arrangement           of resistance    in
the   circuit was different.

   Other similar       experiments giving much the same results were
made,   but need not be quoted.           Evidently     the resistance is inversely
proportional to the area       of the  plates.

   Experiments were made in which the plates were left half out of
the  liquid for 20 hours.         In  this case a resistance of from 80 to 90
ohms,    roughly, was found.         (The numbers must be given roughly,

 for the apparatus       did not admit of great accuracy, the galvanometer
 being  shunted by       a  wire of very small resistance.)        In two or three
 days the resistance was about 200 ohms.                Once the plates were left
for eleven days, when a resistance of about 250 ohms was observed.
 The process, therefore, goes on slowly for            a  long time.
                              Origin of the Resistance.
    Most   probably the resistance            is due to the condensation, on
 the surface of the electrodes,         of gases dissolved in the liquid.        To
test this,  I  left the plates in air instead of placing them in the liquid.
The resistance      in this     case was    of the same magnitude as before,
and was evidently           due to the condensation of atmospheric gases.
To obtain     a stronger     proof, however,     I placed the plates, after being
heated,   in  an atmosphere        of oxygen for about two hours.         A  resist-
ance was found        in this    case about equal to that which was caused
by leaving the plates in air for twenty hours.                 Leaving the plates
in air for two hours made no appreciable change in resistance.
Next, I connected the plates to the positive pole of a battery of
two Bunsen cells for two minutes, and decomposed                       water with
them,   so that oxygen           was developed      on them.      They were    then
connected     together     for a quarter of an hour to get rid of polarization,
and then a resistance was observed equal to that got by leaving them
in oxygen for two       hours.      Nearly, but not quite, the same resistance
occurred     if  the plates       were joined     to the    negative pole   of   the
Bunsens, so as to develop hydrogen on them.                      There can be no
doubt, then, but that the resistance is due to condensed              films of gas
                        Firmness of the Gaseous Deposit.
    That the deposit clings with excessive             firmness   to the surface of
 the metal, is evident from the fact that nothing but heating to a red
 heat destroyed      the resistance.       No amount of rubbing of the       plates,
 however hard, made any observable              diminution.
                    Specific Resistance of the Films of Gas.
    In order to determine             the specific   resistance  of the deposit,   a
 knowledge of its thickness is necessary.                 Or, if  one  can assume
 that the thickness is the same in different specimens of platinum,
 it might    be obtained from the above             experiments (which can give

  1887.]           Mr W. Peddie on Transition Resistance.                      229
 the value of the product of the specific resistance and the thickness)
 combined with experiments made on the resistance of a very fine
 platinum wire, first,       when newly heated, and, secondly,           when left
 unhealed for some time.             The latter experiments would give the
 value of the ratio of the two quantities mentioned.
    Meanwhile,       if it may be assumed        that the thickness of the con
 densed gases is of the same order as the thickness of condensed
 moisture and gases on the surface              of glass (given by Quincke as
 5(10)-" c.m.—Pogg. Ann., 1859, and Wied. Ann., 1877), the above
 experiments show that the order of the specific resistance is the
 same as that of ordinary dielectrics.
                                       Remarks.
    If the    film of gas had acted      as a  perfect dielectric no alteration of
 resistance would have been perceptible.                The fact that the resist
 ance appeared shows that to a great extent,              if not entirely, the  gas
 assumes the potential of the metal on which              it is condensed.   Given
 that    the   gases do    assume     the  potential     of the electrodes,   it is
 rendered highly probable that the resistance               of the film will alter
 with    the potential;     for the particles of the gas become mutually
repellent because of their similar electric charge, and so tend to alter
 their relative positions       against   the attraction      of the metal.   That
such change of resistance with potential did occur was evident in the
experiments        I made;    for if the  initial  deflection    was obtained after
the   plates were leftunheated for some hours, and was again obtained
after they had been connected for a short time to discharge polariza
tion, it was smaller in the latter case than in the former, showing
that    the gas had not yet assumed             its previous physical condition.
Again,      if   the  deflections    be   got   as before,      and the plates   be
heated and an equal resistance             put in circuit     (so as to obtain the
same initial current), and the deflections again be taken, the rate
of  decrease of current        with time is always somewhat greater in the
former     case    than in the latter. This might be due to alteration
of resistance with potential, for the potential of the plates increases
with time after the battery is joined in. On the other hand, it
might     be due to alteration of capacity.

chemical and physiological point of view) of the various problem
atical organs of the Invertebrata will throw much light on their
physiology and their relationship to the Vertebrata, these investiga
tions have been undertaken with that object in view.

officinalis is a true pancreas, and not               a    liver (Proc. Boy. Soc

                     A. (I.) Nephridium of         Cephalopoda.
    Taking a fresh Sepia officinalis as a type of the Cephalopoda, it
was found that its nephridia are true kidneys, or renal organs.
The venous blood,        as  it passes from the vena cava, is distributed          by
a number of afferent branchial vessels which communicate                    with the
 sacculated     and glandular       chambers     (the     nephridia).     The blood
 passes to the gills and then back to the heart.
    After dissecting      the nephridia      from the bodies of several         fresh
 cuttle-fishes,   the secretion    of  these glands was found to be acid to
 litmus     paper,   the   liquid   deposits,    upon standing a short          time,
 earthy matters.       These earthy deposits were submitted to chemical
 analysis.      They are insoluble in distilled water, but readily soluble
 in  acetic acid.     On neutralising a portion of the acetic acid solution
 with ammonium hydrate, and then adding ammonium oxalate,                            a
 white precipitate was obtained,          indicating the presence of calcium.
 Another portion of the acetic acid solution was neutralised, and to
 the neutral solution        silver nitrate added       :   a yellowish   precipitate
 was    obtained.      To another portion of the solution, ammonium
 hydrate was       added until alkaline, and to this alkaline solution a

the    production        of    a  white   precipitate       of ammonio-magnesium
phosphate.         The presence      of phosphoric acid in the earthy deposits
was   confirmed by using the ammonium molybdate and the uranium
nitrate    tests.      Therefore, it must be concluded that these earthy
deposits     consist of calcium phosphate.                   No calcium carbonate,
magnesium         carbonate,     nor any other compound was found in the
deposit

    The   liquid portion of the           secretion    of the nephridia            was ex
 amined by two separate methods             : —
    (o) The clear       liquid from     the nephridia (after the separation               of
 the calcium       phosphate) was treated with a hot dilute solution of
 sodium hydrate, then on adding hydrochloric                      acid, a slight flaky
 precipitate is obtained ; and on examining                   these flakes     under the
 microscope,     they were seen to consist of small crystals in rhombic
 plates,  prismatic needles, and stellar-shaped                crystals.    On treating
 the   secretion     with alcohol,      the   rhombic       crystals are deposited         ;
 these crystals     are soluble in water.       "When these crystals are treated
  with nitric acid, and          heated   gently with ammonia,               the    reddish
  purple  murexide       [CgH4(NH4)N606]         is obtained, which was found
  crystallised  in   prisms.

    (b) Another       method was applied to the clear liquid secreted                 by
the    nephridia.        The   liquid     was   hoiled  in distilled      water,    and
evaporated       carefully    to dryness.        The   residue so obtained was
treated    with    absolute     alcohol, and filtered.          Boiling water was
poured upon the residue             on the filter paper,      and to the aqueous
nitrate an excess of acetic acid was added.                     After standing        6}
hours, crystals of uric acid were deposited,               and recognised        by the
chemico-microscopical tests already mentioned                  above.     Further,     it
was found that there was a small quantity of uric acid                   in the blood
of the vena cava, before           it  entered    the nephridia   ;  but the blood
after passing into the branchiae             contains no uric acid.       From these
reactions,     the secretions     of the nephridia        contain uric acid and
calcium phosphate,          and prove that the nephridia of the Cephalo
poda    are true renal        organs     gotting rid of the nitrogenous waste
matters,     in  the form    of uric     acid, contained   in  the pure blood as it
 is brought to these organs (nephridia) by the vena cava.

              The secretions of the " salivary glands of the Insecta (Orthop-
        tera)    were investigated by taking                    as an example           the Periplaneta
        orientalis (cockroach).
           The salivary glands of Periplaneta                       are situated on each side                  of
        the     oesophagus        and crop,           and extend posteriorly as far as the
        abdomen.        They are about                \   of an inch in length, and composed
        of acini (fig.       3,    b).     Accompanying             the glands are two salivary
        receptacles,     one on either side                of   the crop.         A    quantity of the
        secretion    was extracted by crushing about sixty glands of freshly
        killed    cockroaches.           It   was alkaline         to test-papers.             A   portion of
        the secretion      was added             to   a   small quantity of starch, the starch
        being converted into glucose sugar in                      12   minutes.        The        presence of
        sugar was proved by the formation of red cuprous oxide by the
        action of Fehling's solution.
                    portion of the secretion was distilled (with the utmost
              Another
        care) with dilute sulphuric acid and to the distillate ferric chloride

cyanates.       The inorganic constituent,        as far  as  I  could make out,
consists     only of calcium    phosphate.
    Turning     once more to the soluble zymase (ferment) contained              in
the secretion,     it  can be isolated by precipitating the secretion         with
dilute phosphoric acid, adding lime-water, and filtering.                The pre
cipitate was dissolved in distilled water, and then reprecipitated by
alcohol.      This precipitate converts      starch into glucose sugar.
                                                                              Acinus.

    Fie.  3. —a  and  I, Salivary gland of Periplanda oricnialis (much enlarged).
     I  have    already mentioned        that the secretion       of the salivary
 glands of Periplaneta         are alkaline.    Out of 80 animals,     I  found    4
 with the       secretion    decidedly acid.      This acid property is most
 probably due to pathological          changes    in the   secretion  of the said
 four animals.
     The largest quantity of diastatic or         " soluble " ferment   was to be
 found    in the    secretion   obtained from the glandular portion of the
  organ and     not from the salivary receptacles (fig.       3, a).
     The salivary glands of Helix aspersa              (snail) yielded a soluble
  ferment, capable       of converting starch into glucose sugar.              The
  ferric-chloride    test failed to show the presence of sulpho-cyanates.
  The mineral      ingredients found Were calcium and chlorine             ; but   I

236             Proceedings     of Royal Society of Edinburgh,                [mat  16,
could not detect the presence of phosphates                  or   carbonates    in the
salivary glands of Helix.
    Therefore, from these investigations, the salivary glands of the
Insecta and Gasteropoda            are similar in       physiological     function to
the salivary glands of the higher animals.

     I  have already proved the so-called            " liver " of the    Cephalopoda
 is a true pancreas          (Proc.    Roy.     Soc.  Edin., vol. xiii. No.       119,
 p. 120).
     The secretion       of the " liver " of Astaais fluviatilus when fresh
 gives an acid reaction.
     (a) The secretion of the organ acts upon starch paste.                        The
 starch granules disappear with the exception of their celluloid
 covering     ;  and on treating with water, and then adding Fehlings
 solution, sugar in the dextrose form was obtained.
     (b) The secretion       forms an emulsion with oils and fats yielding
 subsequently fatty acids and glycerol.
     (<•)  The action of the secretion upon milk was to render it trans
  parent.
     (d) When a few drops of the secretion of the organ were ex
  amined with chemical reagents under the microscope, the following

reactions        were observed           :   — On running              in between the side and
cover-slip a solution of iodine in potassium iodide, a brown deposit
was obtained, and on running in concentrated                                nitric acid on anotber
slide containing          a drop or two of the                    secretion,   a yellow coloration
was formed, due to the formation                              of xanthoproteic acid.                 These
two reactions show the presence                          of albumen in the secretion of the
organ       in question.
      (e)   The soluble         ferment was extracted                    according to the Eistia-
kowsky method                 (Pfi tiger's        Archiv      fiir      Physiologie,       vol.    ix.    pp.
438-459).               The     ferment           converts        fibrin   into    leucin         (o-amido-
caproic acid, C6H13N02) and tyrosin (oxyphenylamidopropionic                                             acid,
C8HnNO,).
    (/)       No glycocholic         and taurocholic acids could be detected                               by
the    Pettenkofer            and other tests.               No glycogen          was found         in the
organ or        its secretion.
    (j) The secretion contains about                         5   per cent, of solids.
    (h) The secretion contains leucin and tyrosin.
    Similar reactions were obtained with the secretion of the pyloric
coeca
              " liver "       of Periplaneta             orientalis, which substantiate and

IAcad. Roy. de Belgique, xli. 1874), Hoppe-Seyler, and others.
    The secretion of the so-called                       " livers " of Helix          aspersa,      Limax

Lumbriew terrestris          all yield similar reactions to                               those     of the
secretions
                        "
                  of the liver " of Astacus Jluviatilis.
      From these         investigations the conclusions to be drawn are, that
                          " livers " of the
the         so-called                        Gasteropoda, Lamellibranchiata,

their secretions          are more           like   the secretions         of the pancreas of the
 Vertebrata than the secretions                     of   a   liver.
      In conclusion,      I     may say that the present work                     will    be continued
 on other       problematical organs of the Invertebrata, and their analogy

nephridia, place the longitudinal                 tube in communication with the
exterior;       these openings         are close behind the upper ends of the
2nd to the       5th uncinigerous tori respectively            ;   the 1st uncinigerous
torus being       in the 5th    somite.        The longitudinal tube is continued
backwards on each side through somites 10-13, representing                                four
more      coalesced     nephridia      ;   but in this region there are neither
internal nor external openings,                 nor any loops similar to those in
the more        interior region      ;    the longitudinal     tube     is simple, almost
cylindrical,       showing     slight indentations           between       the    successive
somites,     which mark where the successive nephridia have coalesced.
The outer        side of the whole longitudinal              tube     is in contact with
the ventral       longitudinal muscles, while the upper and inner side is
 beneath the        oblique muscles.          The internal openings           already men
 tioned     are    situated immediately behind the notopodial                       fascicles
 of sete    of somites 5-8 inclusive.               The longitudinal         tube   extends
 into the 5th somite, but           I could not find there          an external opening.
 Behind the         1st to the 4th somites are traces of incomplete                    septa,
 of   which that behind the 4th is the most complete.                          Attached to
 the   front of the latter septum is a nephrostome,                      but    I  could not
 trace any      connection between this and the part of the tube in the
  5th    somite.       There are two             other well-marked          nephrostomata
 attached      to the septa behind somites             2 and     3, and    these openings
 lead into      tubes seen in somites          3  and 4.     I could not find       external
  openings     in the two latter       somites.      There are thus eleven nephridia
  represented      altogether,  — three rudimentary, in             somites 3, 4, 5 ; four
 perfect,    in somites 6-9      ;  and four imperfect,        in somites 10-13         ;   the
 eight     posterior being         all     in communication,          their    distal   parts
  having fused        to form a longitudinal           tube.      This is the first        case
  in which       such a longitudinal           coalescence    of nephridia has been
  discovered, and its morphological similarity                     to the     condition in
  Vertebrates is obvious.

3.   On the       Discharge      of Albumen          from    the    Kidneys of
        Healthy People.          By Prof. Grainger Stewart, M.D.
    Great diversity of opinion exists         as  to the frequency of the       oc
currence of albuminuria        in healthy people, and elaborate          inquiries
have led     different observers      to  conspicuously contradictory         con
clusions.    Posner has said that his observations             satisfy him that
traces of albumen exist       in every normal urine, and may           be demon
strated   if sufficiently  delicate methods       are employed.       One of the
most distinguished authorities on the subject,            Dr Senator of Berlin,
says that his observations supply good reason              why he should con
sider it not improbable that,         if we  were to examine      the urine     for
long periods     at different hours of the day, and with great care, we
should sooner or later find it to contain albumen in the            case  of every
healthy man.        Dr Kleudgen, in the          course of a special     study of
albuminuria      in relation   to epilepsy,    came to the conclusion         that
traces   of albumen could be demonstrated               in any urine above        a
certain degree of concentration.           Dr  de la Celle de Chateauboun:
found albumen in the urine of 592 out of 701 healthy people whom

 1887.]       Prof. G. Stewart on Albumen from, Kidneys.                          241
 he examined,    that is in 84 per cent.         Dr Capitan found that         among
 98  French soldiers 44 or 44       9 per cent,   had albuminuria.         Professor
 Lenbe, on the other hand, found among 119 German soldiers                      whom
he    examined     that only 4 per cent, showed albumen on rising in
 the   morning,    and 16 per cent, in the forenoon            after   a   march     of
 several  hours'     duration.    Dr Van Noorden         states that he'found        it
vary under different conditions among healthy German soldiers from
 3 to  35 per cent.       Dr Munro found albuminuria in             24 out of 220,
that is in 10-9 per cent., presumably healthy people                 examined      for
life insurance      in  the United    States    of America.       And Dr Leroux
found    it only      19   times   among     330 children,       or   in   5'76    per
cent
    Such contrariety of results        made me      think it    desirable    to make
 a  fresh series    of observations      upon this point, with the view of
 determining (first) whether Posner is right in saying that albumen
is present   in  every urine ; (second) what proportion of presumably
healthy people have albumen           in the urine in quantity sufficient for
 demonstration by the tests ordinarily         in use ; and (third) what effects
various  physiological conditions, such        as diet, exercise, severe    exertion,
and cold   bathing, produced upon the discharge.
   I have,   with the aid of Dr       Stevens, made some experiments             with
the view   of determining the first of these questions, and have tried
to repeat  Posner's observations.          I do  not feel sure that our results
were   absolutely satisfactory,     but the conclusion to which          I am led   in
the meantime      is that albumen,     if present at all in normal urine, is        in
such   extremely minute amount            as to be   barely discernible, or not
discoverable at all,     with  the most delicate tests, even after consider
able concentration.       The minute trace which appears sometimes to be
present  is probably accounted for by the epithelial and other cellular
elements   from the urinary passages which are present               in   greater   or
less  amount   in   every urine.
   With the view of obtaining evidence             as  to the second       question,
that   is the proportion       of presumably healthy           people who have
albumen    in their urine in quantity sufficient for demonstration by
the tests  ordinarily in use, I have examined, with the assistance of
Dr Stevens and Mr Boddie, several series of presumably healthy
individuals.     By    the kindness of      Dr Mills    and  Mr Fayrer, medical
officers  of Edinburgh        Castle, and of the Colonel and          Adjutant of

 242         Proceedings     of Royal Society of Edinburgh.                  [jcti    6,
 the Seaforth Highlanders,        I was   enabled to examine a series of 205
 soldiers and applicants for admission to the army.
    I also got specimens of urine from 74 healthy male adults                engaged
in civil employments.         By the kindness of        Dr Sinclair    and his    resi
dent assistant     Dr Helme,      I examined      80 healthy inmates of         Craig-
lockhart Poorhouse       ;  and by the kindness of          Dr Halliday      Douglas
and   Mr Munro,      I had opportunity of examining the urine of a               large
number of the inmates of the Orphan Hospital.                     We   had thus      in
all 407 presumably       healthy individuals, with regard to            whose urine
we made the most           careful   examination, sometimes         on   one, some
times on several occasions.
    The plan of testing adopted was in all             cases   the  same.      Urines
which were cloudy from any cause were carefully filtered.                       Thos
which were clear were tested          as passed.     Each    specimen was      tested,
first with nitric acid by the contact method, by which,                  as previous
experiment had shown,           we    could discover       albumen in       the    pro
portion of 0"003 per cent., or 0*0131          1 of a grain per ounce       ; and by
picric acid, using the contact method,            by which we could          discowr
albumen     in the proportion of 0"00015 per cent., or 0-0006555                   of a
grain per      ounce.     Each     specimen     was also     carefully    tested    for
 peptones,    using Fehling's solution by the contact              method,     a plan
whiqh certainly shows the presence of peptones very distinctly                   when
they are added to urine, and probably is a reliable test in                   cases of
peptonuria.
   Taking specimens         of urine passed by 407 presumably                 healthy
individuals,    during the forenoon or about             midday, we found          that
albumen was present in 129, ora little over 31*7 per cent                    Of  these
it was   in quantity sufficient     to be discovered      by the cold nitric       acid
test in 66, in lesser quantity       in 63.     In Table I. the    greatest    results

  consider these groups               separately.     Among the soldiers and recruits
  examined,       205       in number,     77, or 37-56 per cent., had albuminuria;
  while of 74 adults in              civil employments,        8, or between 10 and 1 1 per
  cent, showed the symptom.                    Of the former group it            was shown by
  nitric acid in 47, or 22*92 per cent.; by the picric acid only in 30, or
  14*63    per cent             Of  the latter group      it  was shown by nitric acid          in

    In seeking to             compare the facts       in    the case of children and old
 people,    I thought           it desirable to    get access to individuals          in similar
position     in life, and living under somewhat similar conditions, and                          I
was    glad to avail myself of the opportunity afforded                          of examining
the   inmates of Craiglockhart                Poorhouse.         We got specimens of the
urine    of 40      men, about or above             sixty years of       age,   resident in the
poorhouse,        but not         on the sick list.     I found      that albumen was pre
sent   in 27 of         them, that is      in  67-5 per cent           We     also examined a
series   of 40 children under puberty, and found that it was present
in 7, or    in   17-5 percent.            Nitric acid    showed      it in  9, that is   in  22-5
per cent, of the old men.                  Picric acid in other         18, or 45 per cent.      ;
while in the children nitric acid showed it in 2, or                          5 per cent, and
picric acid      in other         5, or 12-5 per cent.
    When these results are shown in a tabular form, we see at                           a glance
how    striking is        the contrast      between the two groups.
    It  thus appears that of the four groups the old men in the poor
house     showed albuminuria                most    frequently, the soldiers next, the
children in the poorhouse                  next, and the least frequently apparent
were the young men engaged                   in civil   occupations.

    It was not in my power to determine                 the cause of the albumin
uria in the persons         examined,      but    I  took care to exclude     cases  of
the accidental accumulation of mucus or pus in the urinary tract,
and have included only four, viz., two soldiers and two of the old
men.      In   none of the cases was the albuminuria               due to cardiac or
pulmonary diseases, and in very few was there occasion                     to suspect
the existence       of Bright's disease.          On the other hand, there were
few cases whose          clinical history corresponded           to Pavy's cyclical
albuminuria or Moxon's albuminuria of adolescents.
    Being anxious to supplement these observations,                   I asked   two of
my former assistants,          who are well known            to  me as careful and
accurate     observers,    Dr James Ritchie and Dr Graham Brown, to
give me the results       as to albuminuria met with in the last 200 cases
which had been proposed for insurance in the two companies for
 which they are medical referees.             The tests employed had been heat
or cold nitric acid, and it was found that in one series of 200, 5 per
cent, showed albumen, and in the other series only                    1 per cent    did
so.    The former result corresponds            pretty closely to what nitric acid
revealed in my own series of young men following                 civil employments,
but is considerably below the             results brought out by Dr Munro in
his American statistics.             The   second     series gives   a  much lower
percentage.
    It is interesting to compare the results obtained in my other cate
gories   with those given           by other observers.        Leube found, among
German soldiers examined during the forenoon and after marching,
16 per cent, albuminuric.             Van Noorden,       at the same time of day,
found it in 35 per cent.             Capitan found it among French soldiers
44-9 per cent., and       I   have found     it among the Highlanders (includ

     The Craiglockhart children gave a result less favourable than that
 obtained by Leroux, for while he found albuminuria in only 576
 per cent.,    I  found it in    17-5»
     I   am not aware      of the publication of any series of observations
 on old men corresponding to my Craiglockhart series.
    In    answer,    then, to our second question,          it  appears that a trace of
albumen may be discovered               by delicate     tests    in  the urine    of nearly
 1 in 3 of the male population,            if it   be examined during the active
period      of the forenoon,        an hour or two after breakfast,               although
 before breakfast the proportion would be considerably smaller.
    The third question is as to the effects produced by diet, exercise,
severe exertion, and cold bathing upon the discharge                       of albumen.
    In order     to determine      the effects of diet,      I   obtained specimens of
the urine of 32 soldiers before             and after breakfast,          and found that
of these 15, or 5-625          per cent., had albuminuria               on rising     in the
 morning     ;  while 13, or 40-525 per cent, showed it after the moming
meaL        Thus,     8 who had not had albuminuria                     in   the   morning
acquired     it after   breakfast.
    Among the 40 old men examined in Craiglockhart                          Poorhouse we
find that 15, or 37-5 per cent,              showed      albuminuria        before   break
fast   ;  while after that     meal 27, or 67*5 per cent, showed                 it    Thus
 12   who had not had albuminuria on rising                 in   the morning acquired
it after breakfast
    Among the 40 children we find that 5, or 12'5 per cent, showed
it before breakfast, and 17, or 17*5 per cent., showed                     it after  break
fast.     Thus    2 who had not albuminuria               on rising      in the morning
acquired     it after   breakfast.      Among 48 boys, inmates of the Orphan
Hospital, we found that before breakfast albumen was present in                           7,
or 14-6      per    cent.  ;  after breakfast,       in    10,    or   20-83    per    cent.
Taking the four groups             together,     we have       a   series of 160       cases
examined before and after breakfast,               and we find that of these, 32,
or 20 per cent,          discharged     albumen before breakfast             ;   while 57,
or 30-5 per cent., showed           it afterwards.
    I  have put these various results            in  a  tabular form, which shows
very clearly that at all ages, and            in  the various conditions investi
 gated, the    taking of breakfast is followed by an increased frequency
of albuminuria, but that the increase is greatest among the old men
and soldiers.

     In connection with this it is worthy of notice that in                 most of the
cases of after-breakfast albuminuria                the quantity of albumen was
too minute to be shown by the cold                   nitric   acid test, and also that
when it was present           before,   it   was generally increased         in amount
after    the   meal    But,     on   the    other hand, there          were two      cases
among the children         in which breakfast           was followed      by the disap
pearance of albuminuria which had been present on rising.                          I have
met with facts       corresponding to this in some of my albuminuric
 patients.      A  gentleman who is at present                under my care shows
 copious albumen in the morning urine, and a comparatively small
quantity after breakfast
     Contrary to what one might expect, considering what is usually
taken for breakfast, as compared with what is taken for the other meals,
 it  appears that breakfast more frequently induces albuminuria, or an
 increase of albumen,        than the other meals.             As to the explanation
of the influence of food in this respect,              it is difficult to    speak posi
 tively.      I shall not at   present seek to determine whether an altera
 tion of the blood, or the blood pressure, or of the vascular walls, or
 epithelial structures,     is at fault.      It   may also be remarked         that the
 mucin in the urine also increases               after food, although not to the
 same extent.
     The next point investigated was the effect of muscular exercise
 on albuminuria.        It   appeared      desirable    to distinguish between          the
 effects of moderate exercise          and of severe and prolonged exertion.
 Observations were therefore made upon soldiers before and after
their weekly march of seven to ten miles, and before and after the
 fatigue duty of coal-carrying.

1887.]             Prof. G. Stewart on Albumen from Kidneys.                              247
     Of 63 soldiers about to start for their weekly march of from seven
to ten     miles in heavy marching order, 18, or 29 per cent., were found
to have         albumen in their urine.            After their march         the urines of
58     of these men were examined,                 and 11, or 19 per cent., showed
albumen.              The march out,         therefore,     distinctly diminished          the
albuminuria.             But   as the march is taken      in  the forenoon,      it  occurred
to me      that some of those who got rid of their tendency during the
march might have had a temporary albuminuria                          induced by break
fast.      I therefore examined the urine             of 32 soldiers before breakfast,
after breakfast, and on their return from the march.                         It   was found
that before           breakfast albumen         was     present    in  5, or    15-623     per
cent.;      after      breakfast in 13, or 40-625 per cent.              ;  and after the
march       in   9, or 28-125 per cent.          It was noticed also that          in  several
cases     the amount of albumen diminished, although                    it did not wholly
disappear.            It  was thus shown that        in  a  considerable proportion of
cases     the march removed            the dietetic albuminuria, and other obser
vations       which      I   have made     justify  the conclusion that the march
 oat exerts         a favourable influence.         It   must, however,        be observed
 that   in some cases the march induced albuminuria.                       In   one    of the
 nine cases         it occurred only after the        march, the urine having been
quite free        from albumen on rising and after breakfast, and in at least
 one     other       case    the amount of albumen was distinctly                  less after
 breakfast than            it  was after the march.          It  is thus clear that the
 effort     of marching is sufficient to induce the symptom in some
 people.
     But while marching proved on the whole beneficial,                         the fatigue
 duty of coal-carrying brought out a very different result.                      This work,
 as  carried on        in Edinburgh Castle,       obliges two men to carry a bucket
 wntaining 80 lbs. of coal for several hundred feet up                      a  rather steep
 incline, and then up barrack stairs to the different floors.                      Each pair
 of soldiers makes            six or seven such journeys during the forenoon in
 which they are told off to this duty.                    Of    36 soldiers engaged         in
 this work we found that 16, or 44 per cent., had albuminuria                           before
 the labour commenced              ; while 23, or 64 per cent., had albumen at the
 end of      it.     On another day, when we were able to get the urine of
  17  men engaged            in this coal-carrying,     7  had albuminuria, equal to
 a  little over 41 per cent, although the observations were made, not
 at the end,        but in the course of their work.

     From the facts thus given it is shown that violent exertion may
produce albuminuria, while                 moderate      exercise tends rather        in  many
cases to diminish it.              Statements     have been made as to the urine of
the performers of pedestrian                  feats which confirm this experience.
Weston's urine is said to have contained both albumen and tubecasts
at the end of one of his prolonged walks.
     A   very interesting observation                has    been    made      by   Dr   "W.  A.
Stirling,      in  a thesis      sent    in for    the   M.D.     degree      this  year,   and
he     has permitted          me to make          use of     it on this       occasion.      He
 found in the course of an investigation as to the incidence of albu
 minuria in 369 boys, who are being educated in the training-ship                             at
 Grays, Essex, that the boys who played wind instruments in the
 band exhibited albuminuria                 in  a  much larger proportion than the
 others.       Thus, while, out of 64 boys so employed,                      38, or 59-4    per
 cent., had albuminuria, out of 305 boys, otherwise under like con
 ditions, but not in the band, only 39, or 12-8 per cent, showed the
 symptoms.
     These results may, as he remarks, be very naturally referred to
 altered blood pressure due to habitual use of musical instruments.
     "With the view of testing this,                 I   examined 24 boys who play
  wind      instruments        in    the band of the Orphan              Hospital,     and 24
 boys    in that Institution who             are otherwise similarly placed, except
  in not being          members        of the band.         It  appears,      so far   as their
  numbers serve us for the purpose,                     that albuminuria is more fre
  quent among         the band boys than among the others, but that there
  is a diminution        rather than increase at the end of an hour's practice

         Some years ago            Dr       George Johnson of London                          drew attention to
    the fact       that albuminuria is sometimes induced by cold bathing.                                                 In
    order to get some              information upon this question,                            I got          the urine of
    21    boys passed on rising at 6 A.M., and that passed at 8 after a cold
    plunge       bath.        It   was found that when, before bathing, 4, or 19 05
    per cent.,       showed albumen, after it 5, or 23 -8 per cent., showed it.
         Among the             boys so examined only a small                                       number showed
    albuminuria,            and the amount of albumen was slight, for nitric acid
    failed     to detect       it,     but there was an increase                           both in the number
    of    cases     affected       and in the intensity of the                              condition, although
    the effect      was not very pronounced.

of albumen and serum-albumen.           With    regard   to the occurrence of
peptones,   we discovered      them in only      3  out of the whole series
of 771 specimens which were carefully examined in the course of
the investigations.
   From the facts recorded, we soem entitled to conclude —
   1.  That albuminuria      is much more common           among   presumably
healthy people than was formerly supposed, being demonstrable by
delicate tests  in nearly one-third of    those examined.
   2.  That there    is no sufficient proof that albumen is normally
discharged   from the human kidneys.
   3.  That the frequency of albuminuria increases as life           advances,
being rare in children and young adults, and common in              men at or
above sixty years of age.
   4.  That it is more common         among    those whose    occupations in
volve arduous bodily exercise than among those who have easy work.
   5.  That   albuminuria     frequently    follows    the taking    of food,
especially  of breakfast.
   6. That moderate muscular effort rather diminishes than increases
albuminuria, except in rare      cases.
   7.  That violent or prolonged exertion often induces albuminuria.
   8. That cold bathing produces or increases         it in some individuals.
   9.  That the existence of albuminuria is not of itself a sufficient
ground for the rejection of      a proposal   for life insurance.
   10. That    the discharge     of peptones     from the kidneys is exceed
ingly rare in the presumably healthy.

known as the          Moray Firth,      and this part of the map was accordingly
left blank.           The general       distribution of salinity      is as follows    : —
Water with more               than 3*55 per cent, of salts in solution comes in
from the        Atlantic between         the Orkney and Shetland          Islands   ; the
centre      of the North Sea is filled with water with over              3 "50 per cent,
of dissolved        salts  ;   while to the south and all round the coasts fresher
water is       found.       The line of 3'50 salinity was found to approach
the Scottish         coast at Berwick and again at Peterhead, hut between
 these     it swept out in         a  wide curve to the north-east.          There were
 no available         data by which the German Hydrographic Office could
 determine        whether the Moray Firth was in the area of water over
 or under       3'50 per cent, salinity.

  presented by       Dr Gibson and    me.    The present    paper is merely in
  tended    to summarise      the results,  and point out some of the more
  general bearings of these observations.
      The  Moray Firth.— This         great  bay possesses a very interesting
  configuration.       The northern shore (Caithness) is rocky and steep ;
  depth increases rapidly to over 20 fathoms, and then remains as a
 broad submarine plateau, extending southward and eastward at an
  average distance of 25 fathoms beneath the surface.              The western
  shore is shallow, the slope       for some miles from land being slight         ;
 and the same remark applies to the western half of the south coast
 (Morayshire)      ;  the eastern half of this coast (Aberdeenshire) is again
 rocky, with deeper water close to.          A  tongue-shaped   depression rone
 in from   the north-east along the southern portion of the firth, forming
 a deep   furrow in the plateau-like sea-bottom.          This has a maximum
 depth of 100 fathoms in a hole 10 miles north of Troup Head, and
 brings water over 30 fathoms deep            as a very   narrow trough a con
 siderable    distance    west of Burghead, and close to the south shore.
     Isolated observations      at various times had shown that the salinity
 of the great mass of water in the Moray Firth approached               3-50 per
 cent, very nearly.        The density (at 15°-56 C.) corresponding to this
proportion of dissolved salts is 1-0260, and the density usually
found for both bottom and surface water by             Dr Gibson in   1883, and
by me in 1886, was from 1-0257 to 1-0259.                The agreement     of ail
the observations        taken at intervals during three years is remarkable,
and indicates that beyond the distance of a few miles from land the
influence of the variations of weather (rainfall particularly), from one
season to another, on the salinity is very insignificant.         Temperature
observations      naturally do not agree so closely, for one season may
easily be a few weeks        in  advance of another, or behind     it ; and the
fact that the temperature         is a few degrees higher or lower at any

given date than it was at the same date in some other year is of
trifling   importance.              What must      be compared,        with regard to varia
tions of temperature                 at one place, is not the             absolute    degree      of
¦warmth     at a particular depth, but the vertical distribution of warmth
and the annual changes of this in form and amount.

    An   observation  made off Dunbeath Castle (further north than the
  Ord), in 10 fathoms, gave temperature            of 52-5 at the surface, and
 52°-0   at bottom.     Excepting       this sounding, the observations of
 temperature    showed a warm layer falling          from 55° or more at the
 surface to 52° at 6 fathoms on the Caithness coast, and at 12 fathoms
 on the Morayshire      side.     The minimum bottom temperature                  was
 50°-5  just  on the verge      of the deep trough off Burghead.               Plate
VIII., fig.  4, shows graphically the distribution         in this  section of sur
 face and bottom density, and of temperature            at surface, 5 fathom?,     10
 fathoms,   and bottom.      In  the depression     off Troup Head, at a depth
 of 50 fathoms, an observation on August              23rd gave a temperature
of 540,8 on the surface and 50°"4 on the bottom.                The lowest tem
perature of the trip was found on August 10, at the bottom                    of  the
 depression   off Covesea     Skerries, in 33      fathoms,     the   thermometer
reading being 49°-5.       A   section made from       Fort  George to this point
 (30 miles) showed a perfectly horizontal and parallel arrangement                  of
the isotherms of 50°-5, 51°, 51°-5, 52° and 52°-5, contrasting with the
dip to southward in the north-and-south section.
    During the month of August the sea temperature                    on the west
coast of Scotland was 52°-5, from surface to bottom,               off the  Mull of
Cantyre, and in the Arran Basin, 53° or 54° on the surface, falling
to 47° -5 or 48° at 30 fathoms.            The Moray Firth thus appears to
have been warmer than the western waters during this period.
    The observations     made     in   1883,   although not very numerous,
are sufficient to show that the bottom water was practically of the
same salinity then as       in 1886; while        the   surface water near        the
entrance    of the Inverness Firth          was  much fresher       at the earlier
date.     This is quite    as might be expected,          since   the summer        of
1886 was exceptionally dry          in  the north-east of Scotland, and the
rivers and streams were unusually low.
    Taking into consideration the facts that have been ascertained,
we conclude    that the water of the Moray Firth is the saltest which
can be found near land in the          North    Sea, except on the bottom           of
the Norwegian       Gully, and possibly in the neighbourhood of the
Strait of Dover, where          no   observations have       been     made.      The
influence of estuaries and rivers entering the Moray Firth appears
to effect a local and very superficial freshening.

Cromarty, and          Dornoch — are practically only those                     obtained in
1886,    and the time over which their collection extended was much
too  short to make them of more than comparative                          value.       Import
ant series   of hourly observations,             extending over the greater part of
a tide,  were made        in   each firth, and to these more               particular atten
tion may be       paid,   as   they confirm and extend              the results obtained
on the   Spey in 1885, and on the estuary of the Forth at Kincardine

which divide         it up into tortuous           channels        of very slight depth.
Near    Fort   George      the water is a little over 10 fathoms deep, but
further up 5 fathoms is about                 the average      ;  and the Beauly Basin
in which the        firth  terminates       is much shallower.            During the days

Inverness      Firth    was about        56° on the surface.            The bottom tem
perature   was nearly the same in the shallower part of the firth, but
it fell in a very marked manner towards the sea, being 520-7 at the
 bottom   off Fort George, and 51°-5 off Nairn.                       The average density
of the    water at stations           about     5  miles   apart was        as  follows, but
the   individual readings varied greatly with the tidal phase                        : —

    This shows a progressive                increase    of salinity seawards,             and  a
distinctly greater         salinity for bottom water                 at all    points.       The
diagram,     PI. VIII.       fig. 5, represents       graphically the distribution of
water density and temperature                at surface and bottom,           from Kessock,
past    Fort  George, out into the Moray Firth, to a position off Covesea
Skerries.       Compared with the Firth of Forth, the rate of increase
of salinity      is very rapid, and the difference                   between     surface     and
ljottom more marked in the seaward reaches of the firth.
    Numerous observations              were made       in  the anchorage          at Kessock
Roads, at various depths.                The data for surface and bottom only
need be    given here, but these are of considerable                    importance.          The

       Cromarty      Firth. — The straight          coast line    running south-west
  ward from Tarbat Ness, and bordered                    by   a band of water        under
  10 fathoms       in   depth, is broken by the abrupt              hills which define
  the entrance       to the     Cromarty Firth.           Between them there is               a
  depth of over 25 fathoms              ;  and a clearly -cut channel,      with steeply
  sloping sides, and more             than 10 fathoms        deep, runs straight        west
  through the wide shallows on either side to Alness Point, 10 miles
  from the Sutors.          The depth diminishes rapidly above Alness,                   and
  the channel is much choked by sandbanks.                      Strong tidal streams

salinity of the water at high and at low tide.                          Temperature was
found to fall uniformly towards the                   sea,   the average        being 55°-5
at Alness,    and    54°'5   at the      Sutors, on the surface           ;  while on the
bottom it was 54°-5 and 53°-8 respectively.

   This shows       a variation      of density almost exactly the same for
the 15 miles seaward          from Alness as for the 15 miles seaward from
Queensferry in the           Firth of Forth.               The     identity     extends       to
bottom as well        as  to surface      water    ;    but it must be remembered
that the data compared             are not really comparable,               since   they are
on one side, the salinity of the Cromarty                     Firth in      the   middle of
August 1886, and on the other the mean salinity of the Firth of
Forth determined by numerous observations in                            1884,     1885,     and
1886.     Also, it must be pointed out that the salinity two miles off
the Sutors of Cromarty is about equal to that at the Isle of May                                 ;
while five miles out in the Moray Firth, a salinity is found which,
according to       the    German charts,          is not       to be met with            nearer
than 30 or 40 miles east of the Isle of May.
   The serial tidal observations at Alness                     are of     considerable in
terest.    There were two sets of these.                   The first on        5 th   August,
for six hours, during the last three hours of flood-tide and the first
three   of  ebb, brought out the exact                  equivalence      of the curves of
temperature      and     salinity,    so   that, substituting            "diminution          of
            for "
          "
salinity            increase of temperature," any statement                     with regard
to  tidal influence on         temperature       would be true of salinity                 also.
This series was taken rather near the mouth of the Alness river,
and sudden rushes of warm fresh water produced variations on the
surface   which     were     not found        at   any depth beneath               it.     The
second    series    was    taken     from     llh0 to         20h0     on    August       12th,
and as low water was at 16h0               it  comprised        five hours of ebb and
four of flood.        The resulting figures             are given    in Table VI., and
represented graphically          in PL    VIII.      fig. 3.      The densities of the

     Note. — The position   was changed a few yards nearer the north           shore between
 the 14h0 and lSW) observations.
      This    series   also  shows the temperature               and salinity      to  be in
 close association.          Hence, considering either the one quantity or
 the other, the relative movements                 and gradual mixture or separa
 tion of the warmer and fresher upland water and the colder                                and
 salter sea water may be traced                 out.     The salinity at the bottom
 remained constant for about three hours after high water, then
 gradually diminished              until    low water,       and    again gradually in
  creased.        Surface salinity        remained practically           unchanged,        and
 very near that of the bottom water,                     until two hours before            low-
  tide, when it began to diminish,                  and came to a minimum (the
 surface      temperature       coming      to a maximum) one hour after low-
 tide.       This marked         the   period of        greatest     difference     between
 surface       and bottom salinity;           that    at   the    surface    proceeded       to
 increase,       presumably until high water.                These observations         show
 that flood-tide sets in first at the bottom                 ; that the salt water firs:

    Dornoch Firth. — This firth is shallower than that of Inverness,
 and in addition to its being shut off, like the Firth of Tay, by a
 bar at its mouth, the channels inside are narrow, tortuous, ex
 tremely shallow, and constantly changing on account of the sand
 banks.       The " Garland " navigated this firth under the charge of a
 pilot, and only two days were spent in it.                 It  is impossible to say
 much     regarding the variation of salinity             with position, but this
 appeared      to be more       rapid than in the other inlets examined.               At
 the  Dune of Creich           the density of the surface water was            1 "01750,
and    that of bottom water              1 "01919   at  high     tide; off Dornoch,
 inside the bar, the surface had a density of                      1 "02395,   and the
 bottom 1-02517          at    1J hours     ebb,  the distance from the Dune
 being     9    miles.      A    few    miles   beyond     the    bar   a   density     of
 1 "02588     reigns   from surface to bottom.              Temperature was          high
 in the Dornoch          Firth (over      57°), but rapidly fell as the sea was
 approached.
    A    very complete         set   of observations was       made      off Ardjachie
 Point during the last              4^  hours of ebb tide and the whole suc
ceeding flood, hourly readings              being made for twelve consecutive
hnnrs.       The data are given in Table            VII.,   and    the corresponding
curves in PL        VIIL     fig. 1.
    This is    the most interesting record we obtained             of the tidal    move
ments of salt and brackish water past a given point.                        From 4£ to
 1J hours       before    low tide both surface         and bottom water grew
gradually fresher, while maintaining               nearly the same difference           in
salinity, i.e., the whole mass of water was moving seawards                          as a
uniform        current.       At 1J hours before low water                 the   rate   of
decrease      of salinity in the bottom water diminished,                  that in the
surface water increased,             and the difference     between     the two grew
greater.       The second observation after low water showed a marked
increase     in  the   bottom salinity, while the surface was at its mini

reversed      before the outward surface current was affected.                   During
the next hour the surface water grew Salter more                    rapidly, and then
for two hours gained on the bottom water                  ; so   that 4   J hours after

  as regards vertical distribution              of salinity.         The following reading
  showed a new condition altogether'; the bottom had increased                                       in
  salinity very greatly, and continued to do so until high water                                ;  the
  surface, on the other hand,              remained        constant,    and    even showed             a
  slight      decrease.       This      means      that after        the    water      had      been
  thoroughly mixed, sea-water of greater density began to push it*
  way along the bottom,               and the surface            current of brackish water
  being no longer driven up stream by a wall of uniform salinity,
  resumed         its downward          course   very slowly, and passed over the
  Salter water without             mixing with         it; in     fact,   ebb had begun             on
  the surface,          while    flood-tide     continued         down below.             It thus
  appears       that, so far as the tidal movement                   of   water is concerned,
  the     bottom of the channel in an estuary is before the surface in
  phase.
      The question of tidal currents in estuaries                       is   a  very important
  one   ;   but for its thorough investigation it requires the simultaneous
  work of several assistants,                and a       large enough       staff    to cany on
  uninterrupted           observations for several              successive     tides.       Thia       I

 Spey     with Mr Ritchie, on the Forth with Mr Morrison, and on the
 Domoch      Firth with Mr F. M. Gibson,                    I    have     fully     tested   the
 methods of          studying the problem by means                      of observations       of
 salinity and temperature.      Salinity determinations by means of a
 very delicate       hydrometer are certainly best in all cases ; but in
many, especially         at certain   periods       of the year, the thermometer
gives     an equally exact picture of the state of things, with far less
trouble and the cost of             much less time.               The collection of one
sample of water from a given depth, the bottling of                          it,   determining
the   density, calculating        and reducing the result, occupies                     by my
method nearly 25 minutes, and cannot                       be finished         on    the spot
where observations            are being made.         No        less-exact    determination
of    density   is   of permanent     value, and     it    is   obvious that the results
obtained cannot be ascertained               in time to be of service in directing
the course of the observations.               But   the temperature            can be found
simultaneously at three or more different depths,                          and the correct
result arrived at in rather less than five minutes                  ;   hence, any sudden
change or apparent            anomaly may be detected                 and investigated at
once.      The combination of both methods                       is   certainly best, but
wherever        the river water     is   a   few degrees warmer or colder than
that of the sea,      I    should emphatically recommend                     the use of the
thermometer       as the   chief instrument for investigating the flow of
the tidal currents.
     No   reference     has   been made        in the foregoing to Dr Gibson's
analysis of water samples collected             in the region under consideration
in 1883, and discussed in his Fishery Board Report.                           Our joint plan
of   work for     1886 comprised the collection of samples for chemical
analysis and         gravimetric determination of density.                          About    50
specimens       of water were collected,            and the       analysis     is    now pro

5.   On the Presence of Bacteria in the Lymph, &&, of Living
        Fish and other Vertebrates. By J. C. Ewart, M.D.,
         Regius Professor of Natural History, University of
         Edinburgh.
    During the last        ten  years   numerous    investigations have      been
made to ascertain        whether ordinary (i.e., non-specific) bacteria exist
in the tissues of apparently healthy, living animals.             As a result of
these inquiries,      it  has been   clearly shown that while there is          no
evidence of the existence        of bacteria, under ordinary circumstances,
in the blood of the higher Vertebrate, there is abundance of evidence
of their presence in the blood of some fishes.
    The existence      of bacteria   in fish has been      specially studied by
MM.      Olivier and Bichet.        In   a communication       on the Microbes
of Marine Fish,* Olivier and Eichet point out that bacteria                  exist
 (sometimes      in great numbers) during life in          the peritoneal fluid,
lymph,     and   blood   of the whiting, red mullet, sand-eel, wrasse,        dab,
 and several other fish.        Of the fish examined, the authors       state that
 (with the exception of the conger and the dog-fish) all the tissues
 contained numerous bacteria, — long and short bacilli being espe
 cially abundant.         By cultivations it  was shown that bacteria          also
 existed    in  the tissues of both the conger        and dog-fish.     From the
  observations made, Olivier and Richet conclude that bacteria occur
  so   constantly    in fish that they must          be   almost considered       as
  normal, and, further, that they are not putrefactive bacteria,           because
  when they rapidly multiply after the death of their host there is no
  evidence    of putrefaction.
     In  two subsequent      papers (one dated 9th      July and the   other 17th
  September      1883) the original observations        are confirmed,    and it is
  further pointed out that bacteria are especially numerous in the
  peritoneal cavity, and less numerous in the pericardial sinus, the
  cerebro-spinal     canal,   and the blood of the heart, and that under
  certain conditions the bacilli are mobile, and capable            of being    cul
  tivated.
      I have recently had the opportunity of examining the blood, Sec,
  of  a number of both marine and fresh-water fishes, and              I   am able

  1887.]    Prof. C. Ewart on Bacteria in Lymph, &c, of Fish.                      263
 to  confirm to a certain extent              Olivier and Richet's      observations.
  Although      I  had often examined microscopically                the   blood   and
 tissues of fish,   it  was not    until recently, when at work in the Oxford
 Physiological      Laboratory,       that   I  was convinced      that bacteria are
 often    present    in   immense      numbers in the peritoneal fluid, and in
 smaller numbers         in  the blood of apparently healthy fish.
    I first   noticed bacteria in the blood of a roach (Leuciscus rutilus).                ¦
 This roach, for some hours before it was taken from the water, had
 been occasionally swimming on its side at the surface,                  — an indica
 tion  that it     was    in  an exhausted        condition.     Immediately      after
 the    fish was killed,        a drop of blood taken from the heart              by a
 sterilised pipette (with all the necessary precautions) was found to
 contain      a considerable number of                slender motionless bacilli
 measuring      from -003 to "008 mm. in length.              On an average four
 bacilli were visible in the field at a time with Zeiss's                 F   objective
 and No.     1 eyepiece.      The peritoneal fluid, which was next examined,
 contained so many bacilli that it was impossible to                    count them       ;
 the   bacilli   were usually      lying   amongst    large granular lymph        cells,
 and they were longer and more                 slender than those in the blood.
 Similar bacilli were          found in the lymphatics,           spleen,   liver, and
 kidney, and they were abundant in the                    muscles   in  contact   with
 the peritoneum        ;  while very few were found in the muscles               under
 the skin     of  the trunk, and        still fewer in the     muscles    of the tail.
 The intestine was crowded with similar bacilli to those found in the
body-cavity, and in addition there were              a  number of large and small
 bacteria and micrococci             Bacilli  were also found    in the walls of    the
 intestine and in the bile duct
    Believing that there was some relation between                   the diminished
vitality of the above roach and the numerous bacilli in the tissues,
 I  examined a considerable number of healthy roach and also other
 fresh-water fish, e.g., trout (Salmo levenensis), perch (Perca fiuvia-
tilis), carp (Cyprinus auratus), and eels (Anguilla vulgaris).                   In all
the healthy specimens            examined,     with the exception of the trout,
bacilli   were   found in     the   body-cavity.     Bacilli   were also present     in
the blood of the carp, and on one occasion four bacilli were detected
in a drop of blood from what appeared                to be   a  healthy roach.       In
some the peritoneal fluid contained numerous bacilli, while in others
only    a  few were visible      ; generally there was some relation between

264          Proceedings      of Royal Society of Edinburgh.                [juhr   6,
the number in the body-cavity and the number in the intestine,
and they were most abundant in fish which had lived for some
time in aquaria without food          ;  but in trout which had been fasting
for at least ten days no bacilli could be observed                in the peritoneal
fluid.    The carp which had bacilli in their blood had been living
for  some months       in  a small glass aquarium.
    The    difference     between    the    ronch   first examined and         those
examined subsequently led me to endeavour to ascertain                   whether a
sudden change of temperature            would produce any influence in the
number and distribution          of the bacilli.      As   I   anticipated, a rapid
change from a spring to a summer temperature                  (from 48° to 65° F.)
greatly diminished         the vitality of all the fish experimented with,
except the carp.         As  the fish became more and more exhausted, the
bacilli gradually increased, and when the temperature               was raised from
43*   F. to   65°  F. in two hours,     the bacilli of the peritoneal      fluid  not
only increased       in   the roach,    perch,   carp, and eel, but they made
their appearance in considerable numbers in the body-cavity of the
trout, and on one occasion, a number of small bacilli were found in
the blood     of  a trout.     Although    the carp seemed to enjoy the rise
of temperature,       they were not exempt           from the increase        of  the
bacteria   in   the blood as well as       in the peritoneal fluid. In          some
specimens       of blood as      many as eight short slender bacilli             were
 visible in the field of the microscope at one time, and the peritoneal
 fluid, in some instances, swarmed           with long and short bacilli,       some
 of which were mobile.
    In  some   of the   roach,  in which    no organisms      could be detected in
 the blood, bacilli were found          in the    muscles    immediately external
to the peritoneal cavity.          Further, bacilli were always abundant in
 the muscles      of roach     which had suffered        from a sudden rise        of
temperature.        The above observations were confirmed by cultiva
 tions in gelatine, agar-agar, and infusions of fish muscles.            In healthy
 active   specimens      of the roach     and perch cultivations        were easily
 obtained of the peritoneal bacilli, and generally also from the mus
 cular fibres     lying near the peritoneum, but in no instance did                  I
 succeed    in obtaining cultivations         when the blood, or the muscles
 from immediately under the skin, were used for infecting the culture-
 media.
     Of the sea fish examined,      I have    found bacilli, sometimes long and

1887.]     Prof. C. Ewart on Bacteria in Lymph, &c, of Fish.                          265
slender, sometimes         short and thick, in the peritoneal fluid and blood
of the     whiting (Gadus         merlangus),     haddock (Gadus wglejinus), cod
(Gadus morrhua), and herring (Clupea Jiarengus), and in the peri
toneal    fluid only of    the flounder (Platessa flesus), plaice (Platessa vul
garis), and lumpsucker            (Cycloptenw lumpus).            I   have not hitherto
succeeded      in demonstrating the          existence    of bacteria in either the
peritoneal      fluid or blood of the       skate    (Baia    batis),   dog-fish (Acan-
thias vulgaris),       or fishing-frog (Lophius piscatorius).
    Perhaps the difference         in  the number and distribution           of bacteria
in the sea fish examined by              Olivier and Bichet and           those   I  have
recently studied may be accounted                for, either by    a difference    in the
temperature        of  water from which the fish were taken, or by the fish
having been longer under less favourable conditions in the one case
than in the other.
    It  is extremely desirable that a continuous series of observations
 should     be    carried on throughout the year, in order to ascertain
 whether bacteria are more abundant                   in summer than they          are   in
 winter, whether        they increase       or diminish       before   and during the
 spawning period, and whether the                bacteria    indirectly influence the
 migration      and distribution        of fish — the fish which readily            suffer
 from an       increase of the bacteria in the peritoneal cavity either
 remaining      in comparatively cold seas or selecting cold currents when
 they   migrate in search of food, or in obedience to their spawning
 instinct.
     There can be no doubt that the bacteria               enter   the body-cavity by
 penetrating       the walls of the intestine, neither can there                 be any
 doubt     that having once established themselves                   in  the  peritoneal
 fluid they do their utmost to find their way into the blood and
 tissues.     It   may be taken for granted that ordinary bacteria              flourish
 in the intestinal canal          of all   vertebrates,   and that they assist          in
 digestion by helping          to disintegrate the food particles.             Notwith
 standing the presence of active bacteria in the intestinal canal and
 the   bile and       pancreatic ducts,       I   have   failed to discover either
  bacilli or micrococci      in  the body-cavity of either amphibia, reptiles,
  birds, or mammals         when in    a  healthy condition.          Hence it may be
  taken for granted     — (1) that in the higher        vertebrates     under ordinary
  circumstances the walls of the intestine form an effective                    filter or
  screen    which prevents the passage of the bacteria into the body

cavity, or (2) that the living cells of the mucous and other layers
so act on the bacteria that they are destroyed before they reach the
body-cavity, or (3) that the cells of the peritoneal fluid effectively
sterilise the bacteria which succeed in entering, or (4) that the
bacteria are destroyed as they pass along the lymphatics towards
the general circulation.       The results which follow         the injection of
septic   and other solutions into the body-cavity of rabbits are              con
sidered at length in the Lumleian             Lecture given by      Dr    Burdon
Sanderson in March          1882.     From the experiments referred          to, it
was made clear that whenever the solution could not be at once ab
sorbed without any irritation being set up, bacteria rapidly appeared
in the body-cavity,       and caused death      by producing poisonous        bye-
products.      In many fish, on the other hand, bacteria not only            reach
uninjured the body-cavity, but continue to live there in considerable
numbers without        disturbing    seriously, if  at all, the vital   processes
of their   host, —in    other words, most fish seem capable of tolerating
the presence of one or more kinds of bacteria in the peritoneal fluid,
whilst others can even tolerate considerable numbers in their blood.
It  seems, however,      that there is a limit to this toleration, for when
the equilibrium      is disturbed, when by a change of the surroundings
the   vitality of the tissues      is diminished,     the bacteria rapidly       in
crease, and unless       the tissues recover    the position they have lost,
 the   bacteria   may directly or indirectly       cause death.     It  has been
 suggested     by Metschnikoff       and others,    that bacteria are kept in
 subjection     chiefly   through    the influence    of the   colourless    blood
corpuscles.      This may     be so    in some cases, but     it may    be taken
 for granted that the living tissues as a whole repel the advance of
 the destructive organisms,       and that some bacteria are arrested           and
 destroyed by one tissue, while other bacteria are sterilised by another.
 A  very small swing of the balance may determine whether                 a  given
 bacterium will develop or not             This   may be     inferred from       the
 behaviour of culture-media, e.g., whether gelatine                will  act   as   a
 suitable medium for a given bacterium may depend                 on its reaction
 or on the amount of moisture it contains.           In the  same way, whether
 a given bacterium is able          to disintegrate a piece      of muscle      may
 depend on the reaction or       rigidity of the    muscle.
     The distribution      of bacilli in the tissues of fish, in which            the
 conditions were favourable for their growth, is somewhat                 remark

1887.]   Prof. C. Ewart on Bacteria             in Lymph,     &c.,    of Fish. 267
able.    The fact that even when the bacteria have                     extended into
numerous lymphatics, and even into the substance                     of the muscles
surrounding       the body-cavity before they are found in appreciable
numbers in the blood, seem to indicate that the blood is most
active in destroying bacteria.            Again, seeing that although, when
bacteria exist in considerable numbers in the inner layers of the
myotomes of the trunk, they are often entirely absent (as proved by
cultivations) from the outer layers of the same myotomes, it may
be inferred     that the muscles      also have      considerable power in pre
venting     the   spread   of bacteria.       From    the   observations      made    it
appears that bacteria travel easiest along the lymphatic                   canals   and
spaces — the     lymph cells being apparently less able to arrest their
progress than the blood corpuscles.
   As to the nature of       the bacilli found      in fish nothing has hitherto
been determined.          Olivier and Kichet seemed to think they are
neither     specific   nor putrefactive.        At first   I  thought they were
putrefactive, but not specific.           Having     made    some further experi
ments,    I  am now inclined      to consider them        specific,    and not putre
factive.      I was led to     believe they were putrefactive, because                 I
found    the characteristic long delicate         bacilli of   the body-cavity in
immense numbers between the mascular fasciculi of fish in which
putrefaction had already set in.             A   perch, e.g., which died having
the body-cavity and the blood well charged with bacilli, was placed
in a chamber with the temperature            at 38° C. Fifteen hours afterwards
the mascular bundles, even near the root of the tail, were almost
completely      enveloped with bacilli identical to those in the body-
cavity, the bacilli filling up the inter-muscular spaces, and forming
large irregular patches around the bundles.              In this    fish, twenty-four
hours after      death,   micrococci and bacteria         were extremely few          in
 number, but before the fish had been forty-eight hours in the warm
 chamber the bacilli had largely disappeared,                 and,     in their   place,
 busily   engaged breaking up the mascular fibres, first into filaments
 and    then      into   small   short      segments,     were     numerous       small
 bacteria     and micrococci.       A    trout,    which    contained       bacilli   in
 nearly     all the tissues     during    life,   was   placed in a solution of
 phenol     (5 per cent.) sufficiently long to destroy the               organisms    in
 and around the fish (the intestine having previously been removed)
 without reaching those in the muscles, and then transferred into

268         Proceedings      of Royal Society of Edinburgh.                [/i ke   6,
sterilised water, and kept at      a temperature which varied between 50°
and 65° F.        Ten days afterwards         the muscles had undergone no
marked change         ; they    were   certainly   not    putrefying,     and     yet
living bacilli     were sufficiently abundant       in and around       the fibres
composing them.          The importance of the bacilli so often found in
fish being non-putrefactive and being apparently non-morbific, Le.,
not being associated          with any special       disease,   will  be     readily
understood.       Were they putrefactive, the preservation of fish           as food
would be extremely difficult, and the danger              of suffering from the
presence    of noxious bye-products in the flesh of fish still greater
than it is at        present.     There   is scarcely    any escape from the
conclusion that the bacilli, as long as they survive after the death
of their host, must tend to the formation of bye-products of some
kind.     Whether these bye-products have any influence in producing
the characteristic flavour of somewhat high fish it is impossible to
say, but   it is extremely probable.          In game    in  a high condition       I
have    always found bacteria,        but even    in  grouse   which had been
kept for three months during winter, very few putrefactive bacteria
were found in the large pectoral         muscles.
   Further observations will probably show there is                    a   relation
between      the facility with which           bacteria penetrate       into     and
survive in the muscles,          and what might be called their               innate
vitality.     In  fish,  in which relatively the       percentage    of water in
the muscles      is low, and the fatty constituents high, the bacteria
may be less able         to flourish   than in fish in which the opposite
conditions obtain.         Again, there seems to       be   a relation    between
the number of bacteria present in any given fish and the time
at which putrefaction takes place.              This, as observed above, is
apparently not necessarily a relation             of cause and effect.           The
presence of numerous bacteria seems to be an indication                  of dimin
ished vitality,      an   indication   that the muscles       will fall   a ready
prey to putrefactive bacteria as soon as they make                 their appear
ance.
   Olivier and Richet conclude their second paper as follows               : —
    " En  resume^     nous croyons pouvoir conclure qu'il y a toujours ou
presque toujours des microbes dans les liquides lymphatiquee des
poissons,   et per consequent       dans l'intimate de leurs tissus."
   This conclusion         was  apparently arrived at chiefly because, by

 1887.]   Prof. C. Ewart on Bacteria in Lymph, &c, of Fùh.                          269
 means of cultivations, they convinced themselves                  that bacteria were
 always present in the living tissues.
    It will   be instructive to quote one of their culture experiments.
 The   second    experiment mentioned in the paper of the 9th                   July is
 as follows   : —
    "Le   19   Juin,   on econche avec des ciseaux            rougis la queue d'un
gros Squale venant de lam er.              On la trempe pendant soixante-dix
secondes    dans un bain de paraffine           a 218, puis on l'expose         quelque
instants a la flamme d'une lampe de manière                  a  brûler la peripherio.
Le fragment ainsi sterilizé quant             à sa surface est plongé rapidment
dans un flacon rempli de              paraffine    liquide.     Flacon et paraffine
ont   été sterilizes au préalable       par une temperature        de 1 60°  prolongée
pendent deux heures          et demie, et l'uair        n'a pu y rentrer pendant
le refroidissement qu'a travers un tampon                       d'ouate.    Le flacon
 n'est reste     librement    a   l'air  que     pendant     le   temps    strictement
nécessaire    pour introduire le poisson.
    " Le   29   Juin la chair musculaire           n'a aucune      odeur.     Elle pré
 sente l'aspect et l'odeur du poisson frais.             Elle contient    des Bacilles
extrêmement nombreux, peu mobiles."
    From    analogous    experiments       I  have obtained somewhat           different
results.     For    example,    trout, roach, and eels which              were gutted
immediately after death and introduced for a short time into a 5 per
cent, solution of phenol, and then transferred into sterilised water,
 remained unchanged for weeks.                 When examined,           dead bacteria
 were found on the surface of the skin and in the peritoneal lining
of the body-cavity, but          no  living bacteria could be detected in the
muscles, nor did they appear in cultivations into which fragments
of muscle had been introduced. As was anticipated, when the fish
were placed        in ordinary     water,   putrefaction at once set in.            The
same results were gained by varying the experiment.                      A   trout was
killed,  and a strip of muscle 5 inches           in length     was removed       under
antiseptic precautions       from one side, and introduced into a flask of
sterilised water.       The flask was kept for five days at            a temperature
of 65° F. without any change taking place in the muscular fibres,
or any     bacteria    making their       appearance      either in the fibres or
in the   water.
    Hence in the meantime it may be taken for granted that while
bacteria exist in the tissues of some fish even at a comparatively

of others.

  1.  On the      Origin of the Great Alpine Lakes. By Professor
                    Federico Sacco, University of Turin.
    Among the many and            various controversies          to which the geo
logical study      of the great chain of the Alps has given rise, not the
least   interesting    is that which has reference            to the origin of the
beautiful     lakes which occur most         numerously in the lower reaches
of the    mountain      valleys.   None of the theories             hitherto set forth
seems to me        to explain the origin of these remarkable basins, and
in place    of these     I now venture to adduce one of my own, which
has been     suggested by some years' observations              on the Tertiary and
Quaternary        accumulations of the valley of the Po.                  Of  course,   it
will be understood           that I   am    far from denying that lacustrine
basins may owe        their origin to many various causes               ; and  for lakes
in general      I  am   inclined to adopt some such classification                as  the

     It is not, however, with lakes in general that                I am now about to
 deal,   but with our Alpine lakes in particular.                In    commencing      the
     vol. xiv.         3/13/87                                                  s

 study of those lakes, we must, in the first place, transport ourselves
 in imagination to that epoch of powerful earth-movement                       which,
 according to most         geologists,    closed   the    Miocene period in the
 Alpine     lands, and gave to that mountain-region its last general up
 heaval.      It  was    during this epoch        of powerful       movement that,
 according to common           belief, the Alps received         their present    oro
 graphic features,       while many geologists        were of opinion       that the
 formation of the great Alpine lake-basins ought to be assigned to
the same epoch of disturbance.               With this latter opinion I cannot
agree.       On the contrary,        I  have   been  led to conclude that the
 movement        of upheaval which          brought     the  succeeding     Pliocene
period to a close was of much greater extent than that which took
 place after Miocene times;             and therefore,     so far as regards       the
question at present          under review, viz., the origin of the Alpine
lake-basins,      the Post-pliocenic       movement       is much the most im
 portant
    Be this      as  it  may,   it is quite certain that with          the   close   of
Miocene times           marine    conditions     entirely    disappeared     on    the
northern side of the Alps.             After that date the only deposits laid
down in that region are of fluvio-lacustrine, fluviatile, and glacial
origin   ;   and  as none of these contains fossils, they do not furnish us
with     a sufficiently    exact    basis  for the study of the phenomena
which have         taken place at the foot of the mountain-region since
Miocene times.          By various    geologists these unfossiliferous deposits,
which are in general gravelly in character, have been assigned to the
Messinian, to the Piacentian, and even to the Astian stage, and in
large measure also to the Quaternary.               It   is probable that during
each of these epochs some of the deposits in question                  were formed,
but   as   the classification of the latter is        still far   from  being estab
lished, it is better for our present purpose that we should confine
our attention to the post-miocenic              accumulations which occur on
the south side of the Alps.            These, unlike those of Switzerland,         are
mostly marine and           fossiliferous, and therefore        afford   us a more
secure basis for the study of the question at issue.
    In  the valley of the Po the Messinian             is well marked,     especially
at the foot of the Apennines, where              it contains    gypsum    and marls

sinian      consists   principally     of marshy and lagoon           formations,   in
strong contrast         to   the  underlying      Tortonian,    which is chiefly of
deep-sea origin.
     Along the foot of the Alps the Messinian is very poorly de
veloped, and has been little studied. In the Eastern Alps, how
ever, there occurs a certain old alluvial deposit,               cemented into hard
rock, and containing terrestrial and lacustrine fossils.                 It  has been
elevated and much disturbed, but here and there is seen to overlie
the Tortonian, while elsewhere              it lies abruptly    against  much older
formations.         This alluvium       M. Taramelli is inclined to include in
the Messinian; while M. Rossi * has assigned to the same geological
horizon the extensive marshy deposits of the province of Treviso.
     But    if in  Northern Italy so strong a contrast exists between the
deposits of the Tortonian               and Messinian       epochs,    while   on the
northern side of the Alps the Upper Miocene strata arc poorly de
veloped,      surely we must infer from this that             a powerful movement
of elevation affected the region of the              Alps and Apennines in post-
Tortonian        times.     Is it not evident that this upheaval finally
 banished the       sea  from the northern side of the Alps, where it had
 so  long prevailed, while on the south side of the Alps it changed the
 large and deep Tortonian gulf of the valley of the                  Po into  a region
 of lagoons, low lands, and marshes              1   Is it not to this period that
 the existing orography of the Alps, at all events                in its general out
 lines, ought to be assigned         1
     To this     movement       of powerful and wide-spread elevation suc
  ceeded      another movement,          also   of   great   intensity,  but in the
  opposite      direction.     Thus in the valley          of the Po the marshy
  accumulations of the Messinian              are overlaid directly by the deep-
  Bea   deposits of the Piacentian.          No marine deposits of Pliocene        age
  occur on the north side of the Alps, and Swiss geologists                  therefore
  do not admit that the subsidence             referred   to affected their country.
  For my part,        I   think it highly probable that            the movement     in
  question     did affect the whole mountain-region, but with varying in
  tensity.      The absence of marine Pliocene on the north side of the
  Alps     I  would attribute to the relatively higher position of that
  region above the sea-leveL            In  consequence     of the upheaval of lute

Miocene times, the          sea  retreated    from Switzerland, and hence the
succeeding      deposits   consist, not of marine,       but terrestrial and lacus
trine beds.       These   I  take to be representative      of the Tortonian and
Messinian of Italy.          During    the following Piacentian epoch the sea
invaded the valley of the Rhone, and reached                 as  far as Lyons, but
did not approach nearer to Switzerland.
   It   is to be noted        in this    connection    that the invasion of the
Piacentian Sea was not general,                even   for the south side of the
Alps, for deposits       of that    age are   wanting in Venetia, east of Lake
Garda.       It   would appear,      therefore,    that the post-Messinian sub
sidence was not nearly so well marked in this particular region as in
that which lay further to the west.                 Thus the Venetian districts,
with their continental          deposits    of Pliocene    age,  show   phenomena
analogous      to those met     with  on the northern side of the       Alps.
   Towards the middle of the Pliocene period, a movement                    of  eleva-
vation was again initiated.             This   appears to have been somewhat
rapid in certain       regions,    for we find in places blue marls, with             a
deep-sea fauna, overlaid directly by yellow sands charged                with  fossils
of littoral habitats.          In other    places the same deep-sea strata are
covered by continental accumulations, pointing                 in like manner to      a
more or less rapid upheaval.             In  yet other places, however,      we find
evidence      of a gradual change from deep-sea to shallow-water con
ditions, showing that the elevation may, after all, have been rather
protracted     than rapid.
   The distribution        of the arenaceous marine deposits of the Astian
along     the    base  of the     Apennines       (where they are widely and
almost     continuously spread), and here and there also at the foot of
the  Alps    (such, for example,        as  the marly beds of the Piacentian),
leaves one      in  no doubt as to their stratigraphical position.            At   the
foot of the Alps, however, or at a little distance from these moun
tains,   we encounter        certain   gravelly deposits,     generally quite      tin-
fossiliferous, and       having a prevalent fluviatile          character.     These
gravels, according to some geologists, correspond in              age to the  yellow
marine sands of the Astian ; by others they are regarded as Quater
nary accumulations.           And    so   in Italy,  as  in Switzerland, there is
the same difficulty as to the precise stratigraphical position             of   these
deposits.       But while in Switzerland their horizon has been variously
assigned     to any stage — from the Messinian to the Quaternary — in

  Italy they can only be of Astian or Quaternary                      age.    Indeed, it
  seems to me         probable    that just as in Switzerland, those unfossili-
  ferous     accumulations may truly belong in part to each of the stages
  referred     to — Damely, to the Messinian, the Piacentian, the Astian,
  and the       Quaternary —so the unfossiliferous              conglomerates      in  the
  valley    of the Po may belong in part             to the Upper Pliocene, and in
  part also to      the Quaternary.        I  shall not attempt at present, how
 ever,    to make this distinction, because it is still matter of doubt,
 and     would lead me into too long           a  discussion of what, after all, are
 local details.        Nevertheless,     I should     like to point out some of the
 more      important results       obtained from a geological examination of
 the    upper valley of the Po.         These may be summarised           as follows :—
      1.  In certain     parts   of Piedmont, at a distance           of more than 50
 kilometres from the Maritime Alps, with their important valleys and
 rivers (as, for example, between             Villanuova and Villafranca,           Asti),
 there     occur fluviatile and lacustrine deposits,              consisting of marls,
 sand, gravel, and conglomerate,             -which sometimes attain a thickness
 of 100 metres,        and which from their fossils, studied by me for some
 years,     I   judge to be of Pliocene            age   (Villafranchian of Pareto).
 These      alluvial    deposits   rest upon the yellow sands of the Astian,
 which      in that district    are of inconsiderable thickness.
     2.   In the valley of       the Stura (Cuneo),* and          in  certain other dis
 tricts of Piedmont,         one may see the yellow marine sands of Astian
 age    thinning off towards         the mountains, taking on by degrees the
 character       of true littoral deposits,      and then of marshy or lagoon-like
accumulations.           Followed      nearer     the   mountains, these accumula
tions are covered and replaced by gravelly, sandy, and argillaceous
alluvia, -which at first are probably marine,                 but seem to pass later
ally into true continental deposits.                The numerous fossils found by
me     in these beds prove the latter to be of Upper Pliocene                  age.
     3.   In   other regions of Piedmont, but nearer the mountains,                     as,
for example, between Morozzo and Villanuora,                      Mondovi, the alluvia
in question repose conformably upon the marine blue marls of the
Piacentian,         presenting in this manner             a well-marked      parallelism
with the yellow marly sands, which at a distance                     of only two kilo
metres       represent the marine Astian, and overlie the same horizon of

the Piacontian     marls.    These facts     seem    to me to demonstrate       the
synchronism of the alluvial continental deposits               nearer the moun
tains with the marine beds of the Astian.
    Now   since we find that the yellow marine sands of the                 Astian
are represented     along the foot-slopes      of the Apennines by more or
less extensive gravelly, conglomeratic,          torrential accumulations, and
since in the higher parts of Piedmont we encounter                continental de
posits of undoubted Pliocenic age (which attain a thickness of even
 100 metres at a distance of more than 50 kilometres from the Mari
time Alps, and rest directly upon the marine Astian), it seems only
reasonable    to expect that similar continental accumulations ought to
bo met with occupying a          like  geological    position at the foot of the
 Central Alps.      Indeed, when we consider the more extensive drain
age area of this latter region, its larger valleys and more imposing
 water-flow,   we can hardly doubt that more or less extensive alluvia,
synchronous with the Villafranchian            of Piedmont, must have been
 deposited   during the second half of the Pliocene by the great rivers
 then   descending to the Pliocene          sea.      And   these  alluvia   would
 form irregular deltas, now and again anastomosing               and dovetailing,
 and spreading out from the          Alps towards the Apennines.               Thai
 great alluvial   accumulations do occur along the foot of the Central
 Alps is of course well known, and the only question therefore that
 remains for discussion is the classification and correlation             of  those
 deposits.     Unfortunately,     owing to the fact that the cuttings made
 by the river-courses     in  the plains   of    the  Po are generally of incon
 siderable   depth, the whole thickness of the alluvia is not seen, and
 the determination of the deposits           therefore   is not an easy matter.
 As a rule, it is only the superficial Quaternary conglomerates                 that
 are exposed in sections.       For   the same reasons which induce me to
  believe  that along the base of the Alps in Italy very extensive
  Pliocenic   alluvia exist,  I  am of opinion that a large          proportion of
  the alluvial accumulations,      more especially the conglomerates,        which
  occupy a similar position at the northern foot of the            Alps, ought    to
 be assigned to the Pliocene rather than the Quaternary.
     But the second stage of the Pliocene period was characterised
  not only by the commencement           of the elevation of the Alpine and
  Apennine regions, and by the accumulation of the marine and con
  tinental deposits    already  referred    to, but by the initiation      of those

glacial conditions which subsequently attained so great a develop
ment        Even at an earlier stage than this, namely, in the Astian
epoch, the       Alpine snow-fields       and glaciers     probably reached     a  not
able     development, especially in the northern part of the chain,
where      the geographical and orographical conditions, together                 with
distance     from the     sea,  would necessarily       exert an influence favour
able to      glaciation.      For  these reasons,     I  incline to think that the
first glacial epoch       of Swiss geologists        coincided generally with the
 closing stage      of the Pliocene,        If , as I believe,  the first notable   ex
 tension of glaciers began          in Astian    times, then we should expect to
 encounter on the south side of the              Alps very considerable alluvia of
 Pliocene age, extending           outwards from the mountains far into the
 plains.      And this is just what        I do find.
     The actual cause         of this former great extension of the Alpine
 glaciers    I  would assign to evaporation from a much wider water
 area    than    presently exists.        Much of what is now dry land in
  Northern      Italy was then       submerged     — the water being partly that
 of the     sea,   partly lacustrine.       The vapour rising from these sub
 merged areas,       passing north over the Alps (which at that time were
  being   powerfully upheaved), would be precipitated as snow, and so
  would    eventually give rise to glaciers.          It must be remembered        that
  the  extraordinary glacier-development in question has, in all proba
  bility, not been the         first to have taken place in the Alps.                At
  various   horizons in the Tertiary strata great erratic blocks have been
  met   with.     More especially      is this the case    with  the Miocene of the
  kills near     Turin, where,       scattered    through sandy, marly strata of
  marine    origin, occur enormous blocks, angular in shape, which could
  only have been        carried by ioe.      It  seems most     likely that   the ice
  bergs or     ice-rafts by which they travelled were detached              from the
   front   of the    glaciers   descending from the Alps into the               sea  of
   Miocene times.
      But   if  the movement of elevation began to be manifested more
   or less   pronouncedly during the Astian epoch, it was yet gradual
   enough to     allow of the continued accumulation of the deltas, which,
   step by step, were       compelled to recede from the foot of the Alps.
    At the end    of the Pliocene period, however, the movement assumed
    extraordinary     intensity.      Thus, the lower Pliocene (Piacentian) of
    deep-sea    origin were uplifted 350 or 400 metres, and even more

than 500       metres    in    some sub-Alpine       regions,    whilst   the   upper
yellow sands       (Astian) in the vicinity of           the  Alps   were at certain
points     raised more       than    560 metres.        In    the   sub-Apennines,
facing the Alps,        the     same     deposits   were    uplifted    700   metres^
and in Southern Italy over 1000 metres.                    This    movement,     as  I
believe (and not that which closed the Miocene period), was
the last great elevation of the Alps.                    It is to this Pliocenic
 movement       that  I   attribute     the general    orographic settlement of
the   Alps.      And it is       to   this   last great elevation of the Alps
that   I   chiefly assign     the formation       of the existing lake-basins of
the    sub-Alpine     regions.        These     I  believe    to be due     partly to
faults — often bifurcating           as   they pass     down     the   valleys, — and
partly to the accentuation or formation of synclinal                   folds, and to
local uplifts and subsidences.
    After this period of great elevation the Alpine glaciers, which
had already in the second stage of the Pliocene become strongly
developed,     were now, owing to the changed               orographic conditions,
compelled to form           in cirques differing in shape from those of
Pliocene times, and        to seek new paths in their descent to the low
grounds;       but, erelong,      making their       way through deep          valleys
newly opened, and preceded              by the deposition of diluvial deposits
from the watera escaping             from them, they reached          the plain, and
 piled up their great end moraines, forming the well-known morainic
 amphitheatres opposite           the   mouths of the great Alpine valleys.
Underlying       these   terminal moraines,         therefore,    we always find a
more or less thick        accumulation of diluvial conglomerate             — the in
 duration of the deposits being due sometimes to infiltrated calcareous
 matter, and sometimes           apparently to the pressure          exerted   by the
 glacier-ice   which overflowed the gravels.
    During     the somewhat         rapid descent of the glaciers         to the low
 grounds it seems obvious that the terrestrial waters which escaped
 from them would accumulate                 in the lake-basins, the bottoms of
 which would thus tend to be raised; while the glaciers themselves,
when they reached          those basins,      would take some time to fill them
up.     Before the glaciers        could escape from the lacustrine troughs,
very considerable      masses      of gravel and shingle would          be swept out
by the rivers and torrents, and spread               over the low grounds that
 extend     outwards from the mountains.               When      at last the glaciers

debouched        upon    the plains, their path therefore         lay over a region
more or less        thickly    covered    with gravelly     deposits,    and we need
not wonder therefore            at the great     thickness attained by the con
glomerates which we now meet                with underneath      the great terminal
moraines      of Piedmont,        &c.    The occurrence     of these conglomerates
has long been         well known, ever indeed since attention was first
directed to them by Martins and Studer some                  forty  years ago.

glacial period, and correspond,           in my opinion,    to the similar accumu
lations which, according to Swiss geologists,                belong to what they
term    the   " second     glacial epoch."        From all the Alpine valleys at
this period powerful streams and torrents descended,                  and their pro
ducts occur not only opposite               the mouths of the greater            Alpine
valleys which        contained large glaciers, but spread out also into the
plains and       low grounds         opposite     mountain-valleys      in which no
glaciers appear to have            existed.     To these deposits      various names
have    been assigned,        such as "Quaternary alluvia;"             " fluvio-lacus-

    It is  unnecessary,      however, to pause longer over this period, the
general     conditions     of which, so far        as  they relate to the Alps, are
sufficiently    well known.            The    eventual decadence       of the great
glaciers    was,    in my opinion, brought about by               the    gradual and
general     elevation of the continent, and the consequent                  disappear
ance of     many wide marine and lacustrine areas.                  By    the gradual
 disappearance       of those water areas evaporation was progressively
 diminished,      until   the atmospheric precipitation          on the Alps was
 reduced    by one-tenth, consequently the glaciers, for lack of aliment,
 gradually retreated,       and the great troughs in the mountain valleys
 became    lacustrine basins.         (Probably, also, the gradual lowering of
 the temperature        of the globe may have had something to do with
 diminished     evaporation and precipitation.)              Now, the        lakes  are
 being    gradually filled up by the sediment washed                  into them by
 streams and     rivers, so that the geologist can foresee a time when they
 will become    in this way entirely silted        up.   In  Post-glacial times the
 streams were      not of such importance as those of the Glacial period,

which in many respects may be looked upon as              a period of torrents
and flooded      rivers.    Since the close of that period      the rivers and
streams have been engaged          in cutting down through the glacial and
fluvio-glacial accumulations, so that in some places they have suc
ceeded in reaching the Pliocene, and even the Miocene deposits.
This is especially       the case   in localities where a movement       of up
heaval     had been longest continued, or where it had been most
pronounced.        The erosive action of Post-glacial times having resulted
in the formation of alluvial terraces in the valleys over many wide
regions,    we term this period the "Terracian."
     Having now sketched in outline           the phenomena    connected   with
 the structure and origin of the great lake-basins of the         Alps,  I  may
 sum up in a few words my general            conclusions.    I am of opinion,
 then, that these       basins  came into existence      during that powerful
 upheaval which closed the           Pliocene — that, in short, they    are the
 direct result of that great movement.           They owe their origin partly
 to fractures and foldings of the strata, partly to subsidences              and
 elevation.      They were preserved        during the glacial period by the
  glaciers  which occupied       them, and were only modified to a        slight
 degree by morainic obstructions, and by fluviatile and glacial erosion.
      The form and distribution          of the Alpine lakes seem readily
 explained according to my views as follows           : —
      1. Along   the south-east    margin of Lake Garda the strata present
  distinct folds, the axes of which run generally from west to east.
  In   other words, the undulations and folds of the strata along the
  eastern   side   of the lake    are approximately parallel to the plain      of
  the Po.     Further    to the east their direction is mostly from north
  west to south-east.       The absence of great lake-basins in the Venetian
  Alps is noteworthy, and may be accounted for in various ways.                It
  is not unlikely, in the first place, that fractures and faults would
  tend to take place more in the direction of the folds than perpendi
  cular to them      ; again,  during the last great upheaval,      when new
  foldings took place, these would probably be formed            parallel to the
  pre-existing ones, and only rarely perpendicular to them.             Finally,
  the Venetian Alps, according to Taramelli, experienced          a less degree
   of elevation in Post-pliocene times than the regions lying to the
   west     Such considerations should lessen our surprise, that no great
   iike-basins occur in the mountain-valleys east of Lake Garda.

    2.    Upon the south-west margin of that lake the foldings of the
strata run usually from south-west           to north-east— a direction which
coincides       generally with that maintained           by  the anticlinal      and
synclinal axes of the Western Alps, and explains why the Central
Alps advance       so much further        into the plain of the Po than the
Eastern Alps.         By this  arrangement     of the axes in the region under
review,      it is obvious that       the  folds   of the strata      are   directed
approximately perpendicular to the plain of the Po.                     Now, since
the     faults and foldings which followed           the trend of the original
undulations must have been both numerons and important                      ;  and as
the Post-pliocene         elevatory movement which            took place      in  the
Alpine region to the west of Lake Garda was very powerful, it is
only natural that great sub-Alpine basins             should have been formed
in that region,      the general trend of these basins being perpendicular
to the     plain of the Po.
    3.   In that region     where the discordancy between         the undulations
of the Central      Alps and    those of the Venetian       Alps is  most marked,
we    ought to encounter the largest faults and most pronounced fold
ings of the strata.          Now, it is just in that particular region where
Lake Garda occurs        — a lake which     advances further than any of the
other      Alpine lakes into the plain of         the   Po, and which in places
exceeds the great depth of 800            metres — so that its bottom      is nearly
800 metres below the level of the sea.
    4.    The larger foldings which occur along the southern area of the
 Eastern      Alps  are directed,   as  I  have  said, parallel to the plain of
the Po, thus        differing   notably from the Post-miocene and Post-
 pliocene      undulations    of the Central Alps.         This direction of      the
 folds of the Eastern Alps, taken          in connection with      the disposition
 of the      Alpine chain in      a strong curved line, seems sufficient to
 account for the absence of deep lacustrine basins at the               foot of the
 Venetian Alps.
     5.   The northern region of the central area of the chain (including
 a large    portion of the German Alps and the eastern part of Switzer
 land)     having experienced conditions very similar to those                  which
  have affected the      Alps of Lombardy — for,         doubtless    the powerful
  elevation that closed the Pliocene epoch             influenced the whole area
  in question,    — we   there  meet with     deep lacustrine basins similar to
  those    of Northern Italy.      These basins we see extend        in  a direction

282             Proceedings      of Royal Society of Edinburgh.          [juse   20,
perpendicular to the axes of the Alpine chain, and are sometimes,
as   in the case of Lake Constance,               bifurcated downwards, like not
a few      Italian  lakes.
     C.  In the    more eastern part of Switzerland the phenomena          referred
to   in the    preceding     paragraph were complicated by the proximity of
the     Jura Mountains,          a chain   ¦which    runs parallel to that of the
Alps.        Hence the deep lake-basins were formed rather parallel than
normal to the axes of those chains.
     7.   It  is worthy      of note that the orographic axes of the           syn-
cline of the         valley of the Po lies near            the base of the Alps.
This explains why the lacustrine troughs, lying for the greater
part in solid rocks, shelve off and end near the plain.                         We
must remember            also that the Post-pliocene elevation of the        Apen
nines, where the Pliocene strata often reach an elevation of more
than 700 metres, must have been more intense than the contem
 poraneous       movement       of the Alps, where the Pliocene marine beds
 do not rise more            than 400 metres         above  the sea.  It is highly
 probable      that a similar relation obtained between          the Jura and the
 Swiss Alps.         Nor    can   I doubt   that if the Apennines had approached
 the    Alps    as closely as the      Jura, we should have found the typical
 direction of the Italian            lacustrine basins modified in some       cases.
 Instead of being all perpendicular to the axis of the Alps, some of
 them would have resembled               the Lake of Geneva,    the upper reaches
 of which are normal, while tho lower are parallel to the main axis
 of the mountains.
      8.   I  admit the existence of a relation between the great Alpine
 basins and the glaciers of Quaternary times ; but              in my opinion this
 relation is due neither to excavation by ice                  nor obstruction by
 morainic debris, but simply to the conserving action of the glaciers.
 The troughs,        I believe, were occupied by the glaciers, and thus        their
  filling up by        the    fluvio-glacial    detritus of the first half of the
 Quaternary age was prevented.
      In    the following table        I bring into one view the general conclu
 sions arrived at in the paper : —

                   (Plate     IX.)
             Twenty-seven            years    ago   the writer       submitted       to the        Royal
Society of Edinburgh                     a   paper on the minute oscillations of flexible
pendulums, in which some new general                               laws were expounded.              He
proposes now to consider one                            case    of the phenomenon more in
detail.
             The investigation of extensive oscillations of                   a   flexible system        is
far beyond               the present         powers of the calculus, and we are restricted
to the consideration of disturbances not far from the mean position
of the             system.

the system         is capable   of  as many simple oscillations        as  there are
attached bodies, and        all  the movements      of which it is susceptible are
compounds         of these simple ones.       An imaginary flexible heavy line
may be regarded          as composed     of an infinite number of parts, and
thus for it there is an endless series              of simple oscillations, each
having its own periodic time.             The essential feature    of our inquiry
is as to the manner of one of these.
   The character         of a simple oscillation may be illustrated thus: —
Let HO,        fig. 1, represent the direction      of the plummet, while the
waved line        LIHFECBA         (supposed,   however, to be almost straight)
is the form of the chain at some particular instant           ; then the motions
must be such that all the parts of the chain come simultaneously
into the position Li'H/EcBO.
   For this it is requisite that the tendency to redress the position
of any element,          as Pp, of the chain must be proportional             to the
distance PQ and to the mass of the element.                 Now the tension of
the chain at P is (in our restricted case) measured by the weight of
the part below, — that is by the length PA, which we hold as equal
to  QO   ;    and that tension decomposed            in the direction QP is pro
portional to the sine of the inclination            at P;  so that   if   we denote
 OQ by     z,  QP by     x, and use Leibnitz'     notation, the tendency of the
strain on      PA    to draw the element      outwards is proportional to      2 -j- •
 Similarly, the tension of the chain PE, which is proportional to Og,
 causes a     pull inwardly, indicated by        z'     ; and thus the ultimate
 determination of the element             Pp towards the central line is pro
portional to the difference         —
and thus the general            condition of a simple oscillation is expressed
by the differential equation of the second order
                                                          as
 in which a is a coefficient         constant  all along the chain, but chang
 ing from one simple oscillation to another.

     The resolution of our physical problem is now converted into the
management                of a case in the doctrine of functions, and thus it
acquires        an importance far beyond any that the original                                                       question

the notice         of     the Society.
     The problem does not belong to the differential calculus, for in
that case we should need to have                                     the relation of the primary                            z   to

derivative           would need to be given                      ;      nor yet to the third co-ordinate
branch,        for    the relation of the primitive and derivative functions                                                    is
not prescribed.
     For convenience in treating the                              matter,           it       is   expedient to discard
Leibnitz1 notation                   for differentials of higher orders than the first,

     Such an expression                       as           is    intended to represent                        the result of

five successive             differentiations in which                              z      is   the primary or inde
pendent variable and                      x   the function.              Here the sign of differentiation
is    twice, and that of the order                                 also        twice, written.                   Now,        the
essentials           to be           indicated            are,    the         idea           of differentiation,             the
primary,        the function, and the order.                                   The idea may conveniently
be    indicated by the position of the marks                                             ;    Lagrange placed these
as accents over            the function, thus —             :           xx,   x",        a?", xx", x" .        This    scheme
has       two drawbacks;                      the     position of the accents had long been
appropriated              to the indices of powers, and there                                         is   no notice of the
primary        ;   Leibnitz'          notation clearly shows the distinction between

with them the primary,                          so that the symbol                             jc       is used to denote the

      The symbols x,                        ^c,          ^ar,   thus indicate a series of functions
deduced by the repeated operation called differentiation                                                              ;   each one is,

the primitive              (integral) of the succeeding.                                           So we may carry the

 the abscissae    z are measured,         and    if it  be taken as unit, the periodic
 time of the chain's          oscillation will be that of a simple pendulum
 having the linear unit for its length                ; so the generality of the results

that, however large           z   may be taken, the denominator                 n1
eventually come to exceed it            ;   and thus, although the terms             may
increase at the beginning, they must ultimately                     come to decrease      ;
and therefore the computation of x to                  within any prescribed       degree
of precision is always possible.
    The curve lies on the one or on the other side of the plumb-line,
according     as the sum    of the even terms of the progression                 exceeds
or falls short of the sum of the odd terms, and we can discover
which way only by the actual calculation.                        The intersections of
the curve with the middle line represent                    the points of suspension
of the oscillating chain, and therefore our attention is first called
 to the discovery of those values               of   z  which    correspond to x = 0.
 From the mere aspect of the progression                  we could not even predict
that any such values are possible,              or form any idea of the order of
the roots of this transcendental equation.                   The consideration of the
 physical problem with which it is connected                       does   indeed throw
 light   on the matter, and leads us to anticipate an endless succession
 of roots more and more separated as we proceed upwards.
     The accurate determination of these roots can only be reached by
 trial ;  the computations are very operose, and we look for some
 means for lessening      the labour      ;   this is found in the law of succes
 sion of the derivatives.           Let us suppose that, corresponding to some
 value of    z, the ordinate x and its derivative                have been computed,
 we are then able easily, particularly            if i  be represented     by an integer
 number,     to deduce the subsequent derivatives.                 ThuB —

   Now, in forming a list of the successive derivatives of x for «= 1,
according to the law above explained, and writing for clearness'

    But   these coefficients     of  A  and B are developed                exactly as    are
the members of the approximating fractions, so that since                            A :B u
nearly as 191      : 492, the difference  492      A - 191      B must      be  small, and
must continue to decrease as we proceed farther.                       Hence,     if  we can
show that the above progression            of quotients         1, 2, 3, 4, <fcc., neces
sarily holds good, we shall have demonstrated that the progression
of derivatives never becomes divergent.

approximating to the ratio of            A   to B, is identical       with that of       the
coefficients of     A  and B in the expressions          for the successive deriva
tives ;    in fact,   the   excesses above       found are the very derivatives
themselves,       with the alternate signs changed            ;  and thus      it   appears
that    in no   case can   the progression      of derivatives become divergent.
    Proceeding now one step forward, the computations for                         z = 2 are
found      to give    «=-      -19655 ;    u«   =- -28928,         so   that the curve
must cross       the axis between        z =  1  and z = 2.        The exact place of
crossing     may conveniently be reached              from      either side    ;   it is at
Zi
    = 1-44580.        Thus    it  appears     that a chain having            the     length
 1 '44580    will perform     a simple oscillation       in the      same time as       will
a   pendulum whose length is 1-00000.                      Or, conversely, that             a
chain    of  the   length unit will perform its slowest simple oscillation
along     with   a pendulum       having -69166 for its length.               These pro
portions are shown        in  the figure,   OB being       the length of the chain,
 OQ that of the pendulum oscillating along               with it.
    Proceeding onwards in search of the second                     crossing,    we find    it
to    lie between      z=   l   and   z = 8, from      either of which            an   easy
 approximation       gives us Zj= 7-61782, rather more than five times
 the    preceding ;     this is the      OE of      the   figure,     the   curved line
 EDCBA representing in             a most     exaggerated      way the character          of
 the   oscillation     The second simple oscillation of the chain is thus
 isochronous     with that of       a pendulum       -13127      long, the length of
 the chain    being unit.
     In continuing     the search for the        remote    crossings,     the    labour of
 the   trial calculations increases        greatly, and we seek to lessen the
 toil  by watching the progress of the distances             ; and,    to our consider
able relief,   find that the second         differences     are almost, though not
 nuite, constant,    as is seen in the subjoined table for six crossings.

    Hence, after having computed        the fourth crossing      it was easy   for
us to see that the fifth     must be between        55 and 56 ; and now that
the sixth    crossing   has been accurately determined we readily            infer
that the seventh must be at 112-48, the eighth at 148-26, and the
ninth at 188-97 nearly.
    It is also worthy of remark that the second difference approaches
closely to the value of      Jjt', namely   to 4-93480, and we are tempted
to conclude that this well-known number is the asymptote to which
the second difference      tends.    The mere arithmetical coincidence is
a weak argument         in favour of this notion; yet it is all that the
algebraic formula seems capable of supplying:             we shall find a much
stronger    argument     in the character      of the physical phenomenon
under review.

    The vibration of the portion        LH, comprised      between     two cross
 ings, is that of   a  musical string fixed at     L  and H, and stretched as
 by a    weight HO at its lower end       ;   and the preceding     investigation
 takes into account the change          of strain due to the weight of the
 cord.    In  the case of the musical string the tension is many times
 greater than the weight of the cord, which             weight, therefore,    may
 be neglected even when the string is          upright
     Using   as the linear unit the length       of a pendulum oscillating in
 the same time as the string, and as the unit of tension the weight
 of   one unit's length of the string, and writing           vo for the tension
  so measured, the differential equation of the curve is
                                   -x = to  .

      From        this    we        see      that x is zero                when        the   arc   represented

      Now when                w    increases,         the     fraction      —j—        decreases,        and the
denominator              of this fraction becomes more and more nearly equal
to     2,   so   this analogue of our second difference                           approaches        to Jtt2    .
      Having thus determined the points of crossing,                                          we proceed           to

side, as at          the points           c,   F,I      of the       figure.       Thereat the curve               is
parallel to the axis and the derivative                                    is   zero   ;   we have no other

culty.
   In   passing from side to side of its axis the chain must change the
direction of its curvature,   the concavity being     in general toward the
axis  ;  but the points of reflexure are not necessarily at the crossings.
At  these points the second      derivative must be zero      ; now the very
genesis of the curve is contained       in the equation
wherefore     for the points of reflexure D, G,    K, the ordinate x and its
derivative yc must be equal to each other with opposite signs.             The
subtangent of the curve is given by the             formula     —-or      —x—

 must meet the axis at the distance of unit (that is the length of the
corresponding pendulum) above the points d, g, h, k of the figure,
 as also is the case    for the tangent      applied at the lowest point      A.

increase be or be not confined to                 within   some definite         limit.
     Hitherto         we have    been      considering the form of an indefinitely
long chain, whose oscillations are performed in a fixed time, namely,
that of    a   pendulum whose length is unit.                   We shall now         proceed to
investigate the forms and times of oscillation of a chain having a
determinate           length.
     The simple oscillations of any chain, PO, are easily got from the
preceding       investigations        :   thus the slowest oscillation, that in which
the whole chain swings from one side of its mean position to the
other side, is represented                 by the part BO of the first figure,                   the
ordinates of the curve being, in imagination, reduced                              so as to be
scarcely       perceptible.       If L be       the total length of the chain,

    The second oscillation, that in which the chain has one node,                                                              is

PO of the second figure                      in the ratio of EB to BO, we get B', the
node of the actual                 chain;      on making OQ' also                           in proportion,                 we

    When two oscillations,                    by the (A) and the (B) of

2   76004.        On examining this ratio by the method of continued
fractions,       we find the successive quotients,                                2,   3,   2,   1,    1,   2,    13,    2,    7,

Taking the second           of these for the sake of illustration, while (A)
has made          three complete oscillations, (B) has made seven, and the
chain     is    (nearly) in the same position as at first, so that the same
phases         would     be    repeated.            But           the      periodic times                   are    incom
mensurate, and so the same phase can never                                              be accurately repro
duced.
     The two sets of oscillations may or may not be in one plane                                                               ;

in   the chain      is   analogous           to the curve produced by the vibration of
a   straight wire whose periodic times are                                   in   the same ratio             ;     only in
the     present     case the figure                is   not necessarily circumscribed by                                       a
rectangle.
     In order      to form some idea of the compound movements,                                                         let us
draw     AB, figure     to represent the extent of the oscillation (A),
                              3,
and     BC, inclined to    to show that of the simple oscillation (B).

Then, having described                   a   semicircle on each of these, we divide the

one into some multiple of 7, the other into the corresponding multiple
of   3 equal    parts  (actually into 21 and 9).             Perpendiculars         drawn
from the points of section divide the diameters into graduated                       parts,
representing the distances        passed over by the end              of the chain        in
equal   portions of time during each of the separate simple                        oscilla
tions.     Having     completed    the   rhomboid        ABCD, and divided                 i:
into a multitude of small rhomboids by parallels drawn through                          the
divisions of its sides, we begin at the corner                of any one of          these,
draw a line to the opposite corner, thence into the next, and                       so on,
passing from side to side of the entire rhomboid,                 until we return         to
the first point.      In this way    we get an approximate representation
of the path of the lower end of the chain when                    a  plane oscillation
(B) is imposed on a plane oscillation (A).
    But the chain may perform two simple oscillations                  (A) in   different
planes, the result being an elliptic          movement        ; and so also of          the
oscillation (B) ; and then the compound of the two (or rather four)
must be got by carrying the centre of the one ellipse along the
circumference      of the other, in the manner used for the epicycloid
    These curves present       an endless    diversity of form, according                 to
the dimensions and relative positions of the ellipses.                   Adopting       the
ratio  7 : 3 for that of the periodic times, some of these                 are depicted
in figure 4, a,   b, c, d, e.    In   a and    b   the ellipses have been placed
conformably and the curves are symmetric                ;  for a the motions          were
made both in one direction, and,            as   in the      analogous       case of the
 epicycloid, there     are four, that     is  7   - 3,   lobes  ;   for  b   one of the
motions     has   been   reversed, and we find ten, that is 7 + 3, lobes                      ;
c  and d are corresponding examples           with    the axes of the ellipses set
obliquely    ;  while fur  e  the ellipse  (B)   is compressed         into a straight
line.    These examples may give some faint idea of diversity of char
 acter among the curves.
    While    the lower end of the chain is describing                    some     one of
these curves, the points higher up are performing each its own peculiar
evolution.       As  we ascend, the dimensions of the ellipse               (B)  decrease
moro rapidly than do those           of (A), and consequently,               along with
its extent,    the curve changes       also its configuration          ; and when         we
arrive at the height of the node B', the quicker ellipse has collapsed
 into a point, and the chain there describes                simply the ellipse           due
to the oscillation (A).        Above this height the ellipse (B) reappears,

is a warning to us against too hasty conclusions from experimental
data.     Let  us suppose     for a moment that the periodic oscillations
of a chain had been         of great     importance      ;  while as yet we       had
only observation to guide us, means had been found for counting
the numbers per minute, and it had been found that, within all                      the
attainable accuracy these are as the alternate odd numbers,                3, 7, 11,
15,  19, — this with  the greater precision the farther we prosecute our
trials.    Here then we have discovered           a periodic law      !  Nature    has
a  partiality for small numbers, — vibrating           bodies divide in harmonic
ratio,   substances  combine in       easy proportions.         So,  in seeking for
the law of light's refraction, the constancy             of the ratio of the    sines
was accepted as absolute, while, as yet, the inaccuracy of the observa
tions was so great as to cover the whole range of dispersion.                  Nay,
while we firmly hold to the simple laws of pressure and motion                       at
revealed    to us by our experiments,          may it not be that these only
exhibit close coincidences,        resulting from more deeply-seated           prin
ciples  1  "We  know of the law of velocity only from experiment,                but
the velocities observed by us are only relative variations, mere zerrtt
in comparison with the speed with which we and our apparatus                       are
hurried along.
    The function which has been under review, and its derivatives
and primitives, are all deducible from the generic property
                             - a.<f>z = n.u<f>z +  z.tt<f>z

It  may be interesting to inquire into the phases when this restriction
is removed.

merely         to fix the scale on which the z's are to be measured, and
does          not at all affect the generality of the formula.                                                   Let    us then

      If,     having only this formula to guide us, we inquire as to the
shape          of the curve represented                        by    it,      our course                 is   to compute          the
values          of the ordinate corresponding                                   to various                     values       of the
abscissa.          The           series   converges                much more                     rapidly than that for
the       oscillating chain, and the points of crossing are much more
remote;          thus the first would be found at                                           z   = 2-46740,        the second
 at   z   =    2220661,           and the third at                   z   = 61 -68503.                        These numbers
are    exactly         in    the ratios of               1,   9,    and 25, and the first of them                                  is
just Jx*.  Moreover, in the course of this arithmetical quest, we
should find that the ordinate varies within the limits + and —                                                    1                1,

     In   our original inquiry the tension at any point was measured by
the length of the chain below                  it,   but   if       we suppose            a     load w to       be
appended,         that tension will be represented                         by w      +   z,   and the condi
tion necessary for           a   simple oscillation will be expressed by
                          -ax = u{{w + z)^}           =1^x +           (w   +    z)^x,
and then the investigation becomes much more complex.                                                 On using
the same method              as before we find

in which       each new coefficient            is     deduced from the two                            preceding
ones.        In this     case the computation of the coefficients                             is   very   tedious,
while that of the function and of its derivative                                        is     more so; bat
these being found for any given                       z,   the successive                     derivatives       are
found as before, for
                                   -a.x-^e                      —(w         +   z)^!,

and thus       it   is    easy to compute            the value for any proximate value
of   z.
     The complexity in the preceding case arises from the circumstance
that the terms of the series for w.                        *x       are displaced from those                     of
z.^   ;   and that, therefore,          each new coefficient involves the two pre
ceding ones.             Now     the terms of        „*, z.x,              zP.^jc,   &c,        are all coinci
dent, and thus we are tempted to go one step farther and to                                               propose
for inquiry the condition

3.    Note on the      Biological     Tests employed in determining
        the Purity      of Water.         By A. W. Hare, M.B. Edin.

                                    Part L
     There are two experimental paths by which the facts relating to
 organic impurity in water may be approached, the chemical and the
 biological  ;  and there are two aspects in which these facta may be
 regarded, the catalytic and the fermentative.          The series of observa
 tions made in following the one path is the necessary complement
 of that met with in the other.         The path of chemical investigation
 has been well cleared, and is easily traversed ; that of biological
 inquiry is still   beset by many impediments, and is as yet by no
  means a safe one.       It is the object of many recent researches, and
  of this paper, to lessen these difficulties.        The pollution of water
  with organic substances is inevitably associated with the presence
  of  those organisms   whose function     it is in the economy    of nature  to
  disintegrate such    materials.     These organisms      in their turn     are
  dependent upon organic matter for their continued existence ; the
  Bacteriacese to which they belong being distinguished from allied
  forms by an entire absence of chlorophyll, which obliges them to
  feed only on organic substances.        The relation of these two factors
  of pollution, each to each, is therefore        a necessary   one ;  and due
   regard   must in all cases be paid to each in determining the degree
  of   pollution that their coexistence implies.             It is further of

importance       to inquire      if their relation to     one another can he more
closely     analysed,     and whether specific         features    of the one factor
are    necessarily related to         a  certain constitution      of the other.      A
well-established       case   of    such   a relationship may be here cited in
illustration, and as indicating the direction in •which the present
inquiry is to proceed.               The Beggiaioa       alba,    a •well-known    fila
mentous       organism, is an inhabitant            of warm sulphur springs, in
which      it  carries    on a definite analytical           function,   decomposing
sulphur compounds in solution in the water,                      and giving    off sul
phuretted       hydrogen.        That such facts are of frequent occurrence
is  shown by the work of Pasteur in the case of the Torula group                        ;
 while    the    elaborate      researches      of   Duclaux      exhibit   functional
specialism     in this   respect     carried to an astonishing degree of com
 plexity.     It   is not then beside the mark to press the analysis of
 aquatic microbes         one stage       further,   and    to inquire     whether, in
 addition to the fact of organic             contamination predicable from their
 presence,    there is not       a   possibility   of recognising definite species,
 associated     with    special    forms of organic material,        particularly such
 as   are derived from sewage matter.                In making this attempt           an
 initial difficulty is met with in the fact that a complete classification
 of Bacteria      according to their function             is not yet made;        their
 provisional     division    into     zymogenic,     pathogenic, and chromogenic
 forms,   though of great dialectic convenience, is of no value in practical
 questions,    for  each division is       in part overlapped by portions of        the
 other two.       A   new classification must therefore be attempted to suit
 the   conditions of this inquiry ; and that which specially commends
 itself as at once practical and well adapted to our purpose is based on
 observing the nature        of the pabulum on which various          species subsist   ;
 thus    dividing them into groups according to the complexity of their
 assimilative     processes, as higher groups of organisms              may be classi
 fied   according to their carnivorous or herbivorous habits of life.                 In
  the   case   of the Bacteria this classification             can  rest on   no  such
  obvious diversity of function, for they are distinctly                  omnivorous    ;
 but there are important differences             in the composition of the organic
  matter    in water, corresponding to the different sources from which
  it is derived, and it is not unreasonable to expect that analogous
  differences    will  be found to obtain amongst the species of microbes
  associated     with it.     Two chief sources of organic material in rivers

308           Proceedings        of Royal Society of Edinburgh,                [jcx*  20,
are to be recognised        :   the natural processes of vegetable          growth and
decay contribute a large amount of soluble material which is carried
down      by land drainage;           the other source, which            supplies both
soluble and insoluble organic matter, is the drainage of towns where
a  flushing system of sewage disposal obtains, and where its products
are poured into rivers.            There is an important difference between
the organic material derived from these two sources.                        This differ
ence does not depend            on an original diversity of character between
animal and vegetable waste products              ;   for though such a diversity is
doubtless    recognisable       by delicate tests, it is too fine a point to found
a generalisation      upon for any practical purpose.              But   the difference
that does obtain is due to the disparate                   stage    of  waste   product
decomposition in which organic matter from the two sources reaches
a   river.   In   both   cases     the disintegration        is carried on by the
analytical action of micro-organisms,              and finally results in the pro
duction of such simpler substances                 as  binary compounds of C, H,
N, and 0.        In the      vegetable    waste     products from land drainage
this process is far advanced, and the resulting materials are in a
soluble and much simplified form by the time they reach the river
water   ;  whereas    in the animal and        vegetable waste products present
in   sewage the process is only commencing,                and in places where the
drains are flushed into a river, additional insoluble matter may be
introduced, and may pass far down the stream before even the first
stage of its disintegration takes place, rendering               it soluble, and thru
in   a position for the completion          of the    process.     It  remains then to
inquire, in regard to the disintegration of organic matter, whether
the same microbes         are present throughout the whole process,               or one
group of ferments is replaced by another in correspondence                     with the
 constantly changing chemical equations that express                        the several
 stages    by which it        advances.     That    the latter is the case, analogy
strongly suggests, and experimental results go far to prove.                      As an
 analogous     case,   that of the       fermentation of sugar offers            a good
 example, where the first stage of the process is due to the action of
 the Torula     cereviseas,    and concludes     with the formation of alcohol          ;
 the further stage of acetous              fermentation being produced by a
distinct species, the Mycoderma aceti.                 A  similar   case  is that of the
 lactic fermentation of milk, where                 Bacterium      lartis initiates  the
process,     changing        lactose   into   lactic acid,     at    which    point  the

1887.]              Mr A. W. Hare            on the    Purity of Water.                309
Bacillus butyris makes its appearance, and from the lactic produces
butyric acid.           It   is difficult to prove       distinctly that the same      law-
holds      true     in   the   disintegration       of so complex a compound as
sewage      matter    ;   but the direct evidence         obtained from the investi
gation of decomposing animal solutions points to that conclusion.
In    such a substance          Bacterium termo and its congeners appear, and
carry on their            special functions         of decomposition in         a  definite
sequence,        one    group commencing it labours where another has
completed its special share               in the    process.     In  the sequel,    it will
appear,      from a series of observations              recently made, that different
species     of microbes preponderate             in  the different areas of a sewage-
laden river, and          it will  be attempted       to show how these distinctions
 [tfobahly depend on the advance                of  successive fermentative processes
from stage to stage,           pari passu with       the flow of the river from point
 to point,      from its initial area of sewage contamination                    till it is
 restored     to a state of relative purity.               In  the meantime,     however,
 the    status     of    microbes      in   water    of different qualities requires
 attention.       For      the   purpose      of description it is convenient to
 'lifferentiate      four qualities of         water,    viz., distilled   water,   spring
 water,    river water, and dilute sewage.
     1.  Distilled Water. — The            absence of organic matter prevents any
 great     development of             microbes     in this     medium.      Yet marked
 iliversities    are    found in the behaviour of different               species  in this
 respect       Whilst it        has been shown by Crookes,            Tidy, and Odling
 that    Bacillus     anthracis does not long survive its introduction into
 distilled water, and by          P. Frankland that         the same is true of Koch's
 Comma       bacillus and of Tinkler's and Prior's bacillus, yet it has been
 shown      that the hardy Bacillus pyocyaneus                  is capable of surviving
 for a    considerable time in such conditions, and that, in the first
 place,   it  even     increases     in numbers (P. Frankland).             Many of    the
 ordinary species present in atmospheric               dust are also capable of living
 in distilled water ; hence the necessity known to                  all bacteriologists of
 keeping     distilled water used for microscopic purposes rigidly free from
 direct    contact      with    the air, and of frequently           obtaining supplies
 freshly     prepared.        But   these contaminations, though very serious
 where exactitude           of microscopic observation is at stake, have no
 immediate      hygienic importance,          and we may consider distilled          water
  at least as    an absolutely safe substance for human consumption.

     2. Spring      Water. — Water from     deep wells is always,      in the     first
instance, nearly free from the .presence of microbes; that from shallow
 wells may be seriously contaminated with sewage matter, and may
be loaded with organisms.            Deep wells in the chalk at times supply
 water      rich in organic     matter,  but which      only yields evidence          of
microbic activity after it has stood for a             time in contact with        the
air.      In   such   cases   it is not unfrequently         more  crowded with
 organisms       even than river water,    — a condition probably        due to the
smaller number of species present in such cases            ; for thus the struggle
of opposing vital requirements is avoided, and the total sum of                   pos
 sible individual life thereby increased.
     3.   River    Water. — Glacier water is free from microbes,         but in all
 other cases river water contains a larger or smaller number of micro
 organisms,       depending on the relative amount of organic matter that
 it holds in solution.         The nature of the land drained by        a  river,  the
 presence       or absence of direct sewage infection,         and the speed          of
 its flow, are the chief conditions affecting the purity of its                water.
 As will      be shown   in  the second   part of this paper, the popular         sen
 timent in favour of rapid and tumultuous                 rivers as a source          of
 domestic       supply is probably based on       a  misconception, and is       com
 pletely at variance with sound deductions from the facts of the                case.
     4.   Setoarje. — The rich supplies of organic matter here      present permit
 of an enormous development of          microbes, but the fermentative activity
 thus established       is of a duration inversely proportional to its inten
 sity.      After   a maximum       development occurring on the third or
 fourth day, a rapid decrease is observed in the number of microbes,
 so that in the course of a week to ten days there may be a smaller
 number in a sample of sewage than in a stored specimen                      of  river
  water (Bischof).        In  this  case the large  amount of food material           is
  rapidly exhausted        by the disproportionate production of microbe
  life  ;  and when tho supply comes to an end, the death-rate               amongst
  the microbes      is for a time excessive.
      "We must now turn           to the tests employed in determining              the
  number and varieties of microbes           present  in  water, and inquire into
  their accuracy and reliability.        Various methods have been        suggested,
  some giving       quantitative, othera qualitative results.         It  is obvious
  that    a  method giving reliable information on both points is desirable,
  since the total number of microbes           present   in  a specimen of water

gives an indication of the quantity of organic matter necessarily                                 pre
sent       for   the support of so much            life ; . and    the special forms present
and their proportion to one another,                     is no less important, from the
indication thus given, as the sequel will show, of the state of decom
position         at which such organic material has arrived.
             Of the purely quantitative biological                 tests that by      " dilution    "
     (a)
may be mentioned, employed by                       Fol and Dun ant              It   consists     in
enormously          diluting the sample to be tested with germless water in
a   known proportion, and in inoculating a large number of culture
glasses with equal quantities of this mixture.                           The proportion of the
culture glasses remaining sterile to those showing microbe                            life   affords
a   basis for calculating the number of germs                       in   the original specimen.
This method is inexact                ;   it labours under        the twofold disadvantage
of depending on perfect mechanical                       mixing under great difficulties,
and of the certainty that the culture fluid used could not suit the re
quirements of every microbe present; some, therefore, would not grow
in   it,    and would be omitted from the calculation.                      When      the number
thus obtained           is   multiplied by the number of dilutions previously
carried out, the omissions thus made                       will   be multiplied,      and the re
sulting error in the calculated               total most serious.
     (b)    Of the purely qualitative methods                     may be mentioned that by
" fractional cultivation," successfully
                                        employed by Lister in                             separat
ing species from one another.                  It    is,   however,      so laborious as to be
inapplicable for practical purposes, although                       it   was primarily instru
mental        in establishing       the important scientific principle of specificity
amongst microbes.
      (c)   Another method           is    that proposed          by Dupre, in which the
nature of organic impurities present                        is    determined by observing
changes in the aeration of water, the                       gases absorbed       and given off
giving an index of the amount of vital action occurring in the speci
men investigated.              It    must be seriously doubted whether this can
ever        be   developed     into an accurate             method of observation            :    the
factors of sewage contamination are so variable under varied condi
tions, that        a   uniformity of results        is   scarcely to be hoped for        ;    while
there       is   room for so many fallacies in this method, that                        it   would
require confirmation from others before its results could be accepted.
     (d)     By far the        best method          of determining the number and
varieties of microbes            in water     is   that introduced by Koch.                  It   con

  sists in mixing a sample of water of definite             bulk with     a quantity     of
  liquefied nutrient jelly previously sterilised.             This mixture is poured
  on a sterile glass plate with aseptic         precautions.       When it solidifies,
  the microbes     in it are fixed and develop, each becoming the centre of
  a  colony growing in the jelly, and each colony representing a
                                                                                   " pure
  cultivation" of its       parent    germ.      The    number      of such colonies
  bears a definite relation to the total number of microbes                  present    in
  the original sample of water, and their varied appearances show with
 what diversity of species the sample was inhabited.                    Species which
  cannot be recognised        in this way at once may be identified by re
 moving a portion of one such colony to a separate quantity                             of
 culture material, in which its characteristic           growth may be separately
 observed.       A convenient form of        apparatus       is shown     in Plate X.
 It   consists of a deep glass bell of 8 inches inside diameter,               standing
 in a glass dish that closely fits its mouth.                  Within    are alternate
 square glass plates and india-rubber washers, fitting closely to the
 inside of the bell-jar.       When the       apparatus      is closed it will travel
 safely without any movement of the plate, and can thus be conveyed
 to the near vicinity of the water which it is desired                  to test.     The
 plates    are   sterilised by heating at           170°   C for      one     hour, and
 the rings by       steeping    them    in  1   per    cent,   aqueous     solution     of
 perchloride of mercury for twenty-four                 hours.     A   piece of     thick
 filter paper soaked in the same solution is placed in the floor of the
 apparatus.       A  series  of ten or twelve plates is contained in the
 apparatus.      In making observations the upper two or three of these
              used as " control plates, since they run the greatest risk of
 should be                          "
 aerial contamination from their longer exposure                to the air in manipu
 lating    the apparatus.         They    are    charged      with   a layer      of the
 nutrient jelly alone without the addition of the water to be tested.
 Tf they give negative          results, i.e.    if  the layer of nutrient          jelly
upon them shows           no   foci   of microbic growth, the manipulative
procedure      in the     experiment     may      be    considered     reliable.      In
examining       a river    for microbes      at different parts of          its course,
one such set of twelve plates            may advantageously be used at each
point, a measured        quantity of the water being used in each case,
so that the experiments          may have uniformity of scale throughout,
Two such experimental plates             are shown in Plate           XI., in which
the results of the test are shown             in   the case    of a river examined

immediately              above, and again immediately below a source of sewage
contamination.                   The results obtained by this method in the case of
a    rapid river with gross sewage contamination                            will   be detailed       in
the second          part of this paper, where                special attention     will   be drawn
to the         way in which this test is of value in associating                      special forms
of microbes          with        special   conditions of organic           decomposition, thus
acting as a qualitative test of some degree of definite value                               in   deter
mining the purity of water.
       (e)   Another biological method                 is    an extension of the preceding.
Having found by the preceding                         method what organisms               are usual
inhabitants of               a   river, the introduction         of   a   foreign organism         at   a
certain point, and its recovery from the stream at another                                  by plate
cultivations,            may give valuable evidence              as to the condition of the
river-water          between        these points.       The organism so employed must
be    perfectly distinctive                in its   mode     of growth, and its relation to
other organisms well known, as also its powers of survival and mul
tiplication         in   a   variety of conditions.            Given these data, much may
be   learned from its behaviour                 in various      areas of the river examined.
In   the second part of the paper such an experiment                           will   be described.
     In the present              state of our knowledge           of water     testing,   it     would
be   unwise to discard the methods of chemical examination for any
one,      or   a   combination, of the above biological tests.                        But    some of
them,        and particularly that of Koch, are capable of affording strong
corroboration             of the results obtained by chemical tests; and                          sinco
it   is      its vital rather than its purely chemical contaminations that
render water             a   source of danger to the health of the human subject,
it   may safely           be predicted that, when extended and rendered                             yet
more         exact, these biological tests              will   become an essential element
in the experimental determination of the purity of water.

    Faint traces of green and yellow were seen in the mock suns at
 10h 10m.      The mock suns and horizontal white bar were about 24°
 above    the horizon at      9b.  As the sun      rose higher the bar curved
 upwards,    and at noon was as sketched in fig. 5.                The bar then
 extended     inside the halo     A  almost to the sun, which it had not
done    in the morning.
    The following measurements          were got at various times during the
 forenoon of the different parts by        Mr Rankin : —

above    the sun    ;  but the arc D only touched the halo C, its red
combining apparently with the blue of C.

inside it another ring, as in fig.               7.    The outer ring was a                 distinct
halo,  with      red inside and blue outside;                 radius of red = 22"                 12'.

   August 19, 1887. — Glories seen about 9h 40™. Two rings distinct,
and two others outside these indistinct.                 Red outside in alL          The
colour next the shadow was yellow             ;  between its red (i.e., red1) and red2
was violet, and between red2 and red3 green.                  No  measurements got.
   A   fog-bow was seen at        9h 45™1,    with glory inside it round       shadow.

The violet was        a  broad band reaching nearly,           if not    quite, to the
shadow.
   Two other measurements             of different glories about the        same time
gave for radius of red, 3° 4' and 3° 13'.
   Misty glories      were seen at various times during the day.

both  cases].
   In   3 the   green and red were the most              distinct colours     ;  yellow
barely visible.
   When clouds         or fog blew up the corrie where the glory was                seen
the colours got blurred and indistinct.

     In   a paper which        I     read before          the Society in 1879,                    I gave   the
results      of   an investigation        I   had made                   with    the object of deter
mining the probability, that a man marrying at any age over 40,
will, or will not, have children                      ;   and        I    have now extended the
same      enquiry to men of all               ages.         The statistics upon which my
former conclusions rested, related to 339 marriages                                     entered      into by
peers     and their near relations, above the                             age    of 40, and were ex
tracted from Lodge's Peerage for the year 1871.                                        For all statistical
enquiries         this work  in my opinion, greatly preferable to any of
                               is,
the other         works that give records of the British Peerage.   The
principal ground for this opinion                         is,   that Lodge usually gives the
dates     of birth of the daughters              of each family, as well                        as those    of
the sons     ;    whereas     other Peerages              generally omit those dates, and
 place the         names of the daughters (without any dates) after the
 names       of    the sons, so that        impossible to tell whether
                                                it        is

they are older or younger than their brothers.                   In the     case  of a
few families this practice          is also adopted      in Lodge, presumably
by special      desire  of, the head      of the family; and it is a matter
of regret      that this,     together    with   other    circumstances        to   be
presently mentioned, diminishes the value of the book for statistical
purposes.
    I  could have greatly increast the above mentioned number of
facts,  if  I  had not thought it desirable altogether to exclude the
               of  the              given under the heading,
                                                                         " Collateral
marriages                 persons
Branches".        But   a very slight     examination of the book, was suffi
cient to satisfy me that the information as to the collateral branches
of each family, was very much less trustworthy than that relating
 to the immediate       family.     There appears to be no very precise rule
according to which persons           are transferred from the portion          of  the
work relating to the immediate family, which is printed in larger
type, to the "Collateral Branches", printed in smaller type.                   When
 the title has descended to the present holder from his father and
 grandfather, the name of the peer is given in the first instance,
 with his date of birth, his date of succession            to the title, and full
 particulars of his marriages.           Then follow the names and dates of
 birth of his children,       the dates of their marriages,        if any, and the
 dates of death of any who have died.              In   the case of the married
 sons, similar    information is given as to their children            ;   but this is
 very rarely done in the case of the married daughters.                After all the
 usual information has thus been given as to the peer and his descend
 ants, we have       the name of the peer's father, with similar inform
 ation   as to  himself, his marriages, his children (other than the peer),
 and their marriages.         As in the case of the peer, no information is
 given as to the children of the married daughters,               the sisters   of the
 peer; but full        information     is given as to the          children of the
  married sons, the brothers of the peer;             in other words, we have
  information as to the nephews and nieces of the peer who trace then-
  descent through the male line.
     In   some cases we next have the peer's grandfather, with inform
  ation as to his children, who are the uncles and aunts of the peer                   :
  and, as   in former    cases, we have    information   as to the   children of the
  uncles, but not as to the children of the aunts              ;  and we thus get
  particulars as to the first cousins of the peer who trace their descent

through the male line.                     In   other     cases, the name        of   the grandfather
is not given, but under the Collateral Branches we have the names
of     the uncles and aunts                    of the peer, with particulars                 as     to their
children       and grandchildren through the male line.                                    In still other
cases, when all the                  uncles      and aunts of the peer are dead, the
particulars as to them                     are no longer given             ;   hut the children of
the uncles (who are cousins of the peer) are placed among the
Collateral Branches, and information is given as to the marriages of
the males and their children, and as to the marriages and children
of more distant male relatives,                         whose      number is sometimes                    very
great.
     An examination of                a   single copy of Lodge's Peerage was sufficient
to show that the information                           as to     the collateral branches,                 lacks
the completeness             that is necessary              for the purposes           I   had in view.
We constantly find it                     stated there          that a particular man is dead,
but no date of death is given                      ;   or that he is married and has issue,
but the date of marriage                       and the names of his children are not
given.        The     book claims to be corrected                         by the nobility             ;   and,
although this may tend to secure accuracy as regards the immediate
family, the information                   as    to the collateral branches                   is,   in many
cases,   just such          as   might be given by the head of the family, in
correcting the proofs from memory.                               He   has not      kept up intimate
relations with the numerous                       younger branches of the family                      ;   but,
on looking          through the proofs, and coming upon the name of                                          a
cousin     or other more remote relative, he remembers                                     having heard
that     he   is    dead,    or that he            is     married        and has       children       ;    and
having no record                 at hand         that will give him the exact                        date of
marriage       or death, he contents himself                       with stating the            mere fact
of     marriage      or death,            without         the    date.    A     comparison           of the
editions of Lodge for different years, subsequently proved that the in
formation as to the collateral branches                          is   in other   respects          deficient,
and that the marriages and births                          of children         among them            are not
regularly recorded in the work, from year to year,                               as   they take place;
in fact, sometimes                                      not recorded for many years after
                                                  it is
                                 a   marriage
it   has taken place         ;       and when             is    first mentioned,       a    long list of
children of the marriage                  is    given in addition.              The fact, therefore,
that   a   man whose             name appears             among       the collateral branches in
Lodge's       Peerage       for any year,          is     not stated to have been married,

cannot be accepted as evidence that he is not at that time married ;
and the fact that a married man is not mentioned as having children,
cannot be accepted             as evidence    that he has none.                     Another circum
stance, which diminishes the value of Lodge's Peerage for statistical
investigation, is the practice               adopted           in    some families of giving,
among     the collateral branches,                the names,           &c, only of the " last
surviving"       uncles, aunts,      &c, omitting all mention of                           those        who
are dead.        It   is clear   that we may fall into very serious                       errors    if   we
draw conclusions from incomplete information                                   of    this kind,         and
that very careful         consideration is necessary to determine what use
may safely be made of it.
     Such were the reasons                which led me, on the former occasion,
to    reject all the facts relating                     to the collateral             branches      ;    but
further consideration showed me that, although the                                        information
as to the       collateral branches               is,   on the whole, much less trust
worthy      than that as to the immediate                             family,        yet we cannot
safely    lay    down          the rule,     to     take       the     latter       and    reject        the
former; for,      as we have           seen, no strict line can be drawn between
the two;        the uncles and aunts and cousins                         being sometimes                 in
cluded in the immediate                family, and sometimes among the collateral
branches.        In   fact, we find, on comparing the editions for different
years, that uncles and aunts and cousins, who are given in one year's
Peerage as members of the immediate                          family, will, after the lapse of
some years, when the peer has died, be transferred to the collateral
branches     in the new volume.                    The distinction, therefore, between
the collateral branches             and the immediate                family,    is   one that cannot
be acted upon in practice; and we must seek for some other distinc
tion.
     Even among the immediate                 family, the information given                         is   not
always full and trustworthy;                        and the           facte     given in        Lodge's
Peerage     for one year,            sometimes           differ from those             given in the
edition for another year, or in Foster's work to be presently men
tioned.     Careful examination soon showed                            me that the cases where
the information           is   most defective and least trustworthy, are those
of recent       titles.        "When    a   man         is   created    a     peer who         has been
married many years, the information as to his children                                    is   often less
full, and apparently less accurate, than in the case of peers who
inherited their titles          ;   and I   therefore          came to the conclusion that*

in  the present enquiry,       it would    be desirable     to reject every mairiage
entered into by a commoner             who was subsequently created a peer.
For the      same reason,     if   a son was married before           hia father was
created a peer,      I rejected   the son's marriage.         Similar considerations
apply to the cases where a peer did not succeed to the title in the
ordinary     way, but establisht         his claim to a title that had been
dormant for some time, or succeeded               a distant relative ; and to the
cases where a peer was placed upon the                roll of   peers  in consequence
of the    reversal of an attainder against           an ancestor.       When     a man's
name has stood for a long series of years upon the roll of peers,
each fact as to his marriage,             and as to the births and deaths or
marriages of his children, is usually recorded                 as it takes   place, and
tbere is little risk of error or omission           ;    but when a man is created
a   peer,    or succeeds      under     the    exceptional circumstances           above
mentioned, the facts as to his family are not on record in the same
way, and have to be supplied by himself.                    No doubt in     some cases
the new peer will give this information with all tho desired accuracy,
 but in a good many cases he will not                  ;  and, as  it  is not possible
 to say    with certainty in which cases the information is                    complete
 and exact, and in which it is defective or incorrect,                         the   only
 safe  course     is to reject the whole of the            cases  as clearly liable to
 error.
    In  the present        investigation     I  have,     as before,    taken Lodge's
 Peerage for 1871         as my starting point; but          I have   made extensive
 use also of the new Peerage by Foster, publisht                    for the first time
 in 1880, and       I  think it right to mention that this has supplied a
 good   many dates and other facts which are not given in Lodge.
 Not only      are a great number of additional dates of birth, marriage,
 and death given — principally among the collateral branches                   — but in
 many    cases    the names and dates of birth of children which                  are not
 mentioned at all in Lodge.            Foster seems not to have relied on the
 somewhat questionable assistance               of the peers       themselves      in  re
 vising the proof sheets, but to have obtained in many cases docu
 mentary evidence          in addition     to that which        the editor of Lodge
 has   used.       Foster's   Peerage     also   gives information,        omitted by
  Lodge,    as   to the children      of the married daughters            of the peers
 and of their relatives.         It  cannot, however,        be safely used by itself
 for ordinary statistical purposes ; for            it not only omits         the dates

  332          Proceedings       of Royal Society of Edinburgh.                            4,
  of birth of         the  females   of the family, and places the             names of
  the sisters in a family after the names of all the brothers,                      bat it
  also systematically omits         all mention of children who died              young :
  and when children have grown up to maturity and died                       unmarried,
  they also are often omitted.
      A   careful examination of various Peerages                has    left  upon     my
   mind the      general     impression that too         much reliance should          not
  bo placed      upon individual        facts  contained in them.             There     are
  many sources of error, which are in practice not sufficiently                 guarded
  against.    Sometimes         an obvious misprint is made in the                edition
  for one year,        and is repeated      without     correction in the       editions
  for several     successive     years.    In    a few    cases   there    seems     good
  ground for         behoving     Foster's statement,       that    the    information
  furnisht    by      members      of the     peerage,    has    been     intentionally
  incorrect.     Occasionally, though very rarely, the marriage of                 a peer
  or his son is mentioned in one Peerage and not in another                   ; and the
 same is the case with regard to the issue of some marriages.                      These
 inaccuracies,     however, are not sufficiently numerous to produce anj
  appreciable     effect upon the        general   results of an enquiry of           the
 present    kind   ;   and  I  think that, if proper precautions are           adopted,
 the vital statistics furnisht by the records of the British                   Peerage,
 are moro      complete       and trustworthy than we can hope to                 get in
 almost     any other way.           Perhaps better statistics might            be    got
 from the       records     of some of the Widows'             Funds which         grant
 benefits to the children, as well as to the widows, of members                   ; but,
 in the absence of these,          I  think   the   Peerage statistics the best        we
have.
     Taking now       a general   survey of the facts supplied by the          Peerage,
 we see that they relate to different classes of persons, and that all
 the    facts  so     supplied are not equally trustworthy.               "We   may,     I
think, assume that, in general, the facta relating to each peer will                   be
the most complete             and trustworthy;        that those     relating    to   his
children during his life will be almost (or quite) as trustworthy; and
that the information will become less trustworthy in proportion as
the relationship to the peer of the day, is moro distant.                    We   have,
in   the case of every peer included in our list, the necessary informa
tion as to his sons, and their sons               (if  any), also as to his father,
his brothers,        and their sons (who are the             peer's   nephews).       In

1887.]           Mr T. B. Sprague          on a  Fruitful Marriage.                  333
some cases we have also particulars as to the grandfather (heing the
father's      father), the father's brothers, and their               sons,    who are
respectively uncles and cousins to the peer.                The existing peer at any
time may thus he regarded              as the central figure of a group, around
whom are arranged            his different relations,      at a greater or less dis
tance, according as their degree of relationship is more or less remote.
     Assuming now that the precautions               we have taken have          secured
that    all the     facts we extract from the Peerages             are equally trust
worthy, we have next to consider whether they are all equally suit
able   for our     purpose.      Our object is to obtain particulars of a large
number       of  marriages,    which may be considered           as a  fair sample of
the    whole ; and then to        ascertain  how many of these resulted in the
 birth of issue, and how many were childless.                If,  then, we extract     all
 the marriages of the peer and of his above-mentioned                   relations,   will
 these give us a fair average of cases suitable for the solution of our
 problem?         Or is    there    anything    in the principle on which our
 selection     of facts is made, that renders            the marriages       we    select
 unsuitable representatives          of the general body      1    One such circum
  stance becomes obvious at first sight.              The peer may be single, or
  married ; and       if the latter,    he may    either have children, or have
  none.     The   same is the case      with  regard to his sons, his grandsons,
  his brothers, his nephews,          his uncles, and his cousins        ; but we     see
  that his father and his grandfather had at least one son each ; each
  of them,    in  fact,  being    included in our list for the very reason that
  he had     a son.      It  follows that,    if  we include      in our enquiry the
  information     regarding the fathers and the grandfathers of the peers,
  we shall    not obtain trustworthy results        ;  for we shall have an undue
  proportion      of fruitful marriages.         If   we  include in our list the
   marriages   of the peers' fathers, we must, in order to get the proper
   proportion of childless marriages,         include also the marriages of all
   their contemporaries      who were married and had no children              ;  but to
   attempt   this would,     I believe,   be an impracticable task.         If we took
   only those    fathers of peers who were themselves                peers, we might
   perhaps   obtain a suitable body of statistics, by taking the marriages

   some cases    these were      succeeded    by their brothers, or nephews, or
   other  relatives; and all         cases  of   this kind could probably             be
   'raced without any great difficulty ; but, in a numher of other cases,

such    peers   have had no male relations to inherit the title,                    which
has therefore     become extinct.          In order to       trace out cases      of this
kind, it would be necessary to have a complete                    set  of old volumes
of the Peerage,       and ascertain       by an examination of them which
titles became extinct each year, in consequence                   of the peer having
died without issue, although he was married.                     From several       points
of view this would be a very interesting enquiry, but it was one
which    I  was not    in   a position to undertake          : and   if  I  had desired
to do so,    I cannot      see   how it would have been possible               to decide
how far back the enquiry should                    extend, so as to include            the
proper number of holders of extinct titles, but not too many of
them.      In  a certain number of cases,              moreover,    the peers' fathers
were not themselves            peers, but were        untitled men belonging to a
younger branch of the family            ; and     I  imagine it would be quite im
possible to lay down any principle upon which to determine                         all the
persons who may fairly, for the present purpose, be considered                       their
contemporaries.         The difficulty, however,          is completely got over by
excluding from consideration the marriages of the fathers and grand
fathers of our peers, or, speaking more correctly, the marriages from
which our peers were descended.               I   have, therefore,    if a peer's father
or grandfather was married twice, or three, or four times,                      excluded
from consideration the marriage from which the peer was descended,
but    have   made      use     of the remaining           marriages,  — subject to      a
correction that will be hereafter            explained.         I have also, in a few
cases, rejected    all   the facts relating to certain peers, when, from very
exceptional circumstances,           such as residence         in  a foreign country,
the information was obviously incomplete.
    Another circumstance           may be noted: — The peers themselves                are
all alive at     the    time at which our observations              begin,    and their
fathers and grandfathers are all dead              ;  but their sons, their brothers,
and their uncles, may be either living or dead                     There seems, how
ever,   no reason for thinking that the fact that all the peers are
living, will affect to any appreciable             extent,  if at all,  the probability
of their marriages being fruitful.
    As  already mentioned, my investigation commenced                      with Lodge's
Peerage for 1871.           The principal object was to ascertain what pro
portion of marriages          were   fruitful   :  and as many marriages           which
are not   fruitful   at once, become        so in later years,      it would     be  com

 paratively useless         to   include    in the observations any existing
 marriages      that had subsisted for less than, say, ten years.             I have
 therefore     taken no account of any marriage              entered into after the
year 1870, these being the latest recorded               in the Peerage for 1871 ;
.ind by examination of Lodge's and Burke's Peerages                     for 1884,    I
ascertained      in  regard to each marriage       whether it had been fruitful
up to the year 1883 inclusive.             Thus every marriage included in my
observations,       has either been dissolved by death (or divorce), or has
subsisted     for at least thirteen years.
    Proceeding, then, on the principles explained,             I obtained informa
tion as to the marriages           of the   peers of 1870 and certain of their
male relations ; and although, as far as             I could  see, the facte   stated
in the Peerage with regard to all of these, were equally trustworthy
and suitable for my purpose,           I decided,   as a matter of precaution, to
extract    and tabulate separately,        the facts   relating to the following
classes of men         :— (1) the peers       whose    names    are given in the
Peerage for 1871; (2) their fathers; (3) their grandfathers;                      (4)
their sons ; (5) their brothers ; (6) their uncles, being the fathers'
brothers ; and       I did   not consider it desirable to extend the enquiry
to the peers' nephews,          or cousins, or more remote relations.
    To each marriage           was assigned    a distinctive     number, and the
particulars     were then written       in a book   in  the following form    : —

    It  is clear that from materials      of this kind we can obtain much
information,       not   only   as to  the   probability    of   a  marriage    being
fruitful, but      as  to the number of children to a marriage,             the    pro
bability     that they will be sons or daughters,             the length of       time
that elapses between         marriage and the birth of the first          child, and
the intervals between         the births of successive children, fee           If   the
age of the        wife could also have been ascertained              in every case,
much interesting information could have                 been obtained as to the
 probability of a wife of any age having issue                ;  but it is only in
exceptional       cases  that the age of the wife can be determined — in
fact, only when she is a daughter             belonging to one of the peerage
 families.      On the present occasion      I confine   myself to the considera
tion of the one point           as to the probability of the marriage           being
 fruitful.      If any  child has been born of a marriage,        I have  considered
 it  as a  fruitful   marriage, although all the children            may have died
 young in the lifetime of the father.
     The number of marriages which are included in my observations
 are, of peers      427; of their     sons,  199; of their brothers, 511; of
 their uncles, 384.        On grouping     these according      to age at marriage,
 I obtained the       Bgures shown in the following table          (A) : —
      A  comparison     of these figures shows us that the percentages               for
  the brothers and uncles agree very well together, and that the                    pro
  portion of childless marriages is very much greater among these
  two classes taken together, than among the peers and their sons.
  This    appears     more   clearly   when    the    figures    are   combined        as
  shown in table (B) : —

   The       percentages                 here          run          so regularly,                     and the                 differences
between       those relating to the two sets of observations are so great,
that we are forced                  to the conclusion that the differences                                                    cannot be
accidental,        but that there must                                  be something                        in    the manner of
compiling our statistics,                         that necessarily                          causes the percentage                                  of
childless marriages to be greater at all                                             ages among the brothers and
uncles,    than among the peers and their sons.                                                              It       was not long

difference   ;    — in       fact,  I          found that my class of peers' brothers,                                                            in

eluded a certain number                   of their elder brothers who had died without
male issue.         In       some cases, these were                  themselves                 peers, and were
succeeded by their younger brothers.                               In other            cases, they were the
eldest sons or nephews of peers, and would have                                               succeeded             to the
title   if they had lived             ;    but they died before the succession                                      to the
title opened to them, so that the next brother succeeded.                                                     If     these
men     had left sons who succeeded                              to the title, they would have
appeared        in my classification               as peers' fathers               ;    but in consequence
of their having no sons, they are placed                                           in my         class       of     peers'
brothers    :    and this circumstance causes that class to include                                                        an
undue proportion                 of men           who died without issue.                                The         same
remark applies to the class of peers'                                   uncles,             which        includes a
number of elder brothers of the peers' fathers, who died without
leaving issue.               The obvious way of eliminating                                      this        source of
error is to exclude from observation all such elder brothers of the
peers, and all uncles who were elder brothers of the fathers                                                  ;    and     to
consider only the younger brothers of the peers, and the younger
brothers of the fathers, who, for brevity, may be called                                                 " younger
uncles".         When this                was done,        I     got the           figures        shown           in the

   Comparing the figures for the younger brothers and the younger
uncles, we see that,                 excluding the very few marriages                                   at 60            and

1887.]           Mr T. B. Sprague                               cm         a   Fruitful Marriage.                                      339
upwards, the proportion of childless marriages is at all                                                                    ages greater
among the brothers than among                                              the uncles.                      Similarly,           referring
back to Table A, we                  see        that the proportion of childless marriages
among the sons of peers, is at all ages greater                                                                   than among            the
peers themselves.                    In both                    casts,              therefore,               the        proportion           of
childless marriages              is greater in the younger generation.                                                            This is
quite consistent          with        the proposition                                   laid down by many writers,
that there is a constant tendency in the families of the peerage,
and of ruling classes generally, to die out                                               ;     and         it    suggests a tempt
ing field of enquiry.                       No doubt many interesting and valuable
results would be obtained,                        if            the experience                       of several successive
generations      of the peerage families, were investigated with regard
to both their mortality                         and their                       fecundity          ;        but, although the
figures     above   given, as far as they go, certainly support the idea
that a gradual deterioration is taking place in the peerage families,
the figures       involved are too small to be accepted                                                                 as giving      any
conclusive evidence on the point.
  It     is now time to compare                                 the results thus far obtained, with
those given in my former paper, which related only to men over 40 at
marriage.        For this            purpose,               my former figures are entered in the

son3, (2) their younger brothers and their fathers' younger brothers.

    The statistics       I  formerly made use of, differed from the present
 ones     in two   respects   : —
     1.    They included a number of fathers of peers, all of whom, of
 course (as pointed out           in  the early part of this paper), left sons to
 inherit the title.         The exclusion of these fathers from the present
 observations,      has a tendency to increase the proportion of childless
 marriages.
    2.     They included a number of elder brothers of the peers and
 elder brothers of their fathers,            these   being men whose        male    issue
failed, that is to say, men who had either no children at alL or
 only daughters,        or  if they had      a son or sons, their male        issue had
all died, and the title had therefore descended to a younger branch
of the family.           The exclusion of these men has a tendency to
reduce the proportion of childless marriages.
    These      two tendencies        are therefore    in   opposite  directions   ; and,
as    it   happens,    they to a great extent neutralize each other,                  the
aggregate       result    being that        my present      observations show         197
marriages        of men over 40, of which 84, or 42-6                  per cent, were
childless;      against    339 marriages      formerly considered,      of which 137,
or 40'4 per cent, were childless.*
    Comparing now the figures shown in Table                D with   those in Table B.
 we see that the exclusion of the elder brothers, and                   of the fathers'
 elder brothers, has had              the  effect of reducing the proportion            of
 childless marriages         at   all ages,  with  a trifling exception     at the ages
 40-49      ; the reduction being particularly noticeable at the ages under
 30, at which        more than half        the total marriages      took place.       The
 new percentages          given in Table        D for the younger brothers and
the younger uncles,             are   much nearer to those for the peers              and
their sons, than are our original figures in Table B, which related
 to all     the brothers and        all the uncles ; but we see that at all ages,
the percentages         for the younger brothers and the younger uncles,
are    still  greater than the corresponding ones for the peers and                 their
sons    ; — in other words, that          at all ages there is a less proportion        of
childless marriages          among      the peers and their sons, than there is
among the younger brothers of the peers, and their fathers' younger
   *
      Including, as hereafter explained, certain marriages of the fathers and
grandfathers of peers, the total number of marriages of men over 40 included
in the present observations, is 259, of which 118, or 45 '5 per cent, were childless.

1887.]            Mr T. B. Sprague on a Fruitful Marriage.                                                                                  341
brothers.          An explanation of this fact                                    soon suggests                        itself.              Com
paring the position of an unmarried peer with that of his brothers,
it      likely that the former, being in
     seems                                                                              possession of the estates
which go along with the title, will feel                                               more                free        to follow             his
personal inclinations in the selection of                                         a   wife, than will be the case
with his younger brothers                              ; and          the     same remark                          applies        to the
peer's    eldest     son, and to the eldest                                 son of this eldest son, as com
pared    with their younger                           brothers.              In       other words, they may be
expected          as a   rule to marry wives who are personally attractive,
being young and of                           healthy             constitutions               ;       while              the      younger
brothers may more frequently marry for money, the wife being in
many cases          an heiress who, from her age, or from being herself an
only     child, is less likely to have                                      children.               For           the     purpose              of
testing this supposition,                         I    next examined all the 626 marriages                                                     of
peers     and their sons, and noted                                 which of them were entered                                               into

     As   the numbers we are now dealing                       with are smaller than before,
 the results do not proceed with so much regularity                                  as those we
 formerly obtained.              The figures relating to the sons of peers, how
 ever, strongly support the above views                      ;  as a much larger proportion
 of the younger sons are childless, than is the case with those sons
 who married as heir-apparent.                     The same is not the             case,    with    the
 peers  ;    in   fact,    if we take those          peers who married under 40, the
 figures    in   the two classes are         :—

the results being thus practically                      identical       One reason at             on<v
suggests        itself why the difference between the two classes should
be much less among               the peers than among               the sons ; namely, that
among         the peers who did not marry as peer or heir-apparent,                                   a
large    proportion may at the time of their marriage                            have had, from
special circumstances,            a practical certainty of succeeding                 to the title    ;
for instance, through being heir-presumptive to an elderly unmarried
peer ;     but     I have     not at present attempted to follow up this idea.
    Combining           the peers and sons of peers, we get the following

1887.]           Mr T. B. Sprague on a Fruitful Marriage.                               343
     A    study      of   the   results thus far        obtained,    satisfied    me    that
the      most     satisfactory      course      would    he    to   arrange      my    facts
into two        classes, the first relating to those             men who married as
peer or heir-apparent,               aad tlie     second    to those      who did       not
For      business     purposes,     we of course      prefer to err,    if  at all, on the
side of safety         ;  for  instance,     in calculating     the   risk attaching       to
an insurance against              the   birth of   issue, to take    the probability       of
issue rather above than below tho truth, and thus to make                            use of
that body of facts which                gives   the smallest     probability     of failure
•of issue.
     In    order    to increase      the number of the facts, especially at the
higher       ages,   I   have   thought it desirable        to take into       account,    as
 far   as practicable, those          marriages    of  the fathers and grandfathers
of    peers, from which the peers were not descended.                     There were, in
all, 110 fathers and grandfathers who were more than once married.
 In the      case   of 61, the peer was descended             from the first marriage,
 and in the remaining 49 from the second marriage.                             As  already
 mentioned, these           61  first marriages, of course, have to be excluded.
 We must         also exclude the         49 first marriages,     corresponding to the
 49 second         marriages     from which the peers were descended               ;  for it
 is obvious        that these 49 marriages            will include     an unduly       large
 number of cases where               there was either no issue         or no male     issue.
 We have thus             to reject    all the first marriages ; and, of the second
 marriages,       we ean only make           use of the 61 that correspond           to the
  61   first marriages from which the peers were descended.                       We   have
  also 13 third marriages,            and one fourth marriiige,         making in all 75
  marriages      of fathers and grandfathers, to be taken account of.                     In
  62 of these, the man             married when he was peer or heir-apparent                 ;
  and in 13, he did not so marry.
      Collecting our results, wo now obtain the figures in the following
  tables G and        H,   where    it will    be observed that, at each decennial
  group of ages, the percentage              of childless marriages is considerably
  greater among          those   who did not marry          as   peer or heir-apparent,
  than among those who did.
      In   order that our results may be practically useful for professional
  purposes,      as, for instance,       in   the calculation of the values          of the
  interests of the various heirs           in disentail   proceedings,     it is necessary
  to graduate        the    probabilities.      This   I  have    done by the graphic

    The nephridia of Hirudo medicinalis,                      as   is well     known     to bio
logists, are in pairs extending from the second to the                              eighteenth
segments      (somites).         Each nephridium            consists     of   a much convo
 luted cellular tube.            The cells of the tube are perforated by                   small

 In Lumbricus                the nephridium communieates                  internally by a wide

  The nepbridia of Hirudo are eovered by a pigmented connective

The species               taken for investigation was Hirudo medicinalis.                     The
secretions           of    the nephridia were obtained from a considerable                   num
ber of        freshly killed leeches, and examined by similar chemical and
microscopical reactions as                    I   have   employed      in my     paper     already

 examined            by two       separate methods       —
        (a)   The clear liquid from the nephridia was treated with                          a   hot
 dilate        solution of sodium hydrate, and then, on the addition of
 hydrochloric             acid,   a   slight flaky precipitate       is   obtained, after some
 hours'        standing.          These     flakes were seen, under the microscope,              to
 consist of          various crystalline forms.              On treating these crystals with
 nitric acid,             and then gently beating with ammonia,                      the reddish-
 purple        murexide         is   produced,    which crystallises in four-sided prisms.

     (b) Another process was used as follows           :        the
 by the nephridia of      Hirudo boiling      water (distilled)     was added, and
 then evaporated      carefully to dryness.       The residue so obtained was
 treated   with    absolute   alcohol, and filtered.          Boiling water         was
 poured upon the residue, and an excess of acetic acid added                     to the
 filtrate (aqueous).      After standing      several    hours, crystals of uric
 acid   made    their appearance,      and    were   easily recognised        by the
 chemical    and microscopical tests mentioned above.
     Further than this,    the presence of sodium was found in the secre
tions of the nephridia of Hirudo.              It may be that the uric acid is
in combination with sodium as           a  sodium urate.

4.   On     Degenerated          Specimens            of  Tulipa         sylvestris.     By
         Mrs A. B. Griffiths.                  Communicated               by Dr      A.   B.
         Griffiths, F.R.S.E., &c.
    This  note describes a peculiar yet interesting form of degenerated
Tulipa    sylvestris.     Last June (1886) the tulip bulbs were removed
(after growing and flowering in very rich soil), and set in the
December of the same year in a soil of poor quality.                          The plants
did not flower until       the present     June.
    These degenerated        forms have the usual erect scapes found in
the genus      Tulipa; but         the   inflorescence      has     the form      of well-
marked umbels.          The flowers       were small (fig. 1), and consisted              of
the   usual parts     of Tulipa sylvestris,           namely, a
yellow polyphyllous         and inferior perianth (with
six perianth     leaves).       The stamens were hex-
androus and hypogynous           ;   the   pistil syncarpous
and    superior;    the placentation was              axile, and
the ovary divided into three cells.               The unusual
inflorescence and the peculiar shape of the petaloid
segments of the perianth were so unlike                   Tulipa
that the present investigation was undertaken                  as
a point of some interest to botanists.
   The bulbs, leaves, and peduncle had developed
                                                                     Fio. 1.— Flowor of
the strong odour of the          oil of onions or garlic,             degenerated Tulip
The essential oil was extracted by distilling the                      (natural size)-
peduncle, leaves, and bulbs separately with water.                          The essential
oil was then obtained from this, distillated by repeated fractionation
and rectification over potassium.
    This purified     essential    oil had     a    boiling  point of 141°          C,  and
yielded upon analysis a percentage                 composition similar to that of

 5.   The Luminous Organs of Nyctiphanes                      norvegica, Sars.       By
             J.   T. Cunningham, B.A., and Kupert Vallentin.
     The fact that light          was emitted      in the dark by a Schizopodous
 shrimp was          first noticed by        J.   Vaughan    Thomson, who, in his
 Zoological        Researches,     published about        1820,   describes   a species
 which he observed to be luminous under the name Noctiluca.                          He
 mentions the presence              of scattered     spots   of red pigment in the
 animal,      but was quite unaware             that the production      of light   was
 confined      to certain definite organs enveloped            by this pigment — was
 indeed      unaware       of the existence        of the organs     which   form the
 subject of this paper.           Later on, when the family of the Euphausiidse
 was     defined, various accounts            were   given of certain complicated
 organs     of spherical       shape    in  the animals belonging to the family.
 These organs were generally considered                 to be organs of vision, and
 were called accessory eyes.            The most detailed account of the structure
 of these supposed eyes was given by Claus,*                in  1863.    The fact that
 the Euphausiidac were luminous, was however known to the naturalists
 on   board the "Challenger," and             a  paragraph is devoted to the subject
 in the Narrative          of the Cruise of that ship (vol. i. p. 743). It is
 there stated that the phosphorescent                 light emitted by the species
 of the Euphausiidie            was frequently       under observation during the
 voyage.        It  was found that when one of the animals               newly caught
 was taken Tip by a pair of forceps, a pair of bright phosphorescent
 spots was observed          immediately behind the eyes, other two pairs on
the    trunk, and four other          spots along the median ventral line of the

the pair close to the eyes was first and most brilliantly illuminated,
and then the light, which was bluish white, spread to the other
organs     in   the trunk    and tail  :    that after a brilliant flash had         been
emitted,       the organs glowed for some time             with  a  dull light    :   that
the light was given out at           will by     the animal, and usually but not
always on irritation        :  that subsequent       flashes  became less and less
bright     till  the animal appeared to lose the power of emitting light                   :
that    if   the organs    were removed         by the forceps, the points of          the
latter glowed brightly            for some time,        and when the animal           was
dying the whole body was frequently illuminated by                    a  diffused light    :
that the phosphorescent            organs     appeared    under the microscope          as
pale red spots         with   a central clear lenticular       body, and the light
came from the red pigment.                 It is further mentioned that in August
 1SS0     Mr John Murray         observed      at night, on the surface       of the   sea
in the Faerbe Channel, large patches and long streaks                    of apparently
milky-white water, and the tow-nets caught in these places                     immense
numbers of Nyctiphanes noroegica,                 M. Sars, about half the        size of
the adult, and the peculiar appearance               of the water seemed to      be doe
to the diffused light emitted from the phosphorescent                   organs of thii
species.
    That the organs, erroneously called accessory eyes, were in reality
luminous or " phosphorescent organs was definitely asserted by Prof.

G. C. Sars, in his Report on the Schizopoda of the " Challenger."                      He
gives an account of their structure,            but does not discuss very fully        the
 questions concerning the method and mechanism of the production                        of
 light.      Mr W. Fatten* only last year          has again attempted      to maintain
 that these organs are eyes and not luminous organs                 ;   but in view     of
 the evidence         of Sars and others and of our own experiments,                   Mr
 Patten's arguments         need no special refutation;        they are indeed        con
 tradicted sufficiently by the postscript which is added                  to bis    paper

>bservations         and experiments on the luminous organs in the fresh
itate.       Their structure       was investigated by       Mr Vallentin, by       means
)f the      preserved     material, at the Granton Laboratory of the Scottish
Marine Station.
     The distribution of           the organs   in the body has been completely
 it-scribed by Sara.            There are three pairs and four median single.
The first pair           are   in  the eye peduncles       immediately behind and
dorsal       to the      eyes.    The    2nd pair are in the             basal   joints of
the      2nd pair of thoracic          appendages, and each of these is on the
internal       side looking towards the median line of the body.                       The
3rd pair are in the basal joints of the 7th pair of thoracic appen
dages; each           is on     the   external   side,  and looks backwards and
 outwards.         Of   the four unpaired organs, one is in the middle of the
 ventral surface of each of the first four abdominal somites.
      All   the organs except the pair in the eye peduncles are perfectly
 similar      in    structure.      The   organ    forms    a   spherical body lying
 immediately beneath the epidermis, and almost entirely independent
 of the surrounding tissues.              The envelope      of the posterior half of
 the organ is formed by a hemispherical cup of considerable                          thick
  ness,    of laminated      or stratified structure, appearing       fibrous in section,
 and non-cellular.           Internal to this is a cellular layer, consisting of
  large    cubical cells to the exterior, and smaller cells at the internal
 surface.        The hollow of the hemisphere           within this layer is entirely
  filled    with   a non-nucleated fibrous mass, the fibres                or rods being
  externally perpendicular to the surface              of the cellular layer, but in
  the centre      crossing    one another at right        angles.      In front of this
   fibrous mass is a lens         of perfectly homogeneous          and highly refract
   ing substance.         This is surrounded and            clasped     by a ring of a
   structure similar to that of the stratified layer.               Outside the fibrous
   ring and the Ions is a cellular layer, whose nucleated                 cells are smaller
   in size than        those    of the    posterior cellular      layer.      Outside    the
   posterior half of the organ,           forming a thin mosaic-like epithelium
    over the    stratified layer, is a coating of flat polygonal red pigment
    cells,  which are a specialised set of the red mesoblastic                   chromato-
    phores which occur beneath            the epidermis in various parts             of the
    body.     Cellular strands       may be occasionally detected            passing   from

  the surrounding tissues      in  between   the anterior and posterior halves
  of the organ, but we have not satisfied         ourselves   that these strands
  are either muscular or nervous.         The relations of the various layers
  are for the most part correctly described        by Claus and Sars      ;   but   the
 former described a cuticle enveloping the whole organ, which                     does
  not exist, and the latter did not correctly describe the relation of              the
  external pigmented       epithelium to the stratified layer.
     With    regard    to the emission    of light, our experiments confirm
 the evidence      of previous observations,      that the luminosity is inter
  mittent, and, as far as can be judged, closely dependent            on stimula
 tion.    The following experiments        were made     :—
     1. Mechanical Stimulation. — In total darkness the                 hand       was
 inserted into a vessel containing sea-water in which some of                      the
 animals were swimming, and moved               about.     When   an animal was
 touched    it instantly emitted light.         When      an animal     was taken
 between     the fingers    and removed      from the water,      all the     organs
 shone   brilliantly for    5  to 10 sees., while     the animal was flapping
 its abdomen and trying to escape; then followed             a series  of   separate
 flashes,   and after      10  sees,  more    the emission      of light       ceased
 altogether,    until fresh stimulation    was  applied by means of a        squeeee
 between     the   finger and    thumb, when all the organs          immediately
 flashed.
    When     a fresh animal was crushed between          the two hands, certain
 particles of the tissue became luminous, and remained               so  till     they
 were dried up.
    When     one of the organs was crushed on the stage of the micro,
scope, the field became         immediately illuminated, and remained                so
 for some time.
    2.  Chemical Stimulation.      — When     a living animal    was placed into
saturated     solution of bichloride of mercury, all the organs                shone
most brilliantly      during the energetic struggles      preceding death       :  the
luminosity lasted usually        5 to 7 sees., but in one case for 30 sees.
    When a specimen was placed in nitric acid            ^   per cent, the      same
result occurred.
    In both    cases the  posterior organs ceased to shine first, and the pair
in  the eye peduncles     were the last to cease shining.      One of us spent         a
whole morning at Millport in examination of the organs in the fresh
state, by means of the microscope,          with    the object   of ascertaining

from which particular portion of the organ the light proceeded.
The     results of this examination were afterwards verified by both of
us together.              In    this investigation,              no   evidence     was     obtained in
support of Sars' opinion that the light principally emanated                                         from
the central mass of fibres                   behind the lens.             When         the organ       was
crushed beneath                a cover glass,       and examined in daylight, it was not
difficult      to    separate        the different layers              from one another.              The
exterior       pigment cells were in this process dispersed,                                 and every
other part of the organ, with a single exception, was found to be
perfectly colourless              and transparent.                The exception was the inner
superficial portion of the stratified layer, which may for the time be
named the argentea.                  This portion,         when viewed by transmitted light,
was seen to have a beautiful luminous purple colour,                                      like   a sunset
tint.     The purple was reddish at first, but gradually became more
blue as time went on,                 till   after about half an hour the colour was a
deep blue or violet.                 When the transmitted light was shut off, and
the preparation was viewed by reflected light without                                     a condenser,
the colour of the same region was the complementary                                 tint of that      seen
by transmitted light                    The peculiarity of this colour was, that it
appeared to be luminous                  ;   that    is,   no part of the preparation could
he seen     at all in the field but this colour, which shone with                           a    greenish-
yellow light.             When the light               was       entirely excluded, the whole
preparation was                 invisible.      It    follows from this, that the                    inner
surface     of   the argentea possesses               in    a    marked degree the property of
fluorescence.             It   was afterwards found that such                  a   preparation, when
viewed      in   the dark with the naked eye, contained                            a   luminous spot,
and     this     spot was always found                     to    be the    inner portion of the
argentea.           The phosphorescence               was not visible through the micro
scope,    simply because the light was absorbed                                by the lenses;          but
when     light fell        on the preparation,              although     it   was not sufficient to
render visible            other parts of the organs, the inner surface                             of the
argentea, by its fluorescent action on the most refrangible rays of the
spectrum,        became          visible, just as in the                case     of uranium          glass.
Another          fact     is    of   great     interest.          When    a      living    specimen      of
the     animal       is    crushed       between           the   hands and         rubbed with         the
fingers, certain pieces of the mangled tissue are seen to be luminous
in the dark.             Such pieces can be picked off with the forceps                                and
examined with the microscope,                        and are always found to be morsels

of the argentea.          One of us was tempted           to conclude from these
facts that the luminosity of the organs in the          living animal   was entirely
and exclusively due to the purely physical                property of fluorescence
in the internal portion of the           argentea.    But this conclusion    is quite
inconsistent       with the intermittent         emission of the      light  and     its
dependence        on   stimulation.       Moreover, in other luminous organs,
e.g.,  Lamypris splendidula, the light has been shown to come from
a thick mass of cells, and no layer resembling the argentea of
Nydiphanes         is present.      At  present we conclude that probably the
posterior cell layer in Nyctiphanes is the active agent in producing
light when acted on by a nervous impulse, and that the light                          is
much      intensified by the fluorescent property of the surface               of  the
argentea.       Of   the function     of  the central mass of rod or fibres we
have     ascertained      nothing     at alL    The lens is obviously there           in
order to concentrate           the  light, while    the   anterior cellular cap       is
merely a transparent cornea.               The fibrous iris-like   ring round      the
lens    perhaps     acts   as   a diaphragm, though         it undoubtedly     is not
 pigmented      and is transparent          We   hope   shortly to make     renewed
 attempts     to elucidate the mechanism         of  the organs.

 an inch     in diameter,      sealed at one end, and connected        together near
 the closed      end by      a glass   tube about four inches long, having              a
 glass tap in the middle.
     The hole through the plug of the tap is filled with plaster                      of
  Paris, made as nearly as possible flush with the glass surfaces.                This
 plaster plug serves as a porous septum between the two tubes, which
  represent respectively the two compartments                of a Daniell cell — the
  one tube containing         a copper rod immersed        in a saturated solution
  of copper     sulphate,     the other a zinc rod in a solution         of line   sul
 phate, of      as nearly as        may    be the same     density as the copper
  solution.     The cell is designed          for use only with the quadrant
  electrometer,     and must never be short-circuited.
      When     the    cell is used the tap is turned "on," i.e., so that            the

ends    of the plaster         plug are opposite     the   two tubes     containing
solutions.      Immediately         that the observations are completed,           the
tap is turned off, and so diffusion of the solutions completely pre
vented.       The      tap   is made     of the j>eculiar shape     shown in the
diagram, in order that it may only be turned in one direction, and
so  the possible transfer of         a minute quantity of the one solution into
the opposite tube is avoided.
    Several years ago           Mr A. P. Laurie      and   I  used   this cell con
stantly for four months, and during that time it showed no change
of   E.M.F.,     as    compared      with a standard Latimer Clark, readings
being made to three figures only.               More recently Professor Ayrton,
of the     City and Guilds Technical             Schools, London,      very kindly
undertook to compare              this cell with a standard Latimer Clark of
his own construction, and also with Fleming's                    standard Daniell.
The results of the comparison are given in the following                        table.

    On looking at the cell again, about eight months later, the copper
wire was found corroded through, and contact                broken.      In order    to
avoid this accident, it is well to use copper             rod not less than one-
eighth of an inch thick,      as copper is somewhat         soluble   in solution of
sulphate    of copper (see Gray, Phil. Mag., 1886, p. 389).
    The corks used to support the copper and zinc rods should be
carefully paraffined,    and every precaution taken to prevent evapora
tion of the solutions.
    The observation in the above           table,    dated   May 31, was taken
rather hurriedly, and Professor Ayrton considers                it untrustworthy.
Omitting this result, it is seen that the experimental cell has a very
constant    E.M.F.,   and that the change, after about five months, was
very small.
                7.  On Glories.         By Professor Tait.
                                    (Abstract.)
    When Mr Omond was appointed to                the   Ben-Nevis      Observatory
I   requested    him to take every opportunity of observing what                   are
called     Glories — specially    noting,    when       possible,   their    angular
diameters     and the     order of their      colours,     so  that it might        be
possible    to decide upon the exact mode in which they are produced.
     Young,    while attributing      to their    true cause the spurious (or
supernumerary) rainbows, proceeds              to say: — "The circles, some
 times   seen encompassing         the   observer's     shadow     in   a mist,    are
 perhaps     more  nearly related     to the common colours of thin plates
 as  seen by reflection."   —  [Lectures, II. p. 645].
     Now from Mr Omond's observations it appears that the mists to
 which the glories are due produce corona? of, say,             2° or   3° radius ; —
 from which it follows that the diameter of the particles is some
  where    of the order     1(fo0   inch.     It   is thence shown that,          were
  Young's explanation correct, the radii of the rings would vary with
  great  rapidity   in  passing    from one kind of homogeneous               light  to
  another.     This  is altogether irreconcilable with         Mr Omond's        obser
  vations.
      That the glories are not of the nature of spurious rainbows                     is
  shown very simply by the fact that they are more intense as their
  radii are smaller.

    Hence,    the only possible     explanation     is diffraction   depending
 on the    form of   the   vertex of the reflected      wave.     The form of
 an originally    plane wave, once reflected inside a drop of water is,
 roughly, when the central ray has just emerged, a portion of an
hyperboloid of revolution, doubled back cusp-wise round its border.
 An approximate calculation is given,        based on this assumption.'
    A simple first approximation to          the  theory of glories     is given
by the behaviour of         a  plane wave incident      normally on     a screen
 pierced    with  a great  number of very small circular apertures             of
nearly equal size.      They are thus, to a certain extent,        analogous   to
coronae.

  motion which would be the unique and essentially stable solution
  if   the viscosity were                    sufficiently large.                     It      seems probable, almost
  certain,            indeed,      that analysis similar to that of                                     §§ 38    and 39 will
  demonstrate                that the steady motion is stable for any viscosity, how

  Stokes forty years ago, and so admirably investigated experimentally

investigation.      The case of     ft = 00    is specially important         and in
teresting.
     31. The present      communication is confined to the much simpler
ease    in which the two bounding          planes are kept moving relatively
with constant velocity ; including as sub-case the two planes held at
rest, and the fluid caused by gravity to move between them.                    But we
shall first take the much simpler sub-case, in which there is relative
 motion of the two planes, and no gravity.                 This is the very simplest
 of   all cases of the general question of the          Stability   or  Instability of
 the   Motion of    a  Viscous Fluid.       It  is the second of the two cases
 prescribed by the Examiners for the Adams Prize of 1888.                      I have
 ascertained, and     I now proceed to give the proof, that in this sub
 case   the steady motion is wholly stable, however small or however
 great bo the viscosity      ; and this without          limitation    to two-dimen
 sional motion of the admissible disturbances.
     32.  In  our present sub-case, let    y36   be the relative velocity of the
 two planes ; so that       in (6) we may take             F = 0, 5 = fib ;  and the
 corresponding steady solution of (4) is
                                                                                 (20).

 Here    P    and Q are the two fresh constants,       due to the integration

    Our six arbitrary constants      H, K, L, M, P, Q clearly allow        us to
give any prescribed values to each of U,          93,   2B, for y = 0 and for
y  — b.    Thus the completion of the realised problem with real data
of arbitrary functions, as described in § 37, becomes         a mere  affair of
routine.
    40.   Now remark that the (n, v, w) solution of        § 34 comes essen
tially   to nothing, asymptotically as time advances, as we see by (33),
(34), and (38). Hence the (u, », to) of § 37, which rise gradually
from zero at t = 0, come asymptotically to zero again as t increases
to  oo .    We conclude that the     steady motion is stable.

of the urogenital system         of the vertebrates     was   supposed    to be
derived from the mesoblast.          This view    received a sudden check

  1887.]         Mr G. Brook on Epiblastic Origin of Duct.                      369
  when, on the publication of Graf Spee's researches                 on the guinea
  pig  in    1884, the segmental       (pronephric) duct was shown to have
  an epiblastic       origin.   Hensen, indeed,       had noted the fact some
  years previously, but no notice had been taken of his discovery
  until Graf      Spee   called attention to it.       Hensen has recently taken
  up the subject again, and Flemming              has  published a confirmatory
  account for the rabbit            Thus    there  appears    no further room for
  doubting the epiblastic origin of the segmental                duct in mammals.
  It does not       necessarily  follow that the whole excretory system has
  an epiblastic origin, but further information is required on the sub
 ject.      Towards the end         of  1886     Van Wijhe demonstrated          the
  epiblastic     origin    of the   segmental     duct in Elasmobranchs,         and
  .luring     the   present year Von Perenyi has announced that the
  epiblast plays a similar part in Rana and Lacerta.               During the past
  few months       I  have been enabled to confirm        Von Perenyi's  researches
  so far   as  Rana is    concerned,   and have also      found that, in  regard   to
  the formation of the segmental duct, Teleostean fishes, and probably
  also birds, are in agreement with other types.               The epiblastic origin
 of the     segmental      duct is probably     a feature    common   to the Verte-
 brata generally.
     In    the trout the segmental         duct arises almost precisely in the
 manner       described     and figured by Flemming          for the rabbit.   In   a
 twenty-seven         days' embryo the duct is well marked in the middle
 trunk region, and thins out both anteriorly and posteriorly.                   An
 teriorly the duct          appears  as a thickening       of that portion of the
 surface      epiblast overlying the intermediate cell mass;             that is to
 say, the segmental duct arises from that part of the epiblast dorsal
 to the portion of the mesoblast from which it was formerly supposed
 to be derived.            Passing posteriorly the epiblastic thickening         be
 comes      more    and    more important, and      in the middle trunk region
 forms      a large    rounded mass      of cells still partly attached to the
epiblast, and situated          between    the vertebral plate and the lateral
mesoblast.           The lumen of the duct appears first as an irregular
cavity, and later the whole             mass    loses   its connection with the
epiblast, and        becomes    pressed   in   amongst     the "intermediate    cell
mass
         " during the formation of the lateral body folds.
    The origin of         the segmental    duct in birds does not appear to be
quite    as clear.      Anteriorly, the epiblast covering the central nervous

370         Proceedings      of Royal Society of Edinburgh,             [july  16,
system and the vertebral plates       in chick   embryos      of forty to forty-
eight hours forms a thin membrane.           On nearing the ventral portion
of the vertebral plates the epiblast becomes slightly thickened, while
immediately beyond the vertebral plates there is a slight involu
tion and a considerable       thickening in the outer layer.        On passing
to the lateral mesoblast        the epiblast again     thins out.     Here, evi
dently, is an epiblastic thickening corresponding precisely in position
with that forming the       segmental   duct in other vertebrates.        In  the
                    the " intermediate cell

chick, however,                                mass    is comparatively huge,
and the epiblastic thickening         soon becomes       fused with the meso
blast.   In   a forty -eight hour chick embryo       I  have noticed a curved
line more distinctly shown in some sections              than in others, which
I take to define     the limit of the epiblast.     In the posterior portion
of the embryo the                       "
                        epiblast and intermediate cell mass are quite
                                                                     "
separate, and     I  was   unable to trace any thickening in the epiblast
of that region.      Probably, therefore,    the duct is pushed      backwardf
from the anterior portion without            coming into contact       with   the
epiblast.    This, at any rate, is the mode of development previously
described in Elasmobranchs and birds, when the segmental duct was
supposed   to have a mesoblast ic origin.
    The whole of these recent researches          must necessarily     lead to a
modification     in our views of       the   morphology of the vertebrate
excretory apparatus.         Haddon has recently suggested          that primi
tively the nephridia (derived from the mesoblast) opened on each
side into a lateral groove, that later this groove deepened and
 formed a closed       canal, which    subsequently acquired       a secondary
 opening to the exterior through the cloaca.
    I propose   to discuss this subject more     fully in   a future paper.

    Since my former communications, in which several facte relating
 to the chemistry of Strophanthtcs        kispidus have been stated,      I have
completed a systematic       examination of various parte of this plant,

on     of the        results of this examination,          I  propose    now to mention
nly a few of            these results   in  a brief form.
   The active principle, to which                I  have given the name Strophan-
bin, occurs            most     abundantly in the seeds.              By a very simple
 rocess, consisting essentially of the separation of oil by means of
ther from the alcoholic extract, I obtained some years ago a crys-
dline body having                great  pharmacological activity, and possessing
he      characteristics         of a glucoside.         In   subsequent     experiments,
\owever,         although      the same process was followed, a well-marked
 i ystalline       product was not always obtained, and it soon became
:vident that this difference             was due to some difference          in the   con-
lition of the         seeds which had been operated with.               Thus, from seeds
 ollected by the late Bishop Mackenzie more than twenty years ago,
ind also from seeds sent to me by Mr Buchanan of Blantyre, East
Africa,      in 1881,      I had no    difficulty in separating an active principle
in the       form of well-marked minute crystals; but from                      seeds ob
tained from           Mr Buchanan in 1885, and also from seeds liberally
placed      at my disposal by Mr Moir and by Messrs Burroughs, Well
 come    & Co.      last year,   I failed  to obtain an equally definite crystalline
body.         I  also found that the body obtained by the process formerly
 described,       whether in well-defined crystals or not, was resolvable
 by acetate        of lead into at least two bodies,                one  of which is an
 extremely active glucoside,            and the other an acid, for which          I would
 suggest     the name kombic acid.              It  having become apparent,         there
 fore,   that the strophanthin first described is not a simple substance,
  attempts       were     made     to improve       the process       so as  to separate
  strophanthin        in a more pure form than            I  had originally succeeded
 in doing.        The result of these attempts has been the adoption of a
  process whose        essential   steps are the following        : —
     Starting with the product obtained by the earlier process, it is
  dissolved     in   water, tannic acid is added to the solution, the tannate
  is  digested       with    recently precipitated        oxide of lead,       and then
   extracted    with rectified and proof spirit.             This extract    is dissolved
  in a small quantity             of rectified     spirit, and the solution is pre
   cipitated    by ether.         The   precipitate is finally dissolved in weak
   alcohol,   and through this solution carbonic acid is passed for several
   hoars,   by which means lead is completely got rid of.                    After filtra
   tion   the    solution     is evaporated       at   a low     temperature,    and the

product is dried in vacuo over sulphuric              acid.     In the     process      of
drying, it first assumes a translucent, gummy appearance, and                       then
becomes opaque and white.
   Strophanthin thus obtained is imperfectly crystalline,                  neutral      or
faintly acid in      reaction,  intensely bitter, freely soluble      in  water,     less
so in rectified spirit, and practically insoluble           in ether and         chloro
form.     It  bums without residue, and          it does not contain nitrogen.

sulphuric acid produces a bright green colour, which soon                     becomes
greenish yellow         and brown; sulphuric          acid and bichromate             of

iodide of potassium, nor by many other                 reagents   ;  except that nearly
all acid reagents cause the solution to                 become slightly      hazy, and   it
is     then found that          the  solution     contains glucose.         This   decom
position        is also produced by sulphuretted              hydrogen, and for this
reason       it is not advisable to use sulphuretted hydrogen in any pro
cess      for preparing strophanthin.
      Indeed, all       the mineral acids, excepting carbonic acid and many
 of the organic acids, resolve             strophanthin,      even   in the cold, into
 glucose and a substance which                I  have    named     strophanthidin.       A
 very pretty crystallisation           of the'latter is spontaneously produced,
 in a few hours, in a solution                  of strophanthin       in   1*5   per cent,
 sulphuric        acid.      Contact at the ordinary temperature                 for even
 three days        with dilute sulphuric acid          does not apparently entirely
 decompose         the strophanthin, as an additional             quantity     of glucose
  seems     to be afterwards produced when the solution, filtered from
  strophanthidin, is heated at 212° F. for a few hours.                      Thus, when
  strophanthin was decomposed at the ordinary temperature                      by contact
  lor about three days with            1 -5  per cent, sulphuric        acid,   there was
  obtained      37  "5  per cent, of crystalline      strophanthidin,      and about 20
  per cent,     of glucose.*       The crystals of strophanthidin           having been
  removed       by filtration, and      the almost colourless,         bitter, and acid
   fluid having been boiled for four hours,              it was now found that the
  glucose had increased           to 26"64 per cent., and that about 4*3 per
   cent of an amorphous brownish substance                  had been formed.
       This action of acids renders it apparent that an acid, and especially
   a  mineral acid, should not be used          in the preparation of strophanthin.
   Thus,    in 1877,      seven  years  after the publication         of my first com
   munications       on this subject,    Hardy and Gallois described            a process
   in which, by using for the extraction of the seeds rectified spirit
   acidulated     with hydrocholic       acid,   they obtained a crystalline          pro
    duct   which they believed to be strophanthin.                There can be little
   doubt,    however, that their crystalline           product was strophanthidin,
    not only because        the process    they employed would decompose               the
    strophanthin       into strophanthidin        and    glucose,   but also      because
       *
         In the solution obtained by this decomposition, the exact estimation of
    glucose by  Fehling's solution is rendered difficult and uncertain by a green
    colour being produced,     which persists after the blue colour of Fehling's solu
    tion has disappeared.

374           Proceedings    of Royal Society of Edinburgh,                 [jult  15,
their crystalline product was found by them not to yield glucose when
it  was heated      with dilute sulphuric acid.          Hence they concluded
that strophanthin is not a glucoside (Comptes Rendus de V Academic
des Sciences,      lxxxiv.,   1877,    p.   261   ;  and Journal      de  Pharmaeie
et   de    Ohemie,   xxv.,   1877,     p.    177).     The   glucosidal     chancier
of strophanthin, however, has now been amply demonstrated by a
large number of experiments            which     I  have  made,    and by the ex
periments of subsequent           observers,    and especially by those of         A.
 W. Gerrard, described in an interesting paper published this year
 (The Pharmaceutical Journal and Transactions, 14th May 1887,
 p.   923).     Further,    the solution       obtained when strophanthin           is
 decomposed      by sulphuric acid has been fermented with yeast, and
 carbonic acid, representing 23-64 per cent, of glucose, has been ob
 tained.

              Diffusion.      By   J. J.    Coleman,     F.I.C., F.C.S.
     Supposing a tall glass tube open at both ends be cemented into a
 reservoir packed full of common salt, and the tube then carefully
 filled up with water, and the whole apparatus                 immersed      overhead
 in   a jar of   water,  in   a few days        or weeks    (depending upon the
 length of the tube) particles of salt will arrive at the top of the tube
 and diffuse into the water atmosphere.
     When this condition         arrives,   which Fick calls " dynamic equi
  librium," diffusion     takes place at a uniform         rate, the mathematical
  expression    of the process being stated as follows         : —
     Let    K  denote   the quantity of salt which in a normal state of
  diffusion passes in a unit of time through                 a unit of     horizontal
  section of a cylindrical      tube whose        height is equal     to the unit of
  length, this being called the diffusion coefficient            ; also let  Q  be the
  quantity of salt which in the time t flows from the mouth of the
  tube   ; S its horizontal section      ;  d the density of the liquid at the
  bottom    ; and h the height of the tube ; then
                                      Q=*Kd^t.
      Experiments subsequent         to those of    Fick have caused some doubt
  as   to whether     the "coefficient       of diffusion" is the       same   for all

densities, but        the conclusion he came to, that under the conditions
of    his experiments         the quantities diffused are directly as the times       of
diffusion, is easily and elegantly shown by using concentrated acids
or alkalies instead of common salt.

veniently        be that of the reservoir of a glass spirit-lamp,          holding 350
grammes of hydrochloric acid of              1 -17 sp. gr., and immersing the whole

       The     use   of    such modern indicators as phenolphthalein                and
   methyl orange has rendered the end reaction of a volumetric pro
   cess so    delicate, that no difficulty is experienced in measuring such
   small quantities as one part of acid             in 20,000 of water, winch      were

      dynamic equilibrium              established, which indeed is typical of all
   oases    in which    the diffused column is constantly being elongated            by
   ascent     of fresh particles from the bottom of               a tube of constant
   diameter,      I have devised a piece of apparatus which renders this
    motion visible      to the eye, and which mathematical considerations
    developed by physicists indicate, should he as the square root               of  the
   times    of diffusion.

    bottom    of the jar underneath the acid, the alkali          diffuses and changes

being as strongly defined as that of oil floating upon water, and       this

   The caustic   alkali solution is most advantageously placed        in an
open-mouthed vessel of such capacity that a barometer tube, 12 mm.
to 15 mm. inside diameter,       containing the reddened       acid can be
overturned therein with its mouth downwards, the acid being kept
in the tube by     means   of an india-rubber     disc, attached   by three
platinum wires to a cork sliding on the tube, which thus acts as a
valve to be thrust down when the time for starting diffusion arrives.

 1887.]         Mr J. J. Coleman         on a Neio Diffusiometer.              377
     The following experiments were made by diffusing caustic potash
 of three     different densities into reddened        dilute hydrochloric acid,
 which latter in every case required '145                milligramme of potash
 ( KHO) per c.c.       to turn the colour from red to yellow.       The reservoirs
 of each were        about 60 millimetres diameter,         and contained about
200 c.c. of alkali solution, so that its strength was              approximately
constant during the diffusions.
     The diffusions were made in a chest of wood, of               2  cubic metre
capacity, with hollow walls filled with dry sawdust,             this being again
placed in a room of nearly constant temperature.              Similar precautions
were also adopted with the experiments verifying Ficks' law, already
detailed in this paper.
     It will   be seen from this table that the result of the experiments
demonstrate        to the eye a fundamental law of diffusion, common not
only to material particles, but to the imponderable agents, heat
and electricity.         Sir W. Thomson has also pointed out to me that,
according to theory, and             supposing the coefficient of diffusion is
not variable, the         heights of the columns in Table         I. should have
been identical,         provided    the acid had been regulated        of varying
densities to correspond         with the alkali.
     Further experiments detailed in Table           II.  were then made which
confirm this anticipation,*           or rather, which show that       if there  is
any variation in the coefficient         it must be small.
     Experiments        were also made      with  caustic  soda  (NaHO), which
are recorded       in Table   III.,  and  I have found that the apparatus can
also be made available for measuring the diffusibility of acids                 by
diffusing them into slightly ammoniacal            water coloured yellow with
methyl      orange,   f    We   are thus supphed       with   a  new method of
ascertaining the diffusibility of a large number of chemical com
pounds, and also         a  method of checking the accuracy of the burette
method of determining diffusibility,            which  I described   in the Phil.
Mag. in January last.            The instrument may be also constructed         on
a larger scale for lecture demonstrations.
    * The
            difference   between the heights was reduced to 6 millimetres instead
of    31.  See also     confirmatory experiments detailed in Table IV., added
September 1887.

        1.   Laws of Solution.            Part   II.    By W. Durham, Esq.
      From the note in my former paper on the above                         subject it is
  easy     to deduce the following formula, which expresses                  the relations
   between the heats          of chemical combination and the heats of solu
   tion   : —
Sat    of Combination.     Heat of Combination.      Heat of Neutrality.     Heat of Solution.

   This formula is perfectly general               for chlorides, bromides, iodides,
   -ulphates, and nitrates, and whether the oxides and salts are soluble
   'it insoluble.       It shows that the heats of solution pass from negative

382         Proceedings   of Royal Society of Edinburgh,      [jilt  15,
to positive values through zero when the salts are insoluble.     As in
soluble salts   the  heat of neutralisation  is practically constant, it
follows that the heats of solution vary with the relative variations of
[M,X8] and [M,0,Aq] involving definite chemical actions.            We
should expect, therefore, that the heats of solution would vary in
u periodic manner with the nature of the elements, as with other
chemical phenomena.       The following diagram, representing the heat
of solution of the chlorides, although defective in many places from
want of data, seems distinctly to show that this is so, and that solu
 tion is a periodic function of the weights of the elements.

     In    this diagram there          are several points worthy of particular
notice.
     1.   Although given to illustrate solution it would equally well
             illustrate the relations between [M,X2] and [M,0,Aq], which
             are relations of chemical affinity.
    2.    The rapid rise of heat of solution after Na and E.                 I have   not
             data    for Rb and Cs, but have no doubt they would exhibit
             analogous     relations, and have connected them by dotted lines
             to Sr and Ba.
    3.    After    each rapid rise there are several chlorides which are more
            or less     decomposed       by solution.    These chlorides occur
            between      Li   and Fl,    Al and CI, Ca and Mn, Zn and Br, Sr
            and Bh, and Sn and I, perfectly regular recurring pheno
            mena.
                 peculiar nature of the curve between Mn and Zn noticed
    4^|7he
            in many other          phenomena,   and especially the sudden rise
            from Cu to Zn, this latter relation is repeated               between     Ag
       fi and Cd.          Now, it is remarkable that the atomic weights of
            Cu and Zn       are almost exactly as much lower than the atomic
            weight of Br as those of Ag and Cd are than that of                  I,   the
            next negative element
    5.   The first maximum point is at Al,             whose     atomic weight is
           almost exactly midway between the atomic weights of                  Fl and
           CL       The next maximum is Ni, with atomic weight between
           CI and Br.         The third maximum should be at Bh, but data
           are wanting.
    6.   The curve between Hg, TL and Pb suggests               a repetition of the
           curve between Ni, Cu, and Zn.
    7.  The remarkably           regular relations between      Ca,    Sr, and Ba,
           whose chemical similarity is well known.
   If we     pass from chlorides to bromides          or iodides the change in
the   heat of solution can be represented           by a very simple formula.
For instance, the change from chlorides to bromides               is as follows     : —

  That is to say, the heats of solution of any metallic chloride and
  bromide vary inversely as the difference            between    the excess    of the
  heat of combination          of the metallic chloride over the heat of com
 bination of hydrogen chloride in water, and the excess of the heat
 of combination of the metallic bromide over the heat of combination
 of the hydrogen bromide in water.                 The following examples 'will

   We again      see   from these results how intimately heat of solution
is related to heat of chemical combination.                Whenever an element
develops      less   energy       in combination     with bromine      than     with
chlorine relatively to the hydrogen compounds of these same nega
tive elements, the energy is not lost           ; it immediately   appears    in the
heat of solution.         It  is worthy of note also how regularly the        differ
ence increases      by about 2000 units as we pass from the barium to
the strontium and calcium salts.

       Perfectly analogous results are obtained on changing the positive
 element of the salt instead of the negative.                        In   every case we find
 the heat of solution regulated by the chemical affinities (as measured
 by heat) of the elements.    Another instructive instance of the rela
 tions of chemical affinity and solution is found in the double salts
 of the form MS04, R"S04, 6H20, where                             M forms crystals of     the
 composition  MS047H20.      In the double salts R"S04 takes the
 place of one molecule of H20, and develops more or less heat in so
 doing.         How       the thermal results of solution of the double salt seems
 to indicate that decomposition is brought about.

In fact, putting            the double crystalline salt into solution brings the
mixture         to    exactly the same thermal state                as   if   the constituent
sulphates were separately dissolved in water.

      It   has been said that no argument                 as to   residual affinity can be
based on thermal results because we do not know the fundamental
j, its, but it        appears to me there         is no force whatever in this objec
tion,      as   we are not dealing            with   absolute      affinity but only with
differences, and thermal chemistry is particularly fitted to show these
differences.          Thus, for instance, CI in combining with Sr develops
10190 units less heat than it does when combining with Ba.                             How
the    question       is,   What becomes of       these 10190 units?           Are they lost
entirely, or         is   there residual affinity left in SrCl2 to that amount             ?

The heat of solution appears to me to answer this question                            at once
when we take into account that Sr acts upon                        0 with     less energy
than Ba does.         Thus —

SrCl2 as compared with Bad,                      This is not an isolated case, but
appears in every chloride, so that if the heat of combination with 0

inversely in every case as the heat of combination.                             The      slight
difference     of 140 units in above case appears               as a difference        in    the

       (Plate     XIII.)
   The researches described in this paper had for their object the
direct measurement        of the Peltier effect, with a view to verify the
hypotheses regarding it and the laws deduced               from these.         Hither
to it has been a pure assumption that the Peltier effect vanishes at
the neutral point.        As this important assumption forms part of                 the
basis of the received theory of thermoelectricity, to prove it                       was
one of the main objects of these experiments.
   Very recently,      Signor Batelli (Atti delta Societa Reale            de   Torino,

388               Proceedings          of Royal Society of Edinburgh,                                [mi l!,
May 1887) has attempted to prove experimentally the vanishing of
the Peltier effect at the neutral point in the case of certain alloys,
whose      neutral points with lead are at temperatures                                 not much         above
the ordinary           temperature             of the     air.       In his method              the Peltier
effects produced by a current at the junctions of a thermopile                                                (of
ihe alloys         A   and    B)     are measured by the thermopile itself.                               Now
at the neutral point of                    A   and   B,   the thermoelectric power of the
thermopile becomes zero, and hence the pile becomes, at that                                                tem
perature,     a    wholly       inefficient means of measuring any heating                                    or
cooling effect           Therefore Signor Batelli's experiments by no                                  means
establish the vanishing of the Peltier effect at the neutral point
   In    the following          experiments,              measurements              were       made    of    the
Peltier      effect    both above              and below the neutral point, and                           these
were compared            with        the    values        calculated from the directly                       ob
served     neutral        point,       taking        Professor         Tait's supposition              <r = kt.
Thus    if   to   be the absolute              temperature           of the neutral point of                any
two metals (whose lines are straight), then, according to the theory
of the thermoelectric diagram, their Peltier effect at absolute
temperature        t   is   proportional to t(t              -     to
                                                                  ).         The neutral points               of
the specimens            used   were           accordingly found in the ordinary                            way
by heating          up    a   junction in oil, and                    these      were     the only         data
necessary in finding            the        calculated values with which the                         observed
values were compared.
   The apparatus             used was          a   modification of that described                     by     the
writer in      a   paper      read         before    this Society in 1882                ;     it   was con
structed     in    the following manner               : —
  The       ends of         two strips of sheet iron (say) were                                soldered      (or
in the     case of some metals, brazed) to the lower ends of an arch                                          of
sheet      cadmium          (say).         The      other ends          of    the       iron    strips      had
several copper wires soldered                      to them, leading to              a   rocking commu
tator connected             with four cells of                   a   Thomson's           " tray-Daniell"
battery.       In this circuit              was also included                a   Helmholtz            tangent
galvanometer,          which served to measure the battery current                                          The
differences        of temperatures                 of the    iron-cadmium junctions                       were
measured       by means of an iron-German-silver thermopile (of                                          16 cr
20 junctions),     bent into the shape of an arch, whose ends                                              were
inserted in the trenches                    between         the      iron     and    cadmium,            being

tightly In        asbestos wool        in the middle of    a series of copper        boxes
or      tubes,    separated       from     one another   by asbestos       packing.        A
thermometer was inserted with its bulb as near to the junctions as
possible.         By properly arranging Bunsen burners underneath, it
was possible          to maintain the junctions          at a constant and uniform
temperature.            Throughout        the whole    series     of experiments,       the
mercury thermometers employed were regularly compared                              (at the
ordinary temperature) with a standard one which was never heated
up,      and which had been compared               with a Kew standard.            All  the
temperature         readings were thus corrected.
      The following was the usual mode of observation: — When the

 until several hours after the heating was begun), the current was
 sent      in the positive direction for 30 seconds, then broken for 30
 seconds, put on in the negative direction for 30 more, broken for

                    is taken as the measure          of the temperature        difference
  caused     by the given current (in 30 seconds).
       Since the specific heats of most metals increase considerably as
  the temperature          rises,    it is  necessary,  in comparing the           Peltier
   'Sects at    two temperatures,         to make a correction for the change             in
   specific    heats.    In   the     absence  of definite measurements,          this in
  crease    in specific heat was taken         as approximately      =       per degree
   centigrade    for  iron and nickel, and = 1^60 per degree for cadmium,
   anc, and     German silver.          This correction  was reckoned from 20° C.
       The correctness of the method           was tested by applying       it   to prove
   that the    Peltier effect is proportional to the strength of the current.
    As was to be       expected,      the temperature    nearly always rose slowly
    during    the ten minutes' observations (owing              to the Joule effect) ;
    a small   correction    was applied for this.       Table I. gives some of the
    measurements       of the Peltier effect for different current-strengths.
    The first three sets are         for iron-cadmium, and the fourth for iron-
    'iric.

    Iron and cadmium            were    selected as having a comparatively lo»
neutral point.          The specimens          used were      ordinary sheet iron          and
tolerably pure cadmium.                The neutral point found by heating up
a junction      in oil   was 144°0 C.          At   144° C. the direct measurement
showed       absolutely     no  Peltier    effect,  a small irreversible effect alone
 being visible      ;   while the same current gave              a mean        deflection of
 308     scale    divisions    at   21*   C, and       -240 divisions          at   199*1 C.
 Also    at 139°-0       the  Peltier effect was small, but still of the                  same
 sign as that at 21° C.          Table     II.  gives some measurements              at other

(low temperature to high) calculated from neutral point 144° C.
In Nos. 3 and 4 the temperature was kept uniform by means of a
double steam-jacket           surrounding a small copper box in which the
junctions and thermopile were packed.                By this    means the tempera
ture could be kept very steady and uniform.
                                    Zinc and Iron.
    The metals here used were ordinary sheet zinc and thin tinplate.
 In order that      the junctions might stand a temperature          above 200° C.       ,
 they were       soldered     with  a suitable   alloy of zinc and tin.            Thin
8 trips   were cut from the same specimens,           and the neutral point was
 found     (by heating their junction          in oil)     to be 196°-7       C.     The
 directly observed        Peltier  effect was  found to vanish about 204° C.
The temperature,           however,   was falling    slowly at the time, which
would account for this disagreement.                 Table   III.  gives   a measure
 ment taken just before the temperature               had fallen to 204°.            The
last column gives the ratio calculated from 204° as neutral point                    : —

                             Nickel and German Silver.
    The peculiar form of the nickel line between 150° and 300° C.
made     it interesting     to find whether the    Peltier   effect between       nickel
and any other metal (or alloy) agrees with the theory between these
temperatures.          German silver was chosen as being an alloy whose
Peltier      effect   with nickel ought      to vary     in    a striking      manner.
According to the thermoelectric diagram, their Peltier effect divided
by the absolute          temperature    should remain constant           till at   least
150°    C,   and then decrease uniformly        till it vanishes at       the neutral
point   ;  beyond this it should change sign and increase                    till about
300° C. (above which it should probably remain constant for some
distance).
   The usual form of apparatus               was    used,   but in this       case   the

(Jerman      silver   strips    had to be        brazed    to the nickel, that the
junctions      might stand the high temperatures.                  The neutral point
of the pair was found            as  usual by loug strips cut from the same
sheets.      Since, in the brazing, the metals              bad to be brought to         a
high temperature,         these long strips, as well as the pieces that were
to be brazed, were          all annealed      by heating to bright redness and
slowly cooling.
    In order     to measure       the thermoelectric power of           nickel German
silver     at the    various temperatures,           the     following    method     was
 used   : — The current, instead of being              sent   through    Ni-Arg junc
tions, was sent through the measuring                 (FeArg) thermopile, and         the
 Peltier    effects  caused      in the thermopile          junctions    measured by
 connecting the nickel and German silver strip to the galvanometer.
The deflection       here     in the galvanometer would            be proportional      to
 the product of the Peltier            effect of FeArg, and the thermoelectric
 power of NiArg.           Now, it      has been shown by former           ciperimeni*
by the       writer* that       the    Peltier   effect   of FeArg       varies as the
absolute      temperature.         Hence we can at once             find the thermo
electric power of the         NiArg at any      temperature.
    The junctions        in this     case were      packed      in four thick copper
tubes, one inside the other, with              asbestos wool between.           As this
arrangement       gave a very uniform temperature              at the junctions,    most
of the readings were            taken with       the temperature rising slowly,
except those at 17°-8, 19°-0, 23° 0, and 254° 3                 C, when the tempera
ture was fairly steady.             The temperatures          above    285° C. are not
very certain.        For     convenience      in heating, the        tubes  had to be
almost horizontal.          This, unfortunately, caused the mercury in the
thermometer        to boil at a temperature          much below its       boiling point
at atmospheric pressure.             The readings        340° and 330°,       therefore,
are only estimated.
    In   Table TV. are given some of the measurements                    of the Peltier
 effect   in NiArg.       The second        column gives D/Ct, where          D is   the
FeArg thermopile deflection, C              the battery current through          NiArg,
and t the absolute temperature.               In Table V. are the measurements
of the      thermoelectric power of NiArg (by sending the current
through      the FeArg thermopile).               The     second    column gives the

   iu oil, was     250°-6 C.       The curve drawn from Table             IV.   shows   a

ness of the effect at 254° '3 is pretty strong evidence          that it   vanishes
at most a degree or two from the directly found neutral point.
    The numbers in Tables           IV. and V.       agree  fairly well    with the
fact that the nickel and German silver lines are parallel up                   to   it
least    150°  C, and that     between     its two bends      the nickel line       is
straight.      Above 250° C. the deflections         of the FeArg       thermopile
cannot      be   taken as accurately measuring the small              temperature
differences, for the Arg line is no longer parallel to the iron                 line.
The numbers have not been              corrected    for this.     The very     small
correction due to the resistance of the measuring thermopile                       in
creasing with the temperature         has been neglected.
     In  conclusion,   I  must  express    my thanks to Professor Tait,             in
 whose     laboratory these investigations were carried out, for kindly
 placing at my disposal much of the necessary apparatus, as well                    as
 for his ever-ready advice.          I also  desire   to express    my thanks        to
 Messrs    J.  T. Morrison and A. H. Mackenzie for their            most valuable
 aid, and to Messrs Shand and Buchan for their kiud                    help in the
 determination of the neutral points.

                         § 1. Description     of Apparatus.
      The above investigations were continued by the writer                  and Mr
  J.  T. Morrison, at the laboratory of the former, near Londonderry.
  As   the galvanometers     were arranged     so as to give much more delicate
  measurements      than those in the preceding experiments, a few             words
  of description are here necessary.         The galvanometer connected           with
  the measuring thermopile had a lens of about 10 feet focal length.
  Of   the galvanometers      used for measuring        the battery current,        the
  Helmholtz had a lens of 12 feet focal length, and the other                  mirror
  galvanometer      one   of 6  feet.    The scales, each     1  metre    in  length,
  were    of translucent     paper,   stretched    between     two boards       whose
  edges were circular arcs of the proper radius.            The divisions      were     2
   millimetres each, and could be read to -j^ths.               In order     that    the
   battery current      might    be   more    steady,   the  commutator       was to
   arranged that the moment the current was broken             it was  immediately
   short-circuited through a similar resistance.            For   greater    accuracy

1887.]        Mr A. Campbell         on Measurement        of Peltier Effect.       395
and convenience,          the high temperature      thermometer was always read
with a       telescope.
     At    first it  was thought desirable,      instead of employing the Helm-
holtz galvanometer, to measure the battery current in all cases by
the Peltier effect in a standard set of iron-German-silver junctions,
which would, it          was hoped, integrate the current during the period
of time for which it          was  rua     Although this arrangement           was sub
sequently discarded as a current-measurer,                 some interesting results
 were obtained from it.            It consisted    of 23 squares of sheet iron and
 German silver          (each 3 cms. square),        soldered,   three   by three, into
 seven strips, which were then soldered to one another in zigzag form.
 Along the middle junctions             were    placed the ends (100 in all) of 7
 iron German silver thermopiles, insulated from the junctions by
 thin paper.         The whole was wrapped tightly in wadding, and placed
 in    a tin box surrounded by cold          water.    A thermometer       was inserted
  with its bulb touching         the metals.       The current was sent through
  the iron-German-silver          zigzag, and the      Peltier   effects measured by
  the thermopiles.
                         § 2. Time    Curves    of Peltier     Effect.
       In    order to investigate      the rate at which        the    growing    Peltier
   effect    temperature-difference      showed itself      by the      thermopile de
   flection, the following       simple chronographic method was adopted.
   In this     a number of observers were made use of.                Observer    A  held
   a  watch to his ear, and counted half seconds aloud in exact time
   with      its beats, also    making      and   breaking the battery circuit at
   exactly the proper times.           Observer B, watching the galvanometer
    scale, said sharply the syllables,         " Tic,  tac, to, tee, tic, tac, to, tee,"
    and so on, as the light-spot passed over certain prearranged                divisions
    of the scale.      Eight other     observers    noted down the numbers after
    which they heard the tic, tac, to, or tee, one of these words being
    allotted to each pair of observers.           This  method proved wonderfully
    accurate.       The pairs of observers       very seldom       disagreed   by half a
     second, although the numbers           had to be noted very rapidly.             The
     results of some of the measurements          are given in Tables     VI., VII., and
     VIII., which      are for three   different current-strengths.         In these the
     current was put on for 100 half-seconds,            broken for 100, put on in

 396                Proceedings               of Royal Society of Edinburyh.                                 [jult      is,

 These          periods       were       chosen       so that        the deflection            might         become
 nearly constant before the current was broken.                                        The current,              which
 was from           2    or   3   Bunsen cells, was very nearly constant                              throughout
 the 200 seconds.   The curves (1), (2), and (3) in the diagram are
 drawn from these tables, the abscissa being the time (in half-seconds)
 and the ordinate the galvanometer deflection.

 inside two small copper cylinders, and brought to an almost                      steady
 temperature      by the well-screened       flame of a spirit-lamp beneath.             A
 thermometer       wasjnserted with its bulb touching the junction.                   The
 cold junction (well varnished) was kept in a large can of water; the
 temperature of this seldom varied by more than "3 of a degree C.
 Several hours usually elapsed           between      each reading.       The reading
 at each temperature        was the mean        of four deflections, two to          each
 side of the scale.        Table  IX.   gives a set of the measurements           :

     § 4. Comparison         of Peltier Effect with Thermoelectric Power.
   Further      experiments were         also   made     in  order   to compare       the
measurements        of the Peltier effect with those of the thermoelectric
power in the same specimens.              The apparatus        here used    consisted
essentially     of two thermopiles (one of FeZn and the other of
FeArg) of the same size and shape, and having the 6ame number
of junctions each.         These were arranged, junction to junction, in                as
symmetrical      a  manner    as possible.

     Two forms of this           arrangement       were used.      In   the first (a) the
 Iiermopiles        were two broad         strips (formed of alternate squares of
 be     metals), bent into zigzags which fitted one within the other.
The one zigzag was of iron and zinc, and the other of iron and
jerman silver.            The iron used here was thin tinplate, and none of
,he metals were annealed.               This arrangement was not perfectly sym-
netrical     ; the second modification (6) was, however.                  It  consisted of
rour zigzag thermopiles of               18 junctions       each, almost     idontical in
size and      form, made of strips of thin sheet metal,                3 cms.    long and
i bout 5 mms. broad.             Two of them were of FeArg and the other two
>f   FeZn.        These were arranged          in the form of a square, with their
junctions interlaced,          the similar piles being at opposite           sides of the
square.        Insulation was ensured by strips of asbestos paper separat
ing the junctions from           one another.         (The insulation was tested botli
at   high  and     low  temperatures,     and   was  found    to be practically perfect.)
Clearly this arrangement was perfectly symmetrical.                          In this case
the iron used was thin tinplate which had had the tin almost com
 pletely burnt off it at a red heat              ; the zinc and German silver were
also     well   annealed.       In both     cases,   the copper      boxes    or tubes    in
 which the piles         were heated       up were surrounded by asbestos wool
 and fireclay bricks, and the heating was done by a spirit-lamp care
 fully shut in from air          currents.      Nearly all the measurements           were
 made when the temperatures               had become almost perfectly steady.
     The battery current, which was from two Tray-Daniells,                       was kept
 as  constant      as  possible by gradually diminishing              the resistance      of
 the circuit as the current showed signs of falling.                   It  was measured
 by     a mirror      galvanometer      doubly shunted by copper shunts.                 In
 using both (a) and (6), the intervals for current, no-current, &c, were
  chosen of such a length that a permanent state of temperature dis
  tribution had been almost            reached before the end of each interval.
  For (a)   the periods were 60 sees, each, and                 for (b) 90     sees.  each.
  The thermopile measurements               were made in much the same manner
  as   in the case of nickel German silver described above [i.e., Peltier
  effect in pile (1) measured by pile (2), and then Peltier effect in pile
  (2) measured by pile (1)].
      In arrangement (6) the resistance                of the galvanometer        +  FeArg
  thermopiles       was   2 053     ohms,    while     that of galvanometer + FeZn
  piles was     1 -963 ohms.        This  difference     of resistance also diminished

as   the temperature        rose.    As it       was the      E.M.F.8 that were to         be
compared,      the indications of the FeZn piles had to be corrected for
this difference of resistance (and also for the change in this differ
ence).      In (a), as the piles had both such small resistance, this
correction was not required.
    The specific heat correction was deduced                   from the measurements
described     below.      Unfortunately          no measurement         was made      in the
case    of zinc  ; so the change           in    specific heat for     it was assumed       as
¦10    % per degree C.        If s1.s2,83 be       the specific heats of Fe,      Arg, and
Zn ; wl, w2, w>3 the relative weights of the thermopile strips of these
metals; ax, a2, a3 the respective percentage increments of the
specific heats (per degree C.)           ;   then the complete          correction (% per
deg.    C.)  has been taken as

                                                  + w^.

 and so on up to
                        •136   % per degree C. at 180° C.
     From the values within this range of temperature                       those at lower
 temperatures      were found by extrapolation.                  The effect of the small
 amount of brass and solder in the junctions                        was neglected.        The
 specific heat of German silver was taken as -10.

  the Peltier effect   in FeArg     varies    as the absolute       temperature,      the
  result in equation (1) at once establishes the usual theory.                    In any
  case, equation (1) perfectly agrees with the received theory.
     Experiments     were    also   made    with the four thermopiles inter
 laced in      the order     FeArg, FeArg,          FeZn,      FeZn,     the alternate
 ones being connected.          With this      difference,     everything was done
 just   as in the last described experiments.            In Table XII.        are the re
 sults.     The current was passed sometimes              through the one pair of
 piles    (FeArg and FeZn)         and sometimes          through     the other pair.
 These two ways are marked           P and Q in the         table.   The last column
 gives the values of the square root of                    corrected   for change       in

                  § 5. Measurement          of   Chamje       in Specific Heat.
      As   the correction for increase of specific                heat due to rise of tem
  perature      becomes       very large        at the higher temperatures,          it   wa>
  necessary      to measure     it for the metals used in the above experiments
  A   new method         of doiurj this occurred to the writer, and, although
  he believes       that much more accurate                 results might be got by thif
  method,      the results already obtained seem worth publication.                       The
  method consists          in  measuring,       at different temperatures,       the Joule
  effect   in   a strip or strips of the given metal.                For this purpose two
  narrow       strips (of iron, say) were doubled along the two sets of
  junctions of an FeArg thermopile (wrapped in thin asbestos paper).
       *
          These four terms correspond       to the four sets of thermopile junctions.

and    the   whole tied between         asbestos   boards    and copper plates.
The whole was packed,            in the usual     manner,     in   asbestos    within
a copper     box.      The current was passed through the strips alter
nately (and for such periods           as gave   almost    steady     conditions of
temperature),      and the     Joule  effect found from the           deflections   in
exactly the same manner           as the  Peltier   effect  in  the foregoing ex
periments.       Now    the rise of temperature      thus measured         is directly
proportional to the resistance of the strips, and inversely proportional
to the heat capacity         of the strips, asbestos, and thermopile ends.
Thus, by observing also the change in resistance, we can at once
calculate   the change     in heat capacity.     By this method       the correction
is measured under almost exactly the same conditions                 as those   under
which     it is to    be applied.      The influence of the asbestos paper
(which was of very small mass) may be neglected.                        The widely
different values of the correction found for the various metals seem to
show that the capacity of the thermopile ends (which were of much
smaller mass than the strips) may also be neglected.                        Thus the
results may be considered as tolerably accurate measurements of the
changes of specific heat in the various strips used
   The resistance        measurements      were   made     with     a Wheatstone's
bridge of the        ordinary form.       A thin strip of        the   given metal,
soldered    or brazed to two thick copper wires, was packed in asbestos
in copper boxes.         The measurements were all made at nearly steady*
temperatures,      as it  was found that when this was not the case, in
consistent results were obtained.
   As   the thermopile resistance formed a considerable              fraction of the
resistance    of the galvanometer        circuit, it had to be measured              at
different temperatures,         and a correction introduced for this.               In
measuring     this resistance, the battery contacts had to be short, other
wise the Peltier effects began soon to show themselves.                 Table    XIII.
jives    some of these measurements.             In   this,  as   in all the other
resistance    and Joule effect measurements,          the whole percentage in
crease from the value at the lowest temperature              was calculated,      and
from this the mean percentage increase per degree C. from the lowest
temperature.        The resistance of the galvanometer         and its connections
was 1-667 ohms.

    In    the   tables     which follow are given the measurements                         of the
resistance     and Joule effect, and the changes in specific heat deduced
from them.           In the    case   of the iron and cadmium the Joule effects
were     measured         at the     same time, iron           being at one end of the
thermopile and cadmium at the other.                        Also in this       case   the battery
current was measured by the Joule effect in iron strips round the ends
of another        thermopile.         With       regard    to   the     results for German

5.  On some Vapour Densities at High Temperatures.                                  By
                        Alexander Scott, M.A., D.Sc.
   The apparatus        used  in the following determinations is that of
Victor Meyer, modified as described in a paper published in 1879,
" On the Vapour Densities of Potassium and Sodium,"* by Professor
Dewar and the author.             In  the     experiments     here described,       the
platinum vessel was further protected by a casing of iron, and the
intervening space filled with magnesia, the iron casing                    being   em
bedded     in   sand    enclosed   between        two crucibles.        In  Series    L
hydrogen      was the gas used to          fill  the   apparatus,    but in all the
others    nitrogen    prepared   from the atmosphere           by mixing it with
ammonia      and drawing the mixture over red-hot copper, then through
dilute sulphuric acid        into large      glass   gasholders,     from which       it
was expelled      after drying into the vapour-density apparatus.                  The
nitrogen     thus prepared     almost invariably contains         a   small quantity
of hydrogen,      and this is a decided         advantage    for most of the sub
stances     used.    The temperature         of    the   furnace    (which was an
ordinary wind furnace, with 35-feet draught,                  and fed with coke)
was   considerably above the melting-point of cast iron, but was
barely hot enough         to volatilise rapidly potassium         iodide and silver
chloride, and this gives their results            rather high.     The best way of
weighing the potassium and sodium was found to                   be to   cut   rapidly
a piece of the required weight as nearly as possible, and instantly
wrap   it  up in a tared piece- of thin platinum foil and weigh again.
The sodium kept remarkably well thus, but the potassium was not
so satisfactory.      To check the weights, pieces were similarly weighed
and thrown into water, when             it was found to require 23-8 to 24*3
milligrams of sodium to give           11*16 c.c. of hydrogen,          according    as
an ordinary Becker's         balance, turning with a milligram was used,
or a finer one turning with           *1   milligram, the more rapid though
coarser one giving thus          the   best results;       of potassium      similarly
46*3 milligrams were required.
   The weight in milligrams of the substance which would be required
to give 22-33 cubic centimetres           of vapour is taken       as the molecular
weight.

  The mercury was used to test the apparatus, and indicates that
the results obtained are                 a     little too high.
  The cadmium bromide seemed to                                    cease    giving off gas like the other
substances, but         if    the measuring                   tube be left in position, an additional
quantity of gas          is   obtained,             most        probably from further dissociation
of the vapour into its elements.                                   The cadmium iodide dissociated
very largely       as    indicated by its low vapour density and by expelling
the vapours,         when large quantities of free iodine were observed.
Silver chloride and potassium iodide volatilised very slowly;                                                     the
vapour of the latter seemed to be free from every trace of                                                       free
iodine.

      The results of      the chromium chloride are not very concordant,
 and may be due to traces of water.                      The sample used was sublimed
 and raised to a red heat before using                   ; green   oxide was observed on
 the tube for expelling               the vapours.          Mercuric      chloride seems to
 dissociate largely into its elements,                   as do the      sulphide and mer
 curous chloride.         Sulphur was used to check the apparatus.

    The ferric chloride was sublimed immediately before                      use, but its
extremely hygroscopic nature             renders     it highly probable         that the

no action whatever on the vapours of potassium                    and sodium,           and

with the exception of         one with    sodium, which was the first done
in   a new platinum vessel.          It may    be taken then as conclusively
proved that      the molecules    of potassium     and sodium are monatomic
at high temperatures.
     Mercury,     sulphur, and iodine were used to test the apparatus
and the degree of accuracy to be expected, and gave results quite in
accordance with those of other experimenters,              as did also mercuric
sulphide.       Both chlorides of mercury seem to undergo a very large
amount of dissociation into their elements, though not to the same
 extent as the sulphide.
     The results for     the  chlorides and iodides of caesium, rubidium,
 and potassium        point to     the ordinarily    received formulae    as the
 correct ones, as is the case with the chlorides of manganese, silver,
 and lead, which last seems to dissociate          to a certain extent.
     The bromide and iodide of cadmium           also seem to dissociate largely
 at the temperature        employed.     Ferric and chromic chlorides give
 results which seem to point conclusively to the formulae             FeCl3 and
 CrClj     as the true ones, the chromic chloride giving results very
 closely corresponding to this, and the ferric chloride considerably
 lower, which may be due to water absorbed during weighing (which
 was done as above described for potassium), and this giving a larger
 volume of hydrochloric         acid than the ferric chloride from which it
  would     be produced,     gives too low a number for the molecular
  weight
     Potassium fluoride was tried, but gave no vapour whatever,              and

     One experiment with arsenic           trioxide gave results pointing      to
 As406 as its formula, but further experiments are in progress with
  it and several other bodies, the results of which I hope to be able
 to communicate shortly.

   7.  The Thermal Windrose at the Ben Nevis Observatory.
                               By A. Eankine.
    The Table, showing the Thermal Windrose,             accompanying       this
 paper, was computed from the observations made at the Ben Nevis
 Observatory during the three years ending May             1887.     It   shows
 the   mean temperatures,     on the mean of       the three years, of the
 different winds for each month, for the year, and for the             seasons.
 The direction of the wind is observed to the thirty-two points           of the
 compass, but   in this table  the temperatures   are only shown for eight
 points, the intermediate points having all been added on              to these
eight points in the same way       as that described by Mr Omond mh is
paper   on  " Winds and Rainfall " in        the   Journal of     the Scoitidt
Meteorological Society,     namely, the by winds were added to their
adjacent octants, and the points half-way between           the octants were
on the odd day of each month added to the octant to their right,
looking out from the centre of the compass card, i.e., they were         veered
two points, and on the even days to that on their left, i.e., they were
backed two points.      The mean temperature of each direction of wind
for each month was found by tabulating the hourly observations                 of
temperature    under the direction of wind observed at the same            time,
or under its octant as above, and then taking the arithmetical mean
When     the wind was variable, or its direction doubtful, the tempera
ture was entered      in the column for     calms    and variables.       These
variable winds belong chiefly to the northern half of the compass,
their existence being principally due to the abrupt and precipitous
character of the north side of the Ben.        The temperatures       given in
the   table  are those   indicated by thermometers        which in summer
and autumn are protected        in  the regulation Stevenson screen, and
in winter and spring in       a smaller pattern of the same, which            can
be shifted up or down a ladder-like stand, so as to be always at or
near the standard height of 4 feet above the surface of the snow.
    There are two columns of monthly means in the table, one giving
the mean      temperature for each month, deduced            in the  ordinary
manner from the daily means, and the other giving the mean of the
temperatures    in the  table under the eight wind directions.           It  will
be seen that there is a considerable difference        between    these    mean

temperatures in certain                months, which difference                  is obviously due
to   the inequality of the frequency of the different winds.
     As    the     character      and relative          frequency of each wind                      have
already     been discussed by             Mr Omond, it only             remains      to add a few
words regarding wind-temperature,                      as   far as the accompanying table
sheds any light on the subject.
     The first point to be noticed               is,   that on the mean of the year the
south      is     the warmest         wind, its temperature            being 32°"6        ;   and    the
north-east         is   the coldest wind, its temperature                    being 26° '5; and
also that the winds in their order of highest temperature                                     are — S.,
S.W., W. (N.W. =S.E), E., N., KE.,— the north-west and south
east winds being equal in temperature,                        and the east and north winds
almost      so.     In   each of the seasons the north-east wind                    is   the coldest,
and, with one exception, the south                       is   the warmest,          the exception
being      winter,       when the warmest               wind      is   the south-west.               An
inspection of the results for the different months shows that the
above order of highest temperature                      of the directions varies consider
ably from month to month, as does also the difference between                                        the
temperatures of the warmest                    and coldest winds in each month, the
maximum             difference    being 10°'7           in March,           and the        minimum
4°'2 in April        ;   while the mean of all the monthly differences                         is   60-7.
This      difference      on the mean           of the seasons          is     greater     in winter
and spring than in summer                       and autumn, being least in summer.
Though          the means for the year and for the seasons show that the
warmest and coldest               points are almost constant, yet the monthly
results         show that        these     points        oscillate,      the       warmest       point
markedly           and the       coldest rather less             so.        During the winter
months the warmest point                  is   south-west,       but, as the year advances,
it   swings round through south to south-east,                          which      is    its direction
in   July    and September.              The coldest point             is   north-east for nine
months      ;     and though in February           it    is   south-east,        in June east, and
in November north,               it   has not so well defined            an oscillation as the
warmest         point.
     The   differences      between        the annual ranges of temperature                     of the
different directions of wind                   seem to point           to    the    cause      of this
oscillation in the direction of the warmest wind,                           as   being the degree
to    which        the yearly march of temperature                     affects the areas over
which these winds blow.                   The south-east wind has an annual range,

for which month           it is the     coldest wind, being 19° "7; and in                     July,
when it is not only the warmest                    for that month, but also for the
whole year,      its temperature            is 44" -0.       The wind having              the least
annual range is the north-west,                    its temperature          in January         being
24°-l, and in August 35°-8, thus giving it a range of                                14°"4.      The
mean annual range             for the directions S.W., W., N.W., is                           15°-6.,
and that for S.E., E., N.E., is 20°-7.                      The difference        between these
ranges is apparently due to the                    fact that the easterly            winds blow
over land, and the               westerly        winds over          sea, — land      areas    being
subject     to greater extremes            of  temperature         than sea areas, and this
is apparently the cause of the oscillation above referred to.                                 In  the

 east winds belong to anticyclonic                   systems,       and this also may            have
 a good deal     to do with the great annual range of temperature of                               the

            Sir Joseph Lister, that the Blood has no spontaneous
            tendency to Coagulate.     By Professor John Berry
            Haycraft.
                                          {Abstract.)
    Sir Astley Cooper and Turner Thackrah taught that blood                                  was    a
 fluid tending to coagulate, but inhibited from doing so by the living
 vascular walls. This view        erroneously ascribed to Briicke, who
                                          is
 himself only professes to support it.
    Sir Joseph Lister        considers         that blood of itself does not tend to

420          Proceedings   of Royal Society of Edinburgh,                [jult   18,
coagulate.     When    shed   from the body thia condition is             acUveltj
induced by its contact with foreign matter.        It is unnecessary,       there
fore, to assume that the vascular wall has any inhibitory             power.
    In order conclusively to determine which view is           the correct one,
it is necessary to obtain blood which is neither       in   contact with the
vascular wall nor with a solid foreign body          This   I   have succeeded
in doing by immersing drops of blood in fluids differing                  from    it
in surface tension, such as oil, paraffin, &c.
   Many     experiments   were   made,   notably the receiving of blood
upon the greased surface of       a mica   plate immersed       in  a vessel full
of paraffin oil.   The drops remained     fluid sometimes for two or three
hours.     The most successful experiments      were, however,         performed
by injecting a viscous     mixture of vaseline and paraffin oil into            the
vein of a sheep.       It  was   mixed with the blood         so as to isolate
drops of blood in the midst of the viscous         mass.      These     remained
fluid on more than one occasion for twelve hours afterwards.
    The conclusion    I  drew from these experiments was that blood
required the influence of solid matter to bring about coagulation,
and    that the view of Sir Joseph         Lister— which      he had himself
supported by the strongest arguments        — was  correct.
    Shortly after the completion of these experiments,           the important
results   of  Dr Freund's    were published       He   had been        traversing
almost exactly the same ground            that  I  had,   and      at   the   same
time.
    There is a general belief      that white blood corpuscles            are con
stantly    breaking down     in the    blood-vessels,   setting free fibrin-
ferment.      This view  we owe mainly to Alexander Schmidt and his
school.     Moreover, ferment when artificially injected into the blood
vessels soon disappears.
    I had   been led by my experiments to the fact that the smallest
quantity of fibrous ferment will in time coagulate a considerable
 mass of blood, and inasmuch as blood remains fluid in a ligatured
 vein for twelve or twenty-four hours, it is improbable that                  blood
corpuscles    are constantly breaking down and setting free ferment,
unless we suppose that its action is prevented by the vascular wall.
 This latter supposition both Freund's and my own experiments
 have shown to be highly improbable.
    In  order by a direct experiment to determine      whether the         vascular

1887.]       Professor Hay craft 's       A bstract of Experiments.             421
walls destroy the ferment in any way,               I   performed the following
experiment :—
    Dilute blood ferment           was injected and reinjected several        times
into the blood-vessels        of a dog, previously freed from blood.            The
injected     solution was       as  powerful in causing       the coagulation of
hydrocele fluid        as a  similar solution which had not been passed
through the vessels.
    It  is probable,     therefore,    that any injected ferment is destroyed
within     special   organs or eliminated from the system.             This would
of course be a        priori    most   probable.    One is driven to conclude,
therefore,     that in the course of the ordinary circulation (whatever
may take place in glandular structures) corpuscles do not break
down, nor is free ferment present in the plasma.
    It is stated, however,        by many to be present.
    Believing that this assumption is due to want of care in mani
pulation,     I  repeated   well-known      experiments,    adopting special pre
cautions.
    Previous      experimenters      had   obtained blood either from a cut
vessel    or from one fitted with a glass caunula.               The blood must,
therefore,     have come in contact          for a moment     — a sufficient time
to produce       ferment — with the cut       surface of the vessel or with the
cannula.        The blood was then received           into a vessel containing a
 saturated     solution of      sulphate   of magnesia.      After filtration, the
plasma was found to possess the power of clotting, on dilution.
    I  repeated      this experiment,       mixing     the  magnesium     sulphate
solution with the blood while tlie latter was still within a blood
vessel (an excised       vein).     After filtration,   the diluted and dialysed
plasma did not coagulate.
   I am     inclined then to believe that blood corpuscles do not break
down in the blood-vessels,           or that   if they   do they do not set free
any ferment.        This latter is not     present  in circulating blood, which
only tends to coagulate           when it is brought in contact with solid
matter.
   The exact way in which this solid matter acts,               I hope to   discuss
in  a subsequent paper.

11.    On the Chemical Composition of the Water composing
                the Clyde Sea Area.              By Adam Dickie.
   About the beginning of this year               I was requested by a subcom
mittee of the Government Grant Committee* to determine some of
the components         of  a series   of samples of sea water, which             were to
be collected     during the year at various parts and at different              times  in
the Clyde sea area by the observers of the Scottish Marine Station.
The collections were chiefly made under the immediate                     direction of
Dr H. R. Mill.           Since January, accordingly,        I  have    been working
at this, and have completed           in all eighty-nine analyses, the results of
which     I now take the liberty of placing before this Society.                   There
are various reasons why this paper should consist of                little   more than
tables of results, one of which is that, having little or no experience
in   the science      of oceanography,      it would    be presumptuous        in  me to
draw conclusions from my results which would no doubt strike any
one acquainted         with that    science at once.       Another reason is that,
though acquainted with some of the                    physical conditions under
which the samples were taken, such as depth, temperature,                       place of
collection, and date,        I am quite ignorant of other conditions quite
as   important,     if not  more so,    in my estimation,     as,  for instance, pre
sence or absence of some freshwater              stream near place of collection,
state of tide,     rainfall, &c, — all conditions which would            no doubt in
fluence more or less materially the salinity of the water.
    It  is needless for me even to describe the methods of analysis                      I
adopted,     as,   with    one   exception,    I   have   adhered     strictly to     the
 methods     so   fully   described    by  Dr Dittmar in his memoir               on the
 " Challenger     "
                     waters.   The exception was in the        case  of the chlorine,
 in the analysis of which, though using the modification of Volhard's
 method described in the memoir for my final titration,                    I  employed
Mohr's method, in which chromate of potash is used                    as an    indicator
for the preliminary.
    It  was intended at first to determine            the chlorine, the sulphuric
acid, the alkalinity,       and the suspended        matter, but the latter        I only
completed      in some of the first batch of samples.             In estimating       this

I    proceeded       as   follows:      — After determining the other                    components,
I    weighed the bottle and all that remained of the                               sea water,   filtered
the water through a tared filter paper (which was then dried at
100° C. and weighed), and then weighed bottle again, the difference
of   course being weight of water filtered.                              I found   that, whilst there
was generally about a kilogramme of water filtered, the weight of
suspended matter never                    amounted      to more than 8 mgrms., and was
sometimes         not more than            1£   mgrms.      ,   and,      as the   probable error in
weighing would amount to a not inconsiderable portion of this small
weight,     I considered that the               importance of the result obtained was
not worth the time and labour employed in the getting of                                     it,   which
was sometimes considerable.
     Appended        is   a   table of results.
     The first six columns of this table explain themselves.                                    Column
A    gives the chlorine in grms. per kilo.                           ;   column    B    gives the sul
phuric acid (SOs) in grms. per kilo.;   and D are the alkalinityC
columns     ;gives the
                 C     amount of C02 present as normal carbonate
iu   mgrms. per           litre; and D the amount in                      mgrms. per 100 mgrms.
of total salts.           In    this latter,    as I   did not estimate the total salts,              I
have      calculated from the chlorine, using the number 55-43 as equi
valent to 100 parts total salts, that being the number which                                          Dr
Dittmar       establishes           in his "Challenger"              memoir.        Column      E   gives
the ratios existing in the different samples between the chlorine and
the sulphuric acid              ;   i.e., the weight of S03 per unit of chlorine.
     On glancing over the chlorines ascertained                                in the " Challenger      "
work, we find that in no sample was the chlorine less than 18 grms.
per kilo., that the largest number of samples gives quantities between
19 and 20 grms.                 per kilo., and that the sample                       having greatest
amount contained 20-64 grms.                         per kilo.            In   above table we find
that the largest                amount of chlorine              is   contained in No. 2619 =
18-946       grms.        per    kilo.,   a   sample    taken in the channel south of
Sanda;       and the            least     in No.     1423 = 1-1692              grms.    per kilo.,    a
Lochfyne          sample.           But though        the       difference       between   these two
figures     is   considerable,          the general    variation in the quantity of chlo
rine   is   not   so great,         for we find that out of the eighty-nine samples
only eight (all of them surface samples) contain less than 16 grms.
per kilo., and only five less than 14 grms. per kilo.

very marked.          In    every instance     the amount      of chlorine is   greater
in bottom than in            surface   samples    taken at the same spot.          It is
also curious to note that, where three samples                   have   been taken (a
surface,     a   bottom, and one from some intermediate depth), the
chlorine in the latter is always greater than in the surface, and less
than in the bottom samples, leaving one to infer that the chlorine
in estuary      water, at least, increases       steadily from surface to bottom.
I   may here state that in five cases were surface, intermediate, and
bottom samples           collected,   and in every one of these the above rule
holds good.
    The alkalinity        was determined      in 250 c.c of     the water, by means
of titration with             normal acid and alkali.        The mean over all the
samples     for alkalinity,      in terms of 100 parts total salts, or,      in other
 words, the weight of C02 present as normal carbonates, expressed
in terms of 100 parts total salts, or of 55*43 parts chlorines, is as
 •1482    is to 100.          The mean alkalinity of the forty-one             surface
samples      is '15,     and of the thirty-nine            bottom samples       '1470.
 In  the  "Challenger"          water   the mean over all was '1520,           that of
fifteen surface waters '1492, and that of sixty-three bottom waters
  1540.
    The sulphuric acid          was determined       in about 50    grms., strictly in
accordance       with the method described by Dr Dittmar in his                " Chal
         "                 These results are shown in columns B and               E
lenger      memoir.                                                                   of
the table, B giving the sulphuric acid (S03) per kilo., which, of
course, varied with the quantity of chlorine ; and E the quantity
expressed      in  mgrms. per mgrm.          of chlorine.     In the latter column
the results, except in three          cases,   are  fairly constant. In the three
exceptional       cases,   which are enclosed         in brackets,   it is noticeable
that the amount of chlorine is remarkably small, and, of course, in
the analysis the amount of BaS04                   to be weighed would be corre
spondingly small, so          I suppose the lowness of the results arises from
the probable error           in weighing, which, of        course,  in  a calculation
of this kind is multiplied up enormously.                  The average quantity of
sulphuric acid (S03), in terms of the grammes of chlorine, is "1175                    ;
whilst in the "Challenger" water it was '11576,                   a somewhat lower
figure.

the details in the construction of the C screen                                          ;   nor have           I          been
able    to keep            a    continuous         record of its readings.                          Only        a few
observations have                 been       made         at       intervals with            it,    as       originally
constructed, and shown                        in     fig.      1    of this        paper,         and with                                the
Stevenson screens.                  The result of all these trials                           is    to confirm                             the
conclusions already arrived at.                           The      C     screen always gave the lowest

windy days the differences in the readings were not                                  so great.
  To illustrate the influence of the weather on the                                  readings        of the
Stevenson screen with open                         bottom,     I       shall use all the readings
taken with the screens between the 23rd                                July   and the 19th August
of this year                  arranged in the table (p. 428).

     In       the first column of the table are the dates of the observa
tions     ;    in   the second          column the temperatures                 of the air as given
by the             C screen   ;   in the third column is the excess error of the
Stevenson screen with bottom open; and in the last column is the
estimated force of the wind, on a scale of from                                  0" to    10.        It will
be seen from the last column, that from the 23rd to the 29th                                           July
the weather was stormy, and that on the following days there was but
little wind.            The effect of these two conditions on the comparative
readings of the screens is very evident.                               While the wind       was strong
it will       be noticed that the difference                  between         them was often less
than one degree, but when the wind fell it was frequently more than
two degrees.
     One object of meteorological observatories is to tell us something
about the climate of the place — that                                  something about its effects
                                                              is is,
on animal and vegetable life.                      Now   it            admitted by every one that
the indications of the instruments in general use in our observatories
do    not by any means                     agree   with the indications                  given by our
bodies.             The thermometer often says one thing, while our feelings
indicate something quite different.                      No doubt, part of this                 disagree
ment          is   the result of          the more    or less           healthy condition            of our
bodies at the time                ;    they are, so to speak, instruments with shifting
scale.         But apart from this, there                is    frequently        a   wide difference
between            the indications         of the meteorological instruments and the
average feeling of                a   great number of people.                 This results from the
meteorological instruments not being affected by the same causes                                         as
our bodies.             The thermometer may indicate that the air                               is   warm,
while we may feel                 it   to be cold.     This      may be the result of the air
being dry, and causing                    a   cooling effect by         a   rapid evaporation from
our bodies.            We have therefore to check the readings of the dry bulb
thermometer by                a       reference   to the wet one         ;    we thus get    a   greater
similarity between the indications of the meteorological instruments
and those            of our   bodies.

     On our      solar radiation measurements,                 we however have                       no such
check.          The thermometer         with blackened bulb in                  vacuo may indicate
a very strong         solar radiation, and yet we may feel it chilly                                  ;    or it
may indicate a comparatively low radiation                               effect, and we may feel
warm.           This difference in the indications may be due to different
causes, but no doubt wind is one of the most important.                                         The wind
has but     little   effect on the solar radiation thermometer,                            while      it    has
a most powerful influence               in checking the heating                  effect        of the son
on    our       bodies.       It   seems     therefore desirable that some                                other
instrument be designed                 for the purpose            of showing the radiation
effect, as tempered by the wind,                in order that our observatories                            may
toll us something more definite about the climate of the place.
     The radiation thermometer                described in a previous part of this
communication is affected by the wind, and might be used for this
purpose     ;    but owing to the absorbing surface being flat, it is neces
sary that it be kept always turned towards the sun                                         ;    it is not,
therefore,       suitable for ordinary work.                   In      place     of    it,
                                                                                        I        have for
some     time used        a    large    hollow sphere made of thin metal, and
having      a    thermometer fitted to               it,   with its bulb              in       the    centre.
What       size this      ball ought to be has                 not yet been determined,
but   if    observations are to be taken                    witli an instrument of this
kind, all that seems necessary                    is,   that   a uniform size of ball be
adopted         for all   observatories,       and that           it   he      made    of        the same
kind and thickness of              metaL       The size of the ball,              if   not too small,
does not seem to affect                the readings          much.             Readings have been
taken here with two balls — one 15 cm. in diameter,                                   and the other
40 cm.          Headings given by the 40 cm. ball will be given later on                                      ;
those given by the smaller ball were only                           2°    or 3° lower than the
large one.
     These hollow          balls    have      also      been      used         for night         radiation
measurements.             The readings obtained with them are not so valuable
as those got       with flat-surfaced instruments,                  as they do not get cooled
so much.          While the        flat surface      gets cooled 10° or 11°                     below the
temperature        of the air on       a   clear night, the large ball falls           only 5° or
6°   and the small one not so much                      by   1°   or     2°.     When in use, the
balls are fixed to        a   post at the same height as the screen, and at no
great distance from it.             This method of taking radiation tempera
tures at night seems to be better than the one in general use.                                             The

1887.]          Mr J. Aitken       on Thermometer Screens.                     431
plan generally adopted        of taking the readings of a thermometer
placed on the grass is open to many objections.                  The temperature
indicated by a thermometer so placed              is affected    by the greater or
less amount of heat communicated upwards from the ground, by the
amount of air circulating just at the place where the bulb happens
to be, and other local influences, to many of which the ball at four
feet from the ground is not exposed.            By changing very slightly        the
 position of the bulb of the thermometer placed                  oq the   grass, we
 can greatly alter its readings, whereas          this is not the case with the
 ball at four feet from the ground.          In  the large ball used here there
 are fixed two tubes     in   a horizontal     position.     One of these tubes
 holds a maximum, the other a minimum thermometer.
     Returning   to the table     showing the difference in the readings of
 the Stevenson and the C screens.              In   the   fourth column will be
 found the effect of solar radiation in heating the 40 cm. ball.                 The
 figures given are not the temperatures         given by the ball, but the ex
 cess of this temperature    above that of the air, or, in other words,          it is
 the heating effect of the radiation.        For   instance,   on the 23rd of   July
 the temperature    of the ball was 84°, the air was 64°, and the heating
  effect of the sun was thus 20° as entered.             In the fifth column       are
  the solar radiation temperatures        taken by the black bulb in vacuo.
  These temperatures      are    treated   in the same       way as those      given
  by the black ball   ; the figures show how much the thermometer was
  heated above the temperature         of the air.
     It will  be noticed that though the error of the Stevenson screen is
  due to radiation, yet  it follows   the indications of neither of these radia
  tion thermometers.      This is quite    to be expected,      because the error of
  the screen is the effect of radiation as modified by wind.            Though the
  readings of the ball give the effect of radiation          as  modified by wind,
  yet these readings alone do not tell us how much they are affected
   by wind.     For instance, the black ball might            be heated    to only    a
   small amount, either by a strong sun checked               by a strong wind, or
  by a feeble radiation unchecked by wind.               If, however,   we compare
   the temperatures    of the black ball with those of the black bulb in
   vacuo, we at once see the effect of the wind.          No two of   these readings
   for any day   bear the same relation to each other.             When    there was
   much wind, the black ball was heated               only to about 0-4 times the
   temperature of the black bulb         ; whereas    when there was little wind

432          Proceedings     of Royal Society of Edinburgh,           [july   16,
it was heated to 0 66 times.        If   then we divide the temperature       of
the black ball by that of the black bulb, we get a series of numbers
inversely   proportional     to the cooling effect      of the wind.     These
numbers are given in the sixth column.              If  now we multiply     the
numbers so obtained by the heating effect of the radiation on the
black ball, we get a series of numbers representing the combined
effects of solar radiation and wind.        These numbers are given in the
seventh column.
    It will be observed    that the numbers so calculated vary with the
errors of the Stevenson screen        given in the third column, and that
when they are divided by 10 the figures in the two columns                agree
fairly well with    each other.      It will, however, be noticed that the
figures agree much better when the weather is calm and settled than
when it is stormy.       This   was probably due to the fact that during
the windy days it was also cloudy, with only short gleams of sun
shine, sufficient to heat up the black ball and black bulb, but not
long enough continued to heat up the screens;            or it may have been
due to the maximum radiation temperatures              not having happened
at the same time as the          maximum      air temperature.     The errors
during the cloudy weather were thus probably smaller than they
would have been      if there had been continued sunshine.
   It  would thus appear that, by taking observations with a black
ball and a black bulb in vacuo, we can calculate pretty well what
will be the excess in the readings of the Stevenson screen oyer those
of the G screen.       And further,    a  comparison of readings taken in
this way also tells us something about the climate of the place
which cannot be ascertained         by an examination of the readings of
the black bulb    in  vacuo alone.      On the 24th    July, for instance,   the
black bulb in vacuo was heated          69° above    the temperature     of  the
air, while the black ball was only heated 28", and the error of the
Stevenson screen was only 1°; whereas on the 18th August, when
the black bulb in vacuo was not heated             quite so much, the black
ball had its temperature      raised 42°,5, and the error    in the Stevenson
screen was 2°-6.       As  the thermometer       in the Stevenson screen       is
influenced very much in the same way             as our bodies, by radiation
modified by wind, we may look on the figures given in the seventh
column of the table       as   representing more nearly the climatic con
ditions than those given by any other method at present in use.

14. On the Quotient of a Simple Alternant by the Difference-
  Product of the Variables.                     By Thomas Muir, M.A., LL.D.
     On    17th March 1879           I  gave to the       Koyal Society of Edinburgh
an account of           some researches         on the subject of         Alternants.        A
short descriptive abstract of the communication was published in
the Proceedings, vol x. pp. 102, 103, the concluding paragraph of
 which is as follows : —
            " Now it is well known that                the alternant whose       indices are
        in order       0, 1, 2, 3                is equal to the difference-product
        of its variables.           In    regard     to every other alternant            it is
        evident that it must contain the said difference-product                          as  a
        factor, but what the co-factor should be is not so readily seen.
        In    particular     cases,   doubtless,      it can be found       without much
        difficulty, but a general             method of obtaining it has hitherto
        been a desideratum.              Such     a general       method the author has
        discovered along with a number of less important results bear
         ing on the same special form of determinant."
     These results were never published,                  as,  very shortly after the date
 referred to, the volume of the Giornale di Matematica                              for 1878
 arrived, and        I   found that what           I   had looked      upon as my most
 important theorem,           was given and proved by Garbieri at the begin
 ning of the volume.
     Now, however, that                fresh    interest      in   the  subject has       been
  awakened by the very able papers of Professor Woolsey                              Johnson,
  which     have    recently appeared in the American Journal of Mathe
  matics (vii. pp. 345-352, 380-388) and Quarterly Journal of
  Mathematics (xxi. pp. 217-224), I desire to resuscitate my method.
  Happily      there is no question of priority involved.                 The methods are
  diverse, and the superiority              lies entirely with Professor Johnson's.

  his discovery of the existence of the symmetric function Q which
   is the difference of o(0, p, q, r) and a(l, p, q,r— 1), and his mode
  of determining the said function, are things of which                            I   had not
   dreamed,      and which      I   consider the most notable results added                   to
   the theory of alternants for a great many years.

is       evidently          a       homogeneous                     symmetric                   function         of     degree

The problem              is   to determine x, y,                    z,   u.
      Professor Johnson's                        method            is    to     use         repeatedly his              above-

      My method               contrasts            with this in that                       it        determines the             co
efficients x, y,          z,   u separately.                    Besides,          therefore, being of interest
as    throwing       a    side-light on Professor Johnson's                                          method,     it    may      be
found useful when only one or                                   a       very few coefficients are wanted,
and      it    has certainly been                       the means of arriving at several more                                   ot
less noteworthy results.
     The basis of              it   is       the      expansion of the alternants in terms                                       of
alternants of lower orders.

In   the group     A   delete those which are greater                 than the index of           c

a  number from group B, will give the sum 4, 4 being 1 more than
the   sum of the last two indices                in    2«3i2c.      This number of         times,
2, is the coefficient required.
    The solution      is here put at greater length than need                     be,   in order
that when taken with               the corresponding              solution for the case of
alternants of the fourth order, the generality of the method may be
 apparent.      It  may be enunciated quite shortly as a theorem, viz.: —
    Tlie  coefficient   of 2a*6V in the expansion of \ a'lfc7                   | +• | a0£'c2 |  is

    Solution. — Write        the    integers        from 0 to 9, and separate them
into four groups A, B, C, D, by putting                       a  bar before 0, 2,      4  and   9 ;

In group A       delete,   if   necessary,        those    which are greater than the
index of d in "SmWcM.               Take the integers              from 0 to the index of
d inclusive, and unite each with such a number as will make the
sum    4,  that is to say,      1  more     than the sum of the last two indices
of  %a*b2c2d:    this gives

   For     the case of Sa'^cT, there is only one duad

and therefore,           as is at once seen,                      only          1    dovetailing.               And this
establishes     the theorem.
   These two theorems                      and one well known before                                    this    (v.   Theory

                           §
   Denoting          by er„ the sum of all the symmetric functions whose
terms involve n letters and are of the                                    s'b degree,             we may write the
third      theorem    referred to in the form

But by       the two new theorems
                      a(0,       1,   3,   2   + «)=                  <r., +
                                                                               2o-3    + 3<r4,

And      again by the third theorem
                      a(l,       2,    3,      «)    -                                       <r,  .

Of     course   if    these           last could be established                               independently,                we

     15.   Eemarks by the Chairman on Closing the Session.
    I  am told by our Secretary,         whose authority on such a subject             I
dare not venture to dispute, that on this the                last meeting       of  the
Session,    the duty falls on the retiring Vice-President               of making      a
few remarks on the business of that Session, including                    some infor
mation as to the number of new and of deceased Fellows, the papers
that have been read on each subject, and other similar information.
    This duty I now proceed, to the           best of my power, to discharge.
    It will, I am sure, be gratifying         to the members      to be told that
the supply       of papers      during   the  present   Session    has     been even
more ample than on former occasions,               and  I trust that we are not
guilty of undue vanity in believing that the contributions of this
year show the same deep and patient research, the same knowledge
of what has already been done, both in this country and abroad,
and the same mastery over the latest and best methods of mathe
matical and physical investigation, which have hitherto distinguished
the Fellows of this Society, and have given value to its transactions
 in the estimation of similar learned institutions elsewhere.
     As matter of        statistics, it may    be  noted    that in Physics          the
 number of papers read has been 22, in Mathematics                8,   in Astronomy
 6,  Meteorology      7,  Engineering     2, Chemistry    6,  Physical Geography
 3,  Anatomy and Physiology            10, Botany    2,  Biology    6,   Geology    and
 Paleontology      4,  Political Economy       1.
     It is also satisfactory to know that of late numerous                  candidates
 have sought admission to Fellowship.               During the last Session           3G
 were    admitted     as   Fellows   ;  in the present    the number has been
  35.    Many of these are men of high promise, and not a few have
 already    given evidence of scientific ability by the papers they                have
  published in our Proceedings and Transactions.
     On the other hand, death has, since the opening of the Session,
  made    serious   inroads on our ranks.           Since last    November         nine
  Fellows of our Society have died.
     When     among these       I mention the name of Thomas Stevenson, it
  is impossible not to think with sadness how short                a    time has run
  since, as the valued President of our Society, he occupied                this chair,
  and from     it delivered    addresses to which we listened      with instruction

and     pleasure.     Those who heard          him on these occasions, and those
who were         associated      with him in the        discharge     of the Society's
business, must all deeply regret that his tenure of office was so
short, and that the close of his life came so soon.                         Born of a
family to whom          we owe        the wonderful      advance     which has taken
place in the science of lighthouse-illumination,                it was his fortune to
carry to      still further perfection that branch of scientific knowledge
which       had been so handed down             to him, a branch of knowledge, it
need scarcely        be added, among the most            admirable in its practical
results, providing not for one nation alone but                 "in  salutem omnium"
for    the mariners and the argosies of            all nations,    a series of star-like
guides over the otherwise trackless ocean.                  It   has been said      in  an
able and affectionate           filial tribute to his memory, which I cannot
                             "
 resist quoting, that his lights were in every part of the world guid
 ing the mariner ; his firm were consulting engineers to the Indian,
 the New Zealand, and the Japanese Lighthouse Boards; in Germany
 he had been called the Nestor of lighthouse-illumination                     ;  even    in
 France, where         his claims were long denied, he was at last, on the
 occasion of the late Exposition, recognised                   and medalled."         Few
 men, it has also been            truly  said, were more beloved in         Edinburgh,
 where he breathed             an air that pleased       him;     and   I  am sure few
  men have ever been more               highly regarded by this Society than our
 late President.
      It  is with feelings of deep and unfeigned regret that we recall
  the loss which the Society has suffered               in the death of      Mr Robert
  Gray.      We all      feel    that in him wo have          lost a warm personal
  friend.      He was the highest authority on Scottish Ornithology, and
  had    a large and accurate acquaintance           with other branches of natural
  history.       He was Secretary of the Royal Physical Society, and by
  his able and energetic             management      may almost be said to have
  given it     a new lease of life.         He rendered valuable service           to our
  own Association, which devolved on him some of its most delicate
  and difficult business.            His bright     and   genial presence       will long
  and regretfully be missed at the meetings                 of this Society and its

      The brilliant early career of Adam Gifford, both at the bar and
  on the bench, and the affecting circumstances                      under which that

 many whose tastes lie altogether outside of the profession which he
adorned.       But Lord Gifford        was not a lawyer merely;       and    during
 those years when the shadow            of death was upon him he had, along
with other and higher           consolations,  the ample stores of philosophy
and poetry, and the varied studies of earlier years.
    By   the death      of Alexander Gibson, advocate,          Secretary    of  the
Educational       Endowments         Commission, the public       service, as   well
as his many personal friends, have suffered               a loss which will      not
easily   be repaired.        Born at   Kirkcaldy — the birth-place,     as  I  need
not remind this learned audience, of Adam Smith, the founder of
 Political Economy as a separate branch of human knowledge, — like
 Smith, young Gibson            received   the  first of his education at the
burgh school of that town.              Graduating afterwards in Arts in the
 University     of Edinburgh,       he took an active part in the       Diagnostic
Society, and speedily gained            the reputation of a student of great
acutcness     and of wide reading, both in literature and            in  law.    He
was also much interested             in natural philosophy and science, and
in that    department      of his professional knowledge which Leibnitz, at
once a     jurist and a mathematician, pronounced to rank next to
geometry in the soundness of its principles and the certainty of its
conclusions, the noble system of equity of the Roman law.                           I
quote his words — I have often said that after the writings
                           "                                                       of
geometricians        there    exists nothing which,      in point of strength,
subtility, and depth, can be compared with the works of the Roman
lawyers"      (Dugald      Stewart's Works, by Hamilton,          voL   L  p.   186,

    Mr William Denny of Dumbarton                   was   a distinguished      naval
constructor, and, as such, a large employer of labour.                 He took      a
keen interest in the         improvement of the working classes, and his
death caused a widely felt sorrow among               a large circle   of  friends,
not in this country only but abroad.

    Mr James Pringle, who        at the time of his death was Provost of
Leith,    received  his education at the High School of Edinburgh,         and
was distinguished        by his aptitude for classics.      During his long
connection with Leith he took a prominent part in promoting all
its  interests,  and as chief magistrate rendered      important services to
the town.
    Dr William Brown, who died in January           last, was,  I believe,  the
 oldest member of this Society, having been admitted in 1835.               He
had filled the office of President of the Royal College of Surgeons,
and enjoyed      a high reputation as a consulting physician.
    Dr Rutherford Haldane, LL.D.,          was one of the most       respected
members      of the medical profession in Edinburgh.            After leaving
our University he went abroad, for further study, to Vienna and
 Paris, spending eighteen months in the French capital.            He  became
successively a lecturer on Pathology and on the Practice of Medicine
in  the  Extra-Mural School.         By his professional brethren       he was
regarded     as an authority on    all medical questions.     He was    a man
of   great   learning;    and his early death cannot fail to be much
regretted by the Society.
    The Eev. Francis Le Grix White, although, from residence at               a
 distance from Edinburgh,         personally but little known to many of
us, kept up correspondence        with  the  Society, was a man of varied
accomplishments, and took an active            part in organising scientific
lectures in Cumberland          and Westmoreland.         He   also promoted
everything which        tended   to elevate   those classes over whom his
influence extended.

   The Prize is to be given in recognition of original work in Physic*,
Chemistry, or Pure or Applied Mathematics.
    Evidence of such work may be afforded               either by a paper pre
sented     to the Society, or by a paper on one of the above subjects
or some discovery in them elsewhere            communicated or made, which
the Council may consider to be deserving of the Prize.
    The Prize is open to men of science resident in, or connected with
Scotland.
    The first award shall be in the year        1 887, and shall consist      of   a
sum     of money.        In  accordance   with the wish of       the douor,     the
Council of the Society may on fit occasion award the Prize for work
of a definite kind         to be undertaken during        the succeeding three
years by a scientific man of recognised         ability.
    Before entering on the lost of the subjects of this evening's
meeting,     it will interest you to leam that, heartily joining            as we
all do in the loyal and affectionate         homage of the whole nation on
the completion by the Queen of the 50th year of her happy and
beneficent reign, the following Address has been forwarded to the
Secretary of State for presentation, the arrangements             not permitting
its presentation by our President :—
     " Madam, may it                                — We,         President     and
                            please your Majesty,             the

 attachment to your Majesty, and to the institution of the Crown,
 represented      in the  person of our present     gracious  and distinguished
 Sovereign.
     " The Royal Society of Edinburgh             was constituted     in tbe   year
 1782,     for the promotion of scientific and literary research,            by     a
 Charter from King George the Third.              In  times past   it has counted
 amongst      its members      many statesmen,      and men      of letters     and
 science, who have discussed freely the public and political questions
 of the times.         But   on one subject there      has happily     been  entire
 unanimity     — the    maintenance     of  the    principle   of constitutional
 monarchy       as established   in the British Empire under the guidance
 of your Majestv and your Royal predecessors.

   " We    are deeply sensible of the advantages which we have derived,
during    the past fifty years of social and legislative progress, from
the presence, at the head of the affairs of this great Empire, of
a Sovereign who is dissociated       from the contentions of political
parties, and is possessed of those high personal          qualities  which
enable the Crown to exert a moderating and controlling influence          in
the public life of the country.
   " As   a Scottish Society, we claim a share  in the sentiments of pride
and loyal attachment which your Majesty's personal relations with
Scotland have evoked in the hearts of our fellow-countrymen.            We
trust that your Majesty may long continue to derive health and
solace   from annual visits to your Majesty's Highland         home   ; and
we at the same time regard your Majesty's gracious presence amongst
us m a guarantee of that interest in, and knowledge of our distinc
tively national affairs, which, as Scotsmen,     we most  highly   value.
   "In     addressing  the  Royal   Successor    of  the ancient Scottish
Sovereigns, who in troubled times ruled this country with courage
and ability, we may conclude by offering to your Majesty our most
respectful and loyal congratulations on the good fortune, peace, and
prosperity which have hitherto accompanied         your Majesty's brilliant
and eventful reign ; and by expressing        the hope that the interests
of science and learning, with which this Society is connected,          and
whose marvellous development has been one of the             characteristic
features   of that reign, may continue to flourish, as heretofore, under
your Majesty's gracious encouragement       and protection.

      Part I.     (continued).         Determinants in General (1779-1812).
   Now it is      at once manifest that the successive developments here
obtained of the determinant [xyzt] are letter by letter identical with
the successive      " lignee    "
                                  obtained by Bezout from the unreal product
xyzt  ;  but    that     instead of having one arbitrary step succeeding
another,     as in the application of Bezout's rule, there is here a fluent
reasonableness          characterising the          whole       process.*      As  for   the
peculiarities requiring elucidation in the series of special examples
above     referred    to, they are seen, when looked at               in this light, to   be
but matters of course.
    Not only      so,  but it will be found that the translation of                 ry into
[a?y], &c, is     an unfailing key to much that follows                   in Bezout in  con
nection with the subject.               For    example,     let us take the wide exten
sion of the rule which is expounded later on in the treatise, in                            a
section headed
   *  If the fact at the basis of the process were made use of nowadays, it would
 be advantageous, of course, in the first instance to simplify the determinant as
 much as possible.       For example, the equations being (Bezout, p. 176)
                                      3x + 5y + 2i = 80 (

 we might proceed as follows: —

There are in all fifteen pages (pp. 208-223, §§ 252-270) devoted to
the subject.           The contents of three paragraphs will give a suffi
ciently clear idea of the nature of the whole.                     The notation used is
identical with that of Laplace,               e.g.,

               (264.) Cette manière de procéder au calcul des inconnues,
        en les grouppant, n'est pas applicable seulement à notre objet ;
        elle peut en général être appliquée dans toutes les équations                      du
        premier degré.

                                        exemple,

        En    se  rappellant que chaque inconnue a pour valeur le coeffi
        cient qu'elle      se  trouve avoir dans la dernière ligne, divisé con
        stamment         par celui que l'inconnue introduite               aura dans     cette
        même       ligne, on verra bientôt qu'on peut réduire le calcul à
        chercher      le coefficient     de l'une quelconque des inconnues dans
       la dernière ligne         ;  parce que de la même manière             qu'on en aura
        calculé      un, on calculera de même tous les autres                   :  ou même,
       lorsqu'on en aura calculé un, on pourra en déduire tous les
       autres, lorsque les équations auront toute la généralité                     possible.
        Or pour avoir la valeur du coefficient d'une des inconnues dans
       la dernière ligne, la question               se   réduit à calculer la valeur du
       produit des autres             inconnues.         Mais pour ne pas        se   tromper
       sur les signes,       il faudra toujours          ne pas perdre de vue, la place
       que cette inconnue est censée occuper dans le produit de toutes
       les inconnues.           Ainsi,    dans   le cas présent, au lieu de calculer
       généralement          la dernière       ligne pour avoir xyztu,            je calcule

Although     this can      be   done     nowadays with         ease   by    means      of
Laplace's expansion-theorem in its modern                  garb,  it may     be  safely
affirmed that Laplace himself, using his own process, would not have
succeeded    in making the reduction.              Considerable importance thus
attaches   from more       than one point          of view to Bézout's curious
" rule."
   The only other section         with which        we are concerned         bears   the
heading
        Méthode       pour trouver            des   fonctions d'un nombre
     quelconque        de    quantités,        qui soient zéro par elles-
     mêmes.
In  the second     paragraph     of the section the principle is explained as
follows :—
         "(216) Concevons un nombre n d'équations du                     premier degré
      renfermant un nombre n            + 1  d'inconnues, et sans ancun terme
      absolument connu.
         " Imaginons      que l'on augmente le nombre de ces équations, de
      l'une d'entr'elles; alors      il  est clair que ce que nous appelions la
      dernière ligne, sera non seulement                 l'équation      de   condition
      nécessaire    pour que ce nombre n +            1 d'équations ait heu       ; mais
      encore    que    cette équation de condition            aura   lieu;     on sorte
      qu'elle sera une fonction des coëfficiens              de ces équations,          la
      quelle sera zéro par elle-même.
         " Voilà donc un moyen trcs-siinpie pour trouver un nombre
      «+1* de fonctions d'un nombre n + 1 de quantités, lesquelles
      fonctions soient zéro par elles-mêmes."
For   example,    the pair of equations
                                  ax +by +cz = 0         \
                                  a'x   + l'y + c'z = 0  /
is taken,    the first   equation is repeated, and for this set of                  three
equations the équation de condition is found to be

                       - a'b)c - (ac' - a'c)b + (be' - b'c)a = 0       .
         " Or il    est clair que la troisième équation n'exprimant                   rien
       de différent de la première,           cette dernière quantité doit             être
      zéro par elle-même      :  donc si on      a ces  deux suites de quantités

   Thus far            there     is   in    substance                 nothing          new.        What    we have

equal       to zero.        Indeed the identities are used by Vandermonde                                         in
 Bdzout's form when solving                       a      set of simultaneous equations.                        But
what follows           is   important.

     It very curious to observe, in passing, that although Bizout does not
         is
obtain all his vanishing aggregates directly by means of the principle which
he so carefully states at the commencement,    nevertheless every one of them
can be so obtained.    He does not extend the principle beyond the case where
only one of the original equations       repeated.       however, we take the

 attention to the labours of Cramer and B6zout, specially lauding
 the method               of the latter, given in the treatise of 1779.                                  Then he

 been done by Cramer and Biizout                            (see    his words at                       p.     305).             His

 — In any permutation of                   the first n integers,                 the place-index of any
 integer     is   got    by   counting the integer itself, and all the elements after
it    which are less          tlian it. For example, in the permutation
                                  6,   4,   3,   9,   8,   10,     1,   7,   2,   5
 of the first ten integers, the place-index of                               9   is       6,   and that of              7   is   3.
 The counting of the integer itself makes the place-index always one

and     the two series of signs are seen to be identical, 3 being an odd
number.        Viewing       this   quite independently         of     the    theorem      to
which it is        annexed,      it is evident that       a change        of sign at any
 point in the      series    (A) implies    a change at the corresponding point
 in the other      series, and consequently attention need only be paid to
 the first sign of (B) as compared with the first sign of (A). Now
 the first sign of (A) must necessarily be always plus, there being no
 inversions;      and the       first sign of      (B)   depends        on   the changes
  necessary     for the transformation           of the natural order 1, 2,             3, 4,
 into    3, 1, 2, 4.      The truth of the corollary is thus apparent.
      A  second corollary is given, but         it is of still  less consequence,         the
  difference between it and the first being that in the arranged set (B)
  the place whose occupant remains unchanged may be any one of the
  n places.                                                                        (m. 12.)

      Two permutations          of   the  numbers      1, 2, 3,  .  .   .  , n are called
  conjugate       when each number and the number                of   the  place which it
  occupies    in  the   one permutation       are interchanged        in   the case   of   the
  other permutation.                                                                 (xxiv.)

  are conjugate, because          3 is in the 1" place of (A) and 1 is in the
  3rd  place of (B), 8     is in the 2"4 place of (A), and 2 is in the 8lh place
  of B, and so on in every          case.
      The first theorem obtained is —
      Conjugate permutations have the same sign.                                   (in.  13.)
      This is proved in           a   curious   and interesting           way,    a  special
  conjugate pair being considered,               viz., the    pair just given as an

 11, 22, 33,                     rr, or all the first    integers     :  but this is supple
 mented by a proof, that               if any   term be taken, e.g.,
                         16.24.33.47.51.68.79.82.95
 with the couples          so  arranged that the first integers            are   in   ascending
 order, and       the   sign   be determined       from     the number        of  inversions    in
 the series     of  second integers, then the sign obtained mill be the same
 as would       be got     by arranging       the couples so as to liave             the second
 integers      in   ascending        order,   and determining the sign from the
 inversions in the series of first integers.                 The proof rests entirely on
 the previous theorem, that conjugate permutations have the same
 sign    ;  indeed the new proposition is little else than another form of
 this theorem.                                                                         (in.   14.)
     The desirability of an appropriate notation for the cofactor, which
 any       one of     the     coefficients    has   in  the     common        denominator is
 recognised,* and the want supplied by prefixing                         f  to the coefficient
 in question j for          example,     the cofactor of 32 is denoted             by
                                               f32.

    The connection of Gauss with our theory was very similar to
 that of Lagrange, and doubtless was due to the fact that Lagrange

and for shortness speaks of it as the form                                     (a,   6,    c).     The function
of    the     coefficients          a,   6,   c,   which           was     found      by Lagrange               to    be
of notable importance in the discussion of the form, Gauss calls                                                     the
" determinant of             the form," the exact words of his definition being

Here then we have the first use of the term which with an extended
signification has in our day come to be so familiar.                                                    It   must be
carefully noted           that the more general                       functions, to which the name
came afterwards to be given, also repeatedly                                      occur in the course                 of
Gauss' work, e.g. the function                           aS - /?y     in his   statement           of   Lagrange's

But such functions are not spoken of as belonging to the                                                        same
category   as bb-ac.    In fact the new term introduced by Gauss
was    not " determinant " but " determinant of  form," being thus                   a
perfectly identical in meaning and usage with the modem                                                         term

     Notwithstanding             the title of the chapter Gauss                              did not confine

     Lagrange,        as we have             already seen, was led to certain identities
regarding the expression

in    the course of investigations on the subject of triangular pyramids.
The position of Monge is that of Lagrange                                             reversed.       From the
theory of equations he derives identities connecting such expressions,
and translates them into geometrical                                   theorems.
     The simpler of these identities, as being already chronicled, we
pass over.            At     p. 107 he takes the three equations

    In   this paper Binet returns to the consideration of the first of
 the two identities which have just been referred to, writing it now
 in the form

It   is   thus clear that, in November 1811, Binet was well on the way
towards        a      great      generalisation.                      He    even       says       that          the      three
identities may he looked upon
              "comme lea trois premieres                                   d'une suite de formules con-
          struites d'apres une memo loi facile                               a   saisir."
He merely indicates,                       however, the mode of proof he would adopt
for the results obtained, and refers to possible                                         applications of them
in investigations regarding the Method of Least Squares                                                             (Laplace,
Connaissance            des Terns, 1813) and the Centre of Gravity (Lagrange,
Mem. de Berlin, 1783). The mode of proof need not be given
here, as turns up again in the far more important memoir in
                 it
which the theorem in all its generality falls to be considered.

A proof by the method of mathematical induction                        (so-called)   is
given that with these signs the sum of all the permutations of any
group vanishes.
     Up   to this point the essence of what         has been       famished       is a
combined rule of term-formation and rule of signs.                (11.  5 +  in.  15.)
In connection with it Bezout's rule of              the      year  1764     may be
recalled.
    The ftiird problem is to determine          the sign of any single per
 mutation from consideration of the permutation itself.                The solution
is : — Under    each letter of the given permutation put all the letters
which p»ecede it in the natural arrangement                   and which are not
found to precede it in the given permutation           ;   and make the sum         +
or   -   according as the total number of such letters is even or odd.

The proof that this rule of signs, which is manifestly nothing                             else
than Cramer's,         leads  to the      same results as the previous rule, is
quite easily understood            if  a   particular       permutation be first          con
sidered.     For     example,    let the sign of the particular                permutation
80ay be wanted.             Following      the    first rule, we should require               to
note four different members,            viz.,
   (1) the no. of the column in which 80ay occurs in the 4th group,
   (2)          „                  „                  80a           „           3rd       „
   (3)           „                 „                  80            „           2nd       „

 The first of these numbers being                1,   we should infer that in risk:,
 the sign of 80ay in the fourth group there had been no change                            from
 the sign of 80a in the third group            ;    the second number being also               1,
 we should make a like inference                ; the      third number being 2, we
 should infer that in fixing the sign of                80 in the second group there
 had been      1    change    from the sign of             8  in  the   first group      ; and
  finally, the fourth number being 4, we should infer that in                           fixing
 the sign of       8  in  the first group there had been 3 changes from                     trie
 sign of    a in that group.          The total number of changes from                      the
 sign of a in the first group being thus                3 + 1 + 0 + 0, t'.e., 4, the sign
 would     be made        +.    Now      the 3     in this     aggregate     is simply       the
 number of letters in the first group which precede                    8, the 1     is simply
 the number of letters taken along with                  8  before  0  comes to be       taken
 along with it to form 80 in the second group, and the two zeros
  correspond to the fact that 80a on the third group and 80ay on the
  fourth group have no permutation standing to the left of them.
 Consequently to count the number of changes                     (3+1+0+0)           from    the

sign of a in accordance with the first rule is the same as to count
the number of letters placed under the given permutation, thus,
                                                           8/3oy

   Another point of                 resemblance                between         Rothe and De Prasse           is
thus made manifest,                 viz.      ,   that they both refused to accept Cramer's
rule of signs as fundamental, preferring to base their work                                              on a
rule equally arbitrary, and then to deduce Cramer's from it.
     In    case   it   may have escaped the reader, attention may likewise be
 drawn      to the fact that De Prasse prefixes a sign not only to per
 mutations         involving            all       the    letters      dealt with,       but also to any
 permutation whatever involving a less number                                    ; so   that in reckoning
 the sign of           a8/3, say,       the full number of letters from which a,                         8, (5
 are chosen must be known.
     A    theorem like Hindenburg's is next given, viz.,                                 If the permuta
 tions     of any group                    into sub-groups, (1) those which begin
                                  be separated
 tcith a, (2) those           which begin with     and so on, then the series of

 signs     of    the 3rd, 5th, and other odd sub-groups                           is identical with tlie
 series                       the 1st sub-group,                   and the signs        of   any one   of   the

 even sub-groups                  got     by      changing each sign             of the first    sub-group
 into the opposite sign.                                                                          (in.   16.)
 It   is   more extensive than Hindenburg's                               in that   it    is   true of per
 mutations         which involve less than all the letters, provided such per
 mutations         have had their signs fixed in accordance                             with De Prasse's
 rule.      The proof depends, of course, on the first rule of signs, and
 consists        in showing that              if    the theorem           be true for any group             it
 must,      by the said rule, be true for the                              next group.  It will be
 remembered that Hindenburg                             gave no proof.
      Following        this   is    Eothe's theorem                   regarding the interchange of
 two elements of          a   permutation, or rather an extension of the theorem
 to signed         permutations involving                      less than the whole number of
 letters.        The proof        is    as lengthy as Bothe's, even more unnecessary

[Réfutation de la Théorie des Fonctions Analytiques de Lagrange.

  In    1810          Wronski     presented          to the Institute of             France      a memoir
on the       so-called          Technie       de VAlgorithmie,               which with          his    nsoal
sanguine enthusiasm he viewed as the essential                                          part of        a ne*
branch of Mathematics.                        It contained       a very general theorem, no*
known as          " Wronski's        theorem,"            for the expansion of functions,—                        a
theorem          requiring for its expression                   the use       of   a notation for       what
Wronski styled combinatory                       sums.          The memoir consisted                   mereij
of a statement            of results,          and probably on this account,                      although
favourably reported on by Lagrange and Lacroix, was not                                            printed.
The subject of              turns up repeatedly in the Bé/utatm

printed two years later; and from the indications there given we
can so far form an idea of the grasp                                which Wronski had                  of   the
theory of the said sums.

 The new          name,      combinatory sum, and the new notation, did not
 originate in ignorance of the work of previous investigators, for
 memoirs        of Vandermonde and Laplace are referred                       to.    The only
 fresh and real point of interest lies in the fact that the first index of
 every pair of indices is not attached to the same letter as the second
 index, but        belongs      to an operational symbol preceding this letter,
 and is used for the purpose of denoting repetition of the operation.
 This and        the allied fact that the elements are not                  all independent
  of each other,          AJX] and     A2XX, for example,         being connected by the
  equation

  indicate that Wronski's combinatory sums form a special class with
  properties      peculiar to themselves.

       It would        seem as      if  the   above-noted        frequent      recurrence    of
   functions of the same kind had led Binet to a special study of them.
   In   the memoir we have now come to, his standpoint towards them
   is changed.          They     are viewed as functions           having     a  history  : for
   information regarding them, the writings of Vandermonde, Laplace,

The new quantities            are, of course, not written by Binet in the form
but the fact that they are resultants of the                             2nd   order      is carefully
noted.    Each of them is shown to be transformable, by a theorem
which    may be viewed as an extension of a result given by Lagrange,
so as to have two of the elements                       resultants of the                3,d order,   and
the others resultants of the               1*' order.         This is        done by taking, for
example, the identities
                     <^\m\          +    y*\zM     +                 -   l**y#li

second by     xk,   subtracting, and writing the result in the form

resultants of the           3rd   order will vanish.                The quantities, therefore,

Very prudently, however, another process is chosen. It is recalled
that the quantities in the third triad of rows are related to those in

    This masterly memoir of           84 pages was read to the            Institute     on
the same day (30th November)                  as Binet's      memoir,   of which we
have    just given      an account.        The coincidence of date has to               be
carefully noted, because the memoirs have in part a common ground,
and because there is a presumption that the authors, knowing this
beforehand, had,         in   a friendly      way,      arranged    for simultaneous
publicity.       Binet's words on the matter are —

       analogues à celles de M. Gauss, à des théorèmes                   d'analyse qui
       devaient avoir rapport aux miens.                   Je  m'en   suis assuré,      en

 This latter must       to a certain extent be taken into account, because

general come to be classified according to the number of values they
are able to assume in certain circumstances.
    At   the outset of it the writings            of Lagrange, Vandermonde,
and Ruffini are referred to; the fact is recalled that the maxi
mum number of values             which a function          can acquire by inter
changes    among    its n variables is        1.2.3....*;          also  that when
the maximum is not obtained, the actual number must be                       a  factor
of the maximum;          and then proof is given of the                very notable
theorem that the number           of   values cannot     be less  than the greatest
prime    contained   in n without        being equal    to 2.    It  is pointed out
likewise    that functions capable           of' having     only   two values       are
known from Vandermonde                to be constructible for any number of
variables.     For   example,       the   number of variables being three,

is an instance of     a function capable         of only two values by permu
tation of the variables     ;  the result indeed of any permutation being
 merely that the one function passes into the other.                    Further, the
whole expression
                a/a2 +   a,2Oi + a,2ag     - (a82Oi  + o22a8 + a^a^
is another example,      the difference       between the two values which           it
can assume being however a difference               of sign merely.       As a  refer
ence to the title of the memoir of November 1812                    will  show,   it is
functions of this latter class which Cauchy there considers.
    At the   commencement         he contrasts      them with functions which
 suffer  no change whatever by permutation of variables,                  that is to
 say, symmetric    functions    :   and,   noting the fact,      afterwards ascer
tained, that the new functions consist of terms alternately + and                   - ,
and that were it not for this alternation of sign they would be

    The question of nomenclature being settled there next arises                      the
question of notation. This also is decided on the ground of                           the
resemblance       of the    functions     to symmetric          functions.      It  being
known      that any symmetric function            is representable         by a typical
term   preceded by a symbol indicating              permutation of the variables,
e.g.
          ^{"h^i)    or S^a^j)       standing for      aj>2 + a2bx
and      S3(aj62)    standing for aj)2 +       a2b3 +          + a26j + a3b2 + axb3    ;
also, that any non-symmetric function may be taken as the typical
term of a symmetric function, the question arises whether the like
 may not be true of alternating functions.                  A lengthy examination
 of the latter point     leads  to the     conclusion that any non-symmetric
 function K cannot        be the originating        or typical term of an alter
 nating function unless it satisfies a certain condition, viz., that it be
 such that any value of it obtained by an even number of transposi
 tions of indices will be different from any other value obtained by
 an odd number of transpositions.              Should, however,          this condition
 be satisfied,  and K„, Kg, Ky,        ....     be   all  the values of the former

    Here the subject of general alternating functions may be left for
 the present.      What remains of      the first part of the memoir, refers to
 special   cases,  which naturally fall to be considered in another chapter
 of our history.        At  the close of the part, Cauchy says (p. 51) —
           " Je   vais maintenant examiner particulièrement une certaine
       espèce de fonctions        symétriques alternées        qui s'offrent      d'elles-
       mêmes dans un grand nombre de recherches analytiques.                        C'est
       au moyen de ces fonctions qu'on exprime les valeurs générales
       des inconnues que renferment plusieurs équations du premier
       degré.      Elles    se   représentent    toutes     les  fois qu'on a des
       équations      à   former, ainsi que     dans      la théorie générale           de
       l'élimination."
  The writings       of Laplace, Vandermonde,             Bézout, and        Gauss are
 referred to, and from the latter the name            " déterminant " is       adopted.
    The second part bears the title —

 In    this definition the rule of signs and                    the rale of term-formation
 are inseparable — a peculiarity already                         observed      in the      case  of

  Conjugate      terms    are     defined       as those      whose      suffixes    (" indices ")
  differ in order,    e.g., aTa      and    a3.2;   and terms which are self-conjugate,
  e.g., a1.1, a2.2, . .    .   are called      principal      terms.       The determinant is
  said to belong to the system, or to be the determinant                          of  the system.
  The parts of the expanded determinant which are connected                                 by the
  signs + and        -   are called symmetric products, and the product

 are conjugate systems.
    In the    course   of  these explanations a modification               of the rule of
 term-formation is incidentally noted, the form taken being specially
applicable when the quantities of the system have been disposed in
a square.       Cauchy's wording of this now familiar rule is (p. 55) —
                   "pour former chacun               des     termes     dont   il s'agit, il
      suffira de multiplier           entre   elles  n quantites difforentes prises
      respectivement         dans      les   differentes colonnes          verticales      du

      horizontals      de ce systeme."
Here we may note in passing that the disposal of the                         " termes " in
a square   might have enabled Cauchy to point out (which he did not
                                                                         " determinant "

   The rule of signs applicable to alternating functions in general
is modified      for the special case of determinants, and takes                         the
following form (p. 56)         :—

Here there are three symmetric systems of quantities

every row, and the           third only       once.           The determinants of these
systems are denoted        by
                                     D. ,   8, ,     M.      ,

 there be substituted for mvv mV2,                  ....            their values         as given by
 the group of equations,         there  will   be obtained a                  function of all the
o's and a's, which      must       be an alternating               function with respect to
 the first indices of the a's and also with respect to the first indices
 of the a's.    Further, since each of the m's is of the first degree                              in
 the a's and of the first degree also                   in     the      a's, each       term of the
 development       of S(±mvlm2.2            ....           ffi„.„)     must evidently          be of

 But   the development by reason of its double alternating character
 cannot contain such a term without containing all the terms of the
  product
             ±S(±a1.Ma2                 a,.w)S( ± «1.(l,a4.„                .   . .  a..„).
  Consequently it must equal one or more products of this kind.                                  But
  again   the indices /t, v, . . .,        »   are either all different or not.                    If
  they be different, we have
         S(±a1.llar,    .  .  .   a,.,)= ±S(±a1.1a8.2                   .   .   .  a...)=±&.;
  and   if any two of them be equal
                              S( ± avlia.2.r    .   .   .    o..,)     =   0.
  The like is true in regard to S ± (Oj.^.nj.,,                   .  .   .   a,.„).      This enables
  us to conclude that the development of M„ is equal to one or more
  products of the form

This,    the   now well-known         multiplication-theorem               of determinants,
Cauchy puts in words           as  follows (p. 82)           : —
           LfOrsqu'un     systeme de quantites est determine symetriqucment
       au moyen de deux autres systemes, le determinant du system*

   It   is quite clear, from what has been said above, that it was dis
covered independently, and about the same time,                               by Binet and
 Cauchy,      and ought to bear            the     names        of both.      Binet has the
further merit of having           reached       a theorem of which Cauchy's is a
special case, and then made an additional                         generalisation in a dif
ferent direction       ;  and Cauchy           has    the advantage           over  Binet   of
having      produced,     along with his special                case,  a satisfactory proof
of it
   From       the  theorem      Cauchy goes on to deduce                     several   results
equally important.          Substituting         for the system           (oj.,) the system

are supposed       to be taken, and arranged                  in    order   on the principle
that any one has precedence                 of any other            if  the product of the

criticism to antiquarian research, to free this braneh            of knowledge

Scotland a school of Archaeology         as thoroughly   in   the lines      of true
science as her school of Geology was held to be.                 This might        be
very fully illustrated      by  a criticism   of his special contributions to
this branch of study,      sueh as the papers on    " Roman Remains found
near the Village of Newstead," or his " Notes on Melrose Abbey,"
or his " Notices of the Ancient         Cattle of Scotland," or his        " Notice
of the Remains of the Reindeer found in Scotland."                        The last
named is a peculiarly able and exhaustive paper.                 It   is crowded

    In January     1883,  Dr Smith    began to suffer from the growth           of *
tumour in the upper jaw, which in         a few weeks assumed a malignant
form.     But, both in the intense pain of the early stages of the
disease, and    in  the rapid waste -of the affected parts   in   the later ones,
it was great satisfaction to his friends to see how calmly and bravely
the Christian hope, which         had long heen his, enabled him to bear
his sore affliction.      He died on the evening of the 17th of August
1883.
           Sir John M'Neill.            By Professor Duns, D.T3.

John M'NeiM, Esq. of Colonsay           and Gronsay, was horn at Oronsaj
 House, Argyllshire, August 12, 1795.         He studied at    the Universities
«f St Andrews and Edinburgh.              Having   graduated    in medicine in
 1815, he proceeded to India as        am army surgeon.      Pour      years later
he was attached        to the   H.E.T.C's mission to      Persia, — first in        a
medical and       afterwards in    a •diplomatic  capacity.      His linguistic
attainments,       apt   business   habits,   natural   shrewdness,         literary
acquirements, and "wide knewledge             ©f Eastern affairs led to his
appointment as assistant         Eiwoyat Teheran in      1831.       In    1834 he
became     secretary   of the Embassy, and in 1836         he was appointed

after he became Ambassador an anonymous work on the influence
of Kus8ia in the East was published, and generally ascribed to Sir
John.      The work attracted           a good     deal of attention in England            at
the time.          After his return        home,      he    was   appointed       in    1845
chairman of the new Board of Supervision for Relief of the Poor in
Scotland, an office which he held                  till   1868.    While head of          the
Board of Supervision           he made an extended tour               of investigation,
by desire of Government, through the Western Highlands,                                during
the period of the famine.                 The Report which resulted from this
tour was published in 1861.                  Characterised by much ability and
great good sense, the Report is            full of    interest, both for the informa
tion it contains and for the remedial measures recommended in                              it,
the chief      of which, emigration,         has recently been much canvassed

  During the Crimean War, Sir John                    was requested by the        Minister
of War, Lord Panmure, to proceed                   along with Colonel Tulloch to
the    Crimea, and make            careful inquiry into the disasters              of    that
campaign       in connection with the defective                    commissariat.          On
presenting the       joint Report in         1855,    Sir John     received the thanks
of Parliament         and the distinction            of G.C.B.       He     was   sworn     a
member      of the Privy Council             in    1857.     Though the accuracy of
some parts         of this Report was called in question by the military
commission at home on the same subject, its value was generally
admitted.          Sir John   was   a   D.C.L. of the University of Oxford,               and
LL.D. of Edinburgh.                He   was for some years one of the curators
of the University of Edinburgh,               and at the time of his death was
honorary       president      of    the    Edinburgh        Literary Institute.            He
became     a   Fellow of this Society in          1840, and was     a   member of many
other learned societies, both British and foreign.
      His latter   years were spent partly at his residence,              Burnhead, near
Edinburgh,         and partly at his villa, Poralto, Cannes, where he died
on    May   17, 1883.
      Sir John     was, by one of his marriages,           brother-in-law of Professor
 John Wilson (Christopher North), and by his                       marriage   in 1870      he
became brother-in-law of the present Duke of                      Argyll.

 Morrison Watson,             M.D.,  FRCP,        FR.SS. Edin. and Lond.
                      By Professor Alfred H. Young.
    Among     the Josses sustained by the Royal       Society during the past
year, that    occasioned    by the sudden     death of   Dr Morrison Watson
was perhaps the saddest.
    In the prime of life, and      apparently in good health,      Dr Watson,
when seized with the illness which soon afterwards proved fatal,
was engaged in the active duties of the chair of Anatomy in the
Owens College at Manchester, to which he had been elected — as
the first     occupant   — eleven   years   previously.    Prior   to this, Dr
 Watson     resided   in  Edinburgh,     where   he received  — at the Queen
 Street Institution — his early education, and where later           he studied
 medicine in the University,       and in course of time took the degree
 of Doctor of Medicine.         For   some years    he worked    in  the anato
 mical    rooms    of the University as demonstrator with Professor
 Goodsir,    and thereafter with       Professor Turner,     by the    latter of
 whom he was appointed to the office of principal             demonstrator of
 anatomy.       It  was  during this period that Dr Watson became              a
 Fellow of the Royal Society, whilst             more   recently he was also
 elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of London.
    By his friends, and      he had  many, he was regarded with feelings
 of the highest    respect  and esteem, and the news of his sudden and
 early death gave rise to widespread expressions          of deep and sympa
 thetic regret.      To those who knew him best he was            a  genial and
 affectionate friend, and it was only those perhaps who could fully
 realise his sturdy independence of character,            his straightforward
 nature, and the strength and depth of his friendship.
    The loss which the Medical School of Manchester and the Owens
 College    sustains by Professor Watson's death is great.              He  was
 appointed to the newly instituted chair of Anatomy, at the period
 when the amalgamation         of the previously separate institutions, the
 Medical     School    and the Owens College,        was effected,   and he at
 once    devoted himself      with   energy    and vigour to the work         of
 creating a School     of Anatomy in Manchester.          Under his direction
 the   resources    for teaching were greatly developed        and materially
 augmented,      and the now fairly complete        collection in the Anato

                                          132
mical Museum of the Owens College was formed under his direct
supervision.      As    a   lecturer,   Dr Watson        was     lucid    and   always
practical.    Alike by his own work, and by              the generous       encourage
ment    he readily gave         to others,  he    fostered    a spirit    for original
investigation in     the Anatomical        School of the Owens College with
such success, that     it now     occupies  a  prominent position amongst the
English    schools   as one of       the few in which, not only is human
anatomy efficiently taught, but in which good work                   is also done in
the wider field of animal morphology.                 It is   to be hoped that in
this respect    the   influence of      Dr Watson's work will continue               to
exercise its power for good over the future of the anatomical depart
ment of the Medical School at Manchester.
   Of Dr Watson's own additions to scientific anatomy, undoubtedly
the  most    complete     is the able and comprehensive contribution                 to
the reports of      H.M.S. "Challenger" (vol. viL, Zoology)—                 "On   the
Anatomy      of  the   Spheniscidse."       An important memoir,             "On   the
Anatomy      of the Northern         Beluga     (Delphinapterus        Leucas) com
pared with that of other Whales," of which he was joint author,
appeared    in the Transactions          of  the   Royal    Society   of Edinburgh
                   A more recent paper        by Dr Watson,        " On the Female
(voL xxix.).
Organs and Placentation of the Raccoon," was communicated to the
Royal    Society of London           (1881).      The results of many of his
investigations     were     communicated to the Zoological Society of
London, — notably       a series of interesting papers,

      Eev. Francis Bedford, M.A.               By Henry Barnes, M.D.
     The Rev. Francis Bedford, M.A., who died on the 20th of last
September, was one of the oldest and most notable clergymen in the
diocese of Carlisle.        He  was born at   York in   1813, and at an early
period    showed      remarkable intelligence and aptitude for scientific
work.      He received his early education in the public schools of the
city in which        he was    born, and afterwards,    with the intention of
 adopting the medical profession,        he entered   King's College, London,
 as a medical student.          After obtaining    some considerable    amount
 of medical training, which         was very useful     to him in after life,
 circumstances arose which made it desirable            that he should adopt
 another career, and in 1837            he   was   sent  out by   the   Church
 Missionary     Society to    Trinidad    as  a catechist.   He   remained   in
 that country for four years, doing much good work, but owing to
 failure in health he was compelled to return to this country in
 1841.
    He then     set    about studying for the ministry        of the English
 Church, and     I  am informed he was ordained deacon           on  June   11,
 1843, by Charles James Blomfield,            Bishop of London.       He held
curacies both      in Herefordshire     and   Nottinghamshire, but    a love of
missionary work and travel induced him to again try the climate of
the West Indies, and in 1844 he went out to Jamaica.                 A break
down in his health compelled him to return in 1847.               Three years
later, in 1850, he was appointed to the          living of St Paul's, Silloth,
 and here he continued to reside         during the remainder of his life.
 Here it was that he made those observations               on meteorology   by
 which he will chiefly be remembered             At  the time of his appoint
 ment, the now popular watering-place of Silloth was a desert of
 sandhills  ; there was     not a single house there, and the part which he
 took  in developing     the place and promoting its prosperity is generally
 recognised.      In    the  place  of a sandy desert, there       is now an

                                         134
important seaport, with its docks, pier, regular railway and steam
boat    communication,        and   abundant accommodation              for visitors.
By his    meteorological     observations,    which were regularly published
in the Reports of the Registrar-General and in the Transactions of
the English and Scottish Meteorological Societies, of both of which
he was a Fellow,         he   demonstrated       the    remarkable     fact,   that  as
regards the amount of ozone, signifying an absence of impurity,                    and
in the amount of sunshine, Silloth                occupied     a very conspicuous
position.     This demonstration, proved by the careful record of many
years'   observations, has given Silloth a character which has undoubt
edly contributed to its popularity          as a    health resort.       He   was   the
honorary secretary        of the Cumberland           and "Westmoreland           Con
 valescent   Institution,    from its foundation in 1862 to within a few
 weeks of his death, and          by his energy and painstaking efforts in
 this capacity, he contributed materially to the success and prosperity
 of this valuable institution.          His knowledge of botany              was con
 siderable,  and    he   was   an   intimate     friend of the       late    Professor
 Balfour.    In  the use of the microscope           and telescope he was often
 engaged,    and    for   many years      he    was     a   Fellow    of the Royal
 Astronomical     Society.      The degree of        MA       was conferred upon
 him in 1860 by the Archbishop of Canterbury, and he was elected
 a  Fellow of this Society in 1865.
     Although he was in the daily habit of making scientific                  observa
 tions,  I cannot find    that he ever contributed any paper to our               Pro
 ceedings.     This is much       to be regretted,        as he   had   undoubtedly
 accumulated     much valuable material, and the record of his labours
 in the department of meteorology            fill many      volumes.     These    have
 now come into my possession, and            as   I do   not think    a more fitting
 home could be found for them than the Royal Society of Edinburgh,
  I have much pleasure in handing them over for permanent                    preserva
 tion.    In doing    so  it may be of service       if  I give  a short account of
  the contents.
     No. 1.  A  large volume of meteorological            observations,   taken daily
  at 9 a.m. and    9  p.m.   from March 1854 to December                186S, giving
  the rainfall, wind, thermometer,         hygrometer,       and   barometer.       The
  ozone observations     commence      in April     1868.     There is an interval
  of a few years, and tho observations           begin    again   in January     1874,
  and continue to December 1875.

                                            135
      iVb. 2.     A volume containing observations of          a  similar kind, taken
twice       daily from January 1876 to January 1877.
      No.    3. Twelve volumes containing detailed observations                for the
following years, viz., 1871, 1872, 1873, 1876, 1877, 1878, 1879,
 1880, 1881, 1882, 1883, and 1884. The sunshine observations
commence in 1881.
      No.    4-  A volume containing full observations from October               1876
 to    March 1877.
      No.    5.  A volume containing daily          notes     on   thermometry      and
 rainfall for        1869   and   1870, and monthly averages            for 1872    and
  1873.
      No.    6.   A volume giving     a comparative      statement of the rainfall,
  and    readings     of barometer     and thermometer          taken at Lewisham,
  Kent    ;   Highfield    House, Notts    ;  and St Paul's Parsonage,        Cumber
  land, from March 1854 to February 1855.
      Together with these volumes there is another MSS. volume illus
  trative of the meteorological         history of this district, which       I  desire
  to present       to the   Society at the same time.             It  is a volume of
  observations from January 1838 to May 1842, taken at Carlisle by
  the   late "William       Elliot, M.D. Edin., and         was    found among       Mr
  lledford's papers.
      Before     a Society like this, it would be out of place to refer to the
  manner in which he discharged             his parochial and ministerial duties.
  Suffice it to say that he had many attached               friends, that he found
  his chief relaxation in scientific studies, and that in           a widely scattered
  agricultural      community      he could not      find    much companionship.
  The development of Silloth did much to give him, in this latter
  matter,     much of what he formerly missed, and few of the scientific
  visitors left without visiting his observatory.
      His health of         late  years   had not been         robust,    but latterly
  symptoms of malignant disease of the abdomen set in.                        His last
  illness, which was of a painful              character,   was     borne  with   great
  fortitude.       No   one knew better       than himself there was only one
  possible      termination, but amid his sufferings             he   found relief by
  turning to his scientific pursuits, and by the reflection that during
  the course of a long and active life he had accumulated                 observations
  that would be of        value to his fellow-men.

      General A. C. Robertson.             By T. Stevenson, P.H.S.A.
    General A. C. Robertson, the eldest son of Lieutenant David
Robertson, of Royal Marines, was born at Edinburgh,                February      8,
1816, and was educated at the           High School and University         there.
I   knew him from boyhood          as a born soldier, always ready to fight
his battles with other boys under every circumstance of disadvantage,
and when he found a difficulty in getting his commission he at once
joined other volunteers from this country who took part in fighting
against Dom Miguel in Portugal in 1834.                Serving under Sir de
Lucy Evans,        he saw much heavy service     with  the  British Auxiliary
Legion in the north of Spain.             He   was present     at the relief    of
 St Sebastian and         at the other battles    which    followed in quick
succession during the years 1836 and 1837.             At Ametza Robertson
was severely wounded by a rock splinter from a round shot.                    He
received      for his services in Spain two medals and the cross of the
 first class of San Fernando.         Robertson had risen to be captain in
the Legion when, owing to some difference with his commanding-
 officer, he threw up his commission and enlisted in another regiment,
 and rose again to be captain — a promotion which took place before
 he was one-and-twenty.          In  1837 he obtained    a commission    in   the
 34th Regiment, serving with it for three years in Canada, having
 got his company       in  1845.
     In 1842-43 he had studied at the Senior Department, Sandhurst
 — the germ of the present Staff College, — and obtained superior
 certificates    in  mathematics   and surveying.     In April     1846  he ex
 changed into the 8th (the King's),        with which he continued for        the
 remaining twenty-nine years of his regimental service.             A few    days
 after the arrival of his regiment at Delhi, Robertson joined it            there
 along with Colonel Baird Smith of the Engineers, and served in               the
 siege   till   September    11, when the breakdown of his health com
 pelled his being sent to the hilla          Colonel Greathead says in        his
              "
 diary : — Robertson        was under fire from seven in the morning until
 six in the evening;" and again, regarding the mutiny,              "The   work
  was very well done, and the          King's  behaved   very steadily    under
 Captain Robertson, who is one of the bravest and coolest men             under
 fire that can be seen."         For his services during the mutiny he       was

                                            137
 mentioned        in   despatches,      received      the   hrevets of major        and
 lieut. -colonel, a medal and two clasps;             and after obtaining his lieu
 tenant-colonelcy in 1865, he commanded                   the  2nd battalion of the
 King's — a post which          he retained      for nine years at Malta and in
 various home quarters.           In  1876 he was nominated to the command
 of  the 13th and 14th Brigade Depots,               retiring finally in 1878.      He
 was gazetted C.B. on 2nd June 1877, and 24th March                          1880 was
appointed       honorary colonel of the            15th Lancashire Rifle Volun
teers.
    After his retirement          he lived chiefly in Edinburgh,           and   subse
quently died at Liverpool, on 2nd December 1884, of a disease of
 an incurable and most painful nature, borne with singular patience
and cheerfulness.         Robertson was         a man     of much thoughtfulness,
as well as a zealous        soldier, and wrote with great independence               on
 the following subjects       : — Infantry    ;   the tactics of the three arms        ;
 on the first three parts of the field exercises and evolutions of the
 army, and on some of the resemblances                    and   differences   between
 them and the corresponding part of the French ordnance, &c.                      ;  on
¦the   means of applying         the principle      of stimulating the voluntary
exertions of individuals to the improvement of the system of military
training;      and     a variety     of   other     subjects    connected    with   his
profession.       Besides   which, he devoted           his leisure for some years
to  a verse    translation of "Jerusalem Delivered."                In later  years he
re-edited    the Historical Record of the           King's Regiment.        Robertson
was therefore      a man whom we may well be proud to reckon among
our Fellows.
    Augustus John Darling Cameron.                           By T. Stevenson,
                                        P.R.S.A.
    Augustus     John Darling        Cameron,     the only son of the late       John
Cameron of Edinburgh, was born in October 1841, and was educated
at the   High School       and University        there.    In   1860    he began an
apprenticeship       as a civil  engineer with the late         Mr John Paterson.
He was subsequently in the employment of Messrs Foreman and
M'CalL Glasgow, and Messrs Wylie & Peddie, and was                        engaged on
railway and other works.            He held an appointment of            engineer   in

                                    138
the India Office    for several years, after which he was engineer           to
the South London Tramways Company, and under                 his superintend
ence the various Hues of that company were constructed.               He   died
ou 27th November 1854.         He  was elected a member        of the Institu
tion of Civil Engineers in 1880, and       a Fellow of this Society on 6th
June    1881.
             John M'Nair.        By T. Stevenson, P.RS.A.
    John M'Nair    was for nearly twenty years       a Fellow of the Royal
 Society of Edinburgh.     He took   a  lively interest in physical subjects,
but owing to his advanced       age, and the latterly feeble state      of his
health, was prevented from attending our meetings very regularly.
 He was     born at Belvidere, near Glasgow, in 1801, and died at
Edinburgh in his eighty-fifth year.
       Wiluam Lindsay Alexander.                 By Professor Flint
    William Lindsay Alexander was born at Leith on 24th August
 1808.     He was educated at the High School of his native town and
 in the Universities    of Edinburgh and St Andrews.               He distin
 guished himself in all his classes, but especially in those of Latin,
 Greek, Logic, and Moral Philosophy.            While at St Andrews his
 earlier religious impressions were        much deepened      by intercourse
 with   a pious fellow-student, and through the inspiring influence of
 Dr Chalmers.      Although   he began     preaching when still a student
 of Arts, it was not until 1832, five years after he had left college,
 that he made choice of the Christian           ministry as his profession.
 Teaching, literature, law, medicine, all presented       themselves  to him
 with competing claims.      During    the greater    portion of this period
 of indecision and unscttlement he was occupied as classical tutor
 in   the Congregational   Academy at Blackburn.            Passing through
 Liverpool in    1832, he was persuaded       to occupy for a Sunday the
 pulpit of Newington Street Independent Chapel, then vacant.              The
 result was that he remained in charge of the congregation              for  a

                                        139
year and a half, putting           his qualifications    for the ministry        to a
thorough test, and gradually coming to feel that he had found his
true vocation.         He afterwards went          to Germany, and studied
theology for a short time in Halle and Loipsic.
    On 5th February         1835    he was ordained       to the ministry,         and
became the pastor of the congregation meeting                  in what     was then
called " North College Street Chapel," Edinburgh.                    The connection
then formed lasted somewhat over forty-two years.                     Mr Alexander
at once gained, and to the last retained, great                     popularity   as a
 preacher.     In stimulating and guiding        the Christian        energies of his
 congregation      he   was   also    eminently   successful.          Gradually    he
 attained in his own denomination an influence with which that of
 no one else in Scotland could be compared, while his services to the
 common Christian        cause, his genuine catholicity of spirit, and his
 candour and courtesy even as a controversialist, made                     his name
 honoured in all denominations.            His scholarship, literary talents,
 and theological acquirements became attested                 by writings       which
 spread his reputation       far beyond the limits of Britain.              Notwith
 standing a certain shyness and reserve of manner, his amiability and
 affectionateness    of nature attracted to him numerous warmly attached
 friends.     Among      the   events    and dates     of his       life during     his
 ministry    in Edinburgh,       these may     be specified,    — his     marriage   in
  August 1837     ; his delivery of the Congregational Lecture at London
 in 1840; his editorship of         the Congregational Magazine from 1836
 to 1840   ;  his receiving of the degree of Doctor of Divinity from the
  University of St Andrews in 1845 ; his candidature for the chair of
  Moral Philosophy in the University of Edinburgh in 1852; his
  appointment to the Professorship of Theology in the Congregational
  College in 1854; his removal with his people from Argyle Square
  to Queen Street Hall in 1855, and thence               to the      new church (St
  Augustine     Church) on George the Fourth Bridge                    in  1861 ; his
  election as examiner in philosophy at St Andrews                     University in
  1861 ; his   visit  to Palestine in 1869     ; his selection       as a member of
  the Old Testament Revision            Company in 1870         ;   his appointment
  by the Council of Edinburgh University assessor to the University
  Court in 1871, and reappointment in 1875           ; and
                                                             "  the greatest sorrow

edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica three elaborate treatises —
Moral Philosophy (vol. xv., 1858), Holy Scriptures (vol. six., 1859),
and Theology (vol. xxi., 1860).   From 1861 to 1869 he superin
tended the publication of the                   third edition of Kitto's Cyclopaedia
of Biblical Literature,                  and supplied a very large number of the
articles which appeared                  in it. He was also the author of at least
forty sermons,           lectures,        or pamphlets,        published separately,          and     a
frequent contributor to Reviews and Magazines.
  Dr Alexander               resigned his ministerial charge on 6th                  June        1877,
and was in the same year appointed Principal of the Theological
Hall, while retaining his professorship.                         From a sense of growing
infirmity, these latter offices also he resigned in 1881.                            In 1884        he
received the degree of               LL.D. from         the   University of Edinburgh,              on
the occasion of its Tercentenary.                       Amidst deep and wide regret, on
the    20th December                of that year, he died at Pinkieburn, leaving
behind him many a good work to perpetuate                            and endear his memory,
and the example of an unsullied and beneficent^ faithful,                               and con
sistent life.
   Dr Alexander              was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society on 29th
April       1867, one of the vice-presidents on 24th November                                 1873,
and was re-elected              a vice-president on 22nd November 1880.                            He
wrote a number of obituary                           notices of eminent members,                  and
delivered the Opening Address of the Session 1876-77.
      Having indicated the chief facts of his life, let us now glance                               at
the chief aspects            of his      character.
      It   was impossible to             think of him         otherwise    than as a remark
ably accomplished              scholar.         He    was throughout his life an earnest
student.         No     one knew better that knowledge is not the supreme
object of human life, yet no one could realise                             more      how precious
and pleasant            it    is,   and how closely connected                 with what     is   best.
Hence       a   large portion of his daily life was given to its acquisition,
and not selfishly, but in the belief that through self-improvement                                  he
would the more profit others.                         He had     a     keen    interest in        most

                                       141
kinds of     science   and learning;       had cultivated with special care
various    departments      of theology and philosophy         ;  was intimately
conversant with Biblical studies         ;  was widely read      in classical and
modern literature      ;  and was an excellent Latinist, Hellenist, and
Hebraist.      His mastery     over the classical tongues as poetical media
is amply    attested by the collection of Greek and          Latin  verses which
he printed privately and dedicated to his brethren of the Hellenic
Society.      His attainments     as a Hebraist he had many opportunities
of applying.      He delighted in       good   English     poetry,   and was the
author    of    a  considerable     number    of very meritorious         English
hymns.
    The   amount of literary work which             Dr Alexander performed
must be regarded         as marvellous, when     it  is considered     with what
diligence and success he discharged the many duties of his ministry
and professorship.         Yet none of his writings         bear the     marks of
hasty and inadequate preparation.             The briefest articles from his
pen in Kitto are carefully executed.           That he achieved       so much as
an author was doubtless due largely to strength and readiness                    of
memory,     clearness    and vigour of thought, and facility of accurate
and appropriate expression,         but   it was due as largely to his self-
denying and methodical employment of his time.                   In this    respect
few can ever have surpassed           him.    At  the commencement           of his
ministry he formed the resolution never to have what people called
"a   spare   hour," but to lay out his work every day so as to know
each hour exactly what to do ; and to this resolution he steadily
adhered    to the close of his life.
    Erom the time that he listened to Chalmers in St Andrews, philo
sophy, and especially moral philosophy, had strong attractions for him.
How high       was   his estimate     of philosophy     and his ideal of the
philosopher      may be best learned from his eloquent and elaborate
address to the Philosophical        Society of the University of Edinburgh
on his election as president       in  1875.    The most adequate         measure
of his philosophical ability is, however,              the   treatise   on Moral
Philosophy in the Encijclopcedia Britannica.             It presents    ns with    a
clearly defined,     well-arranged, skilfully rounded system            of ethical
science.     If  not exhibiting     much originality,    it displays     extensive
learning and careful and independent reflection.             It fully  entitles its
author to an honourable place among Scottish moral philosophers.

                                        142
     Dr Alexander     devoted,   of course, far more of his timo and energy
 to theology than to philosophy.            And it may safely          he  said that
 among his contemporaries         in Scotland there      was no more generally
 accomplished a theologian, although he was douhtless surpassed                       by
 several of them in particular qualities.         He attained       a  high  reach of
 excellence   alike in exegetical, historical, apologetic,         systematic, and
 practical theology.      In all   these departments he produced excellent
 works.     On any special theological problem he could at once bring
 to hear ample       knowledge and a rich combination of strong and
 disciplined     mental   powers.      It  cannot,   indeed,     be said      that in
theology, any more         than in philosophy,        he   opened       up or even
 followed    out    new paths of research.         His mind rapidly          reached
 maturity, and the religious opinions which               he formed        in youth
 remained    almost   unmodified to the close of his          lifa       Within     the
 limits   of so-called    orthodoxy,     however, his intellect          acted    with
 admirable     freedom and effectiveness.           He held          firmly    to   the
 Calvinistic    system   of doctrine and to the Congregational scheme
 of Church       government, hut        with   conspicuous independence of
 judgment.        On various theological and ecclesiastical             questions he
 differed decidedly even from those with whom he was in the main
most in agreement.          This    appears very clearly     in his Memoirs           of
Dr Wardlaw,        in which criticism      mingles so largely with            admira
tion.
    Dr Alexander took        a somewhat      prominent part in most of the
religious controversies of his time.           On the platform and through
the press he felt called to set forth his views on Episcopacy, Anglo-
Catholicism,      Romanism, Church        Establishments, and the like            ;  he
was drawn into the Voluntary, Spiritual           Independence, Morrisonian,
and some minor conflicts.            It will   be admitted      by all, however,
that while      he always fought       with vigour,    he also      always fought
without     bitterness or unfairness, and obviously from no love of
strife itself or desire for personal or party victory, but from a                sense
of what he felt due to truth and the public good.                 As    was to have
been expected      in the case of one whose mind was so           justly    balanced
and so catholic in its sympathies, the more experience                  he acquired
of religious controversy the more disappointed he became with its
results,  and in his later life he kept aloof from it.
    As  a pulpit orator ho was of remarkable merit.             Never aiming         at

                                      143
popularity, making it    a rule not to prepare so-called "great sermons,"
constantly dealing largely in the exposition of Scripture and the
setting forth of doctrine, habitually keeping feeling under restraint,
and very sparing of gesture and action, he was yet not only a most
instructive, but   a   most interesting    and impressive preacher.         His
tall  stature  and noble presence,      his admirable delivery, his style
refined yet strong, somewhat      elaborate   but also singularly lucid, the
amount of knowledge which he communicated, and of light which
he cast on Scripture, his intellectual force, his vivid and deep realisa
tion of spiritual things, and       the judiciousness    and pointedness of
his practical applications of truth, combined to make him a great
and beneficent power in the pulpit.
    As   a man   his character    commanded       universal   respect.    None
doubted his piety and benevolence          any more than his learning or
ability.    He gained many friends, and alienated            none.     He   was
especially at home in scholarly and intellectual          society, and where
at home he was a charming companion, unaffected             and genial, with
a keen sense of humour          and hearty love of mirth, and with an
inexhaustible    store  of anecdotes, which       he delighted    to tell, and
which he told exceedingly well.
    His private and    domestic   life has been gracefully delineated        by
Miss E. T. M'Laren, in       reminiscences    originally printed for private
circulation, but now incorporated in the Life of           Dr Alexander by
 the  Kev. Mr Boss.      Mr Eoss himself,        as   an old 6tudent     of Dr
 Alexander, has given us an account of his character and work                as
a professor,  from which it is apparent        that he was nowhere more
 admirable and successful     than in his class-room.
    The memory      of Dr William       Lindsay     Alexander    will  be long
 affectionately cherished and highly honoured.
      William Chambers, LL.D.              By David Patrick, M.A.
    William Chambers,      one of the founders of the publishing firm
 of William and Robert Chambers, and in his later years distinguished
for his public spirit as a citizen, was born at Peebles on the 16th
 April  1800, his father being a cotton manufacturer there.           William,

                                         144
 the   eldest   son, received    a fair elementary education         at Peebles    ;
 but  as,  owing to the father's misfortune, his school days terminated
 with his thirteenth      year, his    education for life-work       was mainly
 due    to the    habit, very early acquired and long             maintained, of
miscellaneous      and extensive reading.         The household migrated to
 Edinburgh      in 1813,   and    next year William was apprenticed to            a
 bookseller.      Immediately      after his five years' apprenticeship        was
 out, he began business in        a  very humble way for himself, and soon
 added    to bookselling      the occupation of    a  jobbing-printer.     He by-
 and-by ventured to print and publish small pamphlets written                    or
 compiled by himself or his younger brother Robert, also established
as a bookseller     in Edinburgh.         Through    much industry, care, and
economy      they each prospered,        and by 1825 what they called their
 "dark     ages"    had closed      for ever.    In   1825   William produced
 The Book     of  Scotland, and had a share with his brother in compil
 ing a gazetteer; but         it was the     Chambers's    Edinburgh     Journal,
projected and started by William in 1832, that brought great and
permanent success to both brothers.              From the beginning, Robert
was the most important contributor to the Journal ; and a month
or two after it was fairly afloat, the two brothers united their
resources     and enterprise under the          now so well known         firm of
W. & R. Chambers.            Other important publications of the firm were
the Information       for   the People     (1833);   the  Educational     Course,
comprising an extensive series of text-books in history, science, and
literature  ; the  Miscellany    ; the  Encyclopaedia (10 vola, 1859-1868);
the   Cyclopoxlia     of  Literature, and numerous works by Robert
Chambers.        In  1859    the elder brother presented        his native town
with a public library,         reading room,     and    museum.     In  1865 he
was    chosen    Lord Provost of       the   city of Edinburgh, and in this
capacity carried out a very important measure for the improvement
of  the city, by substituting healthy houses and airy streets           for  lanes
and closes of pestiferous hovels.            He  was the chief promoter       of a
partial restoration of the ancient        Kirk of St Giles;     and in 1878-83
he carried out a more complete          and extensive restoration at his own
expense.      He found time       to write an admirable county history of
Peeblesshire (1864),       a  short history of France, sketches of tours in
Holland, America, Italy, and France, various other short works, and
a memoir (with autobiographical reminiscences)            of his brother Robert,

                                            145
who was     a member     of this Society from 1840       till his death  1871, and
is known     as  the author of numerous works, including the Traditions
of Edinburgh, the History of          the Rebellion, the Ancient Sea Margins,
and the (anonymously            published)     Vestiges  of Creation.      "William
became a fellow of the Royal            Society of Edinburgh in 1860          ;  and
he was made        LL.D. by Edinburgh University in               1872.     For his
services to the cause of public instruction, and his work as a civic
ruler,  an offer     of knighthood,        which     he declined,   was   made     in
1881.     But when,        a  fortnight    before   his death, a baronetcy was
offered   him, he accepted        it.   It  had not, however, been formally
conferred or gazetted, when on the 20th May 1883 he died, at the
advanced age of more than 83 years, and but a few days before the
ceremony that marked the completion of the last work of his life,
the reopening of the restored            church of St Giles.       He was buried
in the    place of his birth, and many manifestations wore                 made of
esteem and gratitude for his services             to English-speaking     men and
women, by providing            works of instruction      and   entertainment ac
cessible at small cost to         all of whatever rank        or condition.      His
life of unremitting         labour and his remarkable           business abilities
brought to him wealth, honour, and influence, and these were by
him faithfully turned to account for the general good.
                               David Stevenson.
    David Stevenson, the third son of the late Mr Robert Stevenson,
the well-known       civil   engineer,   was born at    Edinburgh on the 11th
January     1815.      Educated at the High School and University of
Edinburgh,      he elected from the first to       follow his father's  profession.
Before entering on his apprenticeship he was for some time in the
workshops of one of the best millwrights                 of the day,     where    he
acquired manipulative skill and the proper methods of working in
different materials,     —a    course   he always advocated        for those who
intended     to    follow the profession          of civil engineering.       After
serving a regular pupilage under his father, during which period he
had ample opportunities of attending various engineering works                    in
progress,    he was     for   some time engaged         with Mr Mackenzie on

                                        146
 railway works, particularly the Edgehill Tunnel               and the Liverpool
 and Manchester Railway.           He  gave a description     of the "   Liverpool
 and Manchester Railway " to the Royal Scottish Society of Arts
in February 1835, and was awarded their medal for his exposition.
 This  paper   was   followed,     in March     1836,   by "Remarks          on   the
Dublin    and    Kingston       Railway."     In   1835     Brunei     asked      Mr
Stevenson to join his staff at the Thames Tunnel                works,  — an    offer
which he could not accept,        as he  had been appointed to superintend
the construction of other works.
    During  the summer of the year 1837,          Mr Stevenson made           a tour
in Canada and     the   United    States, and the result of his inspection
of the engineering works of these countries was given               in  a volume,
published in 1838,       entitled " Sketch of      the   Civil Engineering of
North America," which           was   republished with additions in 1859,
as   one of Weale's     series   of engineering works.          The engineering
practice therein described was peculiarly            applicable to newly          de
veloped countries, where timber forms the chief material employed.
The views expressed        and the drawings given in this book, with
reference   to the fine lines and speed of American              river   and   lake
steamers, were received       in this country by shipbuilders with distrust,
if not ridicule; but     the   bluff bows of British      sea-going     and river
steamers, and short-stroke engines,        all below deck,     gave way to finer
lines and engines     of high power and long stroke          ;  and soon     there
after steamships    were plying on the Clyde at higher 6peed than in
America.     He  had models made in        New York of two of the           fastest
steamers, —a    sea and      river boat, — which      were   submitted      to the
Admiralty    after his book was published;          but as the      "lines"     had
been there    given, the authorities did not care for the models,               and
they ultimately went to the Russian Government                  In this book     Mr
Stevenson also pointed out the true conditions under which                   waves
are formed, which his subsequent experience as a marine engineer
amply corroborated.
   Mr Stevenson       entered     into   partnership   with his       father    and
brother Alan in 1838.          As his father   was   then nearly 07 years          of
age,  and his brother was wholly engaged with the arduous works                    at
Skerryvore Lighthouse, the entire management               of the business       fell
upon Mr Stevenson,       and very soon his advice was much sought                  in
reference  to the improvement of rivers and harbours, and the                  cou

                                          147
8 traction of docks and other marine works.                 There     are,   indeed,
 very few rivers and harbours in Scotland with which he was not
in  some way professionally connected.             He  was also called upon to
 report or to execute       works for the improvement of the rivers Dee,
 Lune,   Ribble,     and Wear        in England;     the Erne and Foyle            in
 Ireland  ; and the Forth, Tay, Ness, Nith, and Clyde in Scotland.
 He designed and       executed     the works of restoration and enlargement
 of the Fossdyke in Lincolnshire,          — the oldest artificial navigation in
 Britain, — the widening and deepening being accomplished without
stopping the traffic.        His advice was also taken on many important
questions relating to salmon fishings in rivers and estuaries, and in
 his Report of August          1842 on the Dornoch       Fishings,     he defined
the different compartments of rivers, according to                their    physical
 characteristics, as    "  sea  proper," " tidal," and " river proper."         The
 views   expressed      in this report were subsequently treated at
greater
                      "
         length in Remarks on the Improvement of Tidal Rivers,"
 communicated to this Society on 17th March                 1845,   which paper
was afterwards published in a separate form by Mr Weale.                     In this
paper he stated his views with regard to the special                works which
 should   be undertaken         for the improvement of the different com
partments, and he showed conclusively that,               if tidal propagation
were    accelerated,     difference     of level  or height    of head      will  be
lessened    and the velocity          of the tide currents      decreased ;      and
 the notion that, by deepening a river and removing obstructions,
 the water in    it may    be caused     to rise higher and    to endanger       pro
 perty on its banks, was without foundation.                All   his subsequent
experience    went to prove that the views expressed            more than forty
years ago were sound.           He   was also the first to enunciate       the true
theory of the origin of bars at the mouths of rivers, and to point out
the works necessary          for removing them and preventing their re
formation.      The necessity of having accurate         data   before designing
 works for the improvement of rivers, estuaries, and harbours led to
his writing a treatise on the         " Application of Marine Surveying and
Hydrometry        to the Practice of       Civil Engineering."        His known
standing as    a  marine engineer led his old friend, the late          Mr Adam
                                                                               " for
Black, to invite him to write the article " Inland Navigation
the last edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica.               This article was
                                                                     " Canal and
republished in 1858 as a separate treatise, entitled

                                           148
River Engineering,"           and it is now in its third edition.               In this
book he has given the results of his practice                 in   the treatment of
rivers, and it will long remain the standard work in this difficult
branch of engineering.             In  1877, at the request of the authorities,
he   delivered       a  course     of   four   lectures on     "Canal       and   River
                 "
Engineering         to the students of the School of             Military Engineer
ing, Chatham.
    During    the    height of the railway mania, when speculators were
overwhelming the Admiralty and Woods and Forests with schemes
too numerous        to be dealt      with by    the officials,   Mr Stevenson       was
appointed       to   hold Courts of         Inquiry, under       the    "Preliminary
Inquiries    Act," into       the    merits of a large number of railway and
harbour projects and water-supply schemes, and in all cases save
one his views were given effect to by the Authorities and Committees
of Parliament.          This exception was         the proposed       crossing of the
Clyde by the Caledonian Railway.                  He  reported     that the railway
might    be allowed to cross the Clyde above Stockwell Bridge, but
the Admiralty          refused    their sanction.      A  crossing,     however, was
subsequently applied for, and has been made.
    In  1853    Mr Stevenson        succeeded    his brother Alan as engineer to
the Northern Lighthouse Board, and, along with his brother Thomas,
who was at a subsequent           date conjoined with him       in  the engineership,
he designed      and executed no fewer than twenty-eight beacons                    and
thirty lighthouses,        three   of which — on North Unst, Dhu Heartach,
and the Chickens          Rocks    — were works of      great difficulty, requiring
the    exercise    of great engineering skilL            The    advice of the firm
was also taken by the Governments                 of India, Newfoundland,          New
Zealand, and Japan on lighthouse matters,                   and schemes         for the
lighting of the whole coasts of the two last countries were matured,
and are now being carried            out.    In connection with        the  lighting of
the coasts of Japan, where earthquakes are of frequent occurrence,
Mr Stevenson devised                the   aseismatic   arrangement,        to mitigate
the effect of shocks on the somewhat                  delicate apparatus       used in
lighthouses, and was awarded the Makdougall-Brisbane                          Medal of
the Royal Scottish Society of             Arts for his invention.           Mr Steven
son    took    a   great    interest    in the introduction      of paraffin as an
illuminant for lighthouses, instead of the more expensive colza oil.
After experiments conducted at Edinburgh with the Doty burners,

                                      149
and actual trial during    a  month at Girdleness Lighthouse, a report
was made to the Northern        Lighthouse Board, embodying the follow
ing results: — That  paraffin, as now manufactured,          with   a high specific
gravity and flashing point, is safe     ;  that the flame is of great purity
and intensity,   and easily maintained       ; the    lamp glasses      and lamps
used for colza   are equally suitable for paraffin ; and that the            initial
power of the lights     on the Scottish       coasts would       be exalted,    and
this, too, at an annual saving of £3500.                The relative merits of
colza   oil and paraffin      were  thus settled, and most British and
many     European,   foreign, and colonial lighthouses now                consume
paraffin, with an increased luminous intensity, and decreased cost
of maintenance.
    Mr Stevenson frequently        appeared     before      Parliamentary     Com
mittees,   and also   gave    evidence    before     Special Committees         and
Royal Commissions on Harbours, River Improvements, Harbours of
 Refuge and Lighthouses.        For these Committees and Commissions
he always prepared     with scrupulous      care   ;  and he was a most con
scientious witness, never entering the box without being satisfied
as to the soundness    of the cause he was supporting            ;  and in no   case
did   a Committee ever       throw out    a   Bill,   the   Parliamentary     plans
and estimates    of which he had prepared.               In  his native city     Mr
Stevenson was greatly respected, and his advice on many important
matters connected     with city improvements            was sought and highly
 valued.   His views on      the city improvement scheme, as conveyed
to Lord Provost      Chambers and the late             Mr David Cousin, city
architect, along with his letters which appeared in the Scotsman                  at
the   time, greatly facilitated the    initiation of this      great sanitary im
provement, now nearing its completion.               Among other local works,
his firm designed     and carried out the Edinburgh                and Leith and
 North Leith    sewerage    schemes,    and the widening            of the North
 Bridge.
    Mr Stevenson     was    consulting     engineer       to the Convention       of
 Royal Burghs of Scotland and to the Highland and Agricultural
Society.     In  the  affairs   of the latter     he took a lively         interest,
especially in the trials of improved agricultural implements; and he
contributed several papers and reports to their Transactions, notably
 one on the reclamation of land, and one on the relative merits of
 different systems of steam ploughing.         The paper on " Reclamation

                                       150
and Protection of Agricultural Land " was republished as a separate
treatise  in 1874.
   Mr Stevenson's books        have taken a permanent place       in engineer
ing literature.      Amid    the exacting calls of his profession     he found
time to write many papers         on engineering and cognate       subjects, in
addition    to   the  books already      noticed.    He also wrote      several
articles for the last and the present editions of the Eneyeloptcdia
Britannica, among which          may   be noticed
                                                    " Canal," " Cofferdam,''
" Diving," and " Dredging."          He   was also the author of    Our Light
houses,   being two articles written for his old friend, Dr Norman
Macleod, while editor of Good          Words, subsequently republished by
Messrs Black, and of the Life          of Robert    Stevenson,  published     in
1878.
   Mr Stevenson      was twice elected     President of the Royal Scottish
Society of Arts, and for his Presidential Address of 1869 he chose
as his subject    " Altered Relations of British and Foreign Industries
and    Manufactures," in which        he   strongly urged   the propriety of
artisans improving       their manipulative     skill and their knowledge
and management         of the materials with which       they had to deal, if
they did not wish to be distanced in the race by foreign competition.
He   was elected a    Fellow of this Society in     1844, and subsequently
acted as a member of      Council and one of its Vice-Presidents. In addi
              "                                                       "
tion to  the    Remarks on the Improvement of Tidal Rivers already
noticed, and several       obituary notices of professional      brethren,   he
contributed to our Proceedings " Notices of the Works             designed   by
Sir C. A. Hartley for       the Improvement of the Danube,"
                                                                      " Notices
of the Ravages of the Limnoria Terebrans on Creosoted Timber,               and
on Greenheart Timber."          " Notice of Two Earthquakes on the        West
Coast of Scotland," and " Notice of Striated Rock Surfaces            on North
Berwick     Law."     He    was elected   a Member of the      Institution    of
Civil Engineers in 1844, and acted as a member of its Council from
1877 till 1883, when he retired on account of ill-health; he was
also a member of the Societe des Ingenieurs Civils, Paris, and                of
other learned Societies.
   Mr Stevenson took        a warm    interest in the better endowment        of
the Chairs of the     University of Edinburgh,       and was mainly instru
mental in founding         the Glover Divinity      Fellowship.      He  was a
great lover    of art in all its branches, and had formed        a   somewhat

                                        151
 valuable collection of etchings         and  engravings,   begun when a boy
 at the High School, his school companion in print-hunting being                    a
life-long friend, Sir Theodore Martin.             He   was   a man     of sound
judgment, unswerving rectitude, utterly devoid of ostentation,
 kind, open, and easily accessible.           He was practically laid aside
 from work for about two         years, and he died at      North Berwick,       on
 the 17th July    1886, in the seventy-second        year of his age.
                Bishop     Cotterill.        By Dr Cazenove.
    Henry Cotterill    was born     in   the year   1812, on the 6th day of
 January, a day ecclesiastically known as the Feast of the Epiphany,
and in popular parlance as Twelfth Night. He was the son of the
 Rev.   Joseph    Cotterill,   rector    of  Blakeney,    in    the   county     of
 Norfolk.     Mr Cotterill had     been   educated    at Cambridge, and had
taken a high       degree, coming       out   as   Seventh    Wrangler.        The
grandfather of the future Bishop had also been            a  Cantabrigian, and
was known in Sheffield as a man of culture.              He  was the author of
a book of family prayers.          All  three were successively      members     of
the same College.      All   three could say,    with  the poet    Wordsworth,
                  " Tho Evangelist St John my patron was,"
and all could, with him, avow a fondness for mathematical as well
as for classical studies.
   In  classics  Henry    Cotterill   found a preceptress       in his   mother.
This lady, known      before her marriage as Miss       Anne Boak,     was very
clever and clear-headed.        She was a great friend of the celebrated
Hannah     More,    and   to   some    extent assisted     that   lady   in    the
preparation of a tale, which was widely read at the time                   of   its
publication, Calebs in Search        of a    Wife.    Miss Boak contributed
some chapters     which contained descriptions of scenery.              She had
also   a  considerable     acquaintance      with    mathematics,      and     was
generally  a learned   woman.
   Not only did   she superintend the education of her three daughters,
but she instructed her two sons, Henry and George                   Cotterill,  in
Latin, until they were fifteen years of       age.
   Here, it will be said, is a clear case of heredity.           I am  far from

                                         152
wishing to dispute the point           ;  but we must not,        I think, neglect
another element of the case.             A     distinguished scholar and mathe
matician, who had been well acquainted                   with  a school which was
attended    by boys from homes of very varied station and character,
told me that, as       a  rule, the difference         was immense     between    the
progress    of the pupils who went back daily, or at set periods, to
homes where they heard           nothing connected         with their studies, and
those who, when not at school,              lived in the houses of relatives or
of friends, which        were    the abodes          of educated   people.    Extra
ordinary genius will no doubt triumph                  over these and many other
obstacles.      But to the youthful student the lack of sympathy
at home     is a formidable disadvantage. Oliver Wendell Holmes
implies,   I think,    that it has been found so in the United States
of America, as well as in Europe.                   And the inquirers      into the
influence of heredity ought, it seems to me, to take some pains in
examining into this phase of the question, and ask whether this
and that man of mark did or did not in youth enjoy the benefit
of an atmosphere of culture.
    Whatever be the decision, it is at least clear that Henry Cotterill
was   in this    respect   exceptionally favoured.           He   began   to receive
lessons   in Latin when         he was five years         old; and   at the age     of
fifteen he and his brother George                 were,  as a favour, accepted      as
private pupils at Cambridge, by Mr Scholefield, subsequently so
celebrated     as the Regius       Professor of Greek in the University of
Cambridge.        From this admirable teacher              Henry    Cotterill learnt
his first lessons in Greek, and to his latest day he always expressed
his deep gratitude to his tutor, and his keen sense of the good
fortune he had enjoyed in having had such a preceptor.                      Hot   was
he less favoured        in mathematics.           A  very eminent mathematician,
William      Hopkins (father of           a    philanthropic    lady, Miss     Ellice
Hopkins, subsequently          a great   friend of the Bishop's), took charge
of his studies in     Mathesin.
    At  a   later date,     a   brilliant Cambridge scholar           described,    in
beautiful    Greek Iambics, how Jupiter, being angry with mortals,
commissioned       Vulcan     to invent a new plague, and how from this
command       came forth      the penal       infliction  of mathematical study.
Such was not, as has already been observed, the sentiment cherished
towards the       science    of   lines and of numbers by this youthful

                                       153
classic.    Contrariwise, his proficiency in this new field of learning
seems to have even surpassed           that which he achieved in ancient
languages.      And during       vacations he was sure of living in an
atmosphere where his studies would receive abundance of encourage
ment and sympathy. His sisters were ladies of cultivated                     taste,
the youngest especially being a good Latin scholar.
     At Cambridge     he found friends among         contemporaries,      and also
 some among seniors, who, in different ways, influenced his career.
 Among      the  seniors,   besides   the   tutors already        named,   he was
 acquainted with Professor Sedgwick,             with Professor Airy (after
 wards the Astronomer Royal), and the aged              Mr Simeon.         Among
 those of his own standing may be named            Mr Dickinson, afterwards
 representative in Parliament for Somersetshire          ;   and a member      of  a
 highly gifted family,    a Merivale, brother of a distinguished Oxonian,
 W. Herman Merivale, and of equally eminent Cantabrigians,                 such as
 the present Dean of Ely.         But specially intimate was he with         a son
 of  the  Right Hon. Henry Goulburn,            sometime      Chancellor of the
 Exchequer.      In  both classics and mathematics         these two, Goulburn
 and Cotterill, were keen, but most friendly rivals.           We    cannot doubt
 but that from     such guides    and friends, and from several more like
 them, Henry Cotterill       must have learned a great deal, though the
 intercourse cannot     possibly have been a merely one-sided             bargain.
 Some of them, as Merivale          and Goulburn, were not permitted to
 display all their powers, having died at        a comparatively early       age.
    In  1832, a year known      in British history   as that of the passing       of
 the Reform Bill, Henry Cotterill was elected a scholar of St John's
 College,  Cambridge.      In  that same year he won the University            Bell
 Scholarship, one of the blue ribands of undergraduate life, as an
 evidence    of proficiency in classics   ;  though its glories are perhaps
 slightly limited by its being confined to the sons of clergymen.
    In   1835 he took his Bachelor's degree, his work at Cambridge
 culminating     in  the   extraordinary     success   of     his   being   Senior
 Wrangler, First Smith's Prizeman, and ninth in the First Class of
 the Classical Tripos, which was headed by the Second Wrangler,                 his
 young friend Henry Goulburn.           This  achievement       probably justifies
 the remark of the late       Principal of the University of Edinburgh,
 Sir Alexander Grant, that Henry Cotterill left Cambridge bearing
 a greater    weight of honours than any other student had gained.

                                       154
Among      the   few rivals    who have      nearly approximated, may be
named     Charles "Webb Le Bas, afterwards Principal                of Hailebury
College,    and the Hon. William Cavendish, now Duke                    of Devon
shire.     Almost as    a  matter of course,    Mr Cotterill      was, soon    after
taking his degree, elected      a  Fellow of St John's.
    The present imperfect sketch is mainly concerned              with the career
of its subject in relation to those gifts which would be felt to con
stitute his claim to become       a Fellow of this Royal Society.            But   it
is impossible to pass by in silence            certain elements        of the case
which exercised       a very real, though     in part     an   indirect, influence
upon his mental development.
    At this juncture     he might have laid out for himself a course              of
life which would necessitate        his remaining a man of study rather
than of action    ;  or he might have chosen a profession,            such as  that
of the bar, in which it would be possible,               while relegating to a
secondary position his Cambridge studies, to make use of the mental
training thus acquired.       His University had abundant             examples   to
encourage     him in either of these directions, — brilliant honour-men
who had become famous as scholars or men of science, and others
who had been conspicuous as barristers and as judges.
    But the    tone   of another profession ruled in the home in which
he   had been brought up, even            more   strongly     than the love of
culture for its own sake, or for the prizes which might thereby be
won.     Entirely by his own     choice,  — though no doubt it was a choice
greatly moulded by the         influences around him, — Henry Cotterill
resolved    to take Holy Orders.         But this    was not all.       His father
had begun      to cherish, in his maturer years, a keen sympathy with
missionary work.         It came seemingly too late          in life for him to
change    his sphere of labour.        But he had expressed          a hope    that
his sons, even      if they did not    feel called to devote        their lives to
direct missionary work, might at least for a time occupy positions
in which they could support and             assist    missionary efforts.      The
father's wish was never forgotten by the son, who always regarded
it  as a grave     mistake to send out to our Colonies only clergy of
powers below the average.
    Henry Cotterill was ordained         deacon    in  1 835,   and priest in the
year   following.      In this latter   year a presentation        to one   of the
East    India Company's chaplaincies          was placed      in  the   gift of the

University of Cambridge. Much to the surprise of many friends
and of still more numerous bystanders, Mr Cotterill accepted the
nomination.        That such a step was not calculated to lead to pre
 ferment    at home      was  obvious enough       ;  but the father entirely
sanctioned the proceeding         ;  and the son never,         I believe,    for   a
moment regretted it.
    The appointment took him to the Madras Presidency.                       Before
leaving England he vacated           his fellowship by marriage with Anna,
daughter     of   John Panther, Esq. of Bellevue, in Jamaica.                    By
this honoured and          much-respected      lady, who lives to mourn his
loss, he became the father of four sons and two daughters,              of whom
all, but   one daughter,    have survived him.
    At   Madras he saw much of missionary work among the heathen,
and     acquired an interest in it which never left him.                 But    the
climate did not suit him, and at the end of eight years' residence
his health   was seriously affected.        In  1847 he returned to England,
and accepted the position of Vice-Principal             of Brighton    College,     a
newly founded institution.           In  1851 he succeeded to the Principal-
ship, rendered       vacant by the death of its previous occupant,               Dr
Maclean.
    Although this College       prospered      greatly under his care, there
were those among his friends who felt that it was not a sphere
that afforded      full scope for his varied powers.            One of these,      a
layman, a member         of a family deeply interested in missions,           walk
ing in London, is said to have noticed an advertising board headed
by    the words       "Wasted    Steam."        The   title   suggested    to  this
gentleman's mind instances          of such loss among men whom he had
known, and      it struck him that Henry Cotterill was at that moment
an   example of such waste.
                                       " By the way," so his thoughts ran
onward, " Archbishop         Sumner told me that the See of Grahams-
town had become vacant by the decease of Bishop Armstrong, and
that a successor       was being sought for it.         Mr Cotterill would       be
the very man        for the place."      Fired by this     idea, he at once' pro
ceeded to Lambeth,         and the result was that on November 23rd,
1856,    Henry Cotterill    was consecrated       and then duly gazetted          as
Lord Bishop of Grahamstown.
   The Bishop of Capetown,          Dr Gray,    seems at first to have feared
that he and his new colleague          might not work harmoniously.             An

                                          156
unlooked-for      event  brought them into thorough concord with each
other.     In   the year    1836,     that is to say the year after that of
Mr Cotterill's Senior Wranglership, the                place   of Second Wrangler
had been won by a member                 of St John's,        who      was   thereupon
elected    Fellow of that College.           His  name was Colenso         ;  and after
having had experience,          both in tuition as a mathematical master
at Harrow, and also         in pastoral work          as a country vicar, he had
been     selected   for  the office       of Bishop       of   Natal.     Dr Colenso
published works certainly of a startling character                 ;  and his former
brother-fellow, the Bishop of Grahamstown,                    in November         1863,
formed part of an Episcopal Court which condemned the teaching
of Bishop Colenso as heretical.               This    sentence was not confirmed
by the State, inasmuch         as the     Privy Council declined          to recognise
the legal    validity of   the    letters-patent granted to Bishop Gray, and
of his claims to act        as  Metropolitan.          The opinion, however, de
livered by Bishop Cotterill was allowed on all sides to be one of
remarkable clearness and ability.
    In    1867   the Archbishop          of Canterbury,        Dr Longley, held         •
gathering at Lambeth of the Bishops of the Anglican Communion                            ;
and a similar one took place              in    1878,    under   the    presidency of
 Archbishop Tait.        On both occasions          Bishop Cotterill       was chosen
 to act,  in company with       an    English    prelate, as a general       secretary   ;
 aud also    as sole secretary     to a committee       appointed to consider the
 constitution of the Colonial daughters of the Anglican                   Church, and
 their   relations   to the     mother        Church      of   England.       In these
 situations he enjoyed an opportunity                of showing to those around
 him his capacity for business, his judicial temper, and his largeness
 of view.      These qualities made         a special    impression upon some          of
 the Bishops who had come from Scotland and from America.
    The     acquaintance      with      his    powers     thus    obtained      greatly
 influenced the clerical and lay electors of the Episcopal Church                      in
 the diocese     of Edinburgh,       when in 1871 they were seeking                for  a
 coadjutor to Bishop Terrot.              Other candidates       withdrew, and on
 April 26th     the Bishop of Grahamstown was elected                  by the vote of
 both the clerical and lay chambers,                nemine   contradicente,      to the
 office of coadjutor Bishop.           Bishop Terrot only survived this event
 by about eleven months          ;  and as   Dr Cotterill    had     been chosen    cum
jure   successionis, he became         full Bishop in April       1872.

                                       157
    "With the details of his rule we are not hero concerned                :  and it
must suffice to say, that he proved himself to be active, energetic,
tolerant, and accessible.     If,   as   seems possible,     these qualities were
more quickly recognised      by the clergy than by the                laity of his
communion, this may have arisen               from the fact that the former,
being brought into more immediate contact, saw most of him, and
that his good gifts were of    a character       that required such intercourse
to bring them out in all their fulness.
    He  was greatly interested    in  the proceedings       of this Koyal Society
of Edinburgh, of which he            was elected      a  Fellow     soon   after his
arrival in Scotland. He was         chosen a member         of the Council, and
subsequently one of the Vice-Presidents.              If   he did not contribute
any papers, such    as the valuable ones supplied             by his predecessor,
Bishop Terrot, it must    be remembered          that the clerical duties of the
occupant of his post had been largely increased.                   Most especially
during eight years (1871-1879) his mind was occupied with the
erection and organisation of the Cathedral, which sprung from the
munificent bequest     of Barbara and Mary Walker.                   In   this com
plicated task he was held to have been eminently successful.                       It
is perhaps   permissible to remark that, in his association                with the
savans of this Society and of the University he expressed                     himself
as greatly gratified    with  the     large    amount of ability among            the
votaries .of   physical science,     which was ranged           upon the side of
belief, in that great contest       with unbelief, which Goethe in well-
known words has declared        to be " the proper, peculiar, and             deepest
theme of universal and human history."
    It remains   to say something concerning             the    indirect   and the
direct influence of his academical         studies upon his professional life.
Indirectly it taught him,       as    it   has    taught so many academical
students, not to be satisfied with mere surface work in any depart
ment of study.       Two illustrations,        out of several      that might be
adduced, will serve to illustrate my meaning.
    At Madras, during    the tenure of his East           Indian chaplaincy,       he
was brought into controversy with some of our Boman                          Catholic
fellow-Christians.     Not content to       take the account of their tenets
 from hearsay     and popular estimate,           he made     a serious    study of
the works    of a famous     champion of Boman                theology,      Cardinal
Bellarmiue; and to the close of his life he was able to cite concessions

                                          158
 or ingenious replies,     which he had met with in the pages of                    that
 eminent controversialist.         He had        been   brought up, and          always
 remained,    a devoted son of the Reformation.             But    he was not averse
 to  the   study of     the schoolmen,       especially Aquinas        ;    and   he re
 cognised,   not wholly without admiration, in the theology which                      he
 so firmly opposed,      a system which,      in his own      words,
                                                                         " touched the
 human mind at a great many points."
    Again, in South Africa he found a system                 of law very different
 from that to which he had been accustomed                   in England.         Dutch
law, like Scottish law, is largely based           upon that of ancient Rome.
Straightway      he became a        student of      Roman      law.      Whether     the
study of that or of any other system will render a mind judicial, if
it is thoroughly imbued with           the advocate-temper,        may be doubted;
but it can hardly be questioned            that where its teaching falls           on a
congenial soil, it has a tendency to strengthen the upgrowth                       of a
judicial harvest by     reason of its general essence of admirable clearness
and common sense.             In  1878   some difficulties       in  the   will of the
Misses "Walker were brought before the First Division of the Court
of Session in Edinburgh.           Bishop Cotterill's interpretation of         certain
clauses had been disputed by some             of   the "Walker Trustees, includ
ing at least one eminent lawyer.            The Court entirely confirmed             the
Bishop's view, and rejected that of his chief opponent.
    As   a scholar and a divine         he was naturally much interested              in
 the Revision of the New Testament                 In  the main he sympathised
with    the Revisers, and      in general preached       from their version.          In
the   field of what may perhaps          be called constructive theology liis
most    important production was probably the volume entitled                       The
 Genesis    of  the   Church, an original         and thoughtful         work, which
 may,    though     in  a   quiet   and comparatively          unnoticed       manner,
 considerably influence the divinity of the future.
    But   as was to be expected      from one who kept up his acquaintance
with physical science, Bishop Cotterill was especially drawn towards
the field of apologetic      theology.     Among contemporary writers none
fixed his attention more than the late Dr Mozley, whom Sir James
Paget — no mean judge — has called
                                               "
                                                  perhaps the most philosophic
divine of our age."        The   Utuseen   Universe at once arrested his notice,
and in 1876 he contributed to the third number of the Church
 Quarterly Review a sympathetic and able criticism of this remark

                                         159
able work.       This  was,  I believe,   his only contribution of any length
to periodical literature.        He was also, however, greatly struck by
Philosophic      Doubts, the work of a gentleman since known as the
Right Hon. A. Q. Balfour,               successively      Secretary of State for
Scotland and for Ireland       ;  all the more so in that he had prepared
for  the  Victoria Institute     a paper based upon a somewhat similar
stratum of thought, entitled           "The Relation         between    Science    and
Religion,    through the principles of        Unity, Order, and Causation."
    This   last-named    paper   was read       in 1880.       But it may       be  re
garded as a continuation of a similar address                  delivered before the
same Institute      in 1878,    "On the true Relation between Scientific
Thought       and Religious Belief;" which was followed by what
many consider his happiest effort              in this direction, namely, the
 small    volume     entitled    Does Science aid Faith i published in
 1882.
    His acquaintance with colonial life not only led to his being on
several occasions      associated with English prelates in the choice of
Anglican bishops for distant           sees,  but also induced him to deliver
addresses bearing on the problems connected                   with modern civilisa
tion.    Among such papers may be named                   "Vital Christianity        as
affected by the present       State of Science         and Civilisation," read at
Leeds during a Church           Congress      held there       in   1873,   and three
lectures given at St Paul's           Church,      in York Place, Edinburgh,
entitled " Progress."        In compositions of this nature               he not un-
frequently      avowed   his obligations       to several      writers    outside the
ordinary range of theological study             ; such    as,  for instance, Fichte
and Mr Herbert        Spencer.
   Very friendly relatious, dating from                the Lambeth        Conference,
existed     between    him    and the Anglican           prelates of the United
States.      He paid a visit to America, which he greatly enjoyed,                  in
1880; and        was subsequently appointed             Bedell     Lecturer.     These
lectures,   however, were read for him in 1884.                   Their subject    was
" Revealed Religion in Relation to           the Moral Being of God."
   There have been men of science who have combined with their
gifts of knowledge that of a remarkable literary style.                      Such   in
France was the famous naturalist Buffon              ; and no one, whether ally
or opponent, would deny this possession to Professor Huxley.                         It
may be doubted whether,          in  the case of Bishop Cotterill,         the gift of

                                       160
 expression    was quite on a par with           the general      level of his very
 high and varied endowments.             It was probably, as a rule, happier
 in friendly conversational discussion than in              set and formal efforts,
 whether spoken or written.          With diffidence it          may be suggested
 that the little volume already named, and the article in the Church
 Quarterly Review, are favourable examples of his style, when at its
 best.
     He  met the     announcement that        a   fatal disease had seized him
 with singular calmness       and    Christian      fortitude.     His illness    was
 cheered   not only by the devoted          assiduity of the partner of his
life, and the other members         of a most united family, but also by              a
sympathy which extended far beyond the limits of his own                        com
 munion.     He left     the Church,    over which he had presided,             very
 grateful to him for his work, which had not only won the affection
and respect of those worshipping           in   the Cathedral and other Epis
copal churches,      but had also tended to draw into closer communion
two congregations        which had previously been disunited.                He  was
probably happier in a disestablished than he would have                      been  in
an Established       Church, inasmuch       as   the conflicts      in England    be
tween Church and State were to him                  a source    of perplexity    and
regret.
     He   used    to   praise  his   contemporary,          Archbishop     Tait (in
company with whom he had been consecrated                      Bishop), for    never
becoming too old to learn.            It   was an      eulogy which       might    be
fairly applied    to himself.    The condition of Scotland was in              many
respects very different from that of South                Africa.     He took  pains
to learn those differences.       From his visit to America, from             events
of the day, from thinkers much younger than himself,                   if they  were
adepts   in any special lines of thought or study, he was most will
ing to learn;* thus showing that he cherished in his inmost heart
a deep    humility,    which chastened what might have been the temp
tation of his great acquirements          and successes.        Most prominently
did this and other graces shine forth during the period of his                 latest
illness in 1885.

      The Rev. David Greig, M.A. of Aberdeen University, now Rector of
Cottenham; and Dr Dowden, who has succeeded him in his Episcopate, mar
without invidiousness bo named as illustrating this remark.           The Bishop was
also very seusible of the value of recent works of learned Presbyterian divines,
such as those of Professors Flint and Milligan.

                     [Note added December 23, 1887.]
    Since the above notice was written, Professor Tait ha3 reminded
me of the name of       Dr Perry, late Bishop of Melbourne,        as that of
a Senior Wrangler,       who, like Bishop Cotterill, had also taken a
high   place  in the Classical Tripos ; and my friend and relative, the
Rev. Dr Luard, Registrary of the University of Cambridge, has,
at my request, furnished me with a list of the most interesting
examples of double honours taken at Cambridge between the years
1753 and 1854.         I pass over those who did not win the highest
place in one of the two departments (though             it contains many
names of students who rose to celebrity or high station in after
life), and confine myself to        a selection from the     list of Senior
Medallists,    Senior Classics, or Senior Wranglers.
    Among      the   Senior   Medallists,   who    were   also    very  high
Wranglers,      may be     named     Craven   (afterwards   Master     of St
John's), 1753; Halifax (Bishop of St Asaph), 1754; Law (Bishop
of Elphin), 1766; Law (Bishop of Bath and Wells), 1781 ; (Arch
deacon) Wrangham,         1790;   Maltby (Bishop of Durham), 1792;
Tindall (Chief Justice), 1799; Grant (Lord Glenelg), 1801 ; Parke
(Lord Wensleydale), 1803; Blomfield (Bishop of London), 1808;
Graham      (Bishop    of Chester),   1816; Hugh James         Rose,   1817;
 Ollivant (Bishop of Llandaff),      1821.
    Among    the   Senior Classics (some being also Senior Medallists)
who were very high Wranglers,           were  (Professor)   Selwyn,    1828;
(Professor) Westcott,      1848;  J.  B. Lightfoot (Bishop     of Durham),
 1851.
    Of   the four    Senior   Wranglers,    who have also       been   Senior
Medallists,    only two became    subsequently eminent — Kaye (Bishop
of Lincoln), 1804, and Aldersou (Baron of the Exchequer), 1809.
    The other Senior Wranglers who have been high in the Classical
Tripos (since its institution in 1825) have been comparatively few;
and Henry Cotterill appears to stand alone in combining with the
 Senior Wranglership,     and a high place in the Classical Tripos, the
position of First Smith's Prizeman.

  William Denny, C.E.              By John Henderson, Jan., F.RS.IL
    William Denny        was   bom in Dumbarton          on 25th May       1847.
 His education was       commenced    in the Academy of his native town.
 Shortly afterwards he was sent to Jersey, more particularly             for   the
 sake of his health, and after a residence        of four years he returned
 to Scotland, and was placed in the        Edinburgh High School,          where
 he remained    until  he was seventeen years of age.
    He had resolved to        become   a  shipbuilder,    and on leaving      the
 High School in     1864 he entered his father's ship-yard       in Dumbarton
as an apprentice,     and passed through the several departments, where
he laid the groundwork of his future         ability as a naval architect.
    In 1868 Mr Denny          became   a  partner in the firm of William
Denny      & Bros., and shortly        after assumed       the   administrative
charge of the extensive business         conducted by the firm.        He    con
tinued to occupy this position until his death on 17th March               1887.
    He early showed       great  promise   of becoming an eminent naval
architect, and introduced a more scientific basis in all the practical
work     of shipbuilding.      He wrote many papers, and took a              pro
minent part in all discussions in connection with his profession.
    Mr Denny     had great force of character,      and  a wonderful     gift    of
inspiring   his staff, and those with whom he came in contact, with
his own enthusiasm and earnest            perseverance     in carrying his     in
vestigations and experiments to a conclusion.
    He was   a fluent speaker,    and his professional and other        papers,
which     he read    from time to time, were         noted   for  the finished
manner in which they were prepared and delivered.
    He took  a prominent part in the introduction of steel for shipbuild
ing, and did much to bring it into the general            use  it now  obtains.
He introduced an admirable system of conference               between his firm
and delegates from all trades represented         in the works, in order        to
adjust and arrange        all questions of    wages,    rules, &c, and     these
conferences    were under his presidency during          the last year of his
life at home.
    Such deep and active interest      as he  had in everything connected
with   the scientific part of his business would have absorbed           all the
energies of most men, but not so with         William Denny.        His  nature
was many-sided, and his sympathies were broad and deep.                 He   was

                                      163
well  read  in many subjects, and proved himself a          capable   lecturer
on  art, politics, and many other subjects, in which         he took a deep
interest.    Possessed   of a warm and affectionate       nature, he   will be
long remembered for the interest he took in every one with whom
he came in contact, and the generous, but wise, assistance he was
ever ready to afford in advancing the well-being of all who had the
good fortune to know him.
    Among the papers which he wrote were           " The Worth of Wages "     ;
 " Dimensions of Sea-going       Ships"; "On the Difficulties of        Speed
 Calculations,"    for  the latter paper he was awarded          the Marine
Engineering     Medal of the Institution of Engineers and Shipbuilders
in Scotland; "The       Speed   and Carrying of Screw Steamers,"         being
 the Watt Lecture        delivered before the Philosophical        Society of
               " On the                             " "
 Greenock ;                 Question of   Success    ;   Christianity in this
 Life " ; of the latter he was only spared to conclude the first part.
    Mr Denny was appointed by the Government a member of the
 Load Line Committee, and he took an active part in all its investi
 gations.    He was    a member of Council     of the Institution of Naval
 Architects,    a member     of the Institution of Engineers       and   Ship
 builders in Scotland, of which he was president at the time of his
 death.    He   was also   member of the Institution of Civil Engineers
 and of the Iron and Steel Institute.          He    was elected a  Fellow of
 this Society on 3rd February       1879.
 Dr      Daniel       Kutherford        Haldane.       — From       materials
            supplied      by    Dr    John    Smith,      LL.D.,    and     Dr
            Heron Watson.
    Dr D. Rutherford         Haldano   was  the son of James       Alexander
 Haldane, who founded the Scottish Congregational body, and has
 sometimes    been called the    Whitefield of Scotland.       He  was of the
 family of the Haldanes of Gleneagles.
    Our   deceased     Fellow   was  educated     at   the High    School    of
 Edinburgh,     and during     the six years   of his attendance     there  his
 usual place in class was about third,      — the dux for the first three
                "
 years being blind Laurie," and when that distinguished pupil left,

                                          161
 the next dux was         one    who afterwards has done              good   work in
 another    profession, the Rev.         John M'Laren, D.D.,             minister    of
 Larhert.
    On leaving the High School, he studied at the University of this
 city until    he   obtained   his    medical degree.        When he graduated
 as Doctor of Medicine, a gold medal was presented                    to him    for his
 thesis on Diseases of the Liver.
    He subsequently went          abroad     for the purpose      of further srudy
at the great medical schools of Vienna and Paris.                      He resided at
 the latter capital for eighteen        months, and whilst        there   acquired a
 remarkable fluency in the French               language,   which he ever after
 wards retained.        On his return to Edinburgh he was appointed
 House Physician       to the   Infirmary, in which capacity he had acted
prior   to  going     abroad,   and not long after this he was elected
Physician     to the    Royal     Public Dispensary and the New Town
Dispensary.        He    subsequently became a Lecturer on Medical
Jurisprudence,       Pathologist    to the     Royal Infirmary, and Teacher
of Pathology and Morbid Anatomy in the Extra-Mural School at
Surgeons' Hall.         On Dr Alexander              Wood retiring from his
Lectureship     at the     College     of Surgeons, Dr         Haldane      began to
lecture on the Practice of Physic in that institution,                   and at the
same time he gave lectures on             Clinical Medicine      at the   Infirmary.
His   classes were     very popular with the students, as he had the
reputation of being one            of the best teachers        in   the  Edinburgh
School of Medicine.         In   1876, about three        hundred of his former
pupils, among       whom were many of our best known practitioners,
presented    him with an address            in which his powers of accurate
diagnosis, the clearness      and grace of his style as a lecturer, and his
vivid powers of description,         were adverted to       in   terms   of grateful
appreciation.
    In   1852    he   was  elected     a   Fellow of the Royal           College     of
 Physicians,    and    he  afterwards        held   successively the       offices   of
Secretary and President of that body.                 Whilst acting     as Secretary
 to the College of Physicians,        he took an important part           in promot
ing the scheme under which the Royal                 Colleges of Physicians and
Surgeons in       Edinburgh,       with     the    Faculty   of    Physicians      and
 Surgeons    of Glasgow, arranged           to   grant  a  conjoint     examination
and diploma to their students,           known as the Double Qualification.

                                          165
 For his    services   in instituting    this diploma, a handsome service of
 silver plate    was presented      to him.      He  was the representative      of
 the   College    of    Physicians     at the    General   Council    of  Medical
Education,      and at the Infirmary           Board.    The General      Council,
Edinburgh University,         elected him their assessor at the        University
 Court.
     He was also for several         years    medical   officer of the Scottish
Equitable Life Assurance Society.               In acknowledging his      services
in this capacity,      the Directors     stated   in their minutes — " that hi?
perfect mastery of his profession, and the sound judgment which
characterised      his   opinions were      so conspicuous, that       the Board
placed the most perfect confidence             in his advice, and      are certain
that   it has been of the utmost value to the Society."
    Dr Haldane chiefly devoted himself to the teaching and con
sulting departments of his profession.               His contributions to the
science of medicine were mainly of the nature of occasional practical
papers,   read before various professional bodies and associations,           and
constituted in not         a few cases interesting additions       to our know
ledge of diseases of the heart, the nervous system,              and alimentary
canal.     For   a number       of years he edited the Edinburgh          Medical
Journal with ability and success.
    His life was destined to be cut short unexpectedly.                   On the
Christmas     day of     1 886,  when leaving his house, his foot slipped,
and in falling he broke the lower part of his                 right leg.    Com
plications, leading to      a complete    collapse of his system,    followed on
this injury, and     he died on the 12th of        April  1886.
    The death of a physician so eminent and so widely known and
appreciated, was the occasion          of much regret both to the profession
and the public       of Edinburgh      ;  and the more so as in private life
he was distinguished by the gentleness            and courtesy of his manners,
his straightforwardness and high sense of honour.               His funeral   was
attended by the Presidents and Fellows               of the Royal Colleges of
Physicians     and Surgeons,      and by a large assemblage of the general
public.     He   was elected a     Fellow of this Society in     1867.

                                        166
                               James     Pringle.
    James Pringle      was born in Edinburgh in 1822.               He was the
son of    Mr Murray Pringle, who for thirty years held the office of
Secretary in the Adjutant-General's Office, and a similar position in
the    Naval and Military Academy, which long existed in the city.
He    received his education at the      High School of Edinburgh,          where
he made great        proficiency in the study of the classics, and stood
third among his fellow-students in the list of honours during                  the
last year of his educational course.
    On leaving the High School          he became a clerk to the Edinburgh
Eoperie Company.           His   business   abilities   and   capacity for hard
work led to his being promoted to the position of cashier in the
 Company's office, and on the occurrence           of a vacancy in the man
agement       the  entire responsibility      of conducting      the Company's
 business was devolved on him.
     About six    years ago, he began to take a prominent part              in  the
 public    business   of Leitb, when he was returned as representative
 of the ratepayers       to the   Leith Dock      Commission.       Entering    the
 Town Council of Leith              in   1881,   he   was   elected   Provost     of
 the burgh in November of that year, and continued to occupy                    the
 position    till the time of his      death.    Like his    predecessor    in  the
 civic chair, he was an ardent supporter of the Leith improvement
 scheme, and he was particularly           active in obtaining a Provisional
 Order for the better preservation of Leith Links.                  He  displayed
 great tact and energy, as well as unfailing courtesy,           in the  discharge
 of his    onerous    duties as chief Magistrate, and he took an active
  interest in all associations      and movements       for the amelioration      of
  the condition of the poor, and the relief of suffering.
      Mr Pringle    also held the honourable office of Deputy-Lieutenant
  of the county.        He found time to take         an intelligent   interest in
  the proceedings      of the Geographical Society, and he was elected              a
  Fellow of this Society on        the  6th of April 1885.        He died    on the
   11th of December         1886.     His funeral, which      was a public     one.
  called forth an expression of general         sympathy and regard, such         as,
   perhaps, had never before         been witnessed    in the town over       which
   he presided.

                                        167
                         Dr Thomas Williamson.
     Dr Williamson     was born at Greenock         in   1815, and claimed to
"be the last surviving      representative of the ancient family of the
JNapiers of Kilmahew.          When quite young,         he was sent to study
medicine at the University of Edinburgh,             where he took his degree
of   M.D.   at the age of twenty,    in the  same year becoming a licentiate
of   the Royal College of Surgeons,          an institution    of which he was
elected a Fellow in 1857.          He   was one    of  the oldest members     of
 the    Medico-Chirurgical      Society,    and of the       Royal   Society  of
 Edinburgh. In early life he held several public offices. He was
 for fully thirty years surgeon in Leith Hospital and during the
 whole of his long residence in Leith took a warm interest in the
 welfare of that institution.       At the time of his        death  he held the
  appointments of parochial medical officer and public vaccinator for
  the parish of South Leith, and medical             officer  of health for the
  entire burgh.    The latter office obliged him to board vessels com
 ing from ports       where    any epidemic was prevalent, and to his
 foresight is due the readiness in which Leith has been held, during
 the late visitations of cholera       on the Continent, to deal with any
  emergency     which   might    arise.   His various public        duties were
  performed with untiring vigilance and care, and he enjoyed the un
  qualified respect of his fellow citizens, among whom his long resi
 dence rendered    his figure one of the most familiar in the community.
 Dr Williamson      was an occasional       contributor    to medical journals
 on   topics chiefly    relating   to sanitation.      He published      various
 pamphlets, and delivered several popular lectures on subjects relat
 ing to public health, and read       a paper  on the subject at one of the
 meetings     of the Social     Science    Congress     at Edinburgh,     which
 was   printed in their reports.        On returning from Colinton, he was
 seized with an attack of apoplexy which terminated fatally on the
 30th of December 1885.         He   was elected a Fellow of this Society on
  7th December 1857.

    The death has just been announced            of Mr John Milroy, Assoc
 Inst. C.E., one of the remaining links between the present and the
 great   days  of railway construction in which the late            Mr Thomas

                                              168
Brassey played a prominent part.                  Mr Milroy died at his           residence,
Torsonce House, Stow, near Edinburgh.                        For   the past two years        lie
had been     in failing health, and           ten days before        his decease he        was
seized    with   a   shock of paralysis, from the effects of which he                     never
recovered.       Mr Milroy        was very early associated             with Mr      Brassey
in railway work,         so far    back, indeed,          as   the year       1840, in      the
construction of the first line between Glasgow and Greenock, now
belonging to the Caledonian Railway Company, and on which                                    he
was   a   sub-contractor.         The most serious portion of that contract
was the cutting         of the well-known            Bishopton       Tunnel, which          was
carried almost entirely           through       a    dense     tough whinstone.             Mr
Milroy subsequently         acted as agent          for   Mr Brassey and for         Messrs.
Brassey     &    Mackenzie in the construction of lines of railway                            of
great extent on the Continent, the first of them being the Paris and
Rouen Railway, with the late Mr Joseph Locke                          as the engineer-in-
chief.     He    was also engaged          in    the same      capacity on the Rouen
and Havre, the Nantes and Caen, and the Caen                              and     Cherbourg
railways.        A   few years later    Mr Milroy likewise           served     Mr   Brassey
as his agent in the construction of well-nigh                       eighty miles of         the
Great Northern          Railway   ;   and there were various               other     railway
undertakings         with which       he      was     connected,      not only       in    this
country, but also          in France and Italy             ;   indeed,    a     considerable
portion of his life was spent on the Continent, where he                             became
exceedingly well known and greatly esteemed on account of his
personal character.         About     a    quarter of      a   century ago, Mr Milroy
settled down in his native country, in order to take charge of                            some
large     work3 in which he was interested, along with the eminent
firm with whom he had been already associated                           for about twenty
years.      The chief of those works was the construction of the City
of Glasgow Union Railway, from the plans of Mr (now Sir) John
Fowler.   It included some difficult pieces of constructional work
to connect the         Glasgow and South- Western Railway on the south
of the Clyde with the North British system                           of railways on         the
north side.          There was also       a     very important        iron girder bridge
across     the    Clyde, together       with        the   Sighthill Railway and              the
Harbour      Railway      running      past     Pollokshields       and   under      a   public
roadway,     a   canal, and two other lines               of railway.     While      engaged
in sinking       the cylinders     for the viaduct over the Clyde,                Mr Milroy

                                    169
 brought    into use a new excavator of his own invention,            which
 subsequently did much excellent service in the construction of
 subaqueous works.       While in and about Glasgow the deceased
 was induced to take two important contracts on his own account,
two    pieces  of work involved in the extension of the harbour of
 Glasgow,     namely,  Plantation   and   Mavisbank       Quays.    In   the
former of these works, the superstructure was built on foundation
piers which were formed of successive rings of brick-work, according
to the plans of    Mr James Deas, engineer to the Clyde Trust.            In
the construction of Mavisbank         Quay, a marked improvement was
made in the character      of the subaqueous    pier foundations, which
were formed of concrete, the piers being most securely bound to
gether.     The Milroy excavator was here used to excellent purpose,
enabling     the piers to sink to depths of 50 ft. to 60 ft. or 70 ft.
In  these   harbour works    Mr Milroy   was closely associated    with Mr
Deas, and he had as his right-hand        man   Mr   George   A. Waghorn,
who also saw much service       under  Mr  Brassoy's   firm. The various
works which he carried out in the Glasgow district, including those
for which      he  was the sole    contractor, cost   nearly 1|    millions
sterling.
   After having retired from active life, Mr Milroy             passed   his
remaining years on the estate of Torsonce, which he acquired in the
year 1879, and on which he occupied his time in making consider
able improvements by building, roadmaking, &c.             At his death   he
was eighty years of age.       He   was of a most retiring     disposition,
and when not occupied in superintending the improvements              on his
estate, devoted the last years of his life to the study of             those
branches of science which were most closely connected             with his
profession.     He  was elected a  Fellow of this Society in   1 875.

                                          170
        General Sir James Edward Alexander,                                 Kt.,
                               C.B.,    K.C.L.S.,     &c.
    General Sir James Edward              Alexander,      of Westerton,          Stirling
shire, who was born in Stirling on the 16th October 1803,                               and
whose decease took place at the Isle of             Wight 2nd April          1 885,     was
a collateral descendant        of the family of the first Baronet, William
Alexander of Menstrie, afterwards Earl of Stirling.*
    After passing through the College of Edinburgh                  and Glasgow,          he
proceeded at an early age to           India   to  join his relative Sir Thomas
Munro, then governor of Madras.                He there devoted himself to the
study of Oriental languages, passed the required examinations, and
was appointed to the Madras              Light Cavalry,       and adjutant         of   the
governor's     body guard.       He   was afterwards transferred           to the 13th
Light Dragoons in January           1825, and volunteering for active service
proceeded to Burmah, was present              in  the field, and took part in the
first Burmah war.
    After   the peace his acquirements            were recognised        by his being
appointed attache to the Persian Mission, under Sir                 John    Macdonald
Kinneir   ;   while acting with the Persian army on the field                     against
the Russians,' he so distinguished himself that he received the Order
of  the Lion     and Sun.
    In  consequence        of his    proficiency in Eastern languages                 and
general     attainments,      he  was     offered,    on   return     to  England,         a
professorship      at   the College of Heylebury,              but, declining         this
employment,        he    instead  joined      the   senior    department         of    the
Military Staff      College,   obtained a first-class       certificate,  and shortly
afterwards was promoted            to a lieutenancy         in the 16th         Lancers.
 He then obtained a year's              leave   of absence,       to enable       him    to
complete      his military studies,      and to join the Royal Engineers                 at
Chatham, under Sir Charles Paisley.
    He next      saw service     with the Russian army of Field-Marshal
Diebitch,     then engaged in operations            against    the Turks.         At   the
conclusion of this service, and while on his return to England,                           a
slightly    untoward       incident    occurred     to   him.       Proceeding       in a
Russian      frigate   by way of Sebastopol,             he was      there    placed     in
quarantine, in consequence            of some cases of the plague                 having
          *
              Ho was buried in the old Logic kirkyard, near Menstrie.

                                        171
appeared on board.         The port chanced       to be visited at the time
by H.M.S.        " Blonde," commanded by           ^Captain,    afterwards     Sir
Edmund and Lord Lyons (commander-in-chief of the fleet during
the Crimean war), then cruising in the Black Sea. Captain Lyons
alone was      allowed to land at the quarantine            station, when       he
naturally communicated with his fellow-countryman.                       On the
                     "
departure of the Blonde," Sir James Alexander wa3 immediately
arrested    by   the Russian      authorities,   on suspicion      of being     an
emissary of the British Government.             He   was arbitrarily     confined
two months in Sebastopol with other prisoners, and finally, in the
depth of winter, sent under guard to St Petersburg, where, after
undergoing      further  confinement      and hard     treatment,     he  was    at
length, by the intervention of the British ambassador,             released, but
without compensation for the unjust           usage he had received      — only   a
slight apology from the Emperor Nicholas in person.
     He returned to England by Sweden and Denmark,                        and in
recognition of the valuable information, plans, and reports he was
enabled     to furnish    with    regard  to   Eussia   and Turkey,       he  was
 promoted to an unattached captaincy.
     Sir James was now      selected   by the Colonial     Office to undertake
 an important commission of inquiry into the state of slavery in
 North and South America, receiving from the Secretary of State
 letters and credentials to the various governors of provinces, &c.
 On the conclusion        of   this  mission    he   was   examined before a
 committee of the House of Lords, by whom his able                    report was
 highly appreciated.
     He shortly afterwards returned to full            pay,  and joined      as   a
 captain the 42nd Highlanders (Black Watch).               While serving with
 this regiment, he was invited by the Royal Geographical Society
 to make explorations in Africa,           and readily accepted        a duty    so
 congenial to his active and enterprising          character  ;  but the British
 expedition then being in the field against Don Miguel, he took the
  opportunity    it afforded him of      seeing   further   active service    and
 acquiring    further   geographical knowledge by joining the expedi
  tionary force.    His  effective service was rewarded by receiving from
  Don Pedro the rank          of lieut -colonel.      He then      proceeded     on
  his mission in H.M.S.        "Thalia"     round the west coast of Africa,
  visiting the different  settlements.

                                         172
    On arrival at the Cape, finding the war with the Caffres already
commenced,       and the time accordingly unfavourable for explorations,
he joined the troops      in  the field under    Sir Benjamin D'Urban, by
whom he was appointed aide-de-camp.               At    the conclusion     of  the
war, Sir James Alexander resumed            his mission of exploration, and
proceeded      into the interior, accompanied          only by seven       men —
encountering successfully the dangers, difficulties, and hardships               to
which at that time travellers in South Africa were subjected.                   In
one    year he accomplished 4000 miles,            and completed       a  full re
port of the countries of the great Namaquas, Boshmans, and                    Hill
Damaras.
     On returning to England, Sir James E. Alexander                received the
honour of knighthood           for his services    in Africa,   being the     first
knight      created   by the Queen in person after Her Majesty's
accession.      His African duties had obliged him to go temporarily
on half pay; but he returned shortly to full pay as             a  captain in the
 14th Regiment, then serving in North America.                    There he     w
asked     to undertake and accepted         the arduous     duty of exploring
and surveying in the construction of a military              road    through the
 forests   of New Brunswick         and Canada from Quebec to Halifax,
 acting as assistant       royal   engineer on this most trying service
 during 1844-45.         He   received   no promotion or reward, beyond           a
 slight addition to pay while so engaged,             for this arduous     servicv
 which he had been invited to undertake.
     On Sir Benjamin        D'Urban being appointed         commander       of the
  forces   in  Canada,    he immediately      reappointed Sir James as bis
  aide-de-camp,      a post he    retained until Sir Benjamin's          death   in
 Montreal.       Sir William Eowen       succeeding   to the command,      he was
 again offered the aide-de-carupship,        and served on the staff of that
 distinguished officer      for  5|  years.    He rejoined his regiment          a?
 major on the breaking out of the Crimean war, shortly became
 lieut. -colonel,   and succeeded      to its command      during the siege      of
  Sebastopol,    at the fall of which stronghold he was present.
     During this time of scarcity and hardship, his regiment was
 notorious for the beneficial arrangements          for their supply and com
  fort that his previous experience        on active service had enabled him
  to make for the comfort and welfare of his men.
     Sir James Alexander        was next appointed to the command             of   a

                                            173
depot battalion, but was shortly selected to raise the 2nd battalion
of his old regiment, the 14th        ;    this he so quickly did, and so rapidly
brought them into an effective state, that his battalion was the first
of the new 2nd battalions that            proceeded on service       in the field ; this
was to Xew Zealand, to engage in the Maori war.                        Here he com
manded for some time in the province of Taranaki, and under Sir
Duncan Cameron the important outposts at Waikato.
   He was then promoted to major-general in 1868, lieut. -general in
1877, and general      in   1881.        He received during his         service   seven
war medals, but the reception only of the C.B. (3rd Class of the
Order of the Bath) will be considered but an inadequate acknow
ledgment of long and arduous service.
   Sir James Alexander         was the author of various works of travel
and of a biographical and military character,                such as his   Life of the
Duke of Wellington, Canada as it         &c, Passages
                                                  is,                  in the Life of
a Soldier, and others relating to the various countries with which he
was personally acquainted,          as   well   as the contributor       of numerous
articles in periodicals on the military, scientific, and social topics of
 the day.
    The deep interest he took in all questions relating to the interests
 and improvements of the army, especially as regarded                        its equip
 ments, and his untiring exertions in promoting these objects to the
 utmost of his power, are well known.    He was among the foremost
 and most strenuous supporters of those who called public attention
 to the long-neglected justice of granting medals for the Peninsular
 services   of   the army, hitherto         unrecognised by distinctive           decora
 tions. This movement was eventually carried to successful result,
                                                                 a
 through the influence and advocacy of the Duke of Eichmond in
 the House of Lords, and with the military authorities, was much
 indebted to the indefatigable exertions of Sir James Alexander.
    Mainly   also to his exertions may be         truly attributed the ultimate
 erection of the Egyptian           obelisk (called Cleopatra's Needle) in its
 present site on the Thames Embankment.                      This obelisk,    presented
 by Egypt to England in recognition of the services of the British
 army in Egypt under Abercrombie, owing to untoward circumstances
 which prevented its shipment to England, for which arrangements
 had been made at the expense of the army, was allowed from that
 up to the present          to lie neglected            on the shore    of Alexandria

                                        174
harbour, at the point intended as that of embarkation;                 and   the
English Government having refused to incur the expense of its
removal, it would finally have been broken up in 1874, had not Sir
James Alexander, who had long endeavoured to call public attention
to the matter,       personally interfered, and undertaken at his own
expense     a voyage    to Alexandria,   and, with the aid of the British
sonsul-general, succeeded       in rescuing it from destruction.         On his
return he renewed his exertions,          so many years      unsuccessful, and
obtained      the   munificent    pecuniary     assistance   of   Sir Erasmus
Wilson, by which after great difficulties the obelisk was transported
to England       and erected   in its present site. The country must be
considered     indebted to Sir James Alexander's persevering energy
for its possession    of this most valuable and interesting antiquity.
    It  would be difficult    to enumerate       the various other works of
public and private character,         whether in England         or abroad, in
which he was constantly engaged, and bore a leading and prominent
part   ; these  will long  be gratefully romembered        by those who bene
fited by his exertions.
    Of him may truly       be said,   that in all countries whatever good
work he found at his hand to do that he did with heart and soul                 ;
and in him those who had the privilege of his acquaintance recog
nised that highest        type of     character,   the   single-hearted,  high-
minded Christian gentleman,         whose   life  was devoted to   duty and   to
the promotion of the interest and welfare of his fellow countrymen,
and the communities among whom his lot might be more imme
diately cast.
                   Alexander James Russell, C.S.
    Mr Alexander James Russell, Clerk              to Her Majesty's Signet,
Edinburgh, who died recently          — 8th January 1887 — at the age of
seventy-two, was head of the firm known                formerly as Russell &
Nicolson, C.S., and latterly as Russell it Dun lop, and the business
which ho carried on was one of the oldest in Edinburgh,                  dating
back to the end of the seventeenth           century, and having descended
in the direct line from father      to son.
    His   father,  Mr John Russell,     was principal Clerk of Session, and

                                      175
Secretary of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, and his              great-great
grandfather was solicitor for the sale of the forfeited           estates   in
Scotland     after the    Rebellion  of   1715,  and one of the original
shareholders of the Bank of Scotland.            On his mother's side,     Mr
Russell    was closely related to the ancient Scottish family of Murray

   Methods.   — The    great difficulties heretofore     encountered     in investi
gating the course of nerve fibres in the brain have been, firstly, the
want of     a method of preparation by which their gross anatomy
could be thoroughly           exposed,     and,   secondly, the failure of any
previously known process of staining to satisfactorily indicate their
direction on microscopic examination.               In endeavouring to collect
reliable data from the records              of lesions of the human brain,         it
becomes only       too   evident      that   until  more   efficient methods      of
localising lesions      be adopted      than those generally in use at the
present day,   little  can possibly be added to the knowledge we already
possess.
   The methods of preparation            I  dow employ for demonstrating the
connections    of the brain are chiefly the gelatine-potash               process   I
formerly    described     in   the   Journal     of Anatomy and Physiology
(vol.  xix., 1885, p. 385), along with a modification of Weigert's
hamatoxylene      - copper      stain   for   medullated    nerve    fibres   lately
published by me in the same periodical (vol. xxi., 1887, p. 444).

                                                                        2 &

The       former       method is suited solely for naked eye observation.
The main           objection        to     Weigert's stain              is,   as   mentioned         by    its
author, that       it   cannot be adapted to cutting the tissue                          in the    freezing
microtome.            The modification above referred to has been introduced
with      the view         of     overcoming this.               The reaction of the nerve-
medulla       is   quite as intense             if    not more so than that obtainable
by the original procedure.
     Could one unite the aniline-black stain of Sankey and Lewis for
nerve cells with this modification of Weigert's stain for nerve fibres,
little would remain                 to    be desired        for microscopic demonstration.
The difficulty, however,                  is   that the aniline-black               dye   will give its
proper reaction only when the brain                          is   perfectly fresh, whereas the
haematoxylene              will    act upon the nerve-medulla only when                            it     has
been hardened           in   a    chrome salt.        I     have, however,          already managed
to    partially        combine       the two, and               see    no insuperable barrier to
complete         success.
     The Callosal Fibrins. — It is,              I     think, almost universally believed
at the present             day that the corpus callosum
                                                                              is
                                                                              a    commissure       ;   that
anatomically          it   unites equivalent areas in the two cerebral hemi
spheres,      and that physiologically                     it    serves       to bring      these       into
functional harmony.                  Some years ago, when working at the pathol
ogy of the brain,          I      came upon certain appearances                     which tended           to
shake      my belief in the commissural theory, and which led to an
inquiry,      part of the results of which                        is   embodied          in this paper.
The appearances                 alluded to are to be seen in the brain of any
mammal           when      it     has been hardened               in Midler's fluid, but                best
in    those      in which          the     organ      is    of large          size, as    in Man.         It
was       in Man that       I      first noticed the appearance, but                     I   have since
then found            that   it     exists in all the mammalian brains                           I      have
examined.             The Midler's fluid, in the case of                        a   large   brain such
as that of Man,                 must be injected from the main vessels at the
base      in order     to insure that          it   will   penetrate deeply and             in   sufficient
quantity.
     If   such    a   brain, when completely hardened,                         be simply cut into         a
series of perpendicular                  transverse        segments, each of about half an
inch in thickness, the following can be readily seen with the naked
eye or     with    a   simple lens        :—

mass   offibres    (see    PL  XIV.   fig. 1), which leaving this body and con
tinuous     with it turns upwards, outwards,               and   downwards in the
centrum       ovale.       The arcuate     mass    varies somewhat      in   shape   at
different parts of the brain.           Thus, anteriorly    it represents an almost
complete semicircle,         while posteriorly    it becomes more pointed.         The
fibres entering into the             composition of the arched          mass     subse
quently pass into the inner and outer capsules.                    The greater hulk
of  them, however,          enters  the inner capsule,     and in its anterior limb
the capsule is almost entirely composed of them                  ; while a consider
able portion also seems to run into the outer capsule, constituting
the inner of the two layers               of which it consists.       Their further
course    and attachments          to underlying      parts will be subsequently
considered.
   In  a former paper (Journal of Anatomy and Physiology, voL xix.,
 1885, p. 385)          I  have named this mass of fibres the "crossed
                   "
callosal tract       ;  and   as all my work     since   then has tended to fully
bear out the view           I at that time entertained         of its significance,   I
propose     still to   adhere to this nomenclature.
   In   order to get at once to the gist of the arguments                    I  intend
using to explain the nature of this crossed callosal tract,                    I  shall
start with the postulate that it is mainly composed of callosal fibres
which have arisen from the cortex, which have crossed in the corpus
callosum, and which, instead of turning upwards to become attached
to   points in the opposite cortex corresponding with those from
which they sprang, are now turning downwards into the two capsules
to become subsequently united to the basal or other ganglia presently
to be enumerated.
   If  it   be true that the crossed          callosal  tract represents the fibres
derived from the opposite             cortex, which have passed over in the
corpus callosum, and which are now turning                       down to the two
capsules, the following data ought to admit of verification                : —
      1.   The crossed callosal tract ought to be capable of being dis
              sected out ;
      2.   It  ought to be co-extensive        with   the corpus callosum ; and
      3.   It  should be possible to trace the fibres microscopically as
              they turn downwards.
I shall   consider each of these in order.

    1.   Foville long     ago (" Traite complet     de 1'Anatomie,   de la Phyrio-
logie, et de la Pathologie du Systeme Nerveux Cerebro-spLnal,"               Atlas)
showed that an arched          ridge of fibres could be exposed by simple
dissection turning downwards at each side of the corpus callosum,
and     figured appearances         which,    allowing    for a certain     amoent
of artistic        embellishment,     substantially    represent   what    actually
 exists.      (The author here exhibited a brain, previously hardened
 in Miiller's fluid, in which this dissection had been made, and in
 which      the arcuate     mass of fibres was       distinctly  displayed.       He
further showed this arcuate mass in horizontal sections prepared by
 his gelatine-potash       method,  in which it    was quite clearly mapped     out
 Its  fibres had a more or less transverse           direction, so that they con
 trasted with those        coming from the cortex, and the outer border of
 the mass where they turn downwards was quite sharply differentiated.
 The fact that the arcuate mass is seen on horizontal section com
 pletely does away with the notion that Foville's                  dissection was
 artificial.      In a series of horizontal sections       the crest of the ridge
 was found to correspond          in position with that in the dissection,       the
 site of   it being   at a point considerably below the level of the cortex
 at the vertex.)
     2. That the crossed callosal tract is co-extensive           with the corpus
 callosum      can be proved by dissecting       it out, or by examining it in      a
 horizontal gelatine-potash        preparation.
     3.  To trace microscopically the fibres curving downwards from
 the corpus callosum is not such an easy matter             as might be supposed,
 owing in great part to the fibres running in different planes            between
 their points of origin and insertion.
     Meynert has alleged         that he could trace single fibres from         the
 cortex of one side through the corpus callosum into the oortex                   of
 the opposite.        For my own part      I  can hardly credit this statement,
 for, after having spent an immense deal of labour upon the                subject,
 and working with methods far more refined than those employed                   by
 Meynert,      it  has never been my good        fortune to follow a single    axis
 cylinder      from the one side        to   the   other even in the      smallest
 mammals.          The fibres diverge and run so obliquely after crossing
 that   I question     if a section made     in any   one plane would suffice to
 expose their entire course.
    If  the brain be cut perpendicularly          in an  oblique aniero-posterior

direction,      however,           the bundles of callosal nerve fibres can be traced
from       about the middle line continuously down to the outer and inner
cupmdes, instead of upwards to the cortex                           as     generally asserted.
In     PI. XV.        fig.    2    I   have   given an accurate drawing of a section
of     the human brain ( x 10 diams.), stained and prepared by my
modification   of Weigert's method, and taken from a region corre
sponding         to     the        front of the basal       ganglia.       The     parts of the
preparation           included in the drawing are the tectorial part of the
corpus callosum               (ex.), the crossed callosal tract (c.c.t), the plexiform
nucleus (p.7i.),* the head of the caudate nucleus (c.n.), and the inner
capsule (i.c.). The section from which the drawing was taken was
made perpendicularly in the oblique antero-posterior direction just
indicated.        By         so doing the         continuity   of     a   certain number of
callosal fibres, as                will   be noticed, can be followed            in    a direction
downwards, although it will be remarked that even here some of
them (as at s.c.f.) have been obliquely divided.
   From the drawing it is evident that the bulk of the fibres issuing
from the side of the tectorial part (c.c.) of the corpus callosum
sweep distinctly upwards, outwards, and downwards towards the
inner capsule (i.c).   They are united in coarse bundles, and thus
can be readily distinguished from those entering it (v.c.f. and p.n.f),
 which, although in bundles, are less condensed,                            and which, more
 over, spread out             in   a radiate or fan-shaped     manner.           When    the brain
is cut in a perpendicular transverse direction the continuity of these
 fibres     cannot be seen, because they have been severed by lying at
 an angle       to the plane of section.              Hence it      is,
                                                                      I     believe,    that they
 have remained               so long unnoticed.        In   no case       have   I    been able to
 see   a    single bundle of fibres run upwards after emerging.                                After
 having crossed, the whole mass seems to turn downwards to the
 capsules, and to form the greater part of their bulk.
      In two     late numbers of               Brain (vols. viii. and ix.), Dr Beevor
 has taken exception to                    this view as originally enunciated by me
 in    a   communication to the Royal Society (Proceedings,                              No. 230,
 1884),      and in papers                which   I   subsequently published              in    the
 Journal of Anatomy and Physiology (loc. cit), in Brain (vol. viii.,
 1886,   145), and elsewhere.

that my view is wrong, and that the old idea of the fibres passing
from cortex to cortex is correct*                                 He   asserts that     this drawing
is not a diagrammatic scheme, but an actual representation of                                                a
preparation in his possession.                         He further          states that he has made
oblique sections as                I   had directed, but still has been unable to                       see
what         I   described.
         "When       I   read this criticism,             I   felt certain of two things: first,
that         Dr Beevor had not examined preparations cut in the                                 oblique
direction          I have recommended;                and, secondly,        that the drawing above
referred to was not an actual representation                               of   the preparation       from
which it was said to have been taken.                             I was    convinced that what          he
had endeavoured                   to depict consisted in reality of the fibres                  pa*o'«<7
into the corpus callosum, and that he had entirely failed to                                      see, as
had happened                to others, those which were issuing   from     owing to      it,
his having cut the                     brain transversely instead of obliquely.  In
justice to           Dr     Beevor's        statement,          however,   I     resolved to    see    his
preparations for myself, and to hear                               his explanation of them              by
word of mouth                 I        am    constantly          being reminded         by so-called
critics that they are still sceptical                          of my statements,       and the most
ardent are those who have never taken the trouble to examine my
work, nor really to work at the subject for themselves.                                   The   matter
is   not one which can be settled                         in   an offhand manner, but requires
the most careful scrutiny.                     If    it   had been easy to demonstrate             what
I    have recorded,           it   would long ago have been done.
     My anticipations in                    regard    to the basis          on which     Dr    Beevor"s
criticism was founded were more than realised.                               I    emphatically     state

by       a   large       number of fibres having been cut off abruptly,                           which

entering the body.           I  further found that the oblique preparations
he employed had been cut in an entirely wrong direction, in a
direction which was calculated to divide the crossed callosal fibres,
instead of rendering them more apparent.                       As  I  have    elsewhere
stated, he has not followed              the directions        I  have so explicitly
given in various of my published papers, and hence it is useless to
argue the point.          If  he  will harden the human brain,             or, say, that
of   a sheep, by the method          I  have recommended,          and cut this per
pendicularly      in an oblique antero-posterior direction, he will                   see
what    I have  described.       It is impossible,      as I have  already indicated,
to trace    individual       axis-cylinders     throughout their entire course,
but   the continuity     of individual bundles        between the corpus callosum
and the capsules can         be demonstrated         with facility.     The difficulty
of tracing the     course of the crossed callosal fibres rests in this, that
those which lie anteriorly           after crossing       run obliquely backwards,
while those which lie posteriorly run obliquely forwards, the point
to which     they all tend to converge              being the knee of the inner
capsule.
    It  consequently happens that in whatever plane the organ may
be cut, the fibres      will   be divided at some point.             In  a completely
transverse     perpendicular        section    the crossed        callosal   fibres   are
usually divided, and being represented only by small fragments,                       are
very apt to be overlooked in the dense mass of nerve-medulla lying
in their neighbourhood.
    The Cortical       Plexuses.   — Of    late years      a good      deal   has   been
written of the most interesting plexus of medullated fibres which
exists in the cortex of the cerebellum                   and cerebrum,       by Exner
(Sitzungsb.    d.   k.   Ahademie       d.   Wissensch.,      vol. lxxxiii. Ab. iii.,
Feb. 1881), Butzke (Arch.           f. Psychiatrie, vol. iii.,        1872),    Gerlach
(Cmtralb. f. d. med. Wissensch., 1872, p. 273), Boll (Arch.                            f.
Psychiatrie, vol. iv., 1874, p. 1), Bindfleisch (M. Schultze's Arch.                   f.
mik.   Anat, vol. viii.      p. 453), and others.          It  seems likely, as     Hill
suggests, that since the discovery           of   these fine cortical plexuses       our
whole notions of what are known as nerve centres, and of the communi
cation that exists between nerve cells and fibres,            will shortly   be revolu
tionised.    The plexuses to which              I   refer   can be seen only when
certain methods      of staining are employed.             Exner, who is generally
regarded    as having discovered           the plexus in the cerebral            cortex,

used for the purpose of demonstrating                it  has almost  exclusively      been
Weigert's hsematoxylene           dye previously referred to.*           In the    cortex
of the cerebellum          the plexus is probably densest, but            it is  present
in all parts of the cerebral cortex          as   well.
    Continuity of Cortical Plexus with that in White Matter. — What
I  would specially wish to direct attention to at present, however,
is that this plexus not only prevails in the cortical grey matter,
but that it appears            to   intertwine      itself round the      nerve     fibres
throughout a great part of the white.                   The large medullated        nerve
fibres   from the cortex          run into the          white   matter,   but     almost
immediately become surrounded by a dense padding or casing of
this nerve network.            At first it might be supposed to be simply
connective      tissue, and    it has in bygone times been always regarded,
when indistinctly seen by less favourable means of demonstration,
simply    as the     branclung neuroglia.          The plexus     I refer to, however,
as pervading the white matter of the brain is a true nerve structure,
and that which is found in the cortex of the cerebrum and cerebellum
is an extension or outcrop            of this.      The appearance       presented      by
it  a short way within the cortical grey matter, of the motor region,
towards the vertex is shown in PI.            XV.     fig. 3.   The large medullated
trunks (a., a.) are seen coming down from the grey cortex, but shortly
after penetrating into the white matter of the centrum ovale they
become encased, as        it were, in a dense and complex mass of medullated
fibres (</.).      Between its fibres is the granular neuroglia (c), which
seems to     fill all  the meshes formed by it.
    Tlie Plexiform Nucleus. — A similar medullated plexus also exists
in certain of the ganglia, such as the thalamus and lenticular
nucleus.       In   the former     it is in  a high       state of development,        but
there is one part of the brain in which it reaches even a higher
grade of complexity.             I refer to  a  little   comma-shaped     body (fig.     2,
p.n.) which lies in the angle constituted by the under aspect of                       the
tectorial part of the corpus callosum                 and the upper surface of the
caudate     nucleus.       This body,      whose     presence    I  do not remember
having seen referred to, is one mass of             a dense    and complicated     nerve
plexus, and,      so  far as I am able    to discover, is without nerve cells.           It

is contiguous to the               caudate     nucleus below, but the tissue of the
one is separated          from that of the other by a sharp line of demar
cation.      It   passes for a short way underneath the corpus callosum,
and at its lower extremity posteriorly, seems to be united with
the taenia semicircularis. Its fibres are directly continuous with
the fibres of the plexus in the white matter just referred to. It is
most developed          anteriorly in the region of the head of the caudate
nucleus.
     In PI. XIV.      fig. 4    I have given a drawing        of the plexus constituting
this body      as  it  appears when magnified about 350 diameters.                      The
part from which the drawing was taken was immediately adjacent to
the inner capsule at the point x. in fig. 2.                     The plexiform nucleus
(p.n., p.n.,p.n.,) is seen to the right ; a few of the fibres of the inner
 capsule (i.e.) to the left. It will be noticed that the main bulk
of the body is made up of an intertwining felt-work of nerve fibres.
 They stain deeply with                 Weigert's copper-hsematoxylene           dye,    and
 between     them,       as    in   other    regions of the brain,         a   quantity    of
 granular neuroglia is interposed.                 It  is only lately that    I have  made
 out the true nature of this body, and on account of its structure                          I
 propose to name          it  the   plexiform     nucleus.
     Points of Origin of           the Callosal Fibres.      — The   most of the callosal
 fibres  which      come        down from the vertex             appear to run directly
 into the corpus callosum.                   Their usual     appearance     and direction
 are   represented         in    fig.   2  (v.c.f, v.e.f).      In passing downwards
they interlace with those leaving the corpus callosum, and which
 are turning downwards to the two capsules.
     Those, however, which are derived from the lower third or half
 of the cortex between the Sylvian                  fossa and the     great   longitudinal
 fissure  (fig. 2,   p.n.f, p.n.f.)         do not appear      to run directly into the
 corpus callosum, bnt pass first of               all into  the  plexiform    nucleus   just
 described.       Shortly after issuing from              the grey matter they become
 united into loose bundles which penetrate through the fibres of the
 crossed callosal tract, and which seem to lose themselves                      within the
plexiform nucleus by breaking up into its reticular network.                          From
 this reticular network               fresh fibres     appear    to arise,   and to enter
 the corpus callosum.                In all probability,       these   turn    downwards
 on the opposite          side into       the two capsules as fibres of the crossed
 callosal tract.       This plexiform         nucleus would thus possibly represent

 528           P roceedings       of Royal Society of Edinburgh,              [jas.    31,
a meeting-point for many              of  the callosal fibres   before they proceed
to cross,     the individual fibres losing their identity             within it        by
splitting    into an anastomising common network, from which again
fresh fibres appear to arise and travel across the corpus callosum
to the opposite         side.
    The fibres which enter            this body are chiefly derived         from      the
motor centres which in Man have been found to preside over                            the
muscles      of the tongue and face, that is to say, the lower parts
of the ascending              frontal  and     parietal    convolutions,  and      it    is
conceivable that the function of the plexus contained in                      it is     to
correlate    and associate their action.
    Destinations        of the Callosal Fibres. — After passing into the          inner
and outer capsules, the arched              callosal fibres just described become
united into dense bundles.               A   very large proportion of them lose
themselves      in    the thalamus opticus.         The excessively fibrous appear
ance   which       the     thalamus presents        is  due to  these fibres passing
into it.      They probably break up into a network, in the meshes
of which the nerve cells are intercalated.
    Are   these nerve         cells directly     connected   with the nerve fibres
entering the ganglion, or is the               network referred to intermediate !
It  seems more        likely that the union is not direct, but that          a plexus
intervenes between the two, and that this plexus simply surrounds
the nerve cells.            I am even    not at all convinced that the processes
of the nerve cells are in all cases directly connected with the plexus.
May not nerve energy generated                  in  cells exert its influence upon
nerve fibres in ways other than by direct continuity                    1  Is it     not
possible that it may be transferred to the coils of a dense                     plexus
through the liquid and neuroglia which fill up the intervals in the
tissue, and that, conversely,          peripheral stimuli may thus be conveyed
to a nerve cell       ?    I think this    is at least conceivable,    and the idea
has of late been           entertained by several physiologists, both in this
country and abroad.
   Few,     if  any,      callosal fibres     end   iu the   caudate   nucleus,    and,
curiously, as      if   supporting this observation, the plexus in this            gan
glion seems to be very scanty.               .The lenticular nucleus may       receive
through the striae medullares a considerable number, and probably
some of the fibres connected                 with the red nucleus may be also
callosal.     A   large      number appear to end in the pons and medulla

     Tlie Direct Fibres.           — This        paper, however, is concerned                with the
connections between the cerebral cortex and the centres lower down,
and     as   yet   I have referred           to only one set, namely, those which are
callosal and which cross from the opposite side.                                    There are others,
of    course, which run down directly, and of these                                 the motor fibres
are among the most important.                             These direct motor fibres lie to
the     outside     of the        crossed    callosal tract (fig. 2, d.f.), and, like                 it,
bend somewhat outwards in circumventing                                      the ventricle.       Those
derived from the marginal                    gyrus seem, at least              in the   sheep, to    lie
in very close apposition with the fibres of the crossed callosal tract.
In Man calculate that about one-third of the fibres entering the
             I
anterior two-thirds of the posterior limb of the                                   inner capsule     are
direct, while the remainder are crossed callosal.
     From experiments              made upon the cortex,                 it   is   evident that these
direct fibres are derived from                   a   wide area, one, indeed, so wide that
it   comes to be       a     question how            it   is   that they are so few in number
when they decussate in the medulla and become connected directly,
or through the intermediation                        of the spinal cord, with the peri
pheral nerves.          The notion at present held by most physiologists                              is
that from the motor cells of the cortex fibres issue which are con
tinuously prolonged downwards to the spinal cord.                                     But   if   we con
sider the matter for              a    moment,         it   is   evident that they must have
been     much reduced in bulk by the time they have reached                                         the
medulla, and that the pyramidal                                fibres   of the medulla or cord
cannot represent             the whole of the                  motor fibres derived from the
motor area.          How, then,         is   this sudden falling off to be accounted
fort     My        present    conviction          is   that the direct continuity                of the
process of     a    ganglion motor cell in the cortex with the pyramidal
tracts of the spinal cord                   is   a   myth.       I      am strongly inclined         to
believe that,        just    as   in   the case of many of the callosal fibres, the
motor fibres break up into                  a    plexus, from which again fresh fibres,
those which          enter the pyramidal tracts, take their origin.                               When
the pyramidal tracts in the cord are affected by secondary                                  degenera
tion,    they are mapped                out with            the    utmost      precision, and       the
degeneration never overlaps                      them.           Can the same be said of the
degeneration further up in the centrum ovale                             ?   I     do not think that

it   can.        There is always more or less diffusion of the tract imme
diately and for some distance below the point of lesion,                                 if   that be
cortical, and the explanation                    I    think is to       be found       in the inter-
position of this plexus.                     The plexus is a means              of reduction and
association,         a means by which the action of the many fibres coming
from        a    particular cortical area may be combined and correlated                               in
the few.
     But        the direct fibres entering the inner capsule are not                       all motor
in their function.               There are many other bands which enter                            it and
whose           function varies.            Thus there is a large contingent of fibres
which passes into its posterior limb from the parietc-occipital region,
and whose function, there cannot be much doubt, is sensory.                                            It
has     been shown,           over and          over    again,     that when it is destroyed
hemianaesthesia            results.          Then      there     is a large          band of       fibre*
which comes               from the          prefrontal     region,      and which        enters       the
anterior limb on its way back to the anterior                                        nucleus of the
thalamus,          to which      it    becomes attached.           The geniculate bodies and
the pulvinar finally are connected                      by direct bands with the occipital
region.
     Plexus most abundant in Man.                     — One of the main          differences       which
exist between the brain of Man and that of the lower mammalian
types       consists      in the disproportional               size    of the white and grey
matters.           In Man the white             matter is relatively more abundant than
in the brain of any other mammal I have examined, and the lower
we go in the scale the greater the disproportion appears to be.
   Now, the cause of this seems mainly to reside in the fact that
this intertwining             plexus which ramifies through the whole centrum
ovale is vastly more abundant in Man than                                in    the    lower animals,
and hence, probably, the superiority of the human brain as an
instrument of association                    may be accounted           for.
     Connections          of Thalamus              Opticus.    —   I   have    said that       a    large
number of callosal fibres pass into the thalamus opticus.                                  They lose
themselves           in    it,   apparently by becoming connected                       with dense
                                                                                               a
plexus.            In conclusion, let          me ask the question whether there                      are
any fibres which leave the thalamus, and,                              if   so, where they go to        ?
Do     fibres       descend       from the thalamus into the cerebral                      peduncle,
ultimately           to enter         the    spinal cord   ?   I       am becoming daily more
and more convinced that,                      if     such do exist,         they must be small in

1887.]     Prof. D.   J.  Hamilton on         the Cortex     of the Brain.         531
number.       Certain bands of fibres which are not callosal, no doubt
enter the thalamus, but these seem to connect it with parts of the
cortex which experiment has shown are associated with definite and
well-located functions.          Thus there are the three so-called peduncles
of the thalamus, uniting it respectively with the prefrontal region,
with the nucleus amygdalaris in the temporo-sphenoidal lobe,
and with the hippocampus major.                 But these differ entirely in their
nature from the fibres which are supposed                  to leave    the thalamus
and to pass downwards with the other descending cerebral tracts, and
it  seems to me that the latter,           if they    do exist, must be in small
quantity.
    How, then,    is the thalamus connected          peripherally, and what is its
use?      As yet any      statement      on this subject must necessarily            be
largely conjectural, but, all things considered,              there is reason f6r at
least supposing that        this ganglion is largely concerned               with   the
 education of the brain through           the optic nerves    and corpus callosum.
 Of all   the nerves    in the body the optics are those by which the
 brain is   mainly educated.        They are in constant use, imperceptibly
 opening up the cortical grey matter to impressions made upon the
periphery by light vibrations.           What is     the connecting     link  between
the peripheral retina and the central cortex?                    The visual centre
is said    to be located       in the occipital        lobe,  but the optic       must
 subserve    a far 'wider function      in educating other parts of the cortex
as well as this small area         ?   How is it that the motor centres, for
instance, are educated to a particular complicated act, purely through
the sense of sight?         "What    is the mechanism          by which a sudden
visual impression,       accompanied       by a sense of danger, will serve to
throw     the body      instantaneously         into   a  complicated attitude of
defence?      This introduces         far too      wide a subject of        discussion
to take up at present        ;   but it seems to me likely that the callosal
fibres   entering the thalamus constitute the substratum by which
these   acts   are accomplished ;         that    they are, in fact,       the   means
by which       the   opposite,    side    of   the   brain is educated         through
vision.
    Where the corpus        callosum has been destroyed             in infancy, im
 becility seems to have been the invariable result.                There are certain
 records   of congenital deficiencies           of this body which have been
 unaccompanied       by any symptoms of note,                 more    especially one

 described                                                   It seems,
however, that in these cases we have to do not with a deficiency
in the actual callosal                     fibres,    but with a malformation                      by     which
they have failed to decussate                        in the middle line, just       as so frequently
happens      in    the anterior pyramids.
      On the supposition that the thalamus subserves the purpose                                                 of
concentrating the fibres which educate the higher centres                                               through
the optic,     it      can readily be understood how,                     if it   were destroyed in
adult life, no very evident symptoms might follow.                                      It    has already
to a great extent subserved its purpose.                              The higher centres                   have
been educated,               and are capable of discharging their functions apart
from the channels through which that education has been imparted.
It    has played its part, so to speak,                       in infancy and youth, and                     may
now in a manner be considered                              as functionally         inert.           The im
pressions     made upon the cerebral                          cortex through it are quite                   pos
sibly recalled by a perfectly different set of channels                                 ;    for    I    do not
see    why in          the internal           economy         of the brain there may not                        be
paths for educating the higher centres                                through       vision, hearing,
touch, and so on, and a whole set of other paths by which the
results of this education may be brought into action.                                         If        such    be
the case — and               I    advance      this with all due caution                — the           callosal
system       of        fibres         might     be     regarded      as    the     great           educating
system; while the direct bundles to which                                 I have    adverted would
constitute the means of adapting this education to a utilitarian
purpose.
     In   the case of those born blind, the education                        of the cortex would
of course be carried on through other channels,                                    namely, through
those     of the remaining special senses.                           The nuclei of the nerves
connected      with          these are situated          in   great part    in the      pons, medulla
oblongata,        and spinal cord, and these again, as already mentioned,
appear to be extensively united to crossed callosal fibres which have
descended         in    the inner capsule.                By the      agency       of       these       callosal
fibres they are placed in communication with the cerebral cortex                                                on
the opposite side of the body.                         The same mechanism for educating
the cortex in fact prevails here as in the case of the optic                                        ;    that   is
to say, there          is,   firstly, the peripheral nerve to receive                         the impres
sion; secondly,                  an   intermediate nucleus to which                         the nerve           is
bound;      and,       thirdly,        a    system       of fibres                      by means                of
                                                                      (callosal)

¦which     this nucleus is placed in continuity with the opposite cerebral
cortex.
      The arrangement            seems a probable one ;                 all the       most    important
motor and sensory channels seem to cross the middle line at some
point.          We    see   this exemplified in its most simple form in the
ordinary ascending and descending paths in the spinal cord                                         ;   and
there seems good reason for believing that the same type of con
struction         prevails higher          up.          The     callosal        fibres would           thus
represent the decussation              of      the multiform tracts which do not cross
in any of         the commissures          or decussations         lower down.               The greater
number of them are probably not motor nor purely sensory in their
function,         but in great        part educational.                 They are, in fact, the
means      of impressing the opposite                       cortical centres      ¦with the      stimuli
that have been made upon the intermediate centres lower down.
