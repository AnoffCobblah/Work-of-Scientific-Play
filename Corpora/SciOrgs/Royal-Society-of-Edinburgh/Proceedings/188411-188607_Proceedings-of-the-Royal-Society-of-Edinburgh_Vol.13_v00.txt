                                  in the Chair.
     The President    opened     the Session with a short        Address, and
an Obituary Notice of Sir Alexander Grant
      The following Communications were read                : —
  1.   On the Distribution of Energy between colliding Groups
                 of Molecules.        By Sir W. Thomson.
     2. On the Dynamics of Reflection and Refraction in the
               Wave Theory of Light.              By the Same.
     3.  On Kerr's Discovery regarding the Reflection of Light
               from a Magnetic Pole.             By the Same.
   4. On an Improved Method of Measuring Compressibility.
                              By Professor Tait.
      When the compressibility of        a liquid or  gas is measured at very
 high pressures, the compression        vessel has to bo enclosed    in a strong
 cylinder   of metal,    and   thus it must be made, in some way, self-
 registering.    I first used indices, prevented from slipping by means
  of hairs.   Sir W. Thomson's        devices for sounding, at small depths,
  by the compression of air, in which he used various physical and
  chemical processes      for recording purposes,      led me to devise and
  employ a thin silver film which was washed off by                a  column of
  mercury.     Much of my work              connected    with   the   Challenger
  Thermometers     was    done   by the help of this process.         Till  quite
  recently  I was  unaware that it had been devised and employed by
  Cailletet in 1873, only that his films were of gold.

                         of Edinburgh,         Session 1884-85.
     Rot the use     of all     these methods is very laborious, for the whole
apparatus     has to be opened           for each     individual reading.         Hence it
struck me that, instead             of measuring the compression produced by
a given pressure,          we should try to        measure the pressure required to
produce     an assigned         compression.        I  saw that this could be at once
effected    by the simplest electric methods ; provided that glass, into
tchirh a fine platinum wire is fused, were capable of resisting very
high pressures without cracking or leaking at the junctions.                          This,
on trial, was found to be the case.
     We have,       therefore,      only to   fuse     a  number of platinum wires,
at intervals,      into the compression tube, and very carefully calibrate
 it with a column of mercury which is brought just into contact
 with     each    of the wires         successively.       Then     if thin wires,      each
 resisting    say about an ohm, be interposed between the                          pairs   of
  successive     platinum wires,          we   have      a  series   whose resistance       is
  diminished       by one ohm each time the mercury, forced in by the
  the pump,       comes      in   contact  with another of         the wires.      Connect
  the mercury        with one pole of        a   cell, the highest of the platinum
   wires    with     the    other, leading the wires out between                two    stout
   leather washers       ;   interpose a galvanometer in the circuit, and the
   arrangement is        complete.       The observer himself works the pump,
   keeping an eye on the pressure                 gauge,    and on the spot of light
   reflected   by the mirror of the galvanometer.                  The moment he         sees
    a change    of deflection he reads the gauge.                 It  is convenient that
    the external apparatus should be made to leak                    slightly; for thus      a
    #en« of measures         may be made, in a minute or two, for the contact
    with each of the platinum             wires.      Then    we pass to      the next in
    succession.
       I  have    found       this method       perfectly      successful     in   practice,
    enabling me to do in an afternoon (and far more certainly than
    before) as much as          I  formerly could manage in a month.                 But I
    cannot   properly       apply it to the compression of water at various
    temperatures      (from 0° to 100° C.) until              I   get a new,     light but
    strong,  steel compression apparatus, which                  has    been  ordered     for
    this special problem.
       The experiments hitherto made by this process (to satisfy myself
    that it would work) were                 made       in my smaller compression
    apparatus ; whieh is a massive           iron cylinder, and very unwieldy for

heating purposes.           The results below are           therefore strictly    pre
liminary and provisional              The difficulty     of knowing the interior
temperature,      and especially     of making    sure that   it  has ceased to rise,
during the measures, renders them very dubious.                     I hope   soon   to
supply more trustworthy results.

    If  these    at   all represent    the truth, they indicate a very curious
result.     But     I draw no   inference    till  I can   repeat   the work under
more favourable circumstances.

                          of Edinburgh,     Session 1884-85.                             5
  of laet  August         At  that time  I went   to a small fishing village called
  Sea Houses,       North Sunderland,         on the Northumbrian           coast,    and
 obtained a large number of herring ova, which                I fertilised   artificially
 on glass     plates when on board a herring boat off the Longstone
 Lighthouse.         I   kept the spawn in wooden boxes sunk close to the
shore,     and was successful in keeping              a   proportion    of them in       a
healthy condition up to the time of hatching, and for several days
after.      When      I  returned to the Scottish Marine Station on Septem
ber 3,    I brought       with  me about a dozen         newly-hatched      larvae in a
corked bottle        of   sea water, and some of these           were   alive on Sep
tember 11,       having lived over nine days.               I attempted to feed the
larvae    by putting in the water some of the small organisms taken
by the tow-net, and those which              I examined     on  1 1th September had
digested food       in the intestine.       I had previously experimented with
 herring eggs      in August and September 1883, when accompanied      I
 some    members of the Scottish Fishery Board to the Moray Firth,
 to investigate      the herring      question there.      In March of     the present
 year also     I  obtained      and artificially   fertilised herring ova off An-
 strutber, in the        Firth of Forth.      On neither of these occasions had
 I suitable    opportunities      for making    a fruitful study of my material.
 At North Sunderland             I  spent most     of my time in observing the
 living    embryos at succeeding stages, and preserving examples                        at
  frequent     intervals.       These preserved      specimens      I  have    cut into
  sections   in the laboratory of the Granton Station since my return.
     The rate of development in herring eggs, as in those of most
  Teleosteans,      varies considerably with the temperature.                 The eggs
  which    I studied were exposed to a temperature              varying from 53° to
 58:    Fahr.   (ll°-5    to 14°"5   C),   and they hatched on the eighth and
 ninth days after fertilisation.
     Kupffer's vesicle, as is well known,              is a small globular cavity
 which appears at an early stage            in Teleostean development          between
 the   posterior end of the embryo and the yolk.                 In  the herring eggs
 with    which     I    had to deal the structure was           visible early on the
 third day, and remained visible for about eight or nine hours                      ;  on
 the   fourth day       it could not   be seen.    At the time of its      appearance
 the   yolk was entirely enclosed          by the blastoderm,        the two ends of
 the   embryo almost met at the ventral side of the ovum, and the
 rudiments      of the     eyes and ears were formed.

6                      Proceedings        of the Royal      Society
    Historical Summary. —The vesicle              was first described by     Kupffer*
in 1868 in Gasterosteus aculeatus,                  Gob ins   minutus,    and Gobius
niger.     He described it         as  lying beneath the intestine, stated that
it  was  lined with cells, and considered that it was homologous with
the allantois of the Amniota.              In  later papers Kupffer came to the
conclusion that the vesicle was connected with the development of
 the urinary organs and ducts.
     Balfour,   in his Comparative Embryology, considered the vesicle
 as   homologous with the post-anal vesicle in Elasmobranchs.                        He
 gave no reasons for this view, intending probably to investigate the
 point at some future time.
     In 1880f M. Henneguy published, in the Bulletin                     de  la Societi
 rhilomathique        de  Paris,      some    researches     on the development        of
 the Perch, in which he announced that he believed he had found
  an opening from Kupffer's              vesicle to the exterior, and considered
  that the structure        represented       the primitive      intestine of Cyclo-
  stomi and Eatrachia,          its opening being the anus of Rusconi.                In
  1883 a paper on Teleostean embryology, by Messrs                      Kingsley and
  Conn,  J appeared      in the Memoirs of           the Boston Society     of Natural
  History.     These authors had studied chiefly the pelagic ova of
  Ctenolabrus, one of the Wrasses,                They trusted entirely to optical
  sections   of the living embryo.            They devote      two short paragraphs
  to Kupffer's vesicle     ;  they describe its origin from a number of small
  granules which coalesce, say nothing                 of its relation to the layers,
  though their figure is correct as far as         it  goes, and  think that Balfour's
  view is much more probable than Henneguy's.
      Finally, Professor A. Agassiz and C. 0. Whitman have recently
  published some researches on the development of pelagic Teleostean
  eggs carried on at the Newport               Marine Laboratory.!        Here, again,
  ova of Ctenolabrus were principally                 studied.    Kupffer's   vesicle- is
  dealt with in some detail            ;  the description      of its origin given by
   Kingsley and Conn           is confirmed,      if    by  granules are understood
  small spaces    ; the   vesicle is correctly described as lying beneath the
  chorda and entodermic stratum, and as having no sort of connection

 with any tubular structure whatever.                     It  disappears      as the intestine
is  formed      ;  but the authors have not recognised                     the fact that the
periblast aids in forming the floor of                    the intestine, as       I shall show
below.         They believe that a lumen exists in the part of the intes
tine formed in         the region of the vesicle, from the time of the hitter's
disappearance          onwards.         It    is very surprising that,           having     thus
grasped clearly the relations of the vesicle,                      Agassiz and Whitman
have      not seen its meaning              ;  they say that they are not ready to
accept       Balfour's     interpretation,         but    the views         of Kupffer and
 Henneguy          are   still    more     unsatisfactory.        I   hope     to   show that
 Henneguy's         is the obvious and only morphological                      interpretation
 possible of the structure in question.
     I may be allowed           to explain that      I arrived      at the view      I hold   in
 dependently,         not having seen any account                 of Henneguy's results
  till  my opinion had been formed ; at present                     I  have only been able
  to   see an abstract         of Henneguy's        paper,     and do not know            if his
  foundation of fact         was more or less firm than my own.
      Kupffer's vesicle, then, as seen in a successful                   series of transverse
  sections    through       a herring       ovum at the proper stage, is               a  hemi
  spherical     cavity, bounded above             by the lowest layer of the blasto
  derm, and        laterally     and inferiorly by the periblast.                The latter is
  simply the outer            layer     of the yolk containing               nuclei,   but not
  divided into cells.          In    the herring at this stage the hypoblast cells
  are  not distinctly differentiated from the mesoblast                        The notochord
  is well formed, not yet vacuolated, and, as usual, not sharply marked
  off from the hypoblast.              The neurochord is present              as a thick cord
  of cells derived         from the epiblast, and containing                    no canal (see
  Plate    L  fig. 1).
      It  is clear, then, that Kupffer's vesicle has the same relation to
  the embryonic         layers as the invagination cavity in Elasmobranchs,
  Amphibia, and Cyclostomi (Petromyzon).                         The vesicle has no dif
  ferentiated cell-walls of its own ; it is simply a depression in the
  periblast        The    differences      between     its relations and those of the
  cavities with which            I  am comparing         it are — first, its small extent,
  and second, the want of an opening to the exterior. As to the
  extent, the vesicle is          a  rudiment, a remnant of          a  larger cavity    ; as to
  its opening, it is on a par with all the other cavities in the Teleostenn
  embryo.         The neural        canal, the cavity of the otocyst,            the cavity of

8                       Proceedings        of  the   Royal Society
the crystalline lens, none of these arises                in the Teleostean by          direct
invagination       from the exterior, as they all do in Elasmobranchs.
The neurenteric canal, as           a  distinct lumen, does not exist in Teleos
tean embryos,        nor does the blastopore which would give rise to                        it.
In Petromyzon             we   have      an   interesting      condition     intermediate
between     the Elasmobranch             and the Teleostean.            The neural       canal
 does not arise as a groove open to the exterior, but, as                  in Teleosteans
 appears    at   a   later    stage   closed      from    the    beginning    ;  while      the
 gastrula cavity, on the other hand, is formed by direct invagination.
 The part of the blastopore represented                 by the neurenteric canal has
 disappeared,     and not the part which in the Elasmobranch remains
 open to the exterior longest (see Plate               I.  figs. 2, 3 ; Plate    II.   fig.  5).
    As far    as  actual comparison goes, therefore,              there   is every reason
 to believe that Kupffer's            vesicle represents         the gastrula cavity,         or
 that part of it which is left after deducting the body cavity                    ;  but still
 further evidence is offered          by the subsequent history of the vesicle.
 In Plate II.     fig. 4 is shown        the condition of the herring embryo                 on
 the fourth day in the region where Kupffer's vesicle existed.                              The
 intestine is completely formed             ; and it will be noticed that beneath
 the   intestine the periblast           is very thin,        and contains no nuclei,
 though these are visible laterally beneath                  the   mesoblast        It   seems
 clear, then, that the floor of the intestine in this region has been
 formed by the differentiation of cells round the nuclei of the peri
 blast, exactly     as   in Elasmobranchs           the   periblastic floor of the gas
 trula cavity is transformed into the floor of the intestine.
     I  think    there     is no room for           doubt     that the     significance of
 Kupffer's     vesicle is completely elucidated by the facts                      and com
 parisons   I  have thus given         ;  it is  the last rudiment of the invagina
 tion cavity in the Teleostean.
    Remarks on General Vertebrate                   Morphology.     — The view which
 obtains homologies between Vertebrates on the one hand, and Chae-
 topoda,   Crustacea,       and Iusecta on the other, by inverting the latter,
 was suggested        long ago by Geoffrey St Hilaire, when he said that
 Vertebrates were insects walking on their backs.                        But    the distinct
 hypothesis that       a  Vertebrate is actually descended from an ancestor
 which agreed in almost every point of its anatomy with a modern
 Chaetopod, owes its origin and support in great measure to                      Dr Dohrn,
director of the Zoological Station at Naples.                    St Hilaire's suggestion

                         of Edinburgh, Session 1884-85.                                   9
was     related      to this theory very much           as    Lamarck's     notions on
evolution to the " Origin of Species."
     The correspondence between a Chaetopod turned                       over, and say
a   fish, is very complete.         On the upper     side (ventral      in Chaetopod's
natural position) is the double nerve-cord               ;  so also    in the fish. In
the axis is the intestine.             Above     the intestine       in   the   inverted
Chaetopod is a blood-vessel, in which the blood passes from the head
towards the tail (subintestinal vessel in natural position).                      So also
                —
in the fish the dorsal aorta.              In the inverted Chaetopod, below
the intestine, is a blood-vessel in which the blood passes from the
tail to the head (dorsal blood-vessel in the natural position).                         So
also in the fish — (subintestinal vein, heart, ventral aorta).
      Moreover,     in the embryo of Chaetopod, Insect or Crustacean, the
 blastoderm is formed on the ventral surface, along which the primi
 tive blastopore extends, though in most cases its actual opening is
 narrowed     to a small posterior aperture, which becomes the anus.                     In
  the Vertebrate embryo the blastoderm is dorsal, and, as Sedgwick*
  has shown     in    a recent paper, and   as  Miss Johnson          f  has confirmed,
  there is evidence       in  the Vertebrate embryo of a fusion of the layers
  at an  early stage along the median line of the blastoderm, indicating
  a  primitive elongated blastopore.
      Sedgwick's       view of the morphology of Vertebrates differs from
  Dohrn's    in one most important point.               The former considers           the
  actual   mouth and anus of Vertebrates                to    be identical     with     the
  primitive     mouth      and anus, and      supposes       that   a   portion    of the
   nervous system, representing the supracesophageal                ganglia of Chaeto-
   pods,  &c,   has disappeared.        On Dohrn's         view, the primitive        anus
   was terminal, and is represented             (when       the actual     blastopore is
  enclosed by the medullary groove) by the neurenteric canal.                      Where
  was the    primitive mouth if the actual mouth is                a secondary       struc
  ture f     DohrnJ pointed out clearly in 1875                      that a primitive
   mouth must have existed, surrounded,             as  in modern Chaetopods, by
  nerve-cord.          He first   supposed   that    the hypophysis           cerebri, or
   pituitary body, then believed          to be developed from the intestine,
   was the rudiment          he was  seeking  ;  but in the publication            I  have
   referred to he definitely abandoned this view, and took up the theory

that the sinus rhomboidalis                      in the medulla oblongata, the               fourth
ventricle in fact, was the position of the primitive                             mouth.          This
view he has also since given up.                        The hypothesis was discussed              by
Balfour in his monograph on the development of Elasmobranchs.*
     It   is an astonishing fact that,              until    the publication of       Sedgwick's
paper, morphologists had never                     fully    grasped the significance of           the
development of the central nervous system in Vertebrates.                              Sedgwick
has pointed out that the interior                       surface of the    lining    canal   is   part
of the original dorsal surface                   of the body — that       is to say, the     condi
tion through which an Elasmobranch or Amphibian                                 embryo passes,
in which the nervous system is                      a   double cord of thickened epiblast,
widening out anteriorly into                    a plate,   was the permanent         condition        of
the Vertebrate ancestor.                       Sedgwick     has not followed out this            fact
to its ultimate consequences.                         He has been misled by his desire
to consider the present mouth and anus as identical with the                                original
structures.           At the         meeting of the British Association at York                       in
1881,         Sir Richard            Owen, in his address            to   the   Department            of
Anatomy           and Physiology               of Section      D,   embraced     the Dohrnian
view          of the homologies of Vertebrates                      and   Invertebrates,         and
announced             as   a   new hypothesis that the original                 oesophagus was
represented           by what he called             the conario-hypophysial          bract — that
is,      that the oesophagus           originally passed from the hypophysis to the
pineal gland.              This      was very much         the same as Dohrn's first view
before         1875, which           had   to be abandoned.          The reasons why             it   is

          Professor    Turner has kindly pointed            out to me that John Goodsir,          in a
paper published in the second volume of his Anatomical Memoirs, Edinburgh,
1868, speaks of a view he once held concerning the Vertebrate primitive
mouth, which      similar to the view once held by Dohrn, as mentioned above.
                      is
Goodsir's view, originally published in the Edinburgh Philosophical Journal in
1857, was that the primitive oesophagus passed through the pituitary body,
infundibulum, and third ventricle, and opened at the roof of the fourth ven
tricle behind the cerebellum.     This theory, therefore, was    combination of a
the views which have since that time been successively favoured by Dohrn,
and    anterior in date to any publications on the subject by Dohrn, Owen, or
         is
any others.   Goodsir, in the paper    refer to, only mentions his theory to say
                                                  I
that he abandoned              it,
                        because Reichert had shown that the pituitary body does
not perforate the skull in the embryo.      We know now that this reason for
abandoning the theory does not exist.    Goodsir completely agreed with Geoffrey
St Hilaire's view concerning he reversed positions in Vertebrate and Annelid

was homologous with the subintestinal vessel and heart in the Vertebrate.—

                         of Edinburgh,       Session 1884-85.                            11
untenable      are— first, the hypophysis is developed             in most cases from
the epiblast of the actual mouth, and not from the hypoblast                       ;  and,
second (a reason which            I  believe has never before           been definitely
stated), that the original          mouth did not open on what is now the
 dorsal surface above the nervous system,                   but on the floor of the
 cerebral vesicles,      which is part of the primitive body             surface.      The
 conditions      required for the rudiment of the primitive                   mouth are
 satisfied completely, and it seems to me exclusively, by the infundi
 bulum.       This latter structure is in        the embryo a diverticulum           from
 the floor of the first cerebral vesicle, which comes into contact with
 the anterior end of the mesenteron.                 In Miss Johnson's        paper
                                                                                     " On
               "
  the Newt        a  pit is described    at the front end of the primitive blasto
  pore, at the bottom of which pit epiblast and hypoblast are fused.
  The writer believes that this pit          becomes the actual mouth.            I think
  there is little doubt that         if  she had      traced   the fate of the pit in
  question she would          have found      that it became the infundibulum.
  I   know that in herring          embryos,      in front of the notochord, the
  neurochord        comes   into contact with the hypoblast.              Dohrn *       has
  come to the conclusion that the hypophysis cerebri is the rudiment
  of  a praeoral pair    of gill-clefts.    If  this conclusion hold good, it gives
  support to my view of the primitive               mouth, for a pair of gill-clefts
  would have       opened    into the original oesophagus, and therefore             might
  very    well in actual Vertebrates             come     into   connection with the
  rudiment       of the primitive       mouth,    as   the pituitary body does with
   the infundibulum.           As for the pineal gland, it does not concern
  the question in        the least j   it is connected with the closing of the
   medullary      canal,   and is of comparatively small importance in the
   present discussion.
      The Notochord.       — Ever    since   the notochord was first described in
   some    embryos as originating           from      the hypoblast,      morphologists
   have considered that         it must phylogenetically          be derived from the
   intestine.      Now, comparative anatomy shows that this supposition
   is untenable. The dorsal aorta in the fish is homologous with the
   subintestinal vessel in the Chaetopod : if the notochord had been
   derived from the intestine,         it would lie between the aorta and the
   intestine  —   its actual position is between the aorta and the neuro
    chord.    It   is not   consistent with the principles             of evolution       to
                  *

  12                   Proceedings     of   the   Royal Society
 believe that it could first arise from the intestine, and afterwards
 pass into    its present      position.     The notochord must               have    arisen
 phylogenetically      from the mesoblast           between the neurochord and
 the aorta.     Some of my sections of herring embryos show the                        noto
 chord distinctly      marked off from the hypoblast, and continuous
 with  the neurochord.         This  is not to be interpreted as showing that
 the notochord was derived from the neurochord, a skeletal structure
 from an epiblastic.        The reason why the notochord is at first in
 close relation with the hypoblast, or with the neurochord, is that                       its
 development in the embryo has come                     to take     place   at so early a
 stage that the fusion of the three layers along the line of the                      primi
 tive blastopore has not disappeared              before       the notochord appears.
 Balfour   says,    that in     Elasmobranchs           it   is   difficult  to   ascertain
 whether the notochord is derived from the hypoblast or is a central
column of mesoblast cells.           We thus       get back to the old view, that
the notochord is homologous with the three giant fibres beneath                          the
nerve-chord in the earth-worm             ;   both are          mesoblastio     structures,
developed    in the same position for the purpose                      of supporting the
nerve-chord.        It  has   been   suggested         that     the   typhlosole    in the
earth-worm represents          the   notochord       ;    as   I  have    shown     this is
impossible    ;  the typhlosole reappears          in the spiral valve of the in
testine of Elasmobranchs          and   other fishes.           The fact that the noto
chord stops short just behind the infundibulum                        is fully accounted
for by my theory that the latter structure is the primitive mouth.
    The  Vertebrate     Eye.- — The peculiarity          in   the   development of the
vertebrate eye, as compared            with that of Invertebrates,                has long
ceased to be so great a mystery as             it   was to earlier morphologists.
In his   address     to the Department          of Anatomy and Physiology                 of
Section D, at the British Association              meeting at Swansea in 1880,
Balfour pointed out that the retina was formed from the floor of
the brain, that is to say, from the              same portion of the primitive
epidermis which formed the central nervous system.                           In   a similar
way the rhabdoms or retinal elements               in the eyes of Arthropods are
formed from the supracesophageal               ganglia.         In his little book on
Degeneration in the Nature series, Prof.                     Lankester      has inferred
from the consideration of the cerebral                 eyes of Ascidians,         that the
original vertebrate ancestor was transparent, and had eyes on the floor
of its brain ; that when the animal became opaque the eyes gradually

grew     out to meet the epidermis at the             sides  of the head.     But
Sedgwick's revelation that the floor of the cerebral vesicle was once
the surface of the head, enables us to go a step further, and form a
clear conception        of the  state of the eyes  in the primitive    vertebrate
ancestor, and the transition          to the present state.    In  the worm-like
ancestor at the sides of and somewhat             in front of    the mouth were
a pair     of eyes, formed as simple pits in the epidermal nerve area,
exactly similar to the simple open eye-cups which exist in Patella
and Haliotis at the present day.            When the mouth and nerve area
were covered by the formation of the neural canal the eyes became
cerebral,      and were influenced by light coming through the trans
parent tissues.         In  this condition the eye has persisted in Ascidians.
In Vertebrates          the body has     become    opaque,   the eye-cups    have
grown out towards            the side of the head, where a thickening took
place    in the epidermis       to form the crystalline lens, which afterwards
was    pinched off and sunk in the mesoblast.               "We may regard the
humours, the cornea, and the lens of the vertebrate eye as parts which
have retained        their primitive transparency (see Plate II. fig. 6).
    We have now made more compact the inversion theory of vertebrate
morphology.           Sedgwick has attempted to go further, and account for
segmentation gill-clefts, segmental          organs,  and abdominal pores, by
deriving        them     from   Coelenterates similar    to Zoantharians.     His
theory is very ingenious, and for the most part extremely probable.
But     it  agrees     much better with the view that the infundibulum
represents the primitive mouth, and the neurenteric canal the primi
tive anus, than with Sedgwick's own view concerning these points.
For, according to Sedgwick himself,            the planes of segmentation      are
 perpendicular        to the direction of the elongated blastopore,       while  if
the present anus of a fish is the primitive           anus, the segments of the
 fish's   tail   are parallel   to part of the primitive blastopore.       And if
 the primitive blastopore extended from the actual mouth to the
 actual anus in such a fish            as a cod   or blenny,    it would occupy
 almost      -j^yths  of the longest circumference of the body.           Balano-
 glossus, too, seems to give evidence that openings can arise from the
 intestine to the exterior independently both of segmental             organs and
 blastopore.         There is one other point which Sedgwick             neglects,
 namely, that segments in all segmented animals are formed between
 the telson and the last segment.          I am not aware    that in any Coelen-
  terate the mesenteries are formed according to this law.

3.   The Relations of the Alveolar form of Cleft Palate to the
         Incisor Teeth and the Intermaxillary Bones.                    By Prof.
         Wm. Turner, M.B., F.R.S.
     Dr Albrecht of Brussels has recently traversed the well-known
and generally accepted theory originally advanced by Goethe, that
in the alveolar form of cleft palate       the fissure     lies in the plane of
 the suture between the intermaxillary         and superior maxillary        bone.0,
 and has suggested,     in substitution for this theory, that in         the early
 embryo each intermaxilla is divided           into an inner         mesial bone
 (endognathion) and an outer lateral bone           (mesognathion), and that
 the    alveolar   cleft is an open     state    of   the    suture   intervening
 between these two divisions.
      In this communication the author        discussed     Albrect's theory and
  described the observations which he had made (A) on casts of the
  roof of the mouth in fifteen cases of cleft palate, and (B) of hard
  palates where there was no cleft, with the view of ascertaining their
  bearing on the theory advanced by Albrecht.
      A- For the opportunity of examining         these casts, and for informa
  tion regarding the cases, he has to express obligations to his colleagues,
  Professors    Annandale     and Chiene    ; to   Dr John Smith, President
  of the Royal College of Surgeons, Edinburgh ; Dr Joseph Bell,
   Senior Surgeon, Edinburgh Royal Infirmary            ; W. Bowman Macleod
   Esq., L.D.S., Dean of the Dental School             ;  and Andrew        Wilson,
   Esq.,   L.D.S., Lecturer on Dental Anatomy, Edinburgh.
       He has  also analysed Th.   Kolliker's   account    of forty-nine prepara
   tions of cleft palate examined in several museums in Germany.
       Dr Kolliker's forty-nine preparations and the fifteen              casts  ex
    amined by the author, make        in all sixty-four       specimens    in which
   the relations of the alveolar cleft to the teeth have been definitely
   observed.     These specimens resolve themselves          into two groups — a,
   one   in which no precanine tooth intervened between the canine and
   the cleft, and in this group were thirteen specimens ; b, one in
    which a precanine was situated between the canine and the cleft,
   and this    consisted of fifty-one    specimens.        Obviously,     therefore,
    much the larger number of persons with the alveolar form of cleft
    palate possess a tooth   in front of the canine, which is cut off from
   the incisor series   of teeth by the gap in the border of the jaw.

 16                     Proceedings      of  tlie   Royal Society
    The author then discussed the homologies of the incisor teeth
with    reference    to the intermaxillary           bones, and    the nature     of the
precanine tooth.         He believed that         the precanine    should be regarded
as   In  3,  and that the missing incisor in the normal human dental
arcade is     In  2.  Whilst     agreeing   with Th. Kolliker in his criticism
that the teeth and jaws arise quite independently of each other, and
only become related secondarily, yet from the fact that in                     so large  a
proportion       of the casts      a  tooth, which from its position must be
referred to the incisor series, was situated between                   the canine and
the cleft could scarcely           be without      some significance, and from         the
frequency of its occurrence,           should not be regarded         as   a mere    acci
dental displacement of          a  tooth germ.         The very frequent presence
of   a   precanine     tooth     may    therefore be regarded            as  supporting
Albrecht's view of the position of the cleft.
    Albrecht has, however, had the advantage                    of examining several
skulls in which the alveolar cleft was seen to separate the inter-
maxilla into an inner and an outer part, each carrying its appropriate
incisor or incisors.        In addition     to the skulls       of the   horse and the
calves referred      to in his first essay on this subject, he has since de
scribed and figured an adult human skull in the University of Kiel,
in which       a  right cleft existed in the corresponding                 intermaxilla,
and the right maxillo-intermaxillary                suture coexisted     with    and was
quite distinct from it       ;  a  new-born infant with double cleft, in which
the same suture was present ; the             jaw of     a  child about one year old,
in the    museum      at Ghent, in which, with a left cleft               in  the corre
sponding intermaxilla,         a  left maxillo-premaxillary        suture was present.
In all   these cases the part of the intermaxilla                 which was situated
outside the cleft contained the                socket     for the precanine incisor.
The anatomical evidence will therefore                  justify the    statement     that,
in  a  proportion of cases of alveolar cleft palate, the cleft lies within
the intermaxilla, the cleft coexisting with the maxillo-intermaxillary
suture,     and an incisor tooth is situated          in   the interval    between     the
cleft and the canine of the same side.
    In   the   group of cases of alveolar cleft in which no precanine
tooth intervened between the canine and the cleft, it is not impro
bable that one may find examples               of   a cleft occurring in the plane
of the maxillo-intermaxillary           suture, and not       within  the intermaxilla
itself.      Wherever     a  suture exists, there, of course,         a   possibility   of

an imperfect     union of the two bones may arise.         Should    the bones
remain separate,     and should the want of union be accompanied              by
anon-closure of the superjacent soft parts, then the imperfect de
velopment would lead to the production             of a cleft in the alveolar
region and   in the upper lip, and the theory of Goethe might there
fore be applicable to such cases.
   The author then referred to the descriptions of Leidy, Callender,
and Th.    Kolliker on the development of the intermaxillary           bones.
   B. The object of examining the hard palate where there was no
cleft was to ascertain     if any suture, or the remains of a suture, could
be seen   in its anterior part, immediately behind the incisor teeth, to
indicate that, as    Dr Albrecht contends, the incisive or intermaxillary
element   of the human upper jaw had originally             consisted   of two
bones on each side, a mesial or internal, and a lateral or external.
The author described six specimens, in each of which          a narrow fissure
was present     in  each  intermaxilla, which apparently represented         the
remains of an intra-incisive suture.          It existed in conjunction with
a  pair of maxillo-intermaxillary sutures.
    The place of origin of the intra-incisive fissure in the majority of
 the specimens was from the maxillo-premaxillary           suture external to
 the incisive    canal, which    canal,   therefore,  on the theory that the
 intermaxilla consists of an inner and an outer division, would lie in
 relation to the inner division       close to the articulation     between     it
 and the superior maxilla.       In  one instance the intra-incisive     fissure
 penetrated into the naso-palatine       canaL     Obviously, therefore,   some
 condition arising during the development of the bone determined
 the  origin and direction of the fissure in question.
    What is yet wanted, however, in order to give             completeness     to
 the evidence    of the division of the intermaxillary     bone into an inner
 and   an outer part, is the discovery that the intermaxillary             bone
 normally arises from two distinct centres of ossification, one for the
 inner, the other for the outer part.         Of this  there is at present    no
 evidence.      But, in connection with this matter, it ought not          to be
 forgotten that it is only recently that the embryological evidence of
 the  origin of   the intermaxillary    part of the human upper jaw, from
 a centre distinct from that of the superior maxilla, has been com
 pleted.    And    yet for nearly a century, on such       minor evidence      as
 was advanced by Goethe, viz., the suture on the hard palate extend-

 ing through      to the   nasal surface,      anatomists have          believed   and
taught that the human upper jaw represented                both the superior       and
intermaxillary      bones  in any other     mammal.        Where       a  question    in
 human embryology hinges upon an examination of parts in a                         very
 early stage of development, we often have               to wait     for many     years
 before an appropriate specimen         falls into the hands of          a  competent
 observer.

 4. Apparent        Lines of Force on passing a Current through
        Water.       By Thomas Andrews, F.K.S.E., F.C.S., Wortley
        Iron Works, near Sheffield.
    The author has recently been engaged               in  a   variety of electrical
observations in connection with wrought iron and steels, in the course
of which it occurred to him to investigate some of the effects produced
in the presence of nascent oxygen, of the ozone type, by a current
of sufficient strength to readily decompose these metals by oxidation
whilst   immersed     as electrodes   in distilled   water,     the great resistance
of the latter apparently facilitating          the interesting results observed
and recorded       below.    An    average    of ten determinations gave the
resistance   of the distilled      water   used as 48,234 ohms, and             in the
following experiments,       the current from forty small Leclanche cells
was employed.         The   current was passed         through       distilled   water
contained in    a  beaker (the distilled water was tested for impurities,
but was found free from everything except the faintest trace                        of
chlorides), using two round electrodes              of the same bright metal
YbVcr 'Ilch   diameter by      2  inches long, suspended          as   shown in the
sketch on page 20 (2 inches apart).               Hydrogen       was rapidly given
off at the kathode B, whilst there,              at first,   slowly     exuded from
the   anode    metal A, faint      clouds accompanied        by long fine streaks
of ferric hydrate, which gradually increased                in quantity       until in
about fifteen    minutes the whole of the water presented                 a yellowish
turbid appearance, and flocculent masses of oxides began to subside
(these    were   of course      reduced    to   protoxide      near     the   evolved
hydrogen from the other electrode B).              The circumstance, however,
to which the author desires to call attention is the seeming

indication of lines of force, during the electrolytic disintegration.
The film of oxides of iron (commencing to exude from the electrode
A) appeared gradually to                   arrange    itself into innumerable delicately
curved filaments or streaks, slowly extending in                           a general     horizontal
direction        from one electrode              to the other.           When    the bars were
 inclined towards               each    other, the filaments emanated                  in   greatest
 quantity from the nearest point,                    as  indicated in       the sketch.        After
 the current had passed some ten minutes, these became increasingly
  numerous, and were seen proceeding from most parts of A.                                     After
  a time, however, they became                      so interwoven          and complicated in
  character as ultimately to present                    the appearance         of thick streaky
  clouds, composed              of finely divided oxide of iron, but yet retained
  the distinct         aspect     of    a   broad current of this nature,                extending
   itself towards the other electrode B.

  metal      electrodes.         The current        was passed in each case             for a total
  period of sixty-five minutes.                  Every bar      was cleaned,      dried at 212°,

results   given     on    table   A.      The    kathode metals      lost nothing       in
weight.
   In the    case  of distilled water,        the loss   was from pure      oxidation
in  presence of the nascent oxygen.
   The generally curved contour of some of the outer streaks                        was
doubtless consequent on the mode of emission of the current                       from
the round surface          of the electrode,        influenced by the       resistance
effects of the distilled water.
   The     sketch    is   from    careful      drawings,    made   at   the   time    of
 observation,     and     gives   a    fair   representation,    though     the   lines
were    perhaps     not always         so   well   defined.     These effects were
obtained when using            distilled    water (possibly owing         to its very
great    resistance)    ;   when      the    salt   water    was   substituted      the
curved     streaks    were    not easily       distinguishable,    to   some    extent
owing    probably to the greater, and more               rapid oxidation,     and   the
much smaller resistance.            The mixed ferrous and ferric oxides in
this minute state of subdivision                appeared    to  manifest magnetic
properties,     the     polarised     particles acting       in  magnetic      fashion

    5. Note on        a  Theorem of Clerk-Maxwell.                By Prof. Tait.
     At   the last meeting of the Society         Sir W. Thomson         again raised
 the    question     of the validity of Boltzmann's Theorem, to which                I
 had    called attention two sessions       ago.     He expressed,      at the same
 time, some doubts as to Clerk-Maxwell's              Theorem (of which Boltz
 mann's is an extension) ;           doubts, however, confined to the proof
  given by Maxwell, not as to the truth of the theorem                 itself.   This
  theorem     is the extremely important one, that in             a  mixture of two
  kinds of particles the average          kinetic     energy    of the particles of
  each   kind is the      same.    The proof, as given in the Philosophical
  Ma amine for 1860, is so very condensed               as   rather to surprise the
  reader by the extraordinary         rapidity with which it seems to show
  that the final      average   is attained.     I  have, therefore, expanded       it
 so   that the nature of the approximation                to the average      may  be
  clearly traced.
     Lemma.      — The    mean value, of the square        of the distance     of any
 point on        a sphere from an internal or external point          A,  is the sum
 of the squares of the radius of the sphere and of the distance of                  A
 from the centre.
     The proof is immediate.           Divide   the spherical surface into pairs
 of elements by double cones, of very small angle,               whose vertices are
 at the centre.        For each pair of these the theorem         is obviously true.
     Hence     if the   speeds of two points be      p  and q, their mean      square
 relative speed is p1 + q*-

 an immense     number of impacts), we have

 shows    the somewhat      complex process       of   averages   by which    it  is
 obtained.
    The Corollary,     in which theproposition is extended           to a number
 of systems of different sets of particles, follows in the same way                 ;

but   it   specially requires            the   postulate (not, explicitly at least, alluded
to in                   that every pair of particles, to whichever set
           Maxwell's paper),
or sets they may belong, shall be perfectly free to collide.   It does
not follow that the extension would hold in cases where there is
any limitation to the freedom of collision, — such as is almost
certainly       the    case    when each particle of              a gas is treated     as a group
of    particles, or       as    a system        with    a considerably greater number of
 degrees of freedom than a free particle has.                          For    some of the con
 stituents of         each particle        may necessarily be so situated                   as    never
 to encounter         the corresponding constituents of another particle.
      In fact Boltzmann's generalisation of Clerk-Maxwell's                               Theorem,
 in which he           asserts      that ultimately            the energy is equally shared
 among all the degrees of freedom, would seem to be at once confuted
 by the collisions of smooth                   spheres,    where each has three degrees of
 (rotational)      freedom       to which no energy at all is communicated.

      (The following notice was sent                to tlie    General Secretary, from             the
                Office   of Messrs Hunter, Blair, and Cowan, W.S.)
      An     occurrence        of an extraordinary               nature   took      place        in the
 kitchen       of this house             on Monday             evening, the       8th inst         The
 kitchen is in the area, and whilst the office-keeper                         and his wife and
 servant girl were seated in front of the fire, suddenly, about twenty
 minutes past eight, a terrific rumbling                           sound was heard               in the
 chimney.         Fearing that something was about to topple about their
 ears,     they all sprang aside, and no sooner had they done so than a
 large     sheet of flame issued from the chimney, and without disturb
 ing the ashes in the grate, or touching the grate itself, swept closo
 past the office-keeper,              who was standing nearest to the fire-place,
 and extinguished              the gas.         Upon the        gas being relit, an extraordi
 nary state      of matters         was revealed.          The apartment was             611ed    with
 smoke       and dust, while the brick wall partition                         opposite      the fire
 place, and which              would be 12 to 14 feet distant from                        it,    was so
 greatly       injured that had   not been for the shelving with which
                                         it                                                              it
 was       lined in front, and which held    together,  would have fallen

 right out.       As     it   was   it   stood greatly off the perpendicular, and was

24                  Proceedings     of  the Royal Society
cracked and wrenched from its holdfast along the ceiling, and at
one part  it was bulged out as      if it had  been forcibly struck    by some
soft heavy bulky article.        There was no appearance of scorching, as
is generally the case when any object of an inflammable nature is
struck by lightning.       The vent, which is swept at regular intervals,
was swept shortly       before,   and was therefore comparatively         clean.
There is no iron bracketing at the top of the chimney.                "With the
exception of     the  partition, no other article        in the kitchen was
injured, or apparently touched.          The gas pipe runs across the roof
or ceiling   from the opposite wall towards the fire-place,             and the
pendant is about the centre of the apartment, rather nearer the fire
place than otherwise, but neither received any            injury, although the
gas was extinguished.         The evening was wet and boisterous, the
wind having     been   from the west or north-west, but a little before
the occurrence    the rain had passed off, and later on it became quite
clear, although there was evidently a good           deal   of moisture in the
air.

 8 a.m., was observed      here a very curious phenomena           in the sky,
 due south and about 45° from the earth ;            it looked like oil or tar
 poured on water, and had all the colours of the rainbow, pink and
blush being in the majority.         It was observed here for about twenty-
 five minutes half an hour before         daylight.    I   heard two peals of
 thunder, but saw no lightning, though we had lightning on Friday
night.    Saturday morning was fair, and          I thought we were to have
 a fine day, but at noon      it  commenced     raining, and continued until
late at night       This morning (Thursday)          I  observed    exactly the
same phenomena and at the same time,                and continued the same
length of time.       The   morning was beautiful,         but commenced      at
noon to rain, and is raining still (8 p.m.), but not heavy.            Was this

     Dear    Mr Buchan, —I                   wonder        if   any one has seen or noticed the
wonderfully beautiful                prismatic-coloured               clouds which             I   have seen
here on the mornings                    of       the 8th and 11th.                  This morning           was
especially       glorious about 8.30, rather                     a clear    sky, with heavy brown
clouds on the horizon,                  and some scudding along at                         a great        pace.
In   the    rifts behind these clouds,                    these white clouds appeared,                  — some
like    a   mountain range tipped with colours,                            — one enormous oblong
shape       formed itself           into     a       B, with pale blue in the middle;                      the
principal one in the zenith was a flat heart shape, the edges brightly
defined with the prismatic colours, and inside a gorgeous lake colour,
i.r., crimson. Sir William and I both saw           and were amazed.          it,

     My Dear Sir, —           I      enclose          a   rough sketch of           a    beautiful and,    I
think,      it   must be      a    remarkable phenomenon which                       I     observed        this
morning.         I    believe the same thing was seen on Monday morning
about the same time,                9   to 9.30 a.m., but          I   did not observe it.                 The
colours were remarkably fine, just like large sheets of fine mother-
o'-pearl, as      a       lady observed              when she saw them.                 The light spaces
were     almost clear of cloud apparently,                            and the sun was                   nearly
behind the coloured spaces.                          I     would     like    to know        if     you have
observed         the phenomenon in the country before.                                     Weather        very

minute anatomy, physiology, and development of Patella vulgata.
The paper aims at giving      a  complete account of this form in both       its
physiological and morphological aspects.          It treats, first of all, with
the external features and rough anatomy.           The epidermal system is
then treated in detail.      Some interesting modifications of the super
ficial epithelium     are  described.     The epithelial    cells are usually
elongated   columnar, with processes        connecting them with a dense
subepithelial   layer of connective tissue.        The attachment of the
circular  muscle    is covered    with modified epithelium, the epiblast
cells not being absent in that region, as is said to occur in the case
of the adductor muscles of Anodvn.             The modified epithelium        at
one spot near     the base of the tentacle functions        as an eye.      The
cells are there pigmented, and the cuticle is modified so as to form
a double layer,   with intervening trabecules.       The retinal epithelium
springs from   a  nerve plexus, which is supported by a mesh-work of
connective tissue fibres, with large lacunae.
    The arrangement of fasciculi in this muscular system points un
mistakably to the attachment of Patella to a rock, being the result
of muscular contraction and formation           of a vacuum beneath the
foot
   The muscle fibres     are non-striped, save   in the  heart.
   The gills  are morphologically       processes of the ventral surface      of
the mantle, which is itself physiologically an accessory respiratory
organ.    The epithelium      is in the mantle and gills columnar, and
the cells are not close to each other, thus permitting             of gaseous
exchange between them.

    Pactile  papillae, over one hundred           in number, are found situated
at intervals    along the edge of the mantle skin.              They lie in pockets,
which open on       the  ventral side of the skirt.            They are apparently
modifications     of those found        in Haliotis, and       may serve as organs
of  locality-sense.
    The observations of Lankester, Bourne, and Cunningham                      on the
renal system are confirmed, and in some respects extended.                         The
history of     the renal    epithelium     appears to be similar to that stated
by Von Jhering,        to be characteristic of the cells of the kidney of
 Tethys.      The    structure     and behaviour        towards     reagents   of   the
 epithelium of      the   right    and   left kidneys       is different, and     it    is
 suggested that the excretion of the two kidneys may be chemically
 distinct

 are   colourless,    and amoeboid.          Coagula      resemble     plasmodia       of

  2.   A   Theory of Solution.            By W. W.         J.  Nicol, M.A., B.Sc.
                                       (Abstract.)
    This   paper contained an account of the experimental                 evidence     in
 support of the theory of solution enunciated in a paper                   * " On    the
 Nature of Solution," communicated to the Society in January                     1883.
    Solution of     a salt  in  a  liquid is    a consequence      of the attraction
 of the molecules of the liquid, for           a molecule of the salt (adhesion),
 exceeding     the attraction of the molecules of salt for one another
 (cohesion).     As the number of dissolved salt molecules increases,
 the attraction of the molecules of liquid for the molecules of salt
 becomes more and more balanced by the mutual attraction of the
 salt molecules.      When     these two forces are      in equilibrium, saturation
 ensues.
     Increase of solubility with rise of temperature               is due to the      co
 hesion of the salt being diminished by heat to a greater extent than

  the adhesion        of the liquid to the salt        ;   and, conversely,      diminished
 solubility      with rise of temperature         is due     to  the cohesion being less
 affected by rise of temperature             than the adhesion.
      Evidence in support of the above                is obtained from          experiments
 on the following physical properties of salt                 solutions : —

     Further,       the solution     of two salts in water is governed                by the
 same laws as that of a single salt (when no                    double decomposition is
 possible)     :   the    solubility    of   both     salts    being increased      in most
 instances. IT         When      double    decomposition         is    possible,   then  the
 amount and nature of it is conditioned by the solubility of the
 possible salts and the strength of the solution.**
     The molecular volume of             a  salt in solution is       a quantity made up
of two constants, one for the metal, and another for the acid-radical.
It    follows from this, that the replacement                 of one metal by another
in combination with             an acid-radical is always attended             by the same
change        in    the   molecular     volume       of    the solution,       or generally,

     The presence or absence of water of crystallisation has no effect
on the above law : it therefore follows that it has the same volume
in solution        as   the solvent water.         Water      of constitution, however,
shows itself in solution by possessing                   a  volume markedly different
from water of solution.

 oldest      method      is to use        a valved-box       arrangement.      This method
  was devised         by Hooke more than two centuries ago, and until
  recently it was the only one employed.                         When descending, both
  the upper and lower valves (which open upwards) are kept open,
  and      the water         traverses      the arrangement.          On    pulling     up, the
   valves     close, and,        kept down by the pressure             of the water above,
   they preserve          the      enclosed     sample     unmixed.     A very ingenious
   apparatus of         this nature,         the   cistern thermometer of Sir Robert
   Christison,       was presented         to the Station ;      but although convenient
   in many ways,           it   has the defect of uncertainty           in action, and the
    result of a long series of trials decided me to employ other methods.
         It  was     tried     to   collect     deep samples      by sinking     a stoppered
    bottle to the required depth, and then pulling out the stopper by
     a  special line.       The two lines were frequently entangled,                  owing to
     currents making            the bottle rotate      ;   but although this could have
     been remedied,           in part at      least,  by fixing     the bottle     in   a frame
     provided with a vane-shaped                  attachment,     other considerations led
      to   the abandonment             of the method.           When the stopper titted
      closely,    the pressure       of the superincumbent            water prevented its
       withdrawal by any force less than sufficient to haul the bottle up
      again     in spite of a heavy lead attached to it; and when the
      stopper did not fit closely, water from intermediate depths found
      it3 way    in.
          The depths in the            Firth of Forth        are  too small    (only in      one
       place   coming up to 40 fathoms) to permit stopcock water-bottles
      to  be used, and the slip water-bottle was consequently adopted for
      general employment.
          The instrument hitherto used was constructed                  as an   experimental
      form for      Mr    Buchanan,        and it is about to be superseded               by an
      improved      apparatus on the same principle.

the    water-bottle is attached to the sounding line, which is wound
on a    drum worked by a small deck engine.    The line passes from
the    drum through leading blocks to the derrick, which is fixed so
as to   project over the port bow, and when a sample of water is to
be    obtained from the bottom or an intermediate depth, the water-
bottle has a 7 -lb. lead attached to                           it,   the stopcock       is   closed, and         a
little plug screwed in to prevent the entrance of mud should                                                    it

   A number of trials showed that when the slip came down did                                             it
not press sufficiently strongly on the india-rubber.   To remedy
this a heavy leaden ring was fixed to the slip, but the result
was that the edge struck the dome      so heavily that    was in d                               it
dented, and so left                  a     little channel between           the rim and the india-
 rubber.              Subsequently            it   has    been the habit,         after the           slip     has
 struck the body, to let down                            one or two of Captain               Eung's brass
 weights              (/,

 and press             it    firmly down.            Repeated trial and continuous use for
 several months have shown this manner of water-collecting to be
 satisfactory.

This   means     of putting     on the thermometer          is   a great     saving  of
time and trouble.           The thermometer has          been     found     to answer
admirably.
   When      each sample is taken the        following observations           are made
and recorded      : —
          Date.
          Hour of collection.
          Position by     bearings.
          Depth of water.*
          Depth from which sample was taken.
          Temperature of the water at that depth.
          Temperature of the air.
          Nature of the weather, wind, and state of the                sea.
          State of tide.
          Colour and transparency of the water.*
   The colour of the water is observed by sinking            a  disc of iron, painted
white, to the depth of a few feet or fathoms, according to circum
stances, and noting         its colour.    The transparency may be roughly
measured      by observing the distance to             which       the   disc remains
visible.
   It is important that the actual notes of all observations be pre
served   for future    reference   should uncertainty arise regarding them.
There are difficulties in doing this, for             it is not      easy on a    small
vessel   when there        is any sea on to       keep an ordinary           note-book
from getting wet, especially when              it is raining     ;   and turning    wet
pages    in   a   breeze is not easy.        I  have    employed a leather case
to hold a note-book, using one page for each set of observations, and
keeping it shut when not in           use.     The principal        objection to thia
is the unwieldy        size of the    case, and     I  now propose to use cards,
with memoranda of the observations               to be made         printed on them,
and kept in a similar though much smaller                 case.      As   each card  is
used   it   may     be slipped beneath the others,          as   is done in a date-
case.    The cards can be very easily kept in boxes, and may be
readily and rapidly referred to at any time.

                         2. Determination      of the Density.
    The density        of the samples      of water collected         in the firth is
 determined       by means of a very delicate hydrometer of the form
used on board the         "
                            Challenger."
    The hydrometer is made of glass, the tubes for body and stem
having been very carefully selected               to ensure      uniformity       of dia
meter.        The    instrument      has   a   body      of about      5     centimetres
diameter,      and   12 centimetres      long;      the stem is nearly the same
length, and has a diameter of 3 millimetres.                 The process of making
and calibrating the hydrometer has been described                     in    great   detail
by Mr Buchanan,              in his " Challenger Report             on the Specific
Gravity of         Ocean "Water"        {Chall.      Rep.    Phys.    Chem., vol.         i.
 pt iL   pp. 1-4).
   The hydrometer which             has been    used at the Marine            Station is
provided      with    seven    movable weights, which can be attached                    to
the top of the instrument, and thus adapt                 it for observing densities
of various     amount        The first four weights slip over the top of the
stem,    and    rest there, the others       are ring-shaped, and are used               to
supplement the weight            of the former.       The hydrometer weighs in
vacuo   150-1478 grammes.            The weights have the following values             : —
      L 4-0285               2. 3-2247           3. 2-4099             4.   0 8195
      5.   0-8125            6.  0-5184          7.   0 3312
   As each of the first four weights can be used with any or all of
the  remaining        three, and as,    with   a   little trouble, any of the last
three can     be balanced on the top of the stem by itself, the total
weight     of    the    hydrometer       may    be    varied    from      150- 1478      to
155-8384      through     36 gradations.
   The volume of the body and bulb of the instrument                        is 150-2070
cabic  centimetres at 0° C.           At  25° C.    it is  150-3210,    the volume of
the  100 millimetres          into which the stem is divided is 0'85 c.c.                   ;
and as    it is  assumed      to be uniform, the volume of each millimetre
of the stem      is taken   as 0*0085.
                                                                            " Ark," the
   Most of the density observations were made on the
floating     laboratory     of the Station.         As    she  is perfectly steady,
except    when there is        a  conjunction    of full tide and high wind, it
was  not necessary        to use a swinging      table.     The process of making
an  observation of the density is as          follows -.—

    A   tall glass jar, capable of holding            a litre, is rinsed out with        the
 water the density of which is to                  be   determined       and which       has
 the temperature         of the laboratory, and then filled up to the 800                c.c
 mark.         A   thermometer,        the  error of which is exactly           known, is
 hung       in   the    water,    read    after being immersed for              1  minute,
 removed        and the hydrometer           put in, sunk up to the top of               the
 scale,    1  centimetre from the top of the stem, and allowed to rise.
 A weight, sufficient          to   sink the instrument until not more                 than
 one-third of the stem is submerged,                  is then put on,         and after    it
 has come to rest, the scale is read               to half a millimetre.          Another
 weight is added,          so  that not less than two-thirds of the stem are
immersed;         after coming to rest the readings are taken, the weights
 removed,       the   hydrometer dried and replaced               in its box, and the
 thermometer again hung in the liquid for                  a  minute.       The tempera
 ture being        noted,    the   thermometer       is withdrawn,        and the water
poured back into the bottle.                  The whole operation occupies           about
ten minutes, and gives data for two distinct                  values     of the density.
The hydrometer is not read closer than to half                     a  division, although
with    care    it might    be taken to one-third.
    A table giving         the volume of the hydrometer at every tenth                    of
a degree        centigrade, from 0° to 25°, has been drawn up, and from
this table       the volume of the body at the observed                   temperature is
taken    ;    the   volume      of the stem immersed           is    got   from   a   table
which gives the            value for       each half-millimetre        from    0  to   100.
These added          together give the immersed volume, and the weight
being        taken     from    another table       and    divided      by    this volume
gives the       density at     the   observed temperature.           The mean of the
two densities is taken, and reduced from the mean                             of the two
corrected      observed     temperatures      to 15°-56 C. by means of Dittmar's
table   (Chall.     Rep. Phys. Chem., vol. i. pt. i. p. 70).

      Omitting        the       exceptionally          high discrepancy of                      IV.   the differ
ence as a mean                  of three results is 0-000028, and even including
it, it   does not touch the fourth place.
      To form an idea of the reliance                               to be placed on the hydrometer
readings, all those                   cases (164           in number) in which the weights
1   and 1+7 were used in consecutive determinations                                              of one water,
were        investigated and             classified.               Temperature does not appear to
affect the differences.
      Let  r   be the reading with weight                            1,   and   r'   with weights         1   and   7
in the      same water, then, as these weights can only be used for water
of nearly the same density, in                        a     perfect hydrometer perfectly read
r-r'     should be          a    constant, and in an actual instrument                                read        with
ordinary        care        the       mean    of      a    sufficient           number of observations
should approximate very closely to the constant.                                                 In   164 cases
r-r        had the following values —                 :

      The mean of all the values                      is   36-5.          Hence out of 164 cases —
               49, or 29-9 per cent., differed from the mean by                                        0

      Here the maximum variation from the mean                                        is   1-5, while nearly
84 per cent,           of the observations showed                               a    deviation no greater
than 0-5.
      0"5 of   a   division of the hydrometer corresponds to a difference                                           in
density of 0*00003 in the case of                              a   sample of sea water of ordinary
density,        while           1*5    division           is    equivalent            to   a     difference         of
0-00009, the temperature being the same.
      The four triple determinations                            of distilled water give the total
error as 0-000066 as                    a    mean         of the whole, and in all cases the
variations were in the same direction.
      As     stated        in     describing          the method,                each      determination            of
density        was     made           in duplicate,                 and the results independently
worked out.                 The two densities obtained in this way invariably
differed, that obtained when the greater part of the stem was im

      The mean of all these discordances                       is 8-4, but omitting the 14-2 per
 cent, over         1  2, as being probably due to careless readings, the mean
 becomes 6-9.               In    order to take the least favourable view of the case,
 the higher number                  will    be considered,         and as the mean of the two
  observations           was always taken for the correct density, this discordance
  is reduced        to    4 '2 as deviation from the mean.
      It   is not allowable             to change this 4           -2 as  error, since it is always
 positive,        and since          the amount of         it    is roughly proportional          to the
 difference between the length of stem immersed by the addition of
 the    second weight, and more nearly proportional to the number of
 the   reading.            The last horizontal line of the preceding table shows
 that     (omitting        8   - 8' = 4, and = 10 on          account of the small number of
 cases) the percentage                 of readings over 80 increases, roughly speaking,
 as  the discrepancy increases.
     The reason of              the difference       may be that the stem of the hydro
meter         is slightly conical, instead of being truly cylindrical,                                  as
assumed.              It   might also be that the weight of the brass pieces was
not correctly              known,         but a careful reweighing                showed that this
was not so.                  Capillarity should act equally in each                          case, and
need        not    be considered.               The    only remaining           explanation which
suggests        itself is the           difference     in weight produced by the film of
water adhering to the part of the stem above                                 the surface.      To test

    Here the adhering film of water produced a sinking of the hydro
 meter of from 0"5 to 2-5 millimetres, according to the length of ex
posed stem.         This is an error wbich is practically negligible when
the reading is less than 30, but rises to a serious amount when it ia
greater than 80.
    Taking     2-0 mm. as the amount of             sinking produced by the film
of water when the stem reading is over 80, and since the sinking
produced by weight No.              7 (0-3312 grammes)            is on an average 36-5
(see page 38) the weight of the water is

In water sample No. 250(1) the reading                   was     80 and the calculated
density    1 -02734.      Supposing the scale to have been wet, and adding
0-01814 grms.        to the weight of the hydrometer, the density comes
out as 1-02746, an increase of 0-00012.
    Here there is a sufficient explanation of the discrepancy increas
ing with the value of         the reading ; and since            in  each case the mean
of the determination when the stem was almost all out of the water,
and that when the stem was almost entirely                         immersed,       and when,
consequently the error from the attached film was reduced to almost
nothing, the uncertainty of a determination (from this cause) is re
duced by a half, and comes to be 0 00006, exactly 0-00002 more
than that brought out by the discussion of the 204 discrepancies
without consideration of their           cause.      The reason of this, assuming
the above explanation to be correct, and considering that 0 00006 is

                        of Edinburgh, Session 1884-85.                              41
    the value    of  an extreme      case, reading over 80 and weight            7, is
    obvious;    as generally    the reading is under 80, and when over it
    weight 6 is   usually employed        as an addition which immerses          more
    of the stem.      Had    the scale    been    always used when dry greater
   accuracy could be expected        ;  but, on the other hand, it must not be
   supposed that     the weight of the film of water was always equal to
   D-0181 + gnn.,    for often the reading        was not taken    until  the greater
   part of the water     carried up had run down again.
       The occurrence of the maximum deviation from the correct reading
   (To    mm.)  in the same direction         as  the increase   due to the water
   film in an extreme      case would certainly affect the fourth place to the
   extent of 1,   but the probability of such an event happening is very
  small, and the sum and difference            of the effects of the error of read
  ing    and the     mean error due to the water film              are   respectively
  0-00007 and 0-00001.
      The result of the discussion is that the discrepancies            between    the
  two observed       densities of one sample of water are accounted               for,
  perhaps    not   fully, but satisfactorily, in       so much that     it is beyond
  question that the hydrometer            gives   results which for the purposes
  of comparison        are rigorously     correct to the fourth decimal place.
  It   also shows     that by taking further precautions greater             accuracy
  may be    reasonably looked for.
                          3. Determination        of Alkalinity.
      Sea water has an alkaline          reaction which is supposed         to be due
 to the presence       in solution of    carbonates,   and especially of carbonate
 of lime.      The   measurement       of the alkalinity is then     a measurement
 of the amount of dissolved carbonate.
     It  is determined by Tornoe's method, boiling with dilute hydro
chloric     acid and titrating the excess with potash, using aurine as an
indicator.
     Practically 250 cc. of the water            are measured    in  a flask, poured
into a porcelain basin, a few drops of neutral aurine solution added,
15    cc   of standard hydrochloric acid run in from             a burette, and the
whole heated over a large spirit-lamp for from twenty to twenty-five
minutes.       It usually    boils for from ten to fifteen minutes.        The excess
of free acid is then determined by means of potash, the red colour
of alkaline       aurine being dispelled           by  a  few drops of acid, and

 42                        Proceedings       of the  Royal Society
 restored      by potash        until   the   end point is closely defined.              Each
 burette reading is taken down on a card,                         aud the result       copied
 into the       Laboratory       Book.       The   cards     are    preserved     for future
 reference      if  necessary.
      The standard acid and alkali were at first made up to be of the
 strength of            normal, i.e.,        x 36-5 grms. of hydrochloric acid, and
 ¦j'j  x 56 grms.       of potassium hydrate per litre, so that                 1 c.c might
 correspond to         1  milligram of carbonic acid
      It  was, however, found to be more                 economical of time to make
 up an acid roughly approximating                   to the desired strength, and to
 determine         its    chlorine      very   carefully     by    titration    with silver
 nitrate.      The potash was made equivalent to the acid.
      Two solutions of hydrochloric acid have                   been used     for the work
described here.            The first was found by the mean of five concordant
experiments to have              1  cc    equivalent to 1-007 c.c of the potash
used.        More than        5  cc. of potash        is never used,       except in very
exceptional cases, and as the burette is not read closer than 0*05                         cc.
the difference         between    5 "00   and 5-03 is considered negligible               The
 mean of the experiments              with the     second     acid solution gave        1  c.c.
of acid as equivalent             to 0'990 c.c of alkali,          and this also is taken
as    equality.      The error of considering the two acids as equal is only
introduced         in the titration        of the excess,        the quantities      of acid
used being reduced separately according to the amount of chlorine
found in them by analysis.
      Trustworthiness       of the Method. — A          large   number of experiments
were       made    on the same samples            of water,       both for the sake          of
practice and in order to arrive at the probable uncertainty                          of each
experiment.
      The    following      tables    (III.   and    TV.) give particulars of           these
determinations,           and    of    the corresponding           deviations     from     the
mean.
      If  the five cases out of the thirty-five                in which the deviation
exceeds Oo be omitted, as probably due to mistakes or misread ings,
the mean deviation is reduced to 0*24.
      It  is probable that 0°2 may be nearer                the truth, as      it was never
the      practice to filter the water before determining                   the alkalinity,
and after the            bottle had stood in the laboratory                 for a day or
two, the 250           cc    decanted      off was tolerably free from suspended

 particles; while,                      when four or five determinations were made on
 water contained                       in a bottle, each quarter litre would contain more
 sediment than the one before,                                 and a minute shell makes a distinct
 increase           in the alkalinity.                       Looking         at the eight               cases     epitomised

in the preceding table                              (III.),        where      three         or more determinations
were made                  on one water, it is evident that in four (a,                                          c, e,    and k),
the later            determinations show an increased alkalinity.
     The quantity represented                                by an alkalinity is very small, although
the       number used                     to       express          it is     large.         An alkalinity                 of 50,
means              that in a litre, say 1026 grammes, there is                                            0 05    gramme              of
carbonic acid as calcium carbonate ; that                                          is,   a   percentage of           0-   00487        ;
which, taking the worst view of the inaccuracy of the determina
tions, might vary from 0-00498 to 0-00476.
  In the discussion of                              the alkalinity               of the Firth of Forth in this
paper,             the integral figures                      may be viewed as correct,                           the decimal
part being uncertain.
     It        would impart                  a     greatly increased                certainty to the figures                          if
the water                   had always                 been          filtered      before           the    alkalinity            was
determined, and                         if       duplicate analyses                were         invariably          made and

 the rigorous zigzag        system    of titration    adopted.        This will     be
 done   in future.
     A   great   many determinations        of   the chlorine,      or rather total
 halogen, present in the samples of sea water were made, but, from
 various causes, the probable error of each experiment was so large
 as to render the results useless         for the purpose of detecting the
 difference    between the ratio of salinity to density in estuary water
 and in ocean water.         For this  reason the figures are not published.
     The density of the water may             be   taken    as   an index     of   its
 salinity, although     there are no data available for interpreting each
density into its corresponding percentage             of total salts.     This can
only be done in the case of ocean water proper, for which                      tables
have been constructed by several chemists.*
                    II. Results of Preliminary Work.
                          1.  Notes   of Previous Work.
     In 1816    Dr John Murray        read a paper to     this Society "On the
Composition       of Sea Water," the samples         which he analysed being
taken from the Firth           of Forth near      Leith.     The    paper (Trans.
Roy.     Soc.   Edin. for     1816) contains results of great theoretical
value, which were         instrumental in modifying the theory of the
existence of salts       of different    bases and     acids in solution,        and
which altogether changed the            mode of analysis      of sea and    mineral
waters.       Attention     was    given    more    particularly     to  the    solid
constituents, and no observations seem to have been made by                       Dr
Murray on the variations in salinity at different parts of the              firth
    Dr John Davy published         a paperf   in 1843, " On the Temperature
and Specific Gravity of the Water of the                Firth of Forth"          He
examined the temperature and density of the water at the end                       of
Leith Pier on eight       occasions,   at intervals of about a        month      His
entire observations are reproduced in table (V.).
    It was Davy's intention to continue the monthly observations                  for
a number of years, but he had to leave              Edinburgh an(l they were
stopped.       Since   no    particulars   as  to   how     the    densities    were

     Dr Stevenson Macadam investigated the salinity of the Firth of
  Clyde in 1855.*               He observed the specific gravity at more than
  fifty places, and determined               the total solids and chlorine in each.
   He found       that between Bowling and Renfrew                   there     was a change
   produced by the tide between high and low water equal                              to that
   discerned in a distance of five miles along the firth at low water.
       In subsequent investigations             he examined the       Firths of Cromarty
   and   Inverness.         The results are recorded in the Proceedings of this
   Society   for 1866.t
      Professor      Kyle of Buenos Ayres             made some observations in 1874
  on the    River Plate, in         the same way as        Dr   Macadam       on the Clyde.
  I   am    indebted         to    Mr F. Newman for            a  translation     of Kyle's
  Spanish pamphlet             (Algunos datos sabre la composirion de lag aijuag
  del   Bio   de    la Plata), and for         a chart of the Plate, with          the water
  sampling stations.
     The results         brought out by Professor Kyle are interesting, but
  like the other observers            cited above, he neglects to mention whether

his specific  gravities are        reduced    to  0°,  to 4°,  or to    15°-56,    or
whether water at 0°, 4°, or 15°-56                was   taken  as   unity.    It is
therefore  impossible to consider the results except           as  purely  relative
to the estuary    in question, and       no comparison between        the different
investigators can be made.
   The Cattegat,     Skager Rack, Baltic, and north-eastern parts                  of
the   North   Sea,   have     been made the subject of very careful             and
prolonged examination            by various Danish       and German scientific
workers.     Water    samples       have been taken regularly for a        numbe    r
of years at various points along the coasts, and from lighthouses
and lightships at considerable distances            from land.     The results    of
the examination of these samples, from 1872 to 1881, is tabulated
in conjunction with        the meteorological conditions,         especially   with
respect to rainfall,     in a    recently issued paper by the Commission          in
Kiel for the Scientific Investigation of          the German Seas.*
    The general    low densities of these waters, and the variations              to
which they are subject, make              the conditions which obtain         there
not   unlike   those   in    an    estuary,   but   they are in general        more
complicated and difficult of investigation.
    While it is fully realised that it will take            years of consecutive
observations to thoroughly settle the relations of the fresh and salt
water in an estuary          ;    and that many conditions,          such as the
currents, law of the tides, and rainfall over the area drained by the
principal river and its tributaries, must be taken into account,               it is
considered   expedient to state the results observed in the six months,
from    June   to   December         1884,   on the Firth     of Forth.      These
results are    purely preliminary,          but as little attention has        been
given to such matters hitherto, they may prove of interest, and may
lead to suggestions     for improvements in the methods of carrying on
the work.
                               2.  The  Firth of Forth.
    The River Forth rises in the valley between Ben Lomond                      and
Ben    Venue, is joined         near  Stirling by the Teith, and gradually
merges into the Firth of Forth, the precise point at which the river

                            of Edinburgh,         Session 1884-85.                                        47
ends and the firth begins being a matter permitting of difference of
opinion.  Probably the best plan is to view the river as ending at
Queensferry, but for convenience the term Firth of Forth may be
applied       as   describing        the river and firth proper from Alloa to the
Isle of May, a distance of 55 miles.                      According to Keith Johnston,
the area      drained by the Forth is 500 square miles.       Few large
rivers    flow into the firth, those of any importance are, on the north
side the      Black Devon at Clackmannan, and the                         Leven at Leven             ;    on
the south side          there       are   the Carron at Grangemouth, the                    Avon a
few miles further east, the Almond at Cramond, the Water                               of Leith
at Leith, the     Eek at Musselburgh, and the Tyne near                           Dunbar.   All
these,     together with the numerous small burns, are                                  represented
on the chart        (Plate III.), which          also shows the depth of the water in
the firth.
    From       Alloa the depth of the water is under                         10 fathoms             until
 within three           miles of          Queensferry, where         it     increases      at        first
 gradually,        then, at the Bamer           Beacon,    abruptly to over 30 fathoms,
 and close to         Inchgarvie to over         40.     This is   the deepest          part of the
 firth, and the narrowest.                 A   very strong tide runs in the channels
 on each       side   of Inchgarvie.           The deep water is confined to                   a   small
 area,    and       the 10 fathom           stream     runs along the northern                     shore
 until off         Kirkcaldy, where it widens out in                   a funnel         shape            and
 approaches           the   coast   on each side.         There is a short tract over 10
  fathoms      to the south of Inchkeith known                      as     the Narrow              Deep.
  Severalsmall depressions of more than                      20 fathoms occur between
  Queensferry and Inchkeith, and a little                    to the east of that island
  the 20      fathom        area begins as a narrow stream trending                      northward
  and    spreading out off Largo.                The Isle of May is connected                      to the
 mainland           of Fife by       a submerged        plateau    rising to less than 20
  fathoms          from the     surface,       and about     4    miles east        of the           May
  depths beyond 30 fathoms commence.
    A line drawn              from Aberlady            Bay to Largo divides               the firth
  into two very different halves.                 To the west of           it,   the slope of the
  bed    is   extremely gradual and the depth slight               ;      to the east of           it,   the
  shore slopes        down abruptly, and the bed of the firth                     is,   with       one or
  two    insignificant exceptions, uniformly over 20 fathoms in depth.

             3.     Observations         on the Surface               Salinity in          the   Firth.
     It   is assumed that the amount of total salts may be deduced                                                  from
the density as           if    estuary     water were ocean water, diluted with                                  pure
water.        The assumption is that the percentage                                    composition             of the
total salts is the same as regards                              their constituents, whether                          the
water yielding them contain                               1    or 4       per   cent.        The          constancy
of composition for ocean water was shown in 1865 by Forchhammer
to be       highly probable,           and      the researches of Torn0e, Schmelk,                                   and
other       chemists          of    the Norwegian                     North     Atlantic              Expedition,
crowned           by    Professor          Dittmar's             exhaustive            discussion              of    the
" Challenger "           waters, have established it as a definite certainty.
     This    cannot be the case                 with estuary water,                   as   the salts           carried
down by rivers are in quite different proportion to those found                                                        in
the sea, and before the processes occurring there have                                               had time          to
produce           uniformity         of composition               ;    that     is,    where          river water
predominates,            the       proportion of the salts among                           themselves               must
vary.        Consequently, until exact experiments can be made on this
point, the interpretation                  of estuary densities by ocean-water                                  tables
must be taken with reservation.
     To get       a   preliminary view of the rate of freshening in the                                             Firth
of Forth,      it      was determined            in       September           1884 to make             a   monthly
trip for collecting water                  samples            from the entire firth              ;     and on the
18th of September the                      "Medusa"                   proceeded        from Inchkeith to
Grangemouth for that purpose.                                 Surface samples              were taken every
five      miles     (the positions are marked                          on the         chart),        and       bottom
samples at each alternate                   station.            Observations were made both in
going and in returning,                      and       they are represented                      on the small
diagram       A (Plate IV.),             the former as           a    dark, the latter           as   a   light line.
     The tide was             |    Hood at       Inchkeith            ;   at Grangemouth, where                       we
turned,      it    was two hours ebb             ;        and    on the return to                Inchkeith           was
J    ebb.     The weather was fine, but hazy throughout;
  The intention to make the complete tour of the firth in one day
had to be reluctantly relinquished, and the Inchkeith to May
section       was       completed          on    the          25th.       Inchkeith         was        reached         at
 10.30       a.m.      with    I     ebb     tide, and          a     strong south-westerly breeze.
Surface samples                were      taken at             the Stations marked on the chart
VIII., IX.,            X.,    and   XI.         At    the       May the tide was             f        iiood,    and    a

                         of Edinburgh,       Session 1884-85.                            4f>
south-westerly       breeze      rising to     a  gale,    which increased         towards
evening,     prevented water          samples being obtained at Stations               IX.,
VIII.,    and   VII. returning.           This trip   showed      that the density of
the water samples          decreased steadily, gradually, and uniformly from
the    May to the Oxcar Beacon (V.), but                   that the change then be
came more        rapid, the curve resembling            a   portion of    a   rectangular
hyperbola.        The weather for the previous few weeks had been dry
and warm.
     On October       7,  water     samples    were taken      to and from the May
 from 8          to 7 p.m.        The weather     was fine      but dull, and the       sea
 smooth.      It was low water at Station            VIII.     going, and high water
 at Station    XL returning.
     Next day the      " Medusa " went        to Alloa, in rain, slight mist, and a
 north-easterly breeze.           Water    samples    were     taken    as    before.    It
 was low water at         Inchgarvie (Station V.) going           up, and high water
 at the same      place returning.
     The water,     beautifully clear and transparent, and of a deep green-
 blue colour at the May, became light green and less transparent
 about Inchkeith, and from Inchgarvie onwards it was yellow and
  very muddy.
      The curve     for this trip (Plate IV., B)          is less regular, but of the
  same general      shape as the previous one.
      The November           trips were    made on the 10th and            11th of the
  month.      For the previous week or two              there had been high wind
  and much      rain, and the rivers had been flooded               heavily, but were
  then subsiding.          The 10th, when the eastern half of the firth was
  traversed,   was    bright, clear, and calm.          The shortness        of daylight
  prevented     the yacht from getting further than Station X., at which
  point it was     low   water.      On the  1 1th it was dull, with        a  stiff south
  easterly breeze.        It  was high water at Station        VI.  going up, and low
  water at    Station V. coming down.             The river was greatly flooded,
  and the    curve (Plate TV., C) is irregular, and much more abrupt than
   the  others.     The reading of the density at Station TV. going up
  seems    too low, but there is no reason to suspect its accuracy.                    The
   influence   of the flooded        streams   may   be traced       by  a  lowering      of
   density   down     to Station       IX.   The effect      of this " spate "      was to
   reduce   the density at Inchgarvie          from 1-02382        to 1-02029, that at
   the  Oxcar Beacon from the mean of 1-02438 to 1-02022, that at
       vol. xm.                                                                   D

Inchkeith from 1-02472          to 1-02403,     and those     at Stations        VIII.
and    IX. from 1-02505 and 1-02518                to   1-02458 and          1-02508
respectively.
    The December trip        did not take     place   till the 25th, when            my
friend Mr T. Morton Ritchie was good enough to take charge                       of  the
eastern excursion.       The day was fine, with        a  north-easterly breeze,
and   a  slight swell.     The tide was two hours ebb at Station                  VII.
going, and one hour flood at the same place returning.                On the      27th
the yacht started for Alloa, but the morning, which was hazy, gave
place   to a day of fog, and         it was   impossible     to proceed        beyond
Inchgarvie.      The 29th and 30th were also misty, and                this portion
of the trip had, very reluctantly, to be dispensed with.
   The curve D (Plate IV.) shows that the water had returned to
its former value after the diluting effect of the floods of November.
   The effect of the tide obscures the changes of salinity to               a  certain
extent in these monthly cruises, but although the data are so few
they are sufficient to show that between           Inchkeith and        the    Isle of
May the tidal effect is relatively slight, and the variations in density
very gradual, though perceptible;          while from Inchkeith to Alloa the
tidal   effect  increases    with every mile, and          the    rate   of change
becomes     more   and more rapid.          Tables    VI.   and    VII.     give    the
figures observed     in these consecutive trips.
    In order   to make some       attempt at neutralising        the influence       of
tides, the   mean was taken of all the observations made                 since   June
at each of the Stations.        These were made at all states of the tide,
and in all weathers       that the yacht could stand, and although they
are   not very numerous, and do not extend over more                    than seven
months,     they give some        idea   of the alteration      in salinity       with
position.
   The means are embodied in the diagram (Plate V., E), on which
the calculated amount of total salts is also represented.                  It plainly
shows that the parts of the firth to which least attention has, as yet,
been given, those west of      Inchkeith,    are the most deserving of study,
for there the changes are large and rapid.
    The maximum, minimum, and mean                  density observed          at  each
Station, together with the number of cases which give the mean,                     are
tabulated.     (Table VIIL)

     An examination of Table                              VIII.        shows that for maximum                                      and
minimum, as well as for mean observed densities, the increase                                                                           is
perfectly continuous                     until the last Station                          is reached, when the
maximum density is only probably greater than that at Station                                                                      XI.,
the minimum                  is certainly less than that at Station                                       VIIL,          and the
mean        is less than that at Station                               IX.       It    is not easy to find an
explanation of this fact, for there is no river nearer than the Tyne
at Dunbar,                and there            are no           springs on the                     Isle       of    May,            the
lighthouse keeper being compelled to get his fresh water all carried
from CraiL                 It    is,   of course, possible that there may be some sub
marine springs near the island, but no indication of this                                                          is   given by

the surface.              It is   also     a  curious fact that four samples of water
from       the      firth beyond the Isle of May                             had       a mean         density of
102514, scarcely greater than that at Station                                       XII.,      and distinctly
less   than that at Station                 IX.      The samples at the Isle of May were
all collected,           as   it happens, during              flood tide          ; so that no current of
 the ebb           carrying fresh water              can be called in to account                           for the
 observation.              It    would almost seem               as    if   the densities hinted at a
 maximum             about Station          IX. with        lower densities on each side                         ;  if
 the water           of the Firth of Tay is                fresher         than that of the Firth of
  Forth a ready explanation suggests itself.
      In    consequence           of the way in which water-sampling trips                                     were
  conducted,            there were        some Stations where                     the two samples were
  drawn          at    opposite     phases of the tide.                   Inchkeith           and Inchgarvie
   were usually in that position.                        Table         IX.       shows        what difference

noticed, in fact the water is found to be sometimes denser at                                                     a lower
state of tide.              This    effect may be due                     to currents, which                 were          not
taken account of in this preliminary                                       investigation.              The rate                 of
change of density with the                          tide decreases very rapidly at first                                    At
Kincardine,             the difference             touches          the second               place    of decimals ;
calling the density of pure water 10,000, it is 100, at Inchgarvie                                                              it
is about 15, at             Inchkeith         4,   and beyond Inchkeith about                              1 ;    that is,
1    in   the fourth decimal place by ordinary notation.
      The temperature observations made on the monthly trips                                                           have
not been alluded                to here       ;    they are intended                         to   form a separate
paper.        It     was      found, speaking generally, that                                     in summer                the
temperature of the surface water was highest at Alloa, and steadily
fell      as the    Isle of May was approached                                ;   the    rate of     fall becoming
more and more gradual.                        In        winter this state of affairs is inverted.
The water at Alloa is the coldest, and the temperature rises more
and more gradually towards the May.                                       The difference              also is          much
greater between the summer                          and winter temperatures                           at Station            I.
than at Station              XII.       For       example,          at Queensferry (Station                      V.), on
July       31, the       surface temperature                  was f>8°'2 Fahr., on December                                27
it    was    41°-2 Fahr.,           a   range           of    17°       Fahr.          At     the    May, on           June
11, the surface              temperature was 50°-l Fahr., and on December 25,
within six miles of                the May,         it       was 43°-8, a range of 6°-3.
      The change of temperature                          produces             a    corresponding change                    in
the       density of the water in situ, which has important                                               bearings         on
convection          currents, and              which           must also                 influence the rate of
mixture of sea and river water, especially                                        as   the temperature                of the
river water          is,    in winter, usually below that of its maximum density.

the western          side, and at high water                        it   is       continuous with the firth
for   a   considerable breadth.                     At low water                  the channel        is   dry, and in
front of     it    is   a   broad tract of sand extending out to Cramond Island,
The River Almond flows into the firth just to the west of Cramond
island, at low               water.      It        is    about           two miles distant                  from        the
quarry.

                               of Edinburgh, Session 1884-85.                                                         55
   A      sample of water was taken at the quarry mouth at high                                                  w   ater
daily,    with such interruptions,                            sometimes            of considerable duration,
as were       to     be expected at the                        first starting of             a   piece of routine
work not absolutely necessary,                                with      a small staff.
   In July           only three samples                        were taken,             owing to a trip of the
"Medusa "on                   the       Clyde;          their densities varied from 1-02454                           to
1-02469.
   In August             there          were 21 occasions                 on which water was collected
at the entrance,               13 at         high water, and             8 at     low water.           The mean for
 the low water was                  1   -02464,         the extremes          1   -02478 and       1   -02435.       The
 only     case of special               interest is one on the 12th.                          On that day there
 was a        severe      thunderstorm with exceedingly heavy rain for several
 hours.        In        the middle               of    it,   during low water, when the quarry
 was land-locked,              a    bottle was filled holding its mouth just under the
  surface, and another at                     a   depth of six inches.                    The result was that
  the extreme surface layer of water                                    was found to have              a   density of
  1-02394, the other                    of 1-02405,           a     difference      of 0-00011.            The high
  water figures differed only from 1-02405                                    to   1   02496, the mean being
   1-02461.
        During September 21 samples                                were taken at the quarry entrance
   at     full tide      ;   the mean density was                         1   02446, the extremes                being
   1-02487 and            1-02296.
         During this month                    a   sample           was taken up daily for some time
   at    low water        at   a    rock on the shore near the quarry.                                     The mean
   density     (12 observations)                       was    1-   02461, the extremes                 1-02506       and
   1-02378,     all higher than those at high water.                                          The peculiarity of
   this    result    is      emphasised                when the curves               are consulted, for there
   low tide         is    seen          to    produce         a     lower       density beyond             Inchkeith
   occasionally.
        In October four samples                           only were collected             ;      the mean density
  was 1-02319,               the extremes being                    1-   02391      and   1   02193.
        During November the density was determined on nine occasions                                                    ;
  the mean          was 1-02313, the highest 1-02390, and the lowest 1-02035.
        In December              samples           were taken             with     greater regularity.            They
  gave    a   mean        of 1-02052, with                    extremes        of   1   -02449     and      1   00969 in
  26 samples.
       The figures for November and December are plotted in curve                                                      G
  (Plate V.), which shows the great irregularities that were observed.

     It will     be noticed by the dotted curve              (Plate V.,      H) that since
July       the density has been continuously               diminishing,        though      the
larger curve shows           that the diminution           is very far from          regular.
On the 20th and 21st the surface water was almost                            fresh,   indeed
ice     formed over        the   whole      quarry at low water,             although      the
temperature         by a  continuously immersed minimum thermometer                        did
not fall below 32° Fahr.              The bulb of this thermometer was              3  inches
below the surface          ;  and   as    there was a difference        of over     3°  Fahr.
between         the  temperature       at the depth of       6    inches,   and when       the
bulb was just covered, at             a time   when the surface          temperature      was
34°,     it  is probable that the extreme           surface   layer was considerably
colderthan the minimum thermometer                    showed.        The ice was about a
centimetre        thick, the upper third was hard, smooth, transparent, and
quite free from air-bubbles, while the lower part was very spongy,
seemingly composed of successive horizontal lamina; with water spaces
between.          Part of the ice collected was washed with distilled water,
allowed to drain, then melted,                 and    the    chlorine      determined by
titration :—

     It   is unfortunate that, owing to arrears               of work       consequent       on
 illness,     I did  not determine       the density of the water collected            on the
 20th and 21st until the 25th.                The two bottles had in the interim
 been frozen solid during a cold night (22nd)                  ;   they were found next
 morning with the cords securing the stopper burst, the stoppers lying
 on the table at a little          distance,    and   the ice protruding          above    the
 neck of each.         On the 25th the water in the quarry was                     as  salt as
 usual, and of course it was too late to ascertain                     to what depth the
 freshening on the two days had extended.
      It  was suggested that the infiltration            of fresh water from springs
 might lower the density of the surface water in the quarry, and                              so
 account for the peculiar temperature                  phenomena        which have been
  observed there,* but on the 20th and 21st, and for several days before
  and after, all the sides of the quarry were sheathed                    in ice, the tem
  perature      of the air was below the freezing             point, and, of course,          at
  the time of sampling the tide was full.                 At low tide in August             the
  water     in  the quarry was almost always found a little Salter than at
                              *

high water, showing the effect of evaporation to be greater than that
due to springs.
    On the 30th December the density                         was ascertained           at several
points at the time of high water, with the result that near a spring
which falls into the quarry it              was a    little lower than         at the entrance
on the surface, and distinctly lower than at the bottom of the quarry",
while half a mile outside in the firth the water was Salter than near

     A   probable      explanation of the freshness             of the quarry surface
 water     at times is that the River Almond when in flood, or whether
wind is in certain directions, dilutes the water along the shore to the
east    of  it     This would also account for the water near the quarry
 being denser at low tide, for then the Almond runs into the firth on
 the west of Cramond Island, and so carries                  its freshening influence
 in another direction (see Plate III.).
     A number of glass floats, coloured distinctively,                      were    thrown
 into the Almond on several occasions                just at the turn of the tide,
 immediately        after high water, but none of them                  were seen again,
 though all the boys         of the   neighbourhood         were     on the alert along
  the shore, a small reward having been offered for each float found.
                        5.   The Bottom Water of          the  Firth.
     As   there    was    considerable time lost in devising and testing                     a
  suitable means       of collecting     samples     of bottom       water, the     number
  of cases   for consideration     is small.
     It  may    be generally      stated,    that the part of the            firth   east  of
  Inchkeith     is the region where the difference                between     the density
  of  surface     and     bottom    water is least,        and that the          difference
  decreases   steadily towards the May.              Towards Alloa,         on the      other
  hand, the     differences in the density between                 surface   and     bottom
  water are great,      but they are greatly influenced by the tide.
     Table   XII.    gives details of      19   comparisons      between      bottom and
  surface  water.
     At the Hen and Chickens Buoy, off Grangemouth, the depth                               is
 only   5£    fathoms,      but the     salinity    is very much greater             at   the
 bottom     than at the surface.            The difference       is   least observed       at
low water,       but   as  the flood tide sets in       it  appears      to increase, and
then to     fall off   again as the ebb commences.               The only divergence
from     this rule noticed         was     on   November         11, when       the    rivers
were    all much      flooded, and the current very rapid.               It would     appear
that these observations confirm the theory that                       sea water     ascends
rivers along the bottom under the opposite                  current of fresh water.
    At Inchgarvie,           where    there    is   a   deep     depression       (over 40
fathoms)       in the middle of      the stream, the bottom              water   is always
much       Salter    than    that  at    the   surface,    and the        result   is most
noticeable      at low water.       The difference is usually like that between

                             of Edinburgh, Session 1884-85.                                                   61
1-0240           at the   bottom and           1   -0220 at the surface.                 On November          11
the bottom              density was 102476 at low water, the surface was only
1   '01 583, a difference              of 0-00613.                 This    was evidently          due to the
unusual rapidity of the surface current caused by the swollen rivers,
being sufficient             to retard the process of diffusion between                                 the two
kinds of          water.      As      an ordinary thing, the bottom water at                              Inch-
garvie        is nearly as       salt as that at Inchkeith,                      while the surface water
is much fresher              ;   in    fact,   in       a heavy flood there              is river water on
the       surface      and sea water below it.                          The following       comparison        of
water from half the depth                              with that         at the    bottom        and    surface
shows that the denser water extends at any rate to half the depth,
    so that one would be inclined to view the heavy sea water filling up
    the hollow as part of the river bed, over which                                     the fresher upper
    water flows.          Experiments              with       a   current gauge at various depths
    would be       certain to give much valuable information on this subject.

         Table    XIV. gives particulars of                        98 determinations of            alkalinity
    arranged      according to magnitude.
         Speaking       roughly, it shows that waters                             having an        alkalinity
    under 40       (that is in which there is less than 0-04 grammes of
    carbonic       acid as carbonate of lime per litre) have a density
    under 1-0200,          alkalinities        under 25 correspond to densities under
    1-0100.       The      only strikingly anomalous                        case       is that    of sample
~So. 189,          a   bottom water from off Alloa, when the river                                 was     low
and very            dirty.       The     density             was    1-00146,       the alkalinity        47   -9,
which       usually corresponds to                     a    density of     1   -024.     The presence         of
sewage        in the river might account for this observation to some ex
tent, but more               probably          it      is   due to the presence            of particles of
calcium carbonate,               to which cause the very exceptional alkalinities
    of   Nos. 94 and 70 may also be referred.

                                                       Uncertain.

62                        Proceedings      of the  Royal Society
    With an alkalinity            between     40   and 50 water has               a   density
between      1  -024 and     1 -025 as a general rule, and when the               alkalinity
is over 50 the density is almost invariably over 1-025.
    There are a number of exceptions apparent on looking over these
tables, and the exceptions are too numerous to be accidental.
   To   discuss      the bearings of       alkalinity    on the other properties            of
the water with any degree of satisfaction,                  it would     be necessary       to
translate the number              representing     alkalinity       per   litre   into   that
representing alkalinity per 100 parts of total salts.                      If it    could be
correctly assumed that the composition of the total salts is constant,
like  the composition of ocean-water              salts, this could easily be done
by calculation          from    the density.        But it is evident from purely
a  priori considerations, that such an assumption cannot                           be made,
for the composition of the dissolved salts of river water is quite
different from that of the salts of sea water, and consequently estuary
water is not         a  solution of sea-water        salts    diluted more and more
with   pure water, but a solution of sea-water                  salts   mixed more and
more     largely with         a   much more        dilute      solution     of   salts  in a
different proportion.
    In  consequence         of inability to compare           the alkalinites      with the
total salts, it is impossible to form             a correct      idea of the difference
between      bottom and surface            alkalinities, as this difference           may  be
entirely due to the different salinity of the water.
    The following table          (XIII.) shows     that the difference in alkalinity,
like that in salinity between surface and bottom water, is greatest                         at
the highest point in the river, and decreases rapidly                           as   the sea
is approached.

1. Notes on the Chemical Composition of the Cobalt and                   Nickel
        Ores of New          Caledonia, with some Remarks on the
        Properties     and Uses of      Metallic Nickel and Oxides of
        Cobalt.      By   J.  B. Readman,     Esq.
    The island of New Caledonia, from which              these  ores of nickel
and cobalt are derived, is situated in the South Pacific Ocean, dis
 tant about 600 miles east from Queensland, Australia.            The island is
about 200 miles long by about           30 miles broad, and is extremely
 mountainous.       New Caledonia belongs to the French, and it                is
 there  that   they    have   established   one   of   their   principal   penal
 settlements.
    The nickel    ores  of New Caledonia      were    discovered rather more
 than twenty years ago by Gamier, in an exploring                expedition    of
the island undertaken under the auspices             of the French Govern
 ment     The  ores  of cobalt  were a more recent discovery.
    Beginning with the deposits of cobalt ores in New Caledonia,                I
 shall  mention    briefly — (1) The kind      of deposits of cobalt ore;
 (2) their physical state; and (lastly) their chemical composition,
with some of the properties and the uses of the oxides of cobalt.
    1. The kind of Deposit* of Cobalt Ore. — The surface deposits of
cobalt ore are found in the midst of certain aluminous ferruginous
masses,   which    seem to    come from the decomposition          of eruptive
aluminous    ferruginous rocks plentifully scattered in these districts.
These masses are very much developed              at the surface,    and form
immense ferruginous plateaux, which sometimes                crown the top of
the principal    serpentine upheavals,     but which occupy specially the
ridges of the less elevated      ranges of hills.     This peculiarity    causes
the cobalt ores     of New Caledonia to         be   found generally at low
altitudes  and not far from the      sea, where the branches of the great
    VOL XIIL                                                           E

G6                       Proceedings        of  the   Royal Society
mountain chain of the interior die away.                         The cobalt ores of New
Caledonia habitually contain veins of chrome ore, which appear to
come from chrome             ore contained      in   the subjacent serpentine.
    2.  The Physical Condition of               the Cobalt Ore, — The ore from                  the
ferruginous masses containing cobalt is solid, round, and sometimes
a little hard.        I   have    here    some specimens           that show the appear
ance    it  presents       on the ground.           It  resembles        iron ore, rotten        or
scoriaceous,     the cavities of which are filled with bluish-black                      cobalti-
ferous manganese.
   3.   Tlie   Chemical          Composition        of   the     Cobalt      Ore*,     §c. — The
average      percentage        of   the    ore,   taken from a large                number of
analyses,     runs      about     3   to    5   per cent,        oxide     of cobalt,       along
with about l£           per cent,      of oxide of nickel.               Besides these two
oxides, the ore           contains     bincxide       and protoxide           of manganese,
peroxide of iron, alumina, lime, magnesia,                        silica, chrome        ore,   and

    It will   be seen from the analysis of the six samples of cobalt ore
(and which are representative analysis of several hundred tons),
that the composition of the ore varies very considerably, — the silica
and chrome ore being as high                  as 30    per cent, in one representative
sample,     and    as  low    as 1 -81 per    cent in another.
    In   the numerous samples submitted to analysis,                        I have     not heard
of copper, sulphur (cither in free state or as                    a   sulphide), or arsenic,
being found in these ores of cobalt.
    It  has not been found advisable to attempt to utilise as yet                              any
 portion of the constituent of these cobalt ores except the cobalt and

                        of Edinburgh,             Session 1884-85.                           67
 the   nickel they contain, so         it   is needless      at present to mention them
 further.
    Cobalt     is almost      entirely      consumed in the arts in the state of
oxide, and       there are two fairly well-defined oxides of this metal
that are so employed.             The tirst of          these, or what is known as the
ordinary black       oxide of coltalt of commerce, is a sesquioxide (Co2Os),
corresponding         to the ferric oxide Fe303 ; and the other oxide is
partly protoxide        and partly sesquioxide of cobalt, corresponding to,
though not so well defined, as the magnetic oxide of iron
                                                                                         Fe304.
This oxide is known in the arts as prepared oxide                                        and is
                                                                           of  cobalt,
made from the black or sesquioxide by heating to whiteness for
some time, and thus depriving                 it of a part of its oxygen.
    In physical character the two oxides of cobalt are somewhat un
like, the higher oxide being blacker than the lower oxide, and less
dense,     and though        the former is apparently               much lighter,        I  was
surprised to find that the specific gravity of the two oxides are not
 very widely different, as         will     be seen from the          following results : —
 The specific gravity of two different representative samples of black
 oxide being 5-82 and 5-82 respectively,                   while the     specific gravity of
 four different      samples of       prepared         oxide were      found to be 5-93,
  6-48, 6-38,    and 612.
     I have here two specimens            of    the cobalt oxides      just   described,    and
  which have been produced             from the cobalt ores of New Caledonia.

    Jt will    be seen from the analysis of the           prepared    oxide of cobalt
that    it is not     a  well-defined oxide, but is rather a combination of
protoxide with sesquioxide.
    The principal use of black oxide of cobalt is in the manufacture
of pottery ware, where it is employed to counteract the yellow colour
the ware would otherwise possess after the process of firing, — the
cobalt here playing the part of the blue of the laundry.                     So intense
is the colouring power of cobalt that about               6 oz. to the    ton of china
clay is sufficient, and         if  more than about     1 lb. to the ton of clay be
used, the ware        has a distinct      blue colour.     I  have received        from  a
large pottery two specimens             of china ware, one of which has had the
usual admixture           of cobalt, while      another one has had no cobalt
added to the clay from which the dish was made.                        In daylight       a
 very decided yellow tint is visible in the latter.
    The other uses of black oxide of cobalt are in colouring glass, and
 in the manufacture of cobalt ultramarine.
    The      principal     use   of prepared oxide of cobalt is as           a  pigment,
 especially in painting           china   (I have  here a familiar     specimen       of a
 plate painted with this pigment), cobalt being the only blue colour
 that   will stand      the high temperature required        in this   case.
     Up    to    the present time       I have not heard of cobalt being found
 in any well-defined veins in New Caledonia — in                 thus matter cobalt
 differs from the ores of nickel, which are found also in the island.
     The nickel ores of New               Caledonia contain no cobalt, but             the
  cobalt ores,     as we    have seen from the analyses, contain a consider
  able percentage        of nickel compared      with the cobalt present
     It  is rather troublesome to separate          all the  nickel    from the oxide
  of cobalt in the process of refining, and in no sample that [ have ex
  amined is the nickel entirely absent in the finished oxide of cobalt.
     Nickel exists in        the ores of New Caledonia as a silicate, — possibly
  a double silicate of nickel and magnesia, — and this ore is probably

                            of Edinburgh,         Session 1884-85.                             69

      The average ores worked contain about 10 per cent, of a metallic
  nickeL        I   have     here as representative           a   set of specimens        of the
  nickel ores as could             be obtained.        It   has a green      colour, and was
  mistaken for an ore           of copper    at one time.
      The refined nickel is usually sent into the market either                        in shape
  of small cubes or round              cakes.      I  have    here    specimens      of each of
  these.       The     nickel rounds      are prepared        by mixing, intimately, the
  oxide of nickel refined from the ore, along with wood charcoal,                            and
  after stamping          into the round        shape (shown in the specimen), the
   cakes are      dried, and the oxide is reduced to the metallic state at a
   high temperature,         the round cakes still retaining their shape.                Nickel
   made     in this way is chiefly employed               in the manufacture of German
   silver, or other       alloys of nickel and copper           ;  it  is brittle, and has a
   distinct    crystalline appearance         on being broken.             Before proceeding
   to speak of        malleable nickel and other uses of the metal and its
   alloys,    I shall give a few of the analyses that have been made of
   the oxide and         of the metallic nickel manufactured from the ores of
  New Caledonia.              I   may here     mention that these analyses               are re
  presentatives         of a great many hundred tons of refined oxide and
  metallic     nickel derived from New Caledonia, which is believed to be

    Four Analyses of Nickel       — Metallic nickel 98-25 per cent.,
                                          Cakes.
98-82 per cent., 98-83 per cent., 98-37 per cent.  I am not able at
present to give greater detail in the last analysis, the difference,
however, is made up of some carbon, iron, and silicon.
     Of   recent years   a   process has been patented                   to make       nickel    malle
able, and render the metal suitable for rolling and stamping.                                      This
process consists      in adding to the fused nickel contained in a                           crucible
a   small quantity of metallic magnesium,                        the effect of this,        according
to some authorities, is to deprive the nickel of a minute                               quantity of
oxygen.       The metal that this sheet was made from, and the                                 various
nickel articles here, have been manufactured from nickel                                    treated in
this way.       The importance of malleable nickel for many                                 purposes
in the arts is very great.
     Pure nickel is not       a   readily oxidisable metal, and its resistance                       to
the action of the atmosphere,                    and also to the action of both                 fresh
and salt water, admits of its being ranked in these respects                                 with the
precious metals.
     This valuable property of not being readily tarnished or oxidised
offers special      inducements to employ nickel for the exposed parts                               of
machinery and engines, for surgical, optical, and scientific                                    instru
ments and apparatus,              for artistic and ornamental work of all sorts,
in jewellery, and in         a great       variety of other ways.
     Another important property of nickel is its whitening effect upon
                                                                " or
copper when alloyed with    forming the well known " German
                                          it,
" nickel silver." Some very beautiful alloys of nickel, copper, and
tin have been quite recently obtained, and these alloys have received
the name of " New Caledonia silver."                          This alloy     is   peculiarly white
in colour, whiter indeed              than pure nickel itself.                    It   is   also very
malleable.     I     have obtained specimens                     of sheets made of this com
position, and likewise of some articles, which may bo of interest to
this Society, made from the same alloy.
     Another very important use of nickel                        is   in the sheathing of ships;
perhaps       sufficient     trials       have       not    yet been       made     to speak con
fidently,     butI     may perhaps              be allowed to quote the remarks of                   a
gentleman present at the docking                       of    a   ship on which some experi
ments       had been made.                He was present               at the docking           of the
" Roma," and writes           as    follows:     —
     " The whole ship,        as    far    as   it   had been in the water, was covered

                               of Edinburgh, Session 1884-85.                                                      71
with     a band       of    sea-weed and shells                  for    a   thickness of several inches                 ¦
the nickel rlates              ¦were,        however, completely free of all growth, and
quite clean, the only alteration                           in   appearance         being    a     slight violet
discoloration,             such as tarnished                   silverplate.        Otherwise they were
without any dirt or slime, so that they could                                       have        been written
on with a lead pencil.  The sheets seemed to                                         be bright              eyes or
windows, and               the     nickel        plates    were not blistered or damaged                           in
any way.            The     plates having             been       brushed were as clean                      as new
ones.      It       should         be        remembered          that the          'Roma'        was        at    sea
for eleven months, and that she was in some of the worst places —
such as the Straits of Magellan                           — for the accretion of            sea-weed             and
barnacles."
    Recently culinary and other vessels made of sheet iron, coated
inside and          out    with thin            sheets     of malleable nickel, have been the
 object of manufacture.                        These articles, of which              1 have           here some
 specimens,         are    indistinguishable               of course from vessels made of pure
 nickel throughout                      (I    have here some examples of the latter for
 comparison.)              The object of coating                  these vessels is to save expense
 compared           with       the pure           metal.          Lastly,      I   may     just         mention
  that another important outlet for nickel is in the coinage.                                                Many
  countries have           now          a    nickel coinage, and it is probable the use of
  nickel in this direction                    will   be soon      largely extended.
        In conclusion,         I   should like to give              a   few details of some experi
  ments     I    have recently made                  in   regard to the solubility               of nickel         in
  acids, and        its behaviour in some other ways.
    first, in regard to the solubility of nickel in acids.                                              I    began
  with acetic acid, and the treatment in this acid was repeated                                                  very
  much in the same way as in case                              of other acids — that            is,   the nickel
  was boiled         in    a   large         quantity      of acid of various strengths, and
  allowed to remain under this treatment four to five days.
    1.    In acetic acid, 0"21 per cent of nickel dissolved.
    2.    In tartaric acid, the nickel was not acted upon.
    3.    In mixture of solution of citric and tartaric acids, the nickel
                a
 upon the treatment as described lost                             0   08 per cent.
    4.    In oxalic acid, the loss amounted                             to 0-14 per cent.
    5.    In cold dilute hydrochloric acid,                             no loss     was sustained                (the
 HC1      sol.      was    1       to       6); but       on    heating the solution                  the    nickel
 dissolved.

72                     Proceedings    of the Royal Society
    6.  In cold dilute sulphuric acid        (1 to 4), the nickel lost 0-14       per
cent., and behaved        on heating as with the last acid.
    When nickel articles, such        as those before you, are heated            over
an Argand or Bunsen burner, a thin unweighable coating of                    oxide   is
formed (which can be removed              by sand-paper),      the nickel vessel
becoming very dark in colour.
    Caustic soda can be fused          in  a  nickel basin with scarcely         any
change     in weight.      In  one experiment, where       the caustic soda      was
fused for one hour in a small nickel basin, the gain                      in weight
amounted       to 0'013 per cent.
    These, then, are a few of the experiments that           I have been able       to
make     with this    metal ; some of them proving the value of nickel             for
many purposes to which it has hitherto not been applied.
           2.   Note on     a  Singular Passage in the Principia,
                                By Professor Tait.
     In the remarkable Scholium,            appended     to  his chapter on the
 Laws of Motion, where Newton is showing what Wren, Wallis, and
 Huygens had done in connection with the impact of bodies, he uses
the following very peculiar language           : —
     " Sed    et  Veritas    comprobata est      a  D.    Wrenno    coram      Regid
 Socieiate per experimentum           Pendulorum,       quod etiam      Clarissimus
 Mariottus Libro integro         exponere mox dignatus est."
     The last clause of this sentence, which          I  had occasion      to consult
 a  few days ago, appeared         to me to be so sarcastic,       and so unlike
 in   tone   to all the context, that      I  was anxious to discover its         full
 intention.
      Not   one of    the   Commentators, to whose works            I   had access,
 makes any remark on the passage.              The Translators differ widely.
      Thus    Motte softens      the clause    down into      the trivial     remark
  " which     Mr Mariotte      soon after thought fit to explain       in   a treatise
  entirely on that subject."
      The Marquise du Chastellet (1756) renders it thus :—
  "               mais ce fait Wrenn qui les confirma par des Experiences
  faites   avec des     Pendules devant la Societe Boyale            :   lesqelles le
  celebre Mariotte      a rapportees   depuis dans un Traitd qu'il a compose
  expres sur cette matitre."

                              of Edinburgh,           Session 1884-85.                           73
     Thorp's translation (1777) runs: —
" which the
                         very eminent Mr Mariotte                  soon   after thought fit to
explain in a treatise entirely upon that subject."
     Finally, Wolfers (1872) renders it thus :—
" der zweite
                        zeigte der Societat die Richtigkeit seiner Erfindung                     an
einem       Pendelversucbe, den                     der   beriihmte      Mariotte     in   seinem
eigenen       Werke aus einander                 zu setzen,   fiir wiirdig   erachtete."
     Not one of these                seems to have remarked anything                singular in
the language employed.                       But when       we consult the
                                                                                " entire book "
in which Mariotte                  is said by Newton             to have    " expounded "       the
result of         Wren, and which                is  entitled Traite de la Percussion            ou
 Choc      des       Corps,       we find       that the name          of Wren     is   not once
 mentioned            in its     pages    !   From the beginning to the end there is
 nothing calculated               even to hint to the reader that the treatise is not
 wholly original.
      This gives           a clue to the reason          for Newton's sarcastic        language     ;
 whose         intensity          is     heightened       by   the     contrast   between       the
  Clarissimus             which is carefully prefixed to the name of Mariotte,
  and the       simple D. prefixed, not only to the names of Englishmen
  like Wren and Wallis, but even to that of                          a  specially distinguished
   foreigner      like Huygens.
       Newton           must, of course, like all the scientific men of the time
   (Mariotte included),               have been      fully cognizant of Boyle's        celebrated
   controversy           with Linus, which led             to the publication,      in 1662, of
   the   Defence          of the Doctrine touching the Spring and Weight                     of the
    Air.      In that        tract,    Part    II.   Chap. 5, the result called in Britain
    Boyle's       Law        is    established        (by   a    very remarkable         series   of
    experiments) for pressures                less than, as well as for pressures greater
    than, an atmosphere                ;  and it is established by means of the very
    form     of       apparatus        still   employed       for    the   purpose     in   lecture
    demonstrations.               Boyle, at least, claimed originality, for he says in
    connection           with the difficulties          met   with in the breaking of his
    glass tube        : —
        ".  .   .   .    an accurate Experiment of this nature would be of great
    importance to the Doctrine of the Spring of the Air, and has not
     been  made (that           I  know) by any man.            ..."
        In Mariotte's Discours de la Nature de I'                    Air, published fourteen
     years later than this work of Boyle, we find no mention whatever of

74                            Proceedings             of    the   Royal Society
Boyle, though               the identical             form of apparatus used                       by    Boyle is
described.           The whole work proceeds, as does that on Percussion,
with      a calm        ignoration            of     the    labours of           the    majority          of   con
temporary philosophers.
    This       also must,          of      course,    have        been   perfectly well known                    to
Newton :— and               we can now see             full   reason for the markedly                    peculiar
language         which       he     permits          himself        to employ          with reference            to
Mariotte.
    What        was thought of this matter by a very distinguished                                        foreign
contemporary,               appears           from     the        treatise       of    James            Bernoulli,
De Gravitate JZtheris, Amsterdam, 1683, p. 92.
  "Veritas utriusque hujus regulae manifests fit duobus curiosis
experimentis ab Illustr. Dn Boylio banc in rem factis, quae videsis
in Tractatu ejnn contra Linum, Cap. V., cui duas Auctor                                                 subjunxit
Tabulas pro divcrsis Condensationis et Rarefactionis gradibus."
    In order         to satisfy myself that Newton's                             language,     taken       in ita
obvious meaning,                  really has the intention which                       I   could not avoid
attaching to           it,  I      requested         my colleague             Prof.        Butcher to state
the    impression which                 it    produced on him.                   1    copied       for him the
passage above quoted, putting                         A. for       the word           Wrenno, and B. for
Mariuttus       ;     and   I      expressly avoided stating who was the writer.
Here      is   his reply —   :
     "I   imagine the point of the passage to be something of this                                          kind
(speaking without farther context or acquaintance with the                                               Latinity
of the learned author) —               :
   A established the truth by means of          (simple) experiment,         a
before        the Royal           Society     ;    later,   B     thought     it      worth his while to
write     a    whole book to prove the                 s    ime point.
 I     should take the tone to be highly sarcastic at B's expense.                                              It
seems     to suggest          that      B     was not only clumsy but dishonest.                               The
latter inference             is   not certain, but at any rate we have                             a    hint that
B     took      no    notice of A's discovery, and                           spent     a    deal    of useless
labour."
    This conclusion,              it   will    be seen, agrees exactly with                    the complete
ignoration of Wren by Mariotte.
    When       I     afterwards referred               Prof. Butcher             to the whole context,
in my copy of the first edition of the Principia, and asked                                                    him
whether the           use    of Clarissimus was sarcastic or not, he                           wrote —

                         of Edinburyh,        Session 1884-85.                          75
    " I   certainly     think so.       Indeed, even apart from the context.
I  thought     the     Clarissimits    was ironical, but there can be no doubt
of it when      it corresponds      to D.    Wren."
    In explanation of this          I must     mention that, when         I first sent the
passage to      Prof.    Butcher, I had       copied   it from Horsley's sumptuous
edition ; in        which     the    Da    are   omitted,     while   the     Clariseimus
is retained.
    Alike in France and in Germany, to this day, the Law in question
goes by the name of Mariotte.                 The following extracts, from two of
the most recent          high-class text     books, have now a peculiar interest.
 I  have put a       word or two of       each in Italics.      These should be com
 pared with the dates given.
     "Diese Frage ist schon friihzeitig untersucht                       und    zwar fast
 gleichzeitig von dem franzosischen Physiker Mariotte (1679) und dem
 englischen           Physiker    Boyle      (1662)."      Wiillner,      Lehrbuch      der
  Experimentalphysik,          1882, § 98.

   Angleterre       et  par Mariotte    (1676) en France; toutefois, si Boyle a
   publie    le premier ses experiences, il ne sut pas en tirer l'6nonce
   clair que      donna le physicien         francais.     C'est done avec         quelque
   raison que le nom de         loi  de Mariotte a passe dans        1' usage."     Violle,
    Cours de Physique, 1884, § 283.
       On this     I  need make no remark further than quoting one sentence
    from Boyle, where he compares                the actual pressure,       employed in
    producing       a  certain compression       in air, with " what         the   pressure
    should be according to the Hypothesis, that supposes                    the pressures
    and expansions        to be in reciprocal proportion."          M. Violle has pro
                                                         "                "
    bably been misled by the archaic use              of   expansion for volume.
        It must be said, in justice         to Mariotte, that he does not appear
    to have   claimed the discovery of any new facts in connection either
    with    collision     or with the effect of pressure           on air.      He rather
    appears   to write with the conscious           infallibility of    a man    for whom
    nature    has     no secrets.     And     he   transcribes, or adapts,        into   his
    writings     (without any attempt          at acknowledgment) whatever suits
    him in those of other people.             He   seems to have been a splendidly
   successful      and very early example of the highest class of what we
    now call the Paper-Scientists.            Witness the following extracts from

76                        Proceedings      of  the      Royal Society
Boyle, with        a   parallel citation from Mariotte of fourteen years' later
date at least.          The comparison of the sponges had struck me so
much, in Mariotte's work, that                I     was     induced to search       for    it in
Boyle, where         I  felt convinced that          I   should find it.
     "This Notion may perhaps be somewhat further explain'd, by
conceiveing the Air near the Earth to be such a heap of little Bodies,
lying one upon another, as may be resembled to a Fleece of WoolL
For this (to omit other likenesses betwixt them) consists of many
slender and flexible Hairs           ;  each of which, may indeed,              like    a  little
Spring, be easily bent or rouled up                   ;   but will also, like  a  Spring,      be
still endeavouring          to stretch itself out again.            For though both these
Haires, and tho yEreal              Corpuscles to             which we liken them, do
easily yield to externall pressures             ;    yet each of them (by virtue               of
its structure) is endow'd with a Power or Principle of Selfe-
Dilatation ; by virtue whereof, though the hairs may by a Mans
hand be bent and crouded closer                         together,   and   into  a  narrower
room then        suits best with the Nature of the Body, yet, whils't the
compression          lasts,   there    is   in      the      fleece  they    composeth         an
endeavour outwards, whereby it                       continually      thrusts  against       the
hand that opposeth its Expansion.                       And upon       the removall of the
external pressure, by opening the hand more or less, the compressed
Wooll doth,         as   it   were,   spontaneously expand or display                    it self
towards the recovery of its former more loose and free condition
till  the Fleece hath either regain'd its former Dimensions, or at least,
approached        them     as neare as    the compressing hand, (perchance                   not
quite open'd) will permit               The power of Selfe-Dilatation                is some
what more conspicuous in             a  dry Spunge compress'd,             then in   a   Fleece
of Wooll.         But     yet we rather chose to employ the latter, on this
occasion,      because     it  is not   like   a Spunge, an intire            Body    ;   but a
number of slender and flexible Bodies, loosely complicated, as the
Air itself     seems to be."
     And,    a few pages later,      he adds      : —
     ".  .  .  . a  Column of Air, of many miles in height, leaning upon
some      springy Corpuscles           of   Air      here      below, may have          weight
enough       to bend     their little springs, and keep them bent                  :    As,   (to
resume      our former comparison,)           if    there were fleeces of       Wooll pil'd
up to      a   mountainous        height, upon one               another, the     hairs     that
compose        the lowermost        Locks which             support the rest, would, by

compress 'd as it' a Man should squeeze them together in his hands,
or imploy any such other moderate force to compress them.                            So
that we need not wonder, that upon the taking off the incumbent
Air from any parcel of the Atmosphere here below, the Corpuscles,
whereof that undermost Air consists, should display themselves,
and take up more room than before."
     Mariotte     (p.   151).      "On peut comprendre à peu près cette
différence      de    condensation de l'Air, par l'exemple de plusieurs
 éponges     qu'on    auroit entassées les unes sur les autres. Car il est
 évident, que celles qui seraient tout au haut, auraient leur entendue
 naturelle : que celles qui seraient immédiatement au dessous, seroient
 un peu moins         dilatées   ;  et que    celles   qui seraient au dessous       de
 toutes   les autres,     seraient    très-serrées   et condensées.      It  est encore
 manifeste,    que si on     ôtoit    toutes celles du dessus, celles du dessous
 reprendraient       leur étendue naturelle         par la vertu de ressort qu'elles
 ont, et que si       on en ôtoit        seulement     une partie, elles ne repren

     Those    curious    in such      antiquarian     details will probably find a
  rich reward      by   making     a careful comparison of these          two works     ;
  and   in tracing     the connection        between     the  Liber   integer, and its
  fons et origo,    the paper of Sir Christopher Wren.
     Condorcet,     in his Éloge       de Mariotte,      says: — "Les lois du choc
  des  corps   avaient      été trouvées par une métaphysique et par                une
  application d'analyse,        nouvelles l'une et l'autre, et si subtiles, que
  les démonstrations de ces lois ne pouvaient satisfaire que les grands
  mathématiciens.           Mariotte    chercha    à les   rendre,  pour ainsi dire,
  populaires,   en    les appuyant sur des expériences, &c." i.e., precisely
  what Wren had thoroughly done before him.
      "Le discours de Mariotte sur la nature de l'air renferme encore
  une    suite   d'expériences       intéressantes,     et qui étaient      absolument
   neuves."     This,    as we have seen, is entirely incorrect.
      But Condorcet         shows an easy way out of all questions of this
   kind, however delicate, in the words: — "Ou ne doit aux morts que
   ce qui peut être utile aux vivants, la vérité et la justice.             Cependant,
   lorsqu'il reste encore des amis et des enfants que la vérité peut affliger,
   les égards deviennent un devoir; mais au tout d'un siècle, la vanité
   peut seule être blessée de la justice rendue aux morts."

  78                   Proceedings       of  the   Royal Society
     Thus   it is seen    that even      the   turn of one of Newton's phrases
  serves, when    rightly viewed,       to dissipate a widespread             delusion  : —
  and that while Boyle, though perhaps                  he can scarcely be         said   to
  have   been    "born     great,"     certainly      "achieved        greatness;"      the
 assumed     parent of     La Loi      de Mariotte         (otherwise Mariottesches
                                     "                                  "
  Gesetz) has as certainly had          greatness     thrust   upon him.

      4.  Note on the Necessity for               a  Condensation-Nucleus.
                               By Professor Tait.
    The magnificent researches            of Andrews        on    the     Isothermals    of
 Carbonic Acid formed,          as  it  were,     a  nucleus in       a    supersaturated
 solution, round which an immediate crystallization                    started,   and has
 since been rapidly increasing.
    They gave the clue to the explanation of the paradoxical result of
 Regnault, that hydrogen is less compressible and other gases more
compressible, under moderate            pressures,     than Boyle's Law indicates          ;
and to that of the companion result of Natterer that, at very high
pressures,    all gases are less compressible than that law requires.
Thus they furnished the materials for an immense                         step in connec
 tion with the behaviour of fluids above their critical points.
    But they threw at least an equal amount of light on the liquid-
 vapour question — i.e., the behaviour of fluids at temperatures under
their critical points.       In Andrew's experiments                there     was a com
 mencement,     and   a  completion, of liquefaction           ;  each at a common
definite pressure, but of course at very different volumes, for each
particular temperature.
    In   1871    Professor    J.   Thomson          communicated           to  the Royal
Society   a  remarkable paper        on the abrupt change              from vapour to
liquid, or the opposite,      indicated      by these     experiments.          Ho called
special attention     to the necessity        for  a "start,"    as  it   were, in order
that these changes might be effected.                [It  is to this point that the
present note is mainly directed, but            I   go on with a brief analysis         of

                       of Edinburgh,       Se6sia,i 1834-85.                               79
Thomson's       work.]      He pointed      out that there were numerous ex
periments proving that water could                be heated,    under certain condi
tions, far above       its boiling point without evaporating                  ; and that,
probably, steam        might   be condensed isothermally to supersaturation
without     condensing.        Hence he was led to suggest an isothermal of
continued curvature, instead of the broken line given by Andrews,
as   representing the continuous passage of a fluid from the state of
vapour to that        of liquid; the whole        mass being supposed             to be, at
each stage     of the process, in the same molecular state.
     In Clerk- Maxwell's         Treatise    on Heat,      this    idea    of   J.    Thom
son's was developed,         in connection with       a  remarkable speculation of
W. Thomson,* on the             pressure   of vapour as depending on the cur
vature of the        liquid surface in      contact    with it.        This completely
accounts      for the deposition of vapour when                a    proper nucleus is
present         Maxwell      showed that       it could      also     account       for   the
 "            "
    singing      of a kettle, and for the growth of the larger drops in                      a
 cloud at the expense        of the smaller ones.
      The main objection to          J. Thomson's suggested           isothermal curve
  of transition    is that, as Maxwell points out, it contains               a   region in
  which pressure and         volume increase         or diminish        simultaneously.
  This necessarily involves instability         ;  inasmuch     as,  for definite values
   of pressure at constant temperature            within   a certain range in which
   vapour and    liquid can    be  in equilibrium, Thomson's hypothesis                 leads
   to three  different values of volume: two of which are stable                  ;  but the
   intermediate one       essentially unstable.        According to Maxwell,              the
  extremities of this triple        region correspond to pressures, at which,
  regarded    from the view of steady increase or diminution of pressures,
  either the     vapour condenses        suddenly      into liquid, or the liquid
  suddenly bursts into vapour.
      If this were the case, no nucleus would be absolutely                 requisite for
  the  formatioiueither of liquid from vapour or of vapour from liquid.
 All that would         be required,     in either case, would be the proper
 increase    or diminution of pressure; — temperature being kept un
 altered.      The latent heat of vapour, which we know                  to become le<s
 as the   critical point is gradually arrived at, would thus be given off
 in the explosive        passage    from vapour to liquid.            It  is difficult      to

sudden passage from liquid to vapour.
    Aitken's experiments tend to show, what                   J.  Thomson only       specu
latively announced, that possibly vapour may not be condensed                            (in
the   absence    of   a nucleus), when compressed                isothermally,     even at
ranges far beyond the maximum of pressure indicated                         in Thomson's
figures.    Hence it would appear that the range of instability is                   much
less than that given by Thomson's                   figures,    and may (perhaps)         be
looked on     as   a  vanishing quantity         ;  the   corresponding part of         the
isothermal being        a  finite line parallel to the axis of pressures, corre
sponding to the sudden absorption or giving out of latent heat.

 THOMAS STEVENSON,                         Esq., Memb. Inst. C.E.,             President,
                                     in the Chair.
     The following Communications were read                          : —
       1. The President delivered the following Address:                           —
    With   the prospect       of addressing you for the first time since you
did   me the   very great honour of asking me to act                   as your President,
I  felt somewhat at         a  loss to determine on what subject                 I  should
venture to speak          to you   ;   but, at last,      I  resolved to refer to an
exceedingly important            question of maritime engineering practice,
which gave rise          to   very lengthened inquiries             before    Committees
during the last two Sessions               of Parliament,         involving    a contem
plated expenditure of many millions                   sterling, and deeply affecting,
for good     or   evil, the entrance          from the sea to the great port of
Liverpool.      I  refer to the proposed           Manchester Ship Canal.
    That   scheme       (for the following remarks have, of course, no
reference whatever to the scheme as now proposed for sanction by
Parliament) cannot but be regarded as involving one of the most
momentous       physical questions that ever was raised in Britain, and
although such       a  question may, perhaps,            never again become one of
national import in this country, still,                I think, no apology is neces
sary for bringing       it  before the notice of this Society.
   About half      a   century ago      a  principle was admitted into the prac-

                          of Edinburgh,          Session 1884-85.                           81
ties   of the maritime engineer,             which was considered at the time to
be sound,      and which the             majority      of the profession until lately
regarded     of universal        application, from its having for many                   years
been    practically tested         in many different         cases with    the most      grati
fying success.
     The principle       to which       I allude    is the confining of the ebb and
flow of the        river and tidal water            to one fixed channel of a certain
width by means            of what       are called training        walls.    These are low
structures     of stone or timber, placed in tidal                  estuaries,   and carried
to such a       height       only    as is  just sufficient      to guide the direction
of the first      of the flood tide and last of                the ebb.      It  was found,
in practice, that a very small elevation of those walls above                              the
bottom      was      sufficient to restrain and direct the                  course    of the
heaviest land         floods and       strongest     tide currents     ; and this, because
such floods         and currents        always increase         in volume      more   or less
 slowly, so that        if    the walls project only high enough               to guide the
 comparatively         gentle beginnings of those              discharges,     they will be
 sufficient    to direct them after they have                     attained their greatest
 volume and highest velocity ; for, as the flood                      increases   gradually,
  the depth     will in like manner always              go on increasing in the line of
  the   directing       wall, since the        flood    must necessarily continue           to
   follow the    line of     least resistance,    which will always be in the line
   of greatest    depth    ;   so that (excepting       in very    rare cases) all that is
   needed    to control        the direction of the heaviest land flood or the
   highest tide is to fix the direction                 of the first of either tide or
   freshet —ribsta principiu           by the time that either flood or tide has
   submerged the training walls              ;  the line of direction of such flood
   or tidal  current has been already permanently fixed.
      Principally,      by means of those walls and steam dredging, the
   river Clyde       has been increased          from    a   depth of 13 feet       8  inches
  to no less      than 26 feet up to Glasgow               ;  but the soundness       of this
   system,   which      was so triumphantly            carried out on the Clyde, has
  also been, as      I have said,      proved over and over again to be no less
  applicable to other rivers as well.
      The   Ribble, the Tyne, the          Tees, the     Nith,    the Lune,     &c, though
  varying     in many of their physical characteristics,                    have   all been
  improved       in the       same way,      without      producing any reduction in
  depth by the        silting up of their       sea approaches.

     This        modern            mode        of    improvement was           naturally
                                                                                       therefore
generally regarded                     as    thoroughly safe, and almost free from any
suspicion of danger                     ;    yet, nevertheless, we have within the last
year     or       two           witnessed       the       greatest           suspicion        and        excitement
about the risk of silting                           in connection with                  the    intended            Man

erection of training walls in the estuary of the river Mersey.                                                     But a
few months ago very eminent engineers                                          were     ranged          on       opposite
sides       in    Parliamentary                Committees                ;   and     it was        only,         after an
almost unprecedented struggle that                                   a   physical question was decided,
which, in the opinion of many, myself among the number,                                           might —
settled otherwise than it was — have ended                                         in something very like a
national calamity, namely, the silting up of the sea approaches to
Liverpool.
     After not much short of half                              a     century of the most varied                          ex
perience          in different parts of the United Kingdom,                                        the profession
hesitated to answer with a united voice either aye or no, one of the
most        important             questions          ever       laid         before them           by the public.
Thirty        years         of practice,            and of successful                practice,          might          have
been thought enough                         to give a satisfactory solution                    ;    but when the
question was laid before                        us, with regard to this particular                               river, it
took a new shape.                            New considerations arose,                    and           new criteria
were evolved.                    This       was a lesson to me, and,                   I think, it should                be
one to the profession.                        Among those who from the first confidently
predicted that disastrous consequences                                       from silting would follow in
the Mersey,                 I    may        mention the            names        of   Mr Vernon Harcourt,
C.E.    ;    Mr Lyster, the engineer of                         the Liverpool Docks                 ;   and Captain
Hills,      the marine surveyor                     of   the port of Liverpool.
     The Mersey was, at first sight, no exceptional river.                                                       The    rise
and maximum velocity of tide was much the same                                                as   in the Ribble           ;
the breadth of estuary was similar to that of the Tees                                                       ;   and the
matter in suspension was much less than in the Lune.                                                    Yet training
walls and           steam dredging                   had      increased         the depth in the Kibble
to between              7       and 8 feet up to Preston;                          in the Lune to 4 feet up
to Lancaster;               and in the Tees from                     3 to 20 feet as      high as Stockton.
     With        such facts before me,                    I   was slow         in coming           to any decided
view.            My instincts or "                   my       feelings," as Smeaton would                              have
expressed          it,   no doubt warned me against                                the adoption of training

                        of Edinburgh,        Session 1884-85.                              8:s
 walls at the      Mersey, but without telling            me why.       My brother and
 myself had       successfully improved eleven different navigable rivers
 by means        of training walls and dredging.                  There was not one
physical      characteristic    of the Mersey which, viewed by itself, would
render     inapplicable the       same treatment, and         it had not yet occurred
to me that certain         characteristics,    any one of which was harmless in
itself,    might,    when     taken together, justify           fears   of disaster    ;   so
that    it was    not  until    I  had resurveyed three of the rivers                I   had
formerly improved            on the system of training               walls that     I   con
cluded it was         solely due to the existence of certain character
istics    which existed        in all the three rivers, that           the    deposits     of
sand had        so  quickly followed the erection of the training walls.
Hence      I  concluded that it would         be unsafe to       risk training walls in
the     Mersey,      where     similar characteristics         were     not    only    more
 numerous,       but much more strongly marked.
     The river Lune was the navigation that first startled                   me.    It   was
 improved by training walls and by steam                   dredging of the channel,
 with an eye solely to improving              the navigation, and with no after
 thought of reclaiming land by accretion.                  The walls were but        3 feet
  high,    and placed strictly parallel         to the stream, nor was any part
  protected,     still less  enclosed,   by cross walls.         Two    years    after the
   completion      of the work, however, it          was found      that  a  considerable
   accretion     of sand had taken          place.      In   1851,    being     only     two
   years   after the works        were finished,      a   marine survey was          made,
   which     showed that the amount of accretion behind the walls had
   already amounted to 3000 cubic yards              of  sand, although that amount
   of deposit was quite balanced by a gain             of additional water admitted
   from the sea through          the deepened        channel.      In   1884,   however,
  thirty-four years after the completion of the works,                 I  had the Lune
  once more      surveyed, when it was found that 230 acres were covered
  with grass,      thus establishing      the important        physical     fact that the
  deposit had risen to the level of high- water neap tides, and the total
  accretion had reached the amount            of 5,536,060 cubic yards. In the
  same    year   I had   a fresh survey taken of the river Nith below Dum
  fries, — a navigation       which    had been improved by training                 walls
  alone, — and      the accretion was found to amount to 3,192,970 cubic
  yards;     and again, in the same year,          I  revisited the third river, to
  which    I  have referred, — the Kibble below Preston, — and found that
  about    5000 acres of what was formerly estuary were grassed over.

S4                     Proceedings           of   the   Royal Society
      These three    rivers had, therefore,               since     the completion of              the
training walls, been undoubtedly subject to large deposits of                                    sand ;
but the original          improvement in depth, and increased velocity                               in
the propagation of the tidal wave, were still maintained, so                                      that,
as    navigation works, they must be held to have been quite success
ful.     Indeed,    if similar improvements had                    to be done over          again,       I
should not propose             to make       any change whatever in the mode                         of
carrying out the works.              It will      be seen, however, from these cases,
that training walls exert           a    double influence — one directly for good,
by enlarging and deepening the main channel                             ;   another directly       for
evil, since     the deposit of silt behind                     the walls must reduce            the
scouring power by diminishing                      the    area filled at each             tide, and
thus     keeping back          a   corresponding          quantity          of tide-water from
entering the estuary.              Thus the ultimate                result      for good or        for
evil     must be in        each     case determined              by     a   comparison of the
relative amounts of these plus and minus quantities.
      Here, then, we have the first and elementary ground of that nega
tive answer, which         I   and others of my professional brethren returned
to the question proposed            for solution in the case of the Mersey.
      If, for instance,   the waters of a navigation contained no matter                            in
suspension,     the system of training walls would give merely                               a    plus
result, and their influence             be   therefore wholly beneficial              ;   but even
where there was matter             in   suspension        in the land-locked portion                of
the    estuary, — by which I            mean      that port ion between             the     training
wall and the river bank behind                    it,   where alone siltage can go on,
— and supposing the             area of that portion should happen                    to be very
small in comparison to the whole extent of the open estuary,                                       the
plus result would still outweigh the minus, and the balance of the
influence be        for good.           What naturally            is    land-locked might no
doubt be silted up, and lost to the navigation                              ;   but then,    if   that
extent      be small compared             with      what        still   remains     open     to    the
entrance      of the tides, the river              on the        whole will be improved.
If,    on the   other hand, the land-locked portion of the estuary be
very large, the total deposit may not only far more than counter
balance     the additional water gained                  by extra water passing up the
improved channel, but leave so little space for the                                 reception of
tidal water in the estuary, that the amount of scouring water that
can in future come in from the sea                      will    be insufficient       any longer

                      of Edinburgh, Session 1884-85.                             85
to keep open either the bar or the lower channels, then the naviga
 tion will  be ruined.
    This possibility    once admitted, that the benefit of the application
 of training walls really depends on the relative proportion of the
good and evil influences, it becomes necessary next to consider in
more detail the natural features which             I  believe tend to the forma
tion and deposit of matter in suspension, and which ought, there
fore, to be regarded       as  dangerous in the application of training walls
to any river where there is            a  wide estuary.       These characteristics
have, so far as     I   know, not been before referred to in connection
with   the subject now under consideration.
    In future, then,     I  consider it essential that in every case the fol
lowing characteristics ought to          be  fully inquired into and taken into
account before training walls are resorted to             : —
                              I. A High Rise of Tide.
    Because   if  there be matter in suspension in the sea (due to the
action of the waves on the bottom when they reach shoal water),
 the higher the rise of tide the greater           will  be the amount of solid
 matter that will be brought from the            sea.
                    II.     A Rapid Tidal Flood Current.
    Because,   from erosion of the sides and bottom, the more rapid
 the current the greater the amount of sandy and silty matter that
 will be disturbed and carried up the river.
                                  III.   Tidal Bore.
    Where    there   is   a   tidal bore with     a   cresting or breaking head,
 which, from its necessarily acting in shallow water, and with a very
high velocity, greatly         cuts up the bottom       and sides of the channel,
so as to set free a large amount of matter.
                                     IV. A Bar.
    Because   if there is either         a bar or extensive sandbanks,        with
 heavy breaking waves, at the mouth of a navigation, large quantities
 of matter are set loose, which may be carried inward                 by the flood
 tide, so that a bar and the adjoining           sea shores may be regarded      as

8G                       Proceedings     of  the   Royal Society
natural silt producers, which never fail to generate                   a constant    and
large supply of matter for deposit.
                  V. Natural Limit         to the Erection     of Walls.
     Given the above features, the only known expedients for                   counter
acting the evil of the reduced amount of scouring power, consequent
on siltage,       are those     proposed     by my brother,        Mr D. Stevenson,
about       forty   years    ago — first,    by continuing        the training walls
down to         the sea, and thus concentrating               what    yet remains     of
the    reduced      scouring power upon the lower channel of the                   navi
gation    ;  and, second, by the        erection of breakwaters in deep water
to shelter the bar from the beating of the                 sea  upon its surface, and
thus to neutralise,          if not   to annihilate,     these great     originators  of
 silt.    If, owing     to the local circumstances of the case, both of these
 plans be impracticable,           we may      almost regard these circumstances
 as  presenting      a fifth and serious element of danger.
               VI.   Amount of Matter in Mechanical Suspension.
     But,     again,    instead of arguing from principles,             the amount    of
 matter in suspension may be ascertained                 by direct observation, and
 will thus form another definite            element    in the comparison of rivers.
             VII.    TJie Existence    of a Wide Land-locked Estuary.
     And last, and        one of the most dangerous         of all,  the existence  of a
 wide landdocked estuary,           as  already referred to.
     Such are the criteria which we shall now proceed to apply to the
 comparison of the river Mersey with six rivers which have all been
 improved by training walls.
     In  three of these — the       Nith, Lune, and Ribble — there           have been,
 as we have         seen, great    accretions    ;  in the other three    — the Clyde,
 Tyne, and Tees — although training walls have been also long since
 employed, there have been hardly any or no deposit.
     Let    us look first    at the three     last cases,   as  to which    it was very
 strongly and pertinently           urged     before   Parliament      that no deposit
 has ever taken place, although training walls have been in existence
 for many years.
     Now it     is not surprising that the introduction          of training walls has

not produced deposit               in all rivers, for the fact seems        just   as certain,
on physical          grounds,     that they      will not produce accretion in some
rivers as        that they will produce it in others.                 It is essential that
before     accretion can, in any            case,   take place there must be matter in
suspension, or,           in other words, there must in          some part of the river
be water       in such rapid motion            as to break up and move the materials
of the bottom and sides of the channel, while at some other part of
the     river there must be             such      retardation of the velocity of the
water as to cause              the deposit of the matter in suspension                 ;   and,
besides      this, there must be          a large receptacle     to contain this matter,
and sufficiently sheltered from waves                    and currents to retain it after
deposit
      The Clyde.       — Having for the last twelve            years    acted    as  engineer
 to the    Clyde Lighthouses            Trustees, who are the Conservators of the
 lower estuary            of that river, and having during that time                      been
  engaged       in conducting          very extensive dredging operations,               I  am
 necessarily        fully acquainted with its peculiarities, and             can state that
  there is    only one point of resemblance               of any consequence         between
  that river      and the Mersey, viz., that the lower land-locked estuary of
  the Clyde        is about the same in width as that of the widest part of
   the Mersey       below Halehead.           But then    there is no training wall        c<m-
   wcied with          the  thore for guiding         the channel through this wide
   estuary,    so     that we can get no information                on     the    subject    at
   issue.     The walls which do exist in the Clyde are mainly in the
   upper part       of the river, where         the navigable channel is only about
   400 feet    wide, and where there is no large space left for silting up
  to take place         between these walls and the land.
      With the one exception of the wide estuary                        to which      I   have
  referred,    none of the characteristics which are favourable to deposit
  exist   in the Clyde,         as   I  will now      show.    The rise of tide in the
  Clyde     is only        10i   feet,   as   against   30 feet at the Mersey.             The
  maximum velocity of the tidal flood current is only about half                              a
  mile per     hour,     as  against   7 at the    Mersey.     There is no tidal bore at
  the  Clyde, and a very rapid one at the Mersey.                     There is neither        a
  bar  nor any heavy breaking               waves at the Clyde, but there are both
  at the   Mersey.          There is only       1  cubic inch of silt to       1  cubic yard
  of water     at the Clyde, and 33 cubic inches                to  1  cubic yard at the
  Mersey.

88                       Proceedings         of   the    Royal Society
     There is     a    depth of 20 fathoms at low water where the                               Clyde
joins the      sea,   which is land-locked and sheltered, while there is                         only
1£   fathom at low water on the bar at the Mersey, which is iu                                       the
open and stormy            Irish Channel.
     In   short, no two sandy rivers can well be more different                           in their
main features than the Mersey and the Clyde.                                 It is therefore quite
what might be expected,                 that there should be scarcely any accretion
in the Clyde.
     The Tyne.        — At   the Tyne       matters are, on the whole,                 in much the
same state as at the Clyde,                  for the rise of tide is                 only 13 feet.
There is no bore, and the bar has been deepened                                and     sheltered     by
the extensive breakwaters now in progress                           ;   and though there are
training walls, they have been erected                       so    close to the land as               to
leave     no large receptacle            for silt to be deposited,              so that there         is
hardly any similarity between the Tyne and the Mersey.
     The Tees.    — As       at the Tyne, the best means have in the case of                         the
Tees been already            employed of counteracting the risk of silting by
the extension of the training walls down to the sea, and the erection
of sheltering breakwaters which protect the bar, where                                  there    used
to be only 3 feet of depth, whereas there is now a depth of 20 feet                                     ;
and, besides, there is only               15 feet   of    a rise of tide,       with    a   flood tide
current of only           4.J   miles an hour,      so   that no argument            applicable to
the Mersey can be derived from the Tees,                          any more than from the
Clyde or the Tyne.
     From      these rivers we turn to the facts relating to those                           in which
silting has really taken place, and where training walls have been
adopted,       but where there are dangerous                  characteristics, but those of
a    comparatively subdued nature compared                         with those which are in
the Mersey.
     The results of the statements                already made may be thus shortly
summarised.            That silting        up to grass level may take place in an
estuary,       though the rise of tide may be no greater                             than 24 feet,
as   at the      Ribble   ;     where there       is     no bore,       as    at the        Lune and
Itibble   ;    where there        is   no bar, as at the      Nith      ;    and where       the ratio
of matter        in mechanical           suspension       may be as low as              3-68    cubic
inches,     as at the     Nith.
     It   is   obvious, therefore,          that there       is   every possible            reason    to
expect that       if    walls be erected accretion will take place up to the

                            of Edinburgh,          Session 1884-85.                         89
grass level         in the Mersey, where we find combined every one of
these     characteristics of danger, which is not the case in any of the
other      rivers referred to.              Not only so, but in every case those
characteristics          are    more     strongly     marked.      To   all   this must be
added the           all-important fact that if silting take place,                    as must
be   expected, there seems no practical mode of remedying                            the evil   ;
for,     owing        to local circumstances,           the walls cannot be extended
so as      to    shelter     the    bar,    as   that would      require no      fewer than
ten miles          of    breakwater        to be erected      in  the   stormy waters of
Liverpool Bay.
     But while the erection of training walls on the Nith, Lune, and
 Ribble has thus been followed                    by large deposits of silt, it is still,
and with         truth, contended that             these   navigations have been, upon
 the whole,        greatly improved.
     We      are   here thrown         back once more upon the question of ratio
 between the effects for good                  and evil   ;  of ratio between the extra
 amount of         tidal water      gained     by deepening and enlarging the             mid-
  channel, and the amount of scouring water altogether excluded by
  accretion       in the land-locked            estuary,    on which     ratio,   as   already
  stated, the      whole question mainly             depends.
      But how is the value of this ratio to be determined, and what
  limit is it safe to observe          1
      I  can   only here refer to the           case  of another river, not yet alluded
   to, viz.,   the     Tay, which, during           the years    1833   to 1844, was im
  proved      according to designs of my late father, so that an additional
  depth of 4         feet and a tidal acceleration of 50 minutes were got up
  to the    quays at Perth            But   no training walls were ever proposed             to
  be erected       in   the lower and wider part of the estuary, where there
  is sand     and     silt
      In the year 1845, however, certain riparian proprietors proposed
  to embank         land in the lower and wider estuary, and the authorities
  of the     important harbour and docks of Dundee became alarmed for
  the    safety of their        interests,   and     applied to the Admiralty to send
  an    engineer       of eminence        to report     on the whole        subject.       The
  engineer       selected     was    the late      Mr James Walker,          the   then per
  manent       President       of the Institution of Civil            Engineers, and the
  acknowledged            head of the profession in all maritime matters.                   In
  an  elaborate report he condemned the proposed works, on the ground

 00                   Proceedings       of the   Royal Society
 that they would exclude one-twentieth              of the scouring tidal        power
 of the Tay.
    In  the opinion, then, of      Mr Walker,       the first engineer     of his day,
and the one who carried out most of the               later improvements of the
river    Clyde between Glasgow and               Dumbarton,       the loss     of   one-
twentieth      of the natural     tidal scouring power at the Tay                ought
 to be firmly resisted.       But is this caution to be accepted, or            should
it be regarded as excessive       1
    Turning to     ascertained    fact,   the   only one to which        I can  appeal
is that observed at the Lune, for           I have no means of knowing            what
has actually taken place at either the            Nith or   the Jxibble.
    The loss of tidal scouring water due to the training walls at the
Lune was found to be one-tenth, but from this loss no evil conse
quences appear to have resulted.              We   have then, by way of       criteria,
only two to guide us, viz., Mr Walker's opinion that                  a loss   of one-
twentieth    would prove injurious at the Tay, and the ascertained fact
that  a loss   in the  case  of the Lune of one-tenth of the scouring power
did no harm.
    Turning now       to the    case   of the Mersey,       and assuming,        as we
have more than sufficient reason for doing, that deposit of sand                   will
take place     up to the grass level in the land-locked estuary of that
river,  as  it has done already in the kindred but less dangerous                 cases
referred to, we have next to ascertain               what would be the ratio of
loss in that case.
    The total amount of deposit,         as ascertained    from actual soundings,
would be about 460,000,000 cubic yards, measuring                     from the pre
sent   bottom up to grass level, while the additional                  tidal capacity
which will be simultaneously gained through dredging and scouring
the improved channel will amount to about 14,000,000 cubic yards;
and, deducting the one from the other,              we find a balance of loss of
446,000,000 cubic yards.
    But in order to judge of the effect of this loss, we must contrast it
 with the total amount of tidal water above the level of low-water
spring tides, which at present            enters   the estuary     from the sea at
the mouth of the        river, and which fills the tidal basin up to Run
corn.     This amounts       to about 733,000,000          cubic yards, to which
must be added        the   average   fresh-water drainage of the Irwell and
Mersey districts, which        I compute       at about 9,000,000         cubic yards

                        of Edinburgh,        Session 1884-85.                           91
in twelve hours, making a total scouring power of 742,000,000
yards.
     Compare      this  with the resulting        loss, and we find that not one-
twentieth,     which Mr Walker feared              to authorise at the Tay — not
one-tenth,    as   has actually taken place at the Lune             — but one-half of
the tchnle    seouriruj poicer would         be excluded   from    the   estuary of the
Mersey.
    With such       a  result as this,   I cannot for a moment doubt that the
promoters of the          Manchester Canal, and Mr E. Leader Williams,
their engineer, before going to Parliament                   for   the     present    Bill,
exercised     a wise     discretion in resolving to adopt the suggestion                 of
Mr Lyster of Liverpool to keep the new Ship Canal — i.e., the                          one
now before         Parliament — altogether        outside of, and therefore clear
of the land-locked estuary of the Mersey, so as no longer to ex
pose     the works to the rapid tides and land floods, as in the first
 scheme.
     The lesson, then,        as  it seems to me, which        is to be derived from
 all that has been said, is simply that where                there    is a conjunction
  of an extensive          land-locked    estuary,    with all, or with many of
  those conditions         favourable to silting which       I   have defined,      such a
  state    of matters should in all cases be             regarded      as more     or less
   dangerous, and especially so         in any river where       the depth is already
   reduced     by   the existence    of  a shallow bar     lying beyond       the mouth
   of the river, and exposed         to  a heavy breaking        sea,   from the action
   of which it cannot be protected by breakwaters.
      2.   On Evaporation and Condensation.                   By Professor Tait.
                                        (Abstract.)
       While     I   was   communicating       my Note on the Necessity              for  a
   Condensation        Nucleus at the last meeting of the Society, an idea
   occurred to me         which germinated (on my way home) to such an
   extent that       I  sent it off by letter to Professor J. Thomson that
   same    night.
      J. Thomson's       idea, which    I had   been discussing, was to preserve,
   if possible,      physical    (as  well   as  geometrical)      continuity      in   the
   isothermal      of the liquid-vapour       state, by keeping         the  whole    mass

  92                     Proceedings       of the Royal        Society
 of fluid in one state throughout.                   He   secured geometrical,         but not
 physical, continuity.           For, as Clerk-Maxwell showed, one part                       of
 his curve makes           pressure     and volume increase             simultaneously,        a
 condition essentially unstable.               The idea which occurred to me was,
 while preserving geometrical continuity, to get rid of the region                            of
 physical instability, not (as          I  had suggested        in my former Note) by
 retaining      Thomson's       proposed       finite    maximum        and minimum of
 pressure      in   the isothermal,        while      bringing    them infinitely         close
together so far as volume                is concerned,        and thus restricting          the
unstable part of the isothermal                    to a finite line         parallel    to the
pressure      axis; but,       by making        both the maximum             and minimum
infinite.     Geometrical continuity, of course, exists across an asymptote
parallel to the axis of pressures; so that, from this point of view there
is nothing        to object to.        On the other hand             there    is essentially
physical discontinuity, in the form of an impassable barrier between
the vaporous and            liquid    states,    so long at least        as   the substance
 is considered as homogeneous              throughout.
    It  appeared      to mo that hero lies the true solution of the difficulty.
 As we are dealing with          a  fluid mass essentially homogeneous               through
out,   it is  clear that we are not concerned                with cases in which there
is  a  molecular surface-film.
    Suppose, then, a fluid mass, somehow maintained at                            a  constant
temperature (lower than its critical point), and so extensive that its
boundaries may be regarded as everywhere infinitely distant, what
 will  be the form of its isothermal              in  terms of pressure and volume t
    Two prominent experimental                facts help us to an answer.
    First.    "We know that the interior of a mass of                 liquid mercury can
be subjected to hydrostatic tension                 of considerable amount without
rupture.        The    isothermal       must,      in this    case,    cross    the line     of
volumes     ; — and the      limit of   the tension would, in ordinary language,
be called the cohesion of the liquid.                  I am not   aware that this result
has been obtained         with     water free from        air; but possibly the experi
ment has not been satisfactorily made.                     The common experiment             in
which a rough measure is obtained of the force                       necessary      to tear   a
glass plate from the surface of water is vitiated by the instability                         of
the concave molecular film formed
    Second.      Aitken   has asserted, as a conclusion             from the results         of
direct    experiment,         that oven       immensely        supersaturated         aqueous

vapour will not             condense      without the presenco of a nucleus.                              This
may be a solid body of finite size, a drop of water, or fine dust-
particles.
   Both of         these facts        fit perfectly in to the                   hypothesis that the
isothermal         in question has             an asymptote parallel to                      the    axis of
pressure     the vapour requiring (in the absence of a nucleus) practi
              ;
cally infinite pressure to reduce                      it,
                                        without change of state or of
temperature,           to    a   certain       finite volume         ;     while the liquid,               also
without        change       of state or temperature,                 may by sufficient hydro
static     tension      be    made      to     expand         almost to          the same limit of
volume.
   This limiting volume                 depends,       of course,          on the temperature                  of
the isothermal;             rising with      it    up to the critical point.
  The physical, not               geometrical,            discontinuity         is    of course to bo
attributed        to   the    latent heat           of vaporisation.             The study of the
adiabatics, as modified by this hypothesis, gives rise to some curious
results.
  It     is   clear that the experimental realisation of the parts of the
here suggested curve near to the asymptote,                               on either side,          will   be   a
matter of great difficulty for any substance.                                 But valuable informa
tion may perhaps be obtained from the indications                                       of   a     sensitive
thermo-electric             junction      immersed           in   mercury        at     the top of             a
column which does not descend in                       a     barometer         tube of considerably
more than 30 inches long, when the tube                                  is   suddenly placed at               a
large angle with             the vertical      ;   or from those of             a    similar junction
immersed in water,               when     it   has    a   concave         surface     of great curva
ture from which the atmospheric pressure                             is   removed.
  Xothing of what                is   said above will necessarily apply when we
have     vapour and liquid in presence                         of one another, or when we
consider      a   small portion of either in the immediate neighbourhood
of another body.              For then         we are dealing with                  a   state of stress
which cannot, like hydrostatic pressure                           or tension, bo characterised
(so far as we know) by                a   single number.              The stress in these mole
cular films       is   probably one of tension                    in all directions parallel                to
the film, and of pressure               in   a     direction perpendicular to                  it         Thus

   The distribution of the                     species     obtained furnishes an important
 instance of the general rule that while pelagic                            forms belong to but
 few species,           each   of which has          a    wide range of distribution,            littoral
 genera are represented                    by very many species each confined within a
 narrow       area.       In the           case of the Cephalopoda this law has been
 expressed          by   Professor Steenstrup in his division of botli Octopodu
  and Decapoda into                     two groups,       littorales   and pclagici      ;
                                                                                             *   to   the
  former of these          belongs the genus Octopus of which                       a   distinct type
  was furnished           by almost every resting-place of the expedition.                            Out
  of about eighteen                 species     collected sixteen came not from dredg
  ing stations,         but from shore collections              ;   and of those obtained by
  the dredge        or trawl only two were found in depths exceeding                                  500
  fathoms.
    The genus Eledone furnished                       two new species       ;    one characterised
  by   a   short stumpy contour, and the other interesting as purporting
 to comefrom a great depth (1950 fathoms).
    The most striking novelties of the Octopoda are to                                       be found
 among the pelagic forms.                      The genus CirroUidhvs, hitherto known
 only from the coast                of Greenland,     has been found also          in   the Southern
 and   Pacific Oceans              ;     and the specimen           from the former locality           is
 remarkable         for its        size, which exceeds one yard in length.
   Allied          to    Cirroteuthis          is   the    new      genus   Amphitretus,          which

   Some    fragments which were picked                    up on the surface           of the
North Atlantic        are beyond all reasonable                doubt referable        to the
curious Alloposus mollis, Verrill.
   The two specimens which for the present constitute the new genus
Japetella    are of great      interest, and may be described                shortly as       a
kind   of pelagic       Eledone   ;   but    one of       them,   J.   diaphana,      shows
characters which approximate            it  to the Cranchiaeformes,          and   it seems
quite possible that it will ultimately prove not to be                   congeneric with
   prismatica.

   The Body is rounded, but               so   distorted by compression             that no
further details can         be given.       The      mantle-opening        extends      fully
halfway round the body, terminating                  a   little below and behind the
eye.    The siphon is long, evenly conical, and pointed,                     and extends
nearly halfway to the umbrella-margin.
   The Head is short, not            so  broad     as   the body, and with         eyes  but
slightly prominent.
   The Arms       are   unequal in length, the second pair being consider
ably the longest, and almost six times                as   long  as the  body    ;  they are
comparatively stout,         and    taper gradually.            The umbrella        extends
about one-fifth up the longest             arms.       The suckers are fairly close,
deeply cupped and marked with radial grooves, between which are
numerous very minute papilla?.                 About four       suckers on each lateral
arm opposite     the umbrella-margin are larger than the others; beyond
these they gradually diminish.                The hectocotylus is present in both
specimens,     and    is very minute (about 2 mm. long in the larger);
it is acutely pointed, and the median groove has three transverse
ridges.
   The Surface of the back, dorsal surface                    of head, and umbrella        is
covered    with irregular closely-set            warts, which attain a maximum
diameter of several          millimetres in the nuchal               region  ;  the    warts

Above     each eye there seems to have been a short cirrus, but these
have been rather damaged.

    The Body      is evenly        rounded, with        a   slight    depression     in the
median ventral line.             The mantle-opening extends less than half
way round the body, terminating                  immediately below the eye, and
further from it than from the             base of the siphon, which            is long and
pointed, has rather           a   small opening, and extends two-thirds                  the
distance to the umbrella-margin.
    The Head is short, and not so broad as the body                        ;   the eyes are
only slightly prominent.
   The Arms are subequal, nearly four                times the length of the body,
and taper evsnly to fine points.                 The umbrella extends one-third
 up   the  arms,     and is a little wider laterally              than dorsally.        The
suckers    are closely set, deeply cupped,                and marked with regular
radial grooves     ;   their biserial arrangement commences                  immediately
after the first.          One arm bears         a   supernumerary sucker in              the
larger specimen.            The hecfocotylus      is of the usual shape             and   of
medium length        ;   it  bears fourteen transverse        ridges,   each subdivided
into four minute papillae.             The circumoral lip is low and narrow.
   The Surface is covered with warts, which are largest                          and most
numerous on the dorsal surface                 of the body, head, and umbrella,
and dorsal aspects           of the arms, where they have                a   quadrifid    or
quinquefid     form, usually with           a  small wartlet in the centre, each
forming a figure like          a star or rosette.      Towards the ventral surface
and on the sides of the arms the warts are simple, and much smaller.
On the back are about ten long cirri, which are rough with small
warts, and above each eye is a very large arborescent                    cirrus with six
or seven smaller ones beside            it

     The Body is rounded, and wider behind than in front; depressed,
and with a well-marked             ventral median groove.        A   sharp narrow
ridge     extends along        either   side of the body      to    the    posterior
extremity.*         The     mantle-opening extends nearly half round               the
 body.     The siphon is of medium size, at first the lateral margins
are parallel       and then tapering rapidly       to a blunt point   ;  it extends
less than halfway to the umbrella margin.
    The Head is narrower than the body, and the              eyes  somewhat pro
minent, dorsally rather than laterally.
    The Arms are unequal, the lateral being slightly the largest, and
about three times as long               as  the body    ; they are     slender and
tapering.       The umbrella is longer than the length of the body                     ;
larger ventrally        than dorsally, and larger laterally       than ventrally.
The suckers         are   prominent     and   closely set; they are       altogether
larger on the lateral arms, and extend in a double row to the centre                   ;
the radial grooves are deep, and extend quite to the margins.                     The
hectocotylus      is absent.
     The Surface of the back of the body, head, and dorsal aspects
 of the umbrella and arms is covered with thick-set hemispherical
 pimples, which are also found on the inner side of the membrane
 between the two dorsal arms, and on the inner surfaces of the arms
 between the suckers.            They are smaller and more sparse on the
 ventral surface of the body.           A  large rough cirrus and a few larger
 pimples are found over each eye.             A  raised ridge passes backwards
 from the base of the siphon along the ventrolateral                margiu of the
 body,     meeting its fellow         of the opposite side at the posterior
 extremity.*

   The Body is rounded          with a median ventral furrow, and depressed
(ffrom     pressure).       The mantle-opening           is slightly   less   than    half
the circumference,        and terminates midway between the siphon and
the eye, and a      little behind the latter.          The siphon is comparatively
short and    conical, and extends one-third the distance to the umbrella-
margin.
    The Head is comparatively           broad, almost as broad            as the   body,
 and the eyes     appear to have been prominent.
    The Arms are unequal, the ventral                considerably shorter than the
 dorsal and     dorso-lateral, on an average six times          as  long as the body,
 stout and      tapering    very rapidly       towards the ends.         The umbrella
 reaches up     one-fifth of the length of the dorsal arms, and is               a  little
 wider between       the lateral and    a   little narrower     between     the ventral
 arms.    The suckers are not closely packed, and not enlarged                         on
 the dorsal arms,        notwithstanding         the   sex of the specimen.           The
 htebxctt/lued arm is very short, but the modified                   extremity is long
 and narrow,      with parallel   sides tapering only at the extremity to a
 blunt point ; a narrow fillet runs between the two marginal ridges.
    The    Surface      of the body is sprinkled              dorsally with      minute
 hemispherical warts, which become               smaller and gradually disappear
 on the sides      and lower surface       ;   they are also found on the dorsal
 surface of the head       and of the umbrella.           Above each pupil stands
 a small cirrus, immediately behind which is a larger one.
     The Colour is a      dull red on  the dorsal surface,       lighter and brighter
  below,  sprinkled with dull reddish-brown dots.

   The Body is rounded, depressed, and broader than long,                             with     a
marked but shallow median groove on the ventral surface.                            Mantle-
opening    extends about one-third               round the       circumference of the
body, terminating nearer to the funnel than to the eye.                        The siphon
is short and conical,         and   extends rather more than halfway                   to the
umbrella margin.
   The Head is small and the              eyes  prominent.
   The Arms are unequal, the order being                    3, 2, 4, 1 ; on an       average
they are nearly ten times             as  long    as the   body, and taper       gradually
to  very fine     points.        The     umbrella      is  very small, and          slightly
narrower dorsally than laterally.               The suckers are for the most part
small and closely packed            ;  the first four are arranged            in  a    single
row   ; in the    male     there   are four large         ones on    each    lateral      arm
opposite   the margin of the umbrella, beyond which                      they gradually
diminish.      The hectocotylus is very minute.
   The    Surf ice   is in general        smooth     ;  the back bears       a  few small
papillae, but owing to the compression of the specimens                      it  is  impos
sible   to  make     out their exact number.                 There are three minute
cirri over   each eye.
   The Colour is on the whole grey, paler below                  ;  this is due to dark
specks sprinkled more or less closely over a cream-coloured                        ground.
One specimen has         a    purplish     patch at either side         of the mantle-
opening.

   The Body is nearly oblong, but                     becomes      somewhat narrower
posteriorly.     The mantle-opening             extends nearly         one-third      round
the body, and terminates some distance below and                       behind the        eye.
The siphon is long and acutely pointed, and extends about half
way to the umbrella-margin.
   The Head is broader than the body, with large laterally prominent
eyes.

    The Arms are subequal, the two lateral pairs being                   a  little longer
 than the others     ;  on an average they are nearly three               times as long
as the    body, aud taper         rather rapidly        about the middle of their
length and then evenly to fine points.                The umbrella extends nearly
 one-third   up the arms, least along the dorsal                  pair.     The suckers
are sunken,      comparatively         large,   with     a  dark margin          and very
 well-marked radial grooves.             The first two in each arm are in a
single   row, owing       to compression of the arms laterally                 ;  there are
no enlarged     suckers on the lateral arms.                The hectocotylus is not
 developed.
    The Surface        of  the dorsum of the              body bears minute warts
scattered    here   and there      ;  over each        eye there     is  a  rather large
branched     cirrus, with a few small ones scattered                   round      it.   The
internal surfaces of the arms are covered with minute hemispherical
 warts, so as to resemble shagreen.
    The Colour is very dark grey, almost black on the dorsal surface
 and outside    the arms     ;  paler grey below and on the inner surfaces
 of the arms.      The dark covering of the body is not continued over
 the inner surface of the membrane              covering the two dorsal arms.

    The Bo<Jy is short and evenly rounded, with the merest trace of                        a
median     ventral     groove.     The      mantle-opening extends about half
round     the circumference,          and     terminates      halfway      between       the
siphon and       the     eye.    The siphon is relatively           long, conical and
pointed, and extends about halfway to the umbrella-margin.
   The Head is small, and the             eyes  rather prominent.
   The Arms seem to have been unequal, the lateral the longest, but
so   many have been            mutilated      that   it is difficult to      be certain     ;
they are about four times the length of the body.                        The      umbrella
extends about one-third            up the      arms,    the    furthest between the
lateral     pairs.     The     suckers      are   large,    close,    and    prominent,
with    a   narrow     margin     marked        off from     the basal portion         ; the
radial grooves extend to the margin and form notches in it.                             The
hectocotylus    is not present      ; the third right arm has been mutilated,

but   the stump shows no groove running                     up the outer ventral
margin.
   The Surface is smooth ; an interrupted ridge starting from the
base of the siphon passes backwards along the ventro-lateral margin
of the body, probably due to contraction.                   There are three      small
papillae above each eye.
   The Colour is a pale bluish-grey above, shading into cream below.

   The Body is rounded and depressed                (?  from pressure),    and with    a
slight ventral groove.           The mantle-opening terminates immediately
below and        behind     the eye.      The    siphon extends as far as the
umbrella-margin, and is acutely pointed
    The Head is broader than the body, and flattened by compression                      ;
the  eyes are    very prominent.
    The Arms are unequal, the third pair being much the longest and
stoutest   ; on the average        they are four times as long as the body              ;
they taper gradually at first and then more rapidly.                   The umbrella
is very smalL        The suckers are prominent, the first four being dis
posed    in  a single row ; and none are enlarged on the lateral arms.
The hectocotylus       is not developed.
    The Surface is smooth in general, but there are about twelve warts
on the back and sides of the body, and a large cirrus over each eye,
with several small        ones near it.
fc  The Colour       is deep     black, apparently owing        to  treatment with
osmic acid.

ably behind the latter.               The siphon is small and acutely conical, and
extends about one-third the distance to the umbrella-margin.
    The Head is narrow, and the                eyes are prominent, where they have
not suffered from compression.
    The Arms are subequal, eight times as long as the body                     ;  they are
very long and slender, the last property being more marked in the
females than         in the male       ; they taper more rapidly at first than near
the extremities,         which      are much attenuated,    where it extends almost
one-third      up the arms        ;  in the   females its extent is only one-sixth.
The umbrella is very wide, especially in the male.                     The suckers are
rather large, and closely set ;             in  the male a few suckers opposite          the
 umbrella-margin           are   slightly,     but not markedly,      larger than the
 others.      The hectocotylm is small, and has about ten small transverse
 ridges.
     The Surface appears to have               been smooth,  except for a few short
 ridges placed        longitudinally on         the back and sides  ;   but the skin is
  shrivelled      by the action of the spirit, so that it is difficult               to be
  certain.      A conical cirrus is situated above and slightly behind                 each
  eye ; but    in some cases this has been destroyed.
     The Colour is a stone-grey,              with dark pigment disposed in veins
  like those of marble on the dorsal surface of the body, head, and
   umbrella    ;  the male     is much darker, so that the marbling is almost
   concealed.       Traces of an oval spot are seen in front of and below
   the eye on     both sides of one female specimen and on one side of the
   other ; but     this spot is concealed by the dark colouring in the male
   even  if it   exist.

    The Arms are unequal, in the order                 1, 2, 3, 4 ;     about six times as
long    as   the body ; they are            very long and slender,            tapering     but
slightly.      The umbrella is small.             The suckers are small,         prominent
and closely set, and the first four stand                   in    a  slightly zigzag lino.

spirit  ;  there is one very small wart over each eye.

back and on the head.

    The Body is oblong, depressed, and bulges                       a little at the sides.
The mantle-opening         extends     about one-third round the circumference,
terminating about midway between                    the siphon and the eye.               The
siphon is short and small, extending scarcely one-third the distance to
the umbrella-margin.
    The Head is almost          as broad       as the  body   ;   and the eyes are large,
spheroidal, and prominent, with very small circular apertures.
    The Arms are subequal and short, compared                       with the body, being
 about three      times    its length; they taper gradually                  to moderately
 fine points.      The umbrella is large, extending about one-third of the
 arms.      The suckers are small and prominent, and arranged in two
 rows from the commencement                  ;  a narrow well-marked groove              runs
 across the     arm between       each two suckers           (possibly due to contrac
 tion).      The hectocotylus          is well-developed, short, and tapering
 rapidly to a blunt point ; the median groove has about ten transverse
 bars.     The circumoral lip is unusually thick.
     The Surface appears to have been perfectly smooth,                          but is now

    The Body is rounded, widening                 a  littlo posteriorly      ;   the ventral
groove is very          faint.     The mantle-opening      terminates just below the
eyes.    The siphon is bluntly conical, and extensively attached                          to the
umbrella      ;   it extends less than halfway to the umbrella-margin.
    The He ad is small, and the sides are entirely occupied                              by the
enormous         eyes, which are swollen and globular, but                with very small
palpebral openings.                The skin covering them is so thin that the
 dark pigment          within is distinctly visible.
     The Arms         are    unequal, the dorsal pair being the largest; on                    an
 average      they     are   four times as long     as  the body.         The umbrella is
 about      equally wide all round, except               that   it is     a    little shorter
 between         the    two     ventral   arms.     The suckers        are comparatively
  small,    prominent, and            separate ;  more     widely      in   one       specimen
  than in       the   other, probably owing to its being less contracted by
  spirit.        None     of the suckers on the lateral             arms     are      enlarged,
  notwithstanding the sex.                 The   hectocotylus    is well-developed ;            it
   is broad, and tapers rapidly              to an acute    point    ;  in  one specimen
   about    seven transverse         ridges  can  be counted      in   the   proximal half
   of the   median       groove ;   in the distal half and in        the other specimen
   they   are   indistinct.
       The Surface is perfectly smooth all over.
       The Colour is a pale purplish-pink            ; deeper    above than below.

      The    Body is spheroidal, very little longer than broad, and                            the

     The A mis are equal, and about twice            as   long     as  the   body    ;  they
 are very stout, and taper           gradually    to blunt      points;    their section
 shows    a  triangle projecting inwards, and a rounded surface                    looking
 outwards     ; the former much more            prominent than the latter.               The
 umbrella is wide, extending one-third up the arms, a little                        further
 dorsally than ventrally.         The suckers are comparatively small, closely
 set, and deeply cupped.            There is no trace of      a hectocotylus.

     The Body is short, rounded, and depressed                  ; blunt behind, and
 deeply grooved below.           The mantle-opening extends one-third round
 the animal, and terminates immediately below the eyes.                      The siphon
is short, acutely pointed, and extends less                   than     halfway    to    the
umbrella-margin.
    The Head is short, and nearly          as  broad  as the body.          The eyes are

    The Arms are equal, and about half              as  long again as the body;
they are short, stout,         and taper gradually         to    blunt    points.      The
umbrella extends halfway             up the arms,    — rather     more   in   the largest
specimen.       The suckers are round, prominent, and deeply cupped, and
there are about 30 on each arm.              The hectocotylus        is not developed.
    The Surface is smooth, with the exception of three cirri arranged
in a triangle over each eye. Behind the left eye in the largest
specimen     the skin is elevated into        a  number of small papillae, and            a
few similar ones are seen on the back of the medium-sized specimen.
    The Colour is      a   dull purplish-grey     above,   inclining      to pale ochre
below.

   The Body is of gelatinous consistency and semitransparent             ;  it is
somewhat    longer than broad, flat on the dorsum, and with the median
 ventral region raised into a prominent ridge, which gives the body a

siphon extends       almost to the margin of the umbrella, and                         is but
slightly   conical, with        a   broad    truncated extremity.             There is no
median septum in the branchial cavity.
   The Head is about         as  broad   as the   body   ;  the eyes are     rounded, and
prominent laterally,         the spherical lens protruding from the                  middle
of each.
   The Arms are unequal, the third being the largest, one quarter
longer than the body, and about one-third longer than the fourth,
which is slightly longer than the second, and this than the first, so
that the order of length is 3,          4, 2,  1.    The arms are stout, and taper
gradually to blunt points.             The umbrella extends about halfway up
the dorsal arms and one-fourth up the ventral arms, its extent                          being
intermediate between these extremes                 in the case of the other arms.
The suckers are round and               prominent,      and in many cases show                  a
double margin, due to           a  thin  membrane        surrounding        the   thickened
edge of    the    sucker;      they commence           one    sucker's breadth           from
the oral margin, and become gradually larger and wider apart as far
as the   middle of the arm, where they are one sucker's breadth apart,
after which they are smaller and closer, and towards the extremity
stand in contact.          There is no trace of       a liectocotylus.
    The Surface of the body appears to have been perfectly smooth;
it is covered with torn remains of epithelium, but there are neither
warts nor cirri.
    The Colour is        a   pale    yellowish-grey,       and   there     are    numerous
reddish-brown chromat ophores.

and prominent         ;  they consist of a larger darkly pigmented spheroid,
from which protrudes the opaque white smaller spherical lens.
   The Arms are unequal ; the longest (the third pair) are almost                         as
long as the body, and are nearly twice              as   long  as  the fourth, which
are the shortest,         the order of length being 3, 2,           1,4;      they taper
rapidly -to    fine points.       The umbrella is very small, extending about
one-fourth       up the dorsal and ventral arms, a little further up the
dorso-lateral and lateral arms, and being least developed                  in the space
between the ventral            and    ventro-lateral     arms.    The     suckers      have
assumed,    owing to shrinking, a quadrangular or triangular form                   ;  they
are prominent, and marked by two constrictions, one at the base,
separating them from the arm, the other rather more than halfway
up.     There is no trace of any hectocotylus.
    The Surface         appears    to have     been smooth originally,            but the
epithelium has been to           a great  extent stripped off.
    The Colour is very pale yellowish-grey, marked with numerous
longitudinally       disposed oblong chromatophores.

    The Body is oblong, about twice               as   long as broad,         and rather
broader than deep.            The mant/e-opening        is circular, but     little larger
than the base of the siphon, and its margins are continuous with two
ridges    on     the    sides   of  the   latter.  The siphon         is conical, and
slightly swollen         at  the tip   ;  it is not   connected      to the head         by
ligaments.        The fins are obovate in form, about four times as long
as broad, and thickened along the posterior margin.                           The dorsal
cartilage     is   saddle-shaped,      and elongated        from side      to side,     not
antero-posteriorly.
    The Head is directly continuous with,                  and somewhat narrower

 palpebral opening circular.

110                    Proceedings        of   the Royal Society
   The Arms are subequal, three and                a  half times as long as the body ;
they are slender,       and more resemble thickenings                  of the web than
independent arms         ;   they are thickest about two-thirds               the distance
along them, and terminate in               a  delicate slender tip, which projects
beyond the web.            The umbrella is a thin delicate membrane,                     very
largely developed, and when fully expanded its diameter was probably
nearly three times as large as its depth.                  It   extends from the tip       of
the ventral arm on either side backwards, and becomes gradually
narrower, so that it only extends along the proximal two-thirds of the
next arm, and passes beneath it to be attached in                     a cresceutic    line to
the outer surface of the web, which similarly passes backwards from
the tip of this arm       ;   this arrangement is usually described by saying
that the arm does not lie in the umbrella for the proximal two-thirds
of its length, but           is joined to it by a vertical                web,     but this
does not so correctly           represent    the disposition        of the    ] arts.    The
umbrella stretches          across from tip to tip of the two dorsal arms,
between       the    proximal        two-thirds       of    the    two    ventral      arms.
The    suckers    commence          about    1  cm.   from the oral margins; and
the first four lie pretty close together within a space of less than
2 cm.,    after which they gradually become further apart, an interval
of 2-3     cm. intervening        between each two           ;  about two-thirds along
the arm they stand closer together,                  and are very large,          but after
this they again become smaller, and stand in close contiguity                           with
each other.      The proximal suckers are small, prominent, and rather
soft,  and seem to contract              by folding        the lateral     margins over
towards each other, so           as  to present the appearance           of  a  half-closed
eyelid  ;   but the largest        suckers are firm and muscular, and consist
of   a  globular     basal      portion     imbedded in the arm             and a short
cylindrical    projecting        portion.       The   cirri    commence      between      the
fourth      and   fifth     suckers     as   very     minute      promiuences,        which
gradually increase          in length until halfway along                 the    arm    they
attain    a   maximum         length of      8   cm.,    after which       they decrease
rapidly, and cease opposite           the attachment of the web to the ventral
aspect    of the  arm.
   The Surface of the body has been entirely denuded of epidermis,
so that it is impossible to ascertain its nature ; the web is perfectly
smooth.
   The Colour, so far as preserved, is              a dull     madder.

     The Body is much distorted, but appears to have been subglobular
in form.        The mantle-opening is very small, and fits closely around
the     base of the siphon, which            is small and bluntly conical, with               a
 still smaller       pimple-like      extremity    ;   on either side there extends
 from the dorso-lateral          base a curved fold of membrane,               which loses
 itself in the mantle.            The fins     are about      equal in length to the
 breadth of the         body, narrow and pointed at the extremity, and
 thickened       towards the posterior margin.                The dorsal cartilage is
  elongated transversely.
      The Head is exceedingly short, and the eyes large and spheroidal.
      The Arms are subequal, and about three times as large as the body
  in the present        shrunken         condition     of the specimen       ;  they taper
  rather    rapidly    to slender points.           The     umbrella extends on             the
  dorsal    side of each arm to            within    1  cm.   of its extremity, whilst
   on the    ventral side      it  reaches     only four-fifths      along it   :  the arms
  lie in the umbrella         and are not united to it by any intermediate
   vertical   web.     The stickers       are about sixty to seventy in number,
   small and    subequal    ;  they are at equal intervals for the greater part
   of the arm, but        closer near the extremity.              The     cirri   are short,
   stout,   and conical,      the largest      2  mm.      in  length   ;  on the      ventral
   arms they       commence       between      the fourth      and   fifth   suckers,      and
   extend     to the fiftieth sucker, beyond which               there    are twenty-one,
   which gradually decrease           ;  on the dorsal arms         the   cirri   commence
   between the      sixth and seventh       suckers, and continue to the fifty-fifth,
   beyond     which there are nine.
       The Surface is smooth.
       The Colour of the body is creamy white, of the arms and umbrella
   deep   madder-brown.          The suckers and cirri are paler.

  The Body is almost entirely                  absent.     The    fin is   obovate    in form,
and thickened along the posterior margin, thin and membranous at
the extremity and along the anterior margin.                        The proximal end of
its cartilage is exposed, ami presents a long grooved articular surface.
One bronchia is visible, and presents the appearance                        of a spheroidal
nodule with meridional grooves.                  The mantle- opening is circular, and
closely embraces          the base of the siphon, which                is long, thin, and
conical.
   The Head is exceedingly short, and the eye appears to occupy all
the available space between the fin and the arms.
   The Arms are subequal, thick,                       rounded,    and     soft, and          taper
rapidly towards the extremities.                   The umbrella is attached directly
to the arms, which are somewhat more prominent on its inner than
on its outer surface ;         it   is attached to the dorsal aspect of every arm
almost to the tip, and to the ventral aspect for somewhat more than
half   its length, and at               its attachment is a         firm cartilaginous            (I)
nodule.     The suckers are about fifty-two in number, and commence
close to the oral lip, and the first half-dozen stand near together                       ;   half
way up the arms they are farther apart, and the largest are situated
opposite the attachment of the membrane                       to the ventral aspect               of
the arms   ;   they are prominent, but not so hard and firm as those of
C. magna.         There are faint radial markings upon them.                         The      cirri
commence on the dorsal arms between the seventh and eighth suckers,
and continue       till    the last  ;   on the ventral arms they commence                       be
tween the sixth and seventh,               and here also are continued to the tips
of the arms.         They begin           as   small papillae, gradually increase                in
length, attaining the maximum about halfway along the arms.
   The Surface       is    smooth.
   The Colour       is
                    a      deep purplish madder,            paler outside the umbrella
and on the fin.

    The Bo-iy is short, rounded, of gelatinous constituency, and                  semi-
transparent         The mantle adheres to the sides of the siphon, so that
the mantle-opening, which is single in all other known Cephalopods,
is here divided into two pocket-like openings,              which lie one beneath
each eye.       The siphon is very long and narrow, and extends forwards
anteriorly     to the margin of the mantle, for a distance almost equal
to the length of the body, and is           a  little swollen    at the extremity.
    The Head      is not marked off from the body, except by the posses
sion of the       eyes,  which     are situated near       together on the dorsal
                          A mphitretus  pelagieus,   Hoyle (f. )
 surface  ;  they consist of      a  larger basal spheroid, through the walls
 of which      pigment is clearly visible, upon whicli stands               a   smaller
 very prominent spheroid, white, opaque, and of glistening surface.
    The Arms       are equal, and rather more          than twice as long        as  the
 body  ; they are     slender, and taper at first gradually and then more
 rapidly   to comparatively blunt         points.     The umbrella extends more
 than two-thirds up the arms, and is thin, delicate,                transparent,    and
 much damaged.           The suckers are firm, muscular cup3 embedded                 in
 the softer tissue of the arms,          as  in Cirrote.uthis ; there      are about
  twelve placed at some distance apart on that portion of the arm up

   The Surface appears to have been quite smooth originally                        ;   there
is no sign of any cirri or warts.
     The Colour is a dull yellow, apparently due to preservation                          in
picric acid,       and the mantle and umbrella are thickly sprinkled
with small brown            chromatophores.

     My Dear Professor Tait, —           I    have   just got back from       an expedi
tion to the top of "Dodabettah"  (over 8600 feet), where have been       I
trying to get the spectrum of the zodiacal light under more favour
able circumstances          than are possible here.       I   cannot say that  I       have

                          of Edinburgh, Session 1884-85.                                     115
met with much success,                 for though, when the sky was clear, the
light was rather brighter than it is here at present, yet                         I have    seen
it quite   as   bright here.         Still    the spectrum      was fairly bright, and           I
don't think that         I  could have helped seeing bright lines if there had
been any       to see.        I  got no      photograph.         I made,      however,       one
observation, which            seems to me to be of importance, and recalls                       a
former observation           made    in  the West Indies.           We had sunset about
6  o'clock     (m.m.t.),      and by 7.15          or 7.30 all      trace    of the sunset
colours (reglow and all) had disappeared,                       and   the    Z.   L.   showed
very clear and a        little brighter than the milky way.                   It   was broad
below, but      much narrower above — being about 15°                       at the horizon
and only 6° at an          altitude of 30", and was distinctly visible up to
about 60*.       !Xow the point          that    I  noticed was this, that it did not
seem to set at      all, but only to fade out.             Even at    10 p.m.,    four hours
after sunset,    you could trace it up            as  high   as before,    and it had still
the same     shape — broad below and narrow                   above.     This     was not a
solitary observation,           but was repeated every night on which                       the
moon     and    the mists — of which             I  had   unfortunately too many             —
would permit        of it.      I suppose     that if this is really the       case,  it must
belong to the earth,          and not to the sua
    I did not confine myself to the Z.                  L., but did what          I  could at
 atmospheric      lines and at atmospheric               electricity.      I  made hourly
 observations    of the latter from          6  or  7 A.M. to 10 or 12 p.m., and have
 got a very   fair approximation to the curve of variations for the day
 between these      hours showing          a   maximum, very well marked, about
 2 p.m.,   and probably           a  minima near        7   a.m.   and   7   p.m.; but the
 evening observations           were so interfered with by mists that they are
not of much         use     for giving       points in the curve.            But the mist
 observations     seem to me by far the most interesting from another
 point   of   view,     viz.,     that    of    the   formation      of    thunderstorms.
Dodabettah,      being the highest point of the Niligres, was usually
above the clouds         in the afternoon, but          at times mist was blown over
from the    comparatively cool easterly side, and was dissipated                         as   it
reached the crest        of the hill, now in such          a  dissipating mist, the air
potential   teas below the          normal      for that      time    of   day.      On    the
other hand,     with a heavy condensing mist, the air potential                      icon far
above the average.           It  seems to me that this is direct evidence                    in
favour    cf the condensation theory of thunderstorms.                          I have    now
an immense mass          of electrical observations on hand, some of them of

11C                      Proceedings       of the   Royal Society
great interest, but        it is almost impossible         to get tbe time to make
certain ones necessary to connect them or to work them up.                        I  hope,
however, now that we have got a new Mathematical Professor, that
I   will  get a  little  more time for such work.
     By  the way,     I  have     discovered that the         " green   sun
                                                                             "
                                                                                spectrum
can    be   exactly represented         by combining        the spectrum of the sun
seen through a        fairly thick mist — the        sun's  disk being still visible —
and the spectrum of             a  moist atmosphere,         showing the rain band
strongly.       This would explain all           cases  in which the      sun has been
seen green.
     There is one point in regard to measuring atmospheric electricity
on    which     I   am      not quite      clear.    In using the water-dropping
collector, Thomson seems to say that you must have the reservoir
inside, so that part may be on one side and part on the other of the
neutral line.        I  have    tried comparisons between the lighted match
and the water-dropper entirely                outside, and they seemed to agree
 fairly well.      I   can get no good          exposure here      if I simply put the
 water-dropper at        a  window, and        I  would like to have it on the roof
 of the house, but will that do            ? — I remain, yours very sincerely,

  8.  On an Application of the Atmometer.                          By Professor Tait.
     The Atmometer is merely             a  hollow ball of unglazed clay, to         which
 a glass    tube is luted.          The whole is filled with boiled water and
  inverted so that the open               end of the tube stands            in  a  dish of
  mercury.      The water evaporates             from the outer surface of the clay
  (at a rate depending partly on the temperature,                    partly on the     dry
  ness of the air) and         in  consequence       the mercury arises       in the tube.
  In  recent experiments this rise of mercury has been carried to                    nearly
   25 inches during dry weather.               But it   can be    carried much farther
   by artificially drying the air round the bulb.                 The curvature of the
   capillary surfaces       in the    pores of the clay, which supports such a
   column of mercury, must bo somewhere                       about 14,000 (the        unit
   being an inch).           These surfaces are         therefore, according to         the
   curious result of Sir W. Thomson (Proc                      R. S. E.    1870,    p. 63),
   specially fitted to absorb moisture.              And   I  fouud, by inverting      over

                        of Edinburgh,    Session 1884-85.                       117
the bulb of the instrument           a large    beaker lined with moist filter-
paper, that the arrangement can be made extremely sensitive.                   The
mercury surface is seen to become           flattened the moment the beaker
is  applied, and      a  few minutes suffice      to give a large    descent,   pro
vided the section of the tube be small, compared               with the surface of
the balL
    I  propose    to employ the instrument           in this peculiarly sensitive
state for the     purpose of estimating the amount of moisture in the
air, when there is considerable       humidity      ;  but in its old form when
the air is very dry.         For this  purpose     the end of the tube of the
atmometer is to be connected,         by   a  flexible tube, with    a cylindrical
glass vessel, both containing mercury.             When     a  determination is to
be made     in moist air the cylindrical       vessel   is to be lowered   till the
difference    of levels of the mercury amounts to (say) 25 inches, and
the diminution of this difference        in  a  definite time is to be carefully
measured, the atmospheric temperature being observed.                     On    tho
other hind,     if  the air be dry, the difference of levels is to be made
nil, or even negative, at starting, in order to promote              evaporation.
From these data, along with the constant of the instrument (which
 must be determined for each clay ball by special experiments), the
 amount of vapour in the air is readily calculated.               Other modes of
 observation    with this instrument readily suggest themselves, and
 trials, such  as it is proposed to make at the Ben Nevis Observatory
 during summer, can alone decide which should be preferred.

                                  (Abstract.)
   While collecting materials for        a Text-book    of the Properties    of
Matter, the author had occasion to consult the very curious pamphlet
by Robert Hooke, entitled Lectures dc Potent ia Rettitutiva,             or of
Spring (London,     1678).    In this work there     is a clear statement of
the principle  of Synchronism, which was applied by Stokes to the
explanation of the basis of Spectrum Analysis.          There is also a very
remarkable statement       of the elementary principles of the modern
Kinetic Theory of    Gases, the first mention of which is usually        fixed

     2. On the Hexagonal System in Crystallography.                    By
                       Professor Crum Brown.
    The forms of the uniaxial       systems   may   be regarded    as derived
from forms, or parts of forms or combinations, of the regular system
by uniform expansion or contraction in a direction parallel to the
axis of the uniaxial system, i.e., normal to a face of the cube for the
tetragonal, and normal to     a face   of the octahedron for the hexagonal
system.    Faces, therefore, which are, in the regular form or com
bination,   at right  angles    to or parallel   to such axis, retain    their
relative angular position unchanged in the uniaxial form or combina
tion, and can be represented       by means    of indices referring to the
rectangular axes of the regular system, whatever be the amount of
 the deformation (expansion or contraction).          These faces are prism
faces, parallel to the axis, and basal faces at     right  angles to it.    All
 other faces have their angular position affected by the deformation.

These other faces are pyramid faces.                                Each pyramid face lies between,
and in the same zone                    with,    a   prism face and                 a basal face.        It   may,
therefore, be represented by the symbol

where s and t are             the symbols of the prism face and the basal face

the length          of a line parallel            to the axis after, to the length of the
line before deformation.                       We may put

           chester, &c.           Communicated by W. E. Hoyle, Esq., M.A.
    In     a memoir published              in the Chemical News, vol. xlviii. page
37, and the       Journal of         the Chemical Society,          1884, page 94,   I   gave
some account of a peculiar excretory product found                           in the Sepia'*
" liver."       The product was found to be albumin in pseudo-crystalline
aggregations         when examined under the microscope.                      These bodies
are not of a constant occurrence                    in this   organ of the Seyria.      Since
the publication of the above paper, which is a year and                          a half ago,
I   have made a thorough examination of this organ in Sepia, which
substaniate and extend the observations of Krukenberg,* Fredericq,t
and Jousset de Bellesme.               J
     After carefully dissecting it out of                   the cavity of the body        of a
fresh Sepia,        I  performed the following experiments: —
      1.  A   small portion          of the organ was placed             on   starch paste.
The       starch      granules       disappeared,        with the exception of           their
celluloid       covering, and on              treating with       water and testing        the
solution with Fehling's                solution, sugar in the dextrose form was
found.
      2.  The organ gave an alkaline reaction to litmus paper.
      3.  When      a small portion of the organ                was placed  in  a tube   with
 a  little oil and agitated, an emulsin                   was    produced ; — this emulsin
 had first an alkaline reaction,              and after some time became acid, owing
 to the formation of butyric acid and other acids of the fatty series.
      4. The action of          it on milk       was to render the     milk transparent in
 four      hours'    time.        15   cubic centimetres of milk were rendered
 transparent by          6  milligrammes of the tissue of the organ.
      5.   When     a  few drops of the secretion of this organ were examined

                      of Edinburgh, Session 1884-85.                           121
with chemical reagents under the microscope,            the following reactions
were observed     :—
    On running     in   between    the    slide and    cover-slip  a  solution of
iodine in potassium iodide, a brown               deposit was the result     ; and
on   running in concentrated nitric acid on another slide, containing
a  drop or two of the secretion,       a  yellow coloration was formed, due
to the    formation of xanthoproteic          acid.  These reactions show the
presence    of albumin in the secreted fluid of the organ.
                   Isolation of   the Ferment of the Organ.
    The process     I  followed to obtain the ferment or ferments in a
crude state from the fluid of the organ was that devised by               Wittich
and used by     Kistiakowsky (Pfliiger's Archiv fur Physiologic, vol. ix.
pages    438-459) in his researches on pancreatic ferments.              The pro
cess consists    in hardening the organ in alcohol for three days, and
then    cutting it up into very small pieces, extracting with glycerin
 and filtering.
    On the addition of alcohol to the filtrate, the ferment             is precipi
 tated.
    The action of this ferment on starch was its complete              conversion
 into dextrose    right-handed glucose, which was proved by Fehling" s
 solution ; and the formation of crystals (C6H1206NaClH20)                  with   a
 solution of sodium chloride, a distinction           between levulose or left-
 handed     glucose,    which   does   not     form  these   crystals    with   salt
 solutioa
    The action of the ferment on         fibrin from the muscular fibres of        a
 young     mouse    was    the formation       of leucia  and tyrosin; for on
 treating the fermented mass        with hot water and filtering, a solution
 is obtained    which contains leucin and tyrosin.             To this solution
 was added acetic acid, when acicular crystals are deposited insoluble
 in ether, but soluble in boiling            water, and gave     with    a neutral
 solution    of mercuric nitrate a red flocculent precipitate, which is
 characteristic   of tyrosin (C9HnN03).
    The acetic acid solution after precipitating          the tyrosin is evapo
 rated, when    leucin (C6H1SN02) is deposited in white shining plates,
 which melt at 98° C.         These shining plates of leucin, when heated
 with barium oxide, yield amylamine and carbonic dioxide,

     I obtained     by digesting        the   organ     itself  with   boiling   water     a
 filtrate containing leucin and tyrosin.                 The ferment has no        action
 on cellulose.       From these investigations            I am led to the     conclusion
 that the so-called      " liver   "
                                      of Sepia officinalis (the cuttle-fish) is        not
 a   true liver, — but     is  a pancreas, — for the juices of the organ                 in
 question are purely digestive in function, digesting starch, oil,                    and
 similiar   bodies   ; and transforming           fibrin into leucin       and   tyrosin.
 Then again albumin is found in its secretion,                 which is characteristic
 of the pancreatic       fluid of the higher animals, — no albumin                 being
found in the liver, for albuminoids are decomposed                      by that organ.
 This    organ    of the     Sepia digests       oil-globules, and the         secretions
 from   a true   liver are incapable of digesting fats               without the pan
 creatic fluid.
     No glycocholic and taurochloic acids                nor glycogen were obtained
from the organ, nor could the slightest trace of them be detected                       in
 the organ or its secretion.           The above investigations prove that this
 so-called   "liver" of the Cephalopod               is a true pancreas or digestive
organ.
     I may mention here that the leucin and tyrosin from the organ                       I
have mounted as microscopic slides.

               1.   Chromomictors.             P>y    Mr John Aitken.
     The instruments which we have called chromomictors, have been
designed     for the purpose of mixing              lights of different colours for
experiments in physiological             optics.      There are already      a consider
able number of instruments for this purpose,                   but none of them are
perfectly satisfactory.        We shall      here describe     one or two new forms
of apparatus        which     have    been    recently experimented          with,   and
though they may not be suitable for many colour experiments,                          yet
they seem to possess some advantages                over several of the instruments

                        of Edinburgh, Session 1884-85.                                 123
now in use.         The colours produced by them are very brilliant and
beautiful, and the secondary ones, such as yellow, blue, purple, are
brilliant and at once recognised by the eye, not being of that dull
low tone given by the rotation of coloured discs, while the white is
so pure and      bright that     it cannot be distinguished from that produced
under ordinary conditions.
     In  two forms       of this instrument           a  lens   or lenses are used for
 combining       the     colours.       One of these         instruments      is simply a
 camera obscura         with    a single lens.        Suppose now there is a bright
 white object in front of the lens.                The rays coming from any point
 of that object pass through all parts of the lens, some through the
 upper half and          some through the lower, after which they are again
 brought to a focus on the field of the camera.                     If, now,   we place in
 front of the upper         half of the      lens   a   transparent red screen, then
  half of the entering rays will b9 red and the other half uncoloured,
  and the image        will  be of a reddish hue.            Let  us now place in front
  of the lower half of the lens another screen of a different colour—
  say green; the       one-half of the entering rays will now be red, and the
   other half green, and these            being combined on the field we get the
   resultant    colour,    namely yellow.         In this way        we can combine on
   the field of the       camera     any colours we desire, and by altering the
   amount of the        lens covered by the different screens we can combine
    the colours in any desired         proportion.
       Another method of combining                 colours by means of lenses is to
   look at     the colours       through      a  short focused        lens, the   coloured
   objects   being     placed at    a  considerable distance.           Suppose we have
   a long    camera      obscura,     closed    at   one    end,   and   having    a  short
   focused lens     fitted into the other end.              If  we now make        a  small
   opening    anywhere near the axis of the lens                   in the far end of the
   camera, so as to      admit a little light, and look at the opening through
   the lens, we      shall  see a   round disc of light, but the disc is not seen
   exactly   in the direction of the opening,              but in the axis or centre of
   the lens.     Now      make another small opening              also   near   the axis of
   the lens, say on      the side opposite the first.          If we now look through
    the lens, we      shall not     see  two discs of light, but apparently only
    the one we saw        at first, but now it is brighter.             We  may go on     in
    this way    making a number of holes, and the light passing                    through
    them   will  be combined into          one round disc of light.             Now    place

124                            Proceedings            of   the    Royal Society
over these holes coloured transparent media of any                                    kind, or direct
them towards coloured surfaces, then on                                    looking through the lens
all the       colours         will    be combined                and we shall           see     the    resultant
colour.
      The following            is a short description of an instrument,                                which          I
have constructed                 on        this     principle,        and    used       with satisfactory
results.       It   consists         of     a   long wooden box about 70 cm.                            long by
12     cm. deep          and 12 cm. wide.                    In    one end of           the box         are two
round openings, placed                      a   short distance apart, one over                        the other.
The lower opening has a diameter of about                                         5 cm.,      and has         three
radial bars fixed in                 it,   dividing        the    circle into three equal sectors.
Into     these      divisions         are fitted pieces               of   glass of different           colours.
What        these    three       colours are         I      shall presently state.                The upper
opening        is   of   a     less diameter than the lower, and                           is   covered       with
clear glass     ;   the purpose of this opening will be referred to presently.
     Each      of the sectors                in the lower opening                  is   provided        with        a
shutter to regulate                  the amount of light                   passing      through it.           The
upper opening             is   also provided with                 a    movable shutter.               Into     the
opposite      end of the box are fitted two eye-pieces, so that,                                  if   desired,
observations can be made with both eyes at the same time.                                                     The
lenses      of the eye-pieces                   are similar       to   a    Ramsden eye-piece, and
each consists            of two plano-convex lenses, mounted at one end of                                       a
tube about 30 cm. long.                         These      tubes slide in sockets fixed                  in    the
end of the box.                The shutters for regulating the quantity of light
entering the apparatus are each mounted on the end of                                           a   horizontal
shaft, which             is   pivoted at the front end of the box,                               and passes
back to the end next the eye-pieces, where levers are fixed to the
end of each, so that each shutter can be moved                                           separately.           By
this means the amount of the different colours may be conveniently
regulated by the observer,                          while his eye          is   applied to the instru
ment.         For   some        observations an opening of                        5   cm. for admitting
the different        coloured              lights    is   too large, as      it   separates      the colours
too    far;   stops of different sizes are therefore provided                                   for reducing
this opening to the size necessary to suit the experiment.
     The colours produced by this instrument are brilliant and beauti
ful, reminding            one of the varied and delicate colours produced                                      hy
selenite      plates and polarised                  light, and by          it   we can easily combine
the colours so as to give white.

                            of Edinburgh, Session 1884-85.                                         123
      In    making white there is, however, always                       a   difficulty in saying
 when it is white, as there seems to be a range of tints, all of which
  seem nearly white.                 To overcome this uncertainty,                 the    instrument
  is    so arranged         that either of two methods may                       be employed          to
  supply         the    eye   with      a   standard     of   white       light of       the   correct
  brilliancy,         with which         to compare the         compound white.               By one
 arrangement the whole field                     can be      alternately filled with white
 light,       or with     the white produced by the coloured lights.                          By this
means          a very true      white can be produced.               The adjustment            can be
made          so that no     difference can be detected whether the illumination
is the        result of the coloured lights, or of the                 white light.          Another
plan is         to   fill only one-half        the field with the          coloured       lights, and
 the other half with white light.
        For making           these      comparative       tests,    the      opening        over    the
  coloured glasses is used, and                  a  horizontal     division       is placed in the
  box, dividing it into two from                     end   to end.         This dividing        screen
   is hinged at the front end, just                  above    the opening           filled with the
    colours.        The other end of the screen next the eye-pieces is moved
    up and down            by means        of  a  lever placed       outside the box;            when
     the end of the screen next the eye-pieces                 is raised, the coloured lights
     fall    on the eye-piece,        and when it is lowered the coloured lights are
      cut off, and white       light from      the upper opening enters the lens.                  The
      amount of white         light entering this opening requires to be carefully
       regulated,     by means of the shutter, to the same brightness                           as  the
       white produced by the colours before a match can be made.                                When
       properly adjusted         it is very difficult      to tell whether we are looking
       at natural white,       or the white of the combined colours.
           When we wish to illuminate               only one-half of the field with white
       light, the    horizontal screen is lowered            till it    is half-way         across the
       lens, and the      division must be carried up to the stop in front of the
       lens.     When this is done, the upper half of the field is illuminated
       with white      light, and the lower with the combined colours, and                             if
       the eye    is kept steady        it is simply     a question         of very nice adjust
      ment     to make      a   perfect match between              the     two halves, and the
      field made      to look      like    a  white disc with         a   black bar across the
      middle.       When half          the field is filled      with white light             the   con
      ditions    are    very    favourable       for observing the            various       combined
      colours   on the other half; the comparison seems to make them more

  12G                     Proceedings         of   the   Royal Society
 distinct.     This    is particularly the case with delicate tints, as                     they      are
  not easily distinguished if not contrasted                     with white.
    Other forms of apparatus              with      lenses may be used            for  combining
 colours   ; an    ordinary       telescope     answers         fairly well, but        an opera-
 glass   will not      do.     The colours to            be   combined are held             close to
 the front of the object-glass            end of the tube,           if they   are   transparent,
 such as glass plates        ;  if  the colours are opaque,             they are placed            in   a
 good    light,    and the         tube    directed         towards      them.      On     looking
 through the eye-piece we get the result of combining the                                   colours
 iu the     proportion in which              they are exposed             to the end         of     the
tube.      The object-glass          of the telescope            is not necessary        for these
experiments.          The lenses of the eye can also be made to combine
the colours without any assistance, but the results are not very
satisfactory.        If we fix the coloured transparent media with their
edges close to each other on a piece of glass, and hold them very
 near to the eye,          confining the entering light to                  a small angle,          we
shall then     see the     colours change through the different combinations,
as  they are moved across the eye.
    With    regard to the selection            of the colours for these experiments,
a few    words    are necessary.          We may of course select any colours we
please, and the instruments               will combine          them    for us, and show us
the resultant colour or sensation.                      We shall find that there               is  an
infinite variety of colours which, when combined in proper propor
tions, will give us white.                 If, however,           we   wish to arrange            the
apparatus,      so   that     it will not only give us white, but                        will also
produce      all possible colours,           with their shades and tints, then the
only three colours which,              so   far  as    I  am aware,       will   produce       these
results,   are red, green, and violet.                 With      these three colours        we can
make     white and all colours,               such      as   yellows, blues,        and    purples
of their different shades and tints, but by no combination of colours
with which       I  am acquainted can we make red, green, or violet.
    In selecting      the colours for the instruments,                 I took   for red    a  ruby-
red   glass,    dark enough           to   give      only     a    band in the         red    when
examined with the spectroscope                   ;   for green,      a glass   which passed         a
narrow band of light in the green of the spectrum,                                and    is about
what is known            as    emerald     green ; and for violet               a   glass    which
passed only        the   light of       the violet         end     of the spectrum.            It  is
impossible to describe these colours more definitely by means of the

                                of Edinburgh,               Sessi&n       1884-85.                               127
lio.es in the spectrum,                    as the bands           have not a definite boundary.
It     will     be     observed       that neither the yellow                         nor the blue light
of the         spectrum         passes into the box, neither of these colours being
passed by any of the glasses.
     There is considerable confusion as to the name3 of the colours
at    the violet end of the spectrum,                        which for clearness                     I   must refer
to    here.         The colour of the violet glass in the apparatus                                           is often
called dark              blue, while the colour that is generally known as violet
has a reddish hue in                  it,
                         and when examined with the spectroscope
is found to have light of both ends of the spectrum. This reddish-
violet       is   therefore not the violet of the spectrum, but                                 is   a   compound
colour.           It     is   desirable that we should not give the same name to
two different colours, and, as the spectrum    an excellent standard           is
of colour, we had better call by the name of violet that colour which
corresponds to the violet of the spectrum.                                     It   is   no objection to this
alteration to say that this colour                          is    often called dark blue, because,
though         it   is   sometimes        called blue, yet          it    is   not the colour which                  is
 most generally recognised                       as blue.        All     blues contain green, and can
 be produced by mixing the violet of the spectrum with the green.
 The blues have               a   wide range, and run into violet on the one side
 and into green on the other.                            Prussian blue, for instance, contains
 as much green as                 violet   ;     while ultramarine blue contains compara
 tively little green.                It    is,   therefore,       desirable         that the colour, which
 has neither green                nor red in          it,   and    which contains               only the light
 of the violet end of the spectrum,                          should be called violet.
       In experimenting with                       the      apparatus          above          described,        some
 practice       is    necessary      to enable           the observer           to keep the eye steady
 in the correct place, as any movement                                 tends to cause changes in the
 colour.          To overcome              this difficulty another                  form of apparatus has
 been        constructed without                   lenses.         It    consists        of    a     rather large
 camera         obscura,          divided        vertically into two compartments                               by   a
 thin metal            partition.          One compartment                 is   lighted by an opening
 in    the     top,      provided with            a    shutter to regulate                 the brilliancy            of
 the    light falling on             a     piece      of white paper placed on the bottom
 of     this    compartment.                   The other compartment                      is    lighted         by   a
 large    circular window,                 also in the            top.     This window                   is   divided
 into   three sectors, and                is   glazed     with red,        green, and           violet glasses.
 Each    sector is provided with                      a   shutter to regulate                  the amount of

 128                  Proceedings        of the Royal Society
light of   each colour entering and              falling   on   the white       paper at
the bottom of this compartment.                 An opening is made in one side
of the box, and arrangements made, so that while light is excluded,
the observer      can look down on the bottom of both                   compartments
of the box, and observe the colour of the illumination                   on the paper.
When     one eye is placed directly in front of the             thin metal partition
it can see the bottom of both compartments at                  once, divided by the
thin line of     the   partition.        The   paper    in the    one    compartment,
lighted by white light, is thus only separated                  by   a fine   line, from
the other one illuminated          by the coloured lights, and comparison is
thus easily made.        When       working      with this colour box it         is  taken
outside or placed at an angle of about 45 degrees at an                 open window.
By opening      the   shutters over         the   coloured glasses      to the proper
degree, the    paper on the bottom of this compartment may be                        made
to appear of any colour or           tint   we may desire.       The other compart
ment of the box is illuminated with white light, and the shutter is
opened to the desired        amount to provide the eye with              a  standard      of
white.
   When    the three colours are combined              in   the   proper proportions,
so perfect a white can be produced with                    this apparatus that it is
impossible to distinguish between the standard white and the white
produced by the         three     brilliant     colours.     In order      to   get this
perfect match of the two whites, great care must be taken in the
construction of the apparatus.               The surface of the interior of the
box must be dead white          ;  if  there is the smallest     amount of polished
surface   reflection,    such     as    that   given by most         paints, then the
field of observation will not be flat, but will be differently tinted at
different points.      If   the surfaces      in the interior were perfectly flat,
these reflections would not interfere with the result; but, owing to
the   unavoidable       curvatures         of these     surfaces,    the    colours     are
unequally reflected       to the      paper.     The source     of the illumination
required for working          this box ought to have             as   wide     an angle
as possible.      A bright sky          does very well, but        if the sun shines
on the instrument, ground glass or               thin white     paper must be hung
up in front of the glasses.
   One advantage        of this colour box is the            ease   to  the    eye    with
which the observations            can     be made, and the secondary              colours,
such  as  yellow, blue, and purple, produced by it are brilliant.                   If  we

                             of Edinburgh,           Session         1   834-8    o.                          123
open the red and green                       shutters, the colour produced is                       a    canary-
yellow of considerable                 brightness and strength.                   To        get this bright
yellow we must be very careful in the selection                                of the glasses in the
window, and also be           very certain that every ray from the violet glass
is excluded           by its shutter, as a very little violet light causes the
yellow to grow pale and change to white.
  An interesting and beautiful                       experiment can be made with this
box.      If, after having adjusted                  the colours to produce white,                             we
introduce          an opaque          body into the compartment lighted with the
coloured          glasses,     there     is at once         formed a striking                   display         of
prismatic-like colours.                  The paper on the bottom of the box is no
longer        white, but covered with most                       varied and                 brilliant     hues,
caused        by the penumbra                 of the opaque              body being lighted with
different         colours      on      the     different    sides.          These effects               can     be
intensified         by placing over the coloured glasses                      a   shutter with three
round openings               cut in    it,   so as to separate the sources of the different
coloured lights.              The colours         on the bottom of the box                     will now         be
found to be           further    separated, more distinct, and                   fuller in      tone.         The
form of the shadow-producing                      body may be varied, but perhaps the
 most     beautiful          effects are got when          it   is   in the shape of            a   flat ring,
 placed       a   short distance from              the     paper.           With that form                 it   is
 interesting         to follow the manner in which the different colours are
 produced.            Confining our attention to the light                    passing          through the
 centre       of the      ring, we can distinguish                   on the       bottom of the box
 three       overlapping circles of light — one                  red, another green, and the
 third violet       ;   where the red and green                  overlap      a    brilliant yellow             is
 produced       ;   where the green and the violet overlap are the blues                                        ;
 and     the      red and the violet give the purples;                        while in the centre,
 where        all three circles overlap, white                  is   produced.              The purity of
 these       colour effects      is    increased     by having the inside of the box
 painted       of   a   dull black,     as    this destroys all internal reflections which
 would        dilute and weaken the colour effects.                         In order that           the same
 apparatus may do for both kinds of experiments, the inside of the
 box     is    provided with two folding screens, each the same size                                     as   tho
 side    of the compartment              ;    one side of each screen                  is   black and the
 other    white.         By folding          the screens one way, the inside of the box
 is   made        all white, for experiments in combining colours                                ;      and by
 folding them the other way, the interior                        is      made all black, to prevent
      vol.     xui.                                                                                  1

 shadow experiments.
    These colour experiments explain          why there is so little appear
 ance of coloured    light in our Cathedrals,       even when there is       much
 coloured light entering through the stained glass windows, and they
show us that we might glaze the windows with the most                 brilliantly
 coloured glass,   and yet the light in the interior            might be quite
white.
    It is hoped these      colour-combining      instruments     will be   found
useful for teaching physiological        optics, for experiments on colour
perception,    ami also    for measuring the        qualities   of lights    from
different sources.      The possibility of making        a perfect match, and
the extreme    nicety of the adjustment necessary to produce a perfect
balance, indicate that these       instruments are capable of considerable
accuracy.
2.   On Chlorophyll       from the Deep       Sea.      By W. W. Hartley,
               F.R.S., liuyal College of Science, Dublin.
   The shells of certain molluscs which are obtainable on the sea
shore   between tides are seen to be more or less coloured green.                I
have noticed a fine rich colour on the operculum           of a Turbo from the
Pacific Ocean, which had been killed and the shell preserved                  dry.
The shell has    a high polish, the colour is the rich green of an ivy
leaf, and the pigment is contained in the shell material.             When the
mollusc dies, and the shell is left exposed to air, light, and water, the
green becomes a brownish-yellow          colour.    Some specimens of spirit,
which hail been poured        off  shells and fragments of coral obtained
by dredging in deep waters, were examined by me for                   Mr   J.   Y.
Buchanan.       He informed       me  that some of the shells were of            a
beautiful green    colour,   but there was no appearance         of any growth
of algae  adhering to them.       When placed in spirit, the colour became
dissolved.     After evaporation of the spirit,       a mixture of green and
yellow pigments was found in the residue, and nothing else.                   The
green    pigment was      insoluble,    while  the   yellow    appeared    to   be
slightly   soluble in water.       On shaking the substance         with hydro
chloric acid and ether,     I  did not at first get Fremy's reaction        ; but

                        of Edinburgh, Session 18S4-85.                               131
  subsequently      shaking ether with the strongest hydrochloric               acid and
 then adding       an ethereal solution of the colouring matter,               a  bluish
 aqueous      solution     was formed,      and a brownish-yellow         solution      in
 ether.     The general reactions indeed were those of blue chlorophyll,
 which has been described by Sorby as existing in the leaves of land
plants and       in certain    sea-weeds.     The yellow substance        was     one of
 the colouring      matters which result from the alteration of chlorophyll.
On heating the         alcoholic solution with zinc dust in          a sealed    tube at
 100'    C., the green colour became very much brighter, and the
yellow being removed the tint was much purer.                      After four hours
the liquid        was partially decolorised. The spectrum of the solu
tion was carefully examined, the details of the examination here
follow.
    Spectrum        of a       Green   Colouring     Matter    derived from Ocean
Shells. — The shells          were   preserved  in alcohol, which dissolved the
colouring matter.            A  bottle was received    from Mr    J.  Y. Buchanan in
January 1884, which bore the following label :—
               "S.S. 'Dacia,'        17th Nov. 1883.
               Lat. 33'42' N.          Long. 14°T      VV.
                Depth,     533 fathoms.      Coral Patch."
    The original         liquid,   which    measured     about three     ounces,     was
  examined      just   as   it was poured from        the   bottle, and again after
  undergoing concentration            by evaporation.      It  was   of a pale green
  colour and      slightly yellowish, but after being        concentrated    it became
  a dull olive-green.
     The spectrum was observed               with    a small spectroscope         of the
  usual form, fitted with         a compound      prism capable       of dividing tho
  D lines   ;  the measurements        were made upon a divided arc         ; a  pointer
  shaped    like   a broad finger was placed       in the eye-piece.      One side of
  the  finger was perfectly straight and vertical, the other was curved
  and brought        to a fine    point like a pen nib     ;  when this was moved
  over an absorption           band, a reading was      taken as soon      as   the fine
  point ceased to be visible.           The arc measurements         were reduced      to
  wave-lengths and oscillation frequencies by means of two interpola
 tion curves obtained from those flame and spark spectra recommended
 as   affording      good lines of reference        in  the   Report    on Spectrum
  Analysis, in the volume published by the British Association for the
  year 1881     :—

the green colouring matter from liquid No. 10 was insoluble in
water,    but soluble in alcohol and ether; boiling with dilute
sulphuric acid showed that it was not                 a  glucoside,    as  it had subse

feeble   action on Fehling's           solution.     Both specimens         No. 12 and
No.  7  yielded yellow residues soluble in water, which reduced copper
solution at once on boiling.
   According to Sorby, blue chlorophyll                 in strong solutions shows
three bands at the red end of the spectrum,                     the least refrangible
being the most intense (Proc. Roy. Soc, vol. xxi. p. 442).                        I have
observed only one band in solutions corresponding in strength
to the liquids numbered 12, 10, and 7, when examined                         in the  same
way, and it is that which is figured in the paper just quoted                        ;  the
bands    in the yellow and            green    are due    to the colouring        matters
derived from chlorophyll.
   An examination        was made         of living green sea-weed brought out
of the Irish Channel by trawlers.                The fronds being thin and filmy,
can be easily     laid upon glass and placed             before the    slit of  the spec
troscope    to be examined in layers of different              thicknesses by direct
sunlight.      One thickness showed              a dark band in the red, with an
extension towards the orange, which was undoubtedly the second and
weaker band of blue chlorophyll              ;  but there were no traces of bands
in the    orange    and green.          The spectrum ended           just beyond the
magnesium      green triplet     b.     Two thicknesses       caused the band to be
much increased       in density     ;  no band in the orange       ;  green practically
unaltered, the end of the spectrum nearly approaches                      the triplet in
the green.      Three and four thicknesses transmitted no trace of red,
but only the green and part of the yellow rays.                        No band in       the
green was observed        at all.

ether, no other bands were seen with distinctness                   ;   but an alcoholic
solution of the colouring matter from the                same specimen,         and much
stronger, exhibited three absorption bands.
    Puredry ether does not take up            so much colouring matter as alcohol,
and   it appears as    if the ethereal solution contained but two              substances,
namely, bine chlorophyll, and a yellow body which causes absorption
only beyond the          b group.       The spectrum of the ethereal solution
very closely resembles            that of the      fronds of    the     living    sea-weed,
while the alcoholic solution differs therefrom.

      I am indebted to Mr John Murray for the following                              note,  in

 answer to a query as to the possibility of floating molluscs                 containing
 colouring matters of the nature of chlorophyll, and after                  dying falling
 to the bottom of the ocean        : —
     " The                        matter from the           '
                                                                          533   fathoms,
             green   colouring                                 Dacia,'
 must have come,        I  think, from the corals and other organisms                lying
 on the bottom, and         not from the floating molluscs or other surface
 organisms."
     The occurrence     of chlorophyll      in the depths of the ocean          does not
 necessarily    imply     the presence      of plant life, since spongilla have
 been found coloured by this substance                 (Ray Lankester, Quarterly
 Journal of Microscopical         Science,    1882, p. 253), but        it  opens  up the
 question whether rays of light are at all necessary for its production.
     The penetration of light to the bottom of the deep sea is a possible
 if not  a  probable phenomenon.             It it true that in        the clear   waters
 of Lake Leman photographic dry -plates                 are affected      at mid-day     at
 no depth beyond        1 20 fathoms     ;  but Messrs Fol and Sarasin are led
 to suppose that the greater         transparency of sea-water will admit of
 the   extreme    limit of luminous rays reaching                 a  still lower level.
 (" Sur   la Penetration de la Lumiere du           Jour   dans les    Eaux du Lac      de
 Geneve," Comptes Rendus, xcix. p. 783.)
     Facts at present at our disposal do not warrant the assumption
that light cannot pass beyond this depth, for though the violet and
ultra-violet certainly do not,        as   proved by Messrs Fol & Sarasin, yet
water may transmit the green rays under circumstances which enable
it  to obscure the rest of the spectrum — the less refrangible portion by
absorption, the more refrangible partly by absorption and partly by
scattering.     (See   M.   J. L Soret's    "Memoir Sur la Couleur de l'Eau,''
Journal     de Physique, 2nd series, vol.         iii.  1884.)
    The reason why we have very little evidence                     at present    of  the
penetration of great depths by green rays is owing to the fact that
gelatine    emulsion containing silver bromide is very slightly sensitive
to    such light.     It' any rays are necessary              for the production       of
chlorophyll in plant life, which is extremely doubtful, they are those
in the yellow and green lying between                the solar lines      D and E, this
portion of the spectrum being transmitted                  bj    the substance.      We
have accordingly no grounds for the conclusion that because chloro
phyll   has been found at a depth of 553 fathoms,                 even   if the pigment
be produced in situ, therefore          light   has not penetrated           so far, and
has not operated in its formation.

        3.    On the Termite         as the Tropical          Analogue       of the
              Earth-Worm.          By Professor Henry Druininond.
       My object in this paper is to call attention to            a  few observations
      which   occurred to me during        a recent    scientific survey of part of
      Central   Africa, regarding the larger economy of tropical nature.
     And    I  wish especially, and with much deference, to attempt to
     supplement      a  well-known theory of Mr            Darwin's,      by   bringing
    forward another claimant         to the honour of being, along with the
    earth-worm, the leading organic agricultural and geological                agent in
    nature.
       By means of inorganic agencies        — the air, the     frost, and the rain —
    nature     has  no difficulty in any part of the world               in preparing
    surface films    of disintegrated soil for     the growth of vegetable          life.
    But though the elaboration            of a surface     film by these agencies
    would     produce crops for     a  few years,   a  much more radical system
    of agriculture     must   be in operation before a prolonged succession            of
    crops can     be   kept up from year        to   year,   and from      century to
    century.     The lower layers of soil,       exhausted      with bringing     forth,
    must be constantly transferred to the top; while the upper layers,
    restored, disintegrated,      and saturated     with the fertilising products
   of   organic    decomposition,     must be lowered down to where                  the
   rootlets spread themselves        in the under soil.       The patient series of
  observations by which Mr Darwin established the conclusion that
  this function      was discharged by      the earth-worm are too well- known
  for repetition.        On every      acre of   land in England,         Mr Darwin
 calculates that more than 10 tons of dry earth are passed through
 the bodies      of worms,     and brought to the surface every year; and he
assures      us  that the whole soil of the county must pass and repass
                                                      " The plough," he says, "is
through their bodies every few years.
one    of the most ancient and most valuable of man's inventions ;
but long before he existed the land was, in fact, regularly ploughed
by   earth-worms.          It  may be doubted whether there are many other
animals      which have played        as important a part      in the history of the
world as have these lowly organised creatures."*
    Now, while admitting to the fullest extent                     the influence      of
worms       in countries       which enjoy a temperate         and    humid climate,

it   can scarcely be allowed that the same influence is exerted,                                  or   can
possibly be exerted, in tropical lands.                         No      man          danger
                                                                              was less      in
of taking a provincial                view of nature than                 Mr Darwin, and in
discussing the earth-worm he has certainly collected evidence                                       from
different       parts of the globe.                 He refers,        although sparingly,              and
with less than his usual wealth of authorities, to worms being                                    found
in Iceland, in          Madagascar,        in the United States, Brazil, New                      South
Wales, India,           and     Ceylon.         But his        facts,       especially
                                                                         with   regard
to the influence on the large                  scale of the worm in warm countries,
are few or       wholly wanting.               Africa, for instance, the most tropical
country     in the        world, is not referred                 to     at all ; and       where       the
activities of worms in the tropics are described,                               the force         of the
fact is modified by the statement                     that these are only exerted                during
the limited number of weeks of the rainy season.
      The fact    is,   for the greater portion of the year in the tropics                       the
worm cannot operate at all.                       The soil, baked into              a   brick by the
burning sun, absolutely refuses                      a   passage to this soft and                delicate
animal.         During      the      brief period of the rainy season worms                            un
doubtedly carry on their function                        in some of the moister tropical
districts   ;    and     in the sub-tropical               regions      of South America            and
India worms, small                  and    large,    appear      with     the   rains in endless
numbers.          But, on the whole, the tropics proper seem to be poorly
supplied with worms.                  In Central Africa, though               I     looked for them
often,  I   never saw          a    single worm.           Even when the rainy season set
 in, the closest search failed to reveal any trace either of them or                                    of
 their casts.      Nevertheless, so wide                 is   the distribution       of this animal,
 that in the moister regions even of the equatorial belt one should
 certainly expect         to   find it.        But   the general fact remains.               Whether
 we consider the comparative poorness                          of their development, or the
 limited    period during which they can operate,                             the    sustained per
 formance        of the agricultural function by worms, over large areas in
 tropical countries,           is   impossible.
      Now, as this agricultural function can never be dispensed with,                                   it
 is   more than probable that nature will have there commissioned
 some other animal to undertake the task.                               And   the animal we are
 in search of, and which             I    venture to think equal to all the neces
 sities of the case,           is    the termite, or white ant.                   This animal,         the
 popular name of which                    is   misleading, seeing that          it      belongs to the

                         of Edinburgh,         Session 1884-85.                         139
 Termitiche, and is        not an ant at all, is a small ant-shaped insect, with
 a bloated,     yellowish-white abdomen, and a somewhat large thorax,
oblong-shaped,        and in colour         a disagreeable      oily brown.      There are
three or      four different species of termites, and their geographical
range is probably second in extent only to that of the earth-worm.
The white ants are found in enormous numbers throughout the
length and breadth               of Africa      and     India; they occur in South
America, Australia, and Ceylon                 ;   and every sub-tropical         region is
more or less infested by them.                 The insects themselves,          owing to a
peculiarity in their habits, are                 rarely seen, but throughout           large
districts in Africa the ground is              literally living with them.          On the
Tanganyika         plateau      I have   camped at night on ground which was as
hard as adamant,            and as innocent of white ants apparently as the
pavement         of St Paul's, and wakened next morning to find all the
 wooden articles          in my tent almost gnawed to pieces. The termite
 lives almost exclusively upon dried wood, and it is upon a peculiarity
 in its mode of securing this that its agricultural                  and geological func
  tions   largely depend,         so far at least as Central Africa is concerned.
      I have    just said that the white ant is            never seen above the surface
   of the ground       ;  and yet, without         coming to the surface,         it cannot
   secure     the decaying         branches, fallen        trunks,   and dead      wood on
   which     it lives.     How     does  it solve the difficulty      1   It takes some of
   the ground        out along with it.          I  have seen white ants working          on
    the top    of  a high    tree, and yet they were underground.                They took
    up some       of the ground         with   them      to the tree-top     ; just  as the
    Esquimaux heap up snow, building                   it into   the low tunnel-huts       in
    which they live, so the white ants collect earth, only in this case
    not from the surface but from some depth underneath the ground,
    and plaster      it into tunnelled        ways.       Occasionally these run along
    the  ground, but more often mount in endless                      ramifications to the
    top  of trees, meandering along every branch and twig, and here and
    there   debouching into large covered chambers which occupy half the
    girth of the trunk.            Millions of       trees   in  some districts    are thus
    fantastically plastered over with tubes,                 galleries, and chambers       of
    earth,   and many pounds weight of subsoil must                     be brought up for
    the  mining of even a single tree.             The building material is conveyed
    by the insects up a central pipe               with which all the galleries com
     municate,     and which at the downward end connects with a series of

  140                      Proceedings       of   the  Royal Society
  subterranean        passages leading deep into the                earth.     The    method of
  building the tunnels and covered ways is                      as               —
                                                                     follows: At the foot
  of  a tree the     tiniest hole cautiously opens in the ground close to the
  bark.       A small     head    appears      with    a  grain of earth         clasped     in its
 jaws.       Against the tree trunk this earth-grain is deposited, and the
  head is withdrawn.             Presently it reappears with another grain of
 earth    ;  this is laid beside         the   first,   rammed        tight against       it, and
 again the builder descends underground                     for more.         The third grain
 is not placed against         the tree but against the former grain; a                   fourth,
 a  fifth, and     a  sixth follow, and the plan of the foundation begins to
 suggest itself as soon as these are in position.                      The stones or grains,
 or pellets of earth, are arranged in               a   semi-circular wall, the termite,
 now assisted by three or four others, standing in the middle between
 the sheltering wall and the tree, and working                      briskly with head and
 mandible        to strengthen        the position.          The wall, in fact, forms a
 small moon-rampart, and as it grows higher                            and    higher     it soon
 becomes evident that           it  is going to grow from a low battlement                   into
 a   long perpendicular tunnel running up the side of the tree.                              The
 workers, safely ensconced             inside, are now carrying up the structure
 with great rapidity, disappearing in turn as soon                         as  they have laid
their stone and rushing off to bring up another.                         Each stone as       it  is
brought to the top is first of all covered                     with mortar.          Of course,
without        this the whole tunnel              would      crumble       into dust before
reaching the height of half an inch                  ;  but the termite pours over the
stone a moist sticky secretion,               turning      the   grain round and round
 with its mandibles until the whole is covered with slime.                              Then it
places the stone with great care upon the top                        of the wall, works it
about vigorously for          a  moment or two           till it  is well jammed into its
place, and then starts off instantly for another load.
     Peering over the growing wall one soon discovers one, two, or
more termites of a somewhat                 larger build,        considerably longer, and
with     a  very different arrangement             of the parts of the head, and espe
cially      of   the    mandibles.        These       important-loooking            individuals
saunter about the rampart                   in the most          leisurely      way, but      yet
with      a    certain    air  of business,         as   if   perhaps      the   one was      the
master       of works and the other the architect.                       But     closer    obser
vation        suggests     that    they    are   in nowise superintending                  opera
tions, nor in any immediate way contributing                              to   the structure,

for they take not the         slightest notice either of         the workers or the
works.        They are posted there in fact             as sentries,     and there they
stand, or promenade         about, at the mouth of every tunnel, to keep at
bay the warlike hordes of Formicidm — the real ants — who forage
about in every tropical forest in unnumbered legions.                          To every
hundred        workers   in a white        ant colony,       which      numbers many
thousands of       individuals, there are perhaps two of these fighting
men.        The division of labour here is very wonderful, and the fact
that besides these two specialised forms there are in every nest two
 other kinds of the         same insect,     the   kings and queens,          shows the
 remarkable       height to which civilisation in           these     communities has
 attained.
      Now where is this tunnel going to, and what object have                        the
 insects in view in ascending this lofty tree ? Thirty feet from                     the
  ground, across innumerable forks, at the end of                a  long branch are     a
  few feet     of dead wood.        How   the ants    know it is there, how they
  know its sap has dried up, and that              it  is now fit for the termites'
   food, is a    mystery.     Possibly they    do not know, and are only pros
   pecting on the chance.         The fact that they sometimes            make straight
    for the decaying limb argues in these instances                a   kind of definite
    instinct   ; but, on the other hand, the fact that in                most cases the
     whole tree,    in every branch and limb, is              covered      with termite
     tunnels,    would show      perhaps   that they work most commonly on
     speculation, while the number of abandoned tunnels, ending on                      a
     sound branch in a cul-de-sac, proves how often they must suffer the
      usual disappointments      of adventurers.
         The extent    to which these insects         carry on their tunnelling        is
      quite incredible  until  one has seen      it in nature with his own         eyes.
      The tunnels are perhaps        about the thickness       of a small-sized gas-
      pipe, but there are junctions here and there of large dimensions, and
      occasionally patches of earth-work are found embracing nearly the
      whole   trunk for   some feet       The outside of these tunnels, which
      are  never quite   straight, but wander irregularly              along stem and
      branch, resembles    in texture     a coarse sand-paper       ;  and the colour,
      although this naturally       varies with the soil, is usually          a reddish-
      brown.     The quantity of     earth and mud plastered          over a single tree
      is  often enormous    ; and when one thinks           that it is not only an
      isolated specimen    here   and there that is frescoed           in this way, but

142                         Proceedings           of    the   Hoyal Society
often the whole of the trees of                   a forest,           some idea              will    be     formed of
the magnitude of the operations of these insects                                             and the         extent of
their influence upon the soil which                           they are thus ceaselessly                           trans
porting from underneath the ground.
   In travelling through the                    great     forests       of the Rocky Mountains
or of the Western                 States,      the broken branches and                               fallen trunks
strewing the ground breast-high with all sorts of decaying                                                         litter
frequently make             locomotion impossible.                      But in an African forest
not   a   fallen branch is            seen.      One is struck at first at a certain clean
look about the great forests                    of the interior,             a    novel and unaccount
able cleanness,        as    if    the forest-bed             was carefully swept and                          dusted
daily by unseen elves.                      And    so,    indeed,            it       is.       Scavengers         of    a
hundred kinds remove decaying animal matter — from the carcase of
the   fallen elephant to the broken wing of                                       a     knat — eating             it,   or
carrying     it      out of sight, and burying                    it    in       the deodorising                  earth.
And       these countless         millions of termites perform                              a   similar function
for the vegetable world, making away with all plants and trees, all
stems, twigs, and tissues, the moment the finger of decay strikes the
signal.      Constantly in these woods                         one comes across what appears
to be sticks and branches                     and bundles of faggots, but when closely
examined they are seen to be mere                                 casts      in mud.                   From       these
hollow tubes, which preserve                      the    original form of the branch down
to the minutest knot                  or fork, the ligneous tissue                              is   often    entirely
removed, while others are met with in all stages of demolition.                                                         In
attacking        a   small branch the                  insects        start apparently from two
centres.         One company attacks the inner bark, which                                        is   the favourite
morsel,      leaving the coarse outer                    bark untouched, or more usually
replacing     it     with grains of earth atom by atom                                  as      they eat     it   away.
The inner bark              is    gnawed        off likewise           as    they           go along,         but the
woody tissue beneath                   is     allowed to remain                   to form            a      protective
sheath for the second company                      who begin work at the centre.                                   This
second contingent eats its way outward and onward, leaving                                                     a   thin
tube of the outer wood to the last as props to the mine                                              till   they have
finished the main excavation.                      When           a   fallen trunk lying upon the
ground      is   the object of attack, the                    outer     cylinder             is   frequently left
quite intact, and           it   is   only when one tries to drag                           it   off to his camp-
tire that he finds he             is   dealing with           a   mere hollow tube                      a    few lines
in thickness filled up with mud.

                        of Edinburgh,     Session 1884-85.                        143
     But the works above ground represent only a part of the labours
of    these    slow-moving      but   most industrious       of   creatures.      The
arboreal tubes are only the prolongation of a much more                    elaborate
system of subterranean          tunnels which extend over large            areas and
mine the earth sometimes to a depth of many feet or even yards.
    The    material excavated from these            underground       galleries and
from the succession          of doomed      chambers   — used    as nurseries and
granaries — to     which they    lead, has to be thrown out upon the surface.
And it is from these materials that the huge ant-hills                  are reared,
which form so       distinctive   a feature of the African landscapa           These
heaps    and mounds        are so conspicuous that they may            be seen for
miles, and so numerous are they and so useful as cover to the sport-
man, that     without them iu certain districts hunting would                 be im
possible.      The first things, indeed,     to strike the traveller    in entering
the   interior are the mounds of the white ant, now dotting the plain
in groups     like   a small cemetery,     now rising into mounds singly or
 in clusters,     each    30   or 40    feet  in   diameter,   and    10 or 15 in
 height, or again       standing    out against the sky      like obelisks, their
 bare sides    carved and fluted into all sorts of fantastic shapes.               In
 India these ant-heaps seldom attain           a  height of more     than   a couple
 of feet, but    in Central Africa they form veritable hills, and contain
  many tons     of earth.    The brick houses of the Scotch mission-station
 on Lake     Nyassa have all been built out of a single ants' nest, and
  the quarry    from which      the material has been derived forms             a  pit
 beside the     settlement some dozen feet in depth.          A supply of bricks
  as large  again could probably still be taken from this convenient
  depOt, and     the missionaries on Lake Tanganyika              and   onwards to
  Victoria Nyanza       have been similarly     indebted to the labours of the
  termites.      In South Africa      the Zulus     and   Kaffirs   pave all their
  huts  with white-ant      earth ; and during      the Boer war our troops in
  Praetoria,    by scooping out the interior         from the smaller beehive-
  shaped ant-heaps,      and covering the top with clay, constantly used
  them as ovens.         These ant-heaps      may be said to abound over the
  whole   interior of Africa, and there are three or four distinct varieties.
  The most      peculiar, as well as the most ornate,         is  a  small variety
  from 1 to 2 feet     in height, which    occurs in myriads along the shores
  of   Lake     Tanganyika.       It  is  built    in   symmetrical      tiers,   and
  resembles    a pile of small rounded hats, one above           another, the rims

144                              Proceedings             of   the   Royal Society
depending like eaves, and sheltering the body of the                                              hill from rain.
To estimate the amount of earth per acre raised from the water-line
of the subsoil by white ants would                                  not in some districts be an im
possible task, and it would be found probably that the quantity at
least      equalled that manipulated annually in temperate                                             regions by
the earth-worm.
     Let     me now             attempt to show the way in which the work of the
termites bears                  upon    the        natural agriculture              and geology of the
tropics.           Looking           at the question from the large point of view, the
general           fact to be noted            is,   that the soil of the tropics                     is   in   a   state
of perpetual motion.                       Instead of an upper crust, moistened to a
paste by the autumn rains, and then baked hard as adamant                                                       in the
sun   ;    and an under soil, hermetically sealed from the air and light,
and inaccessible                 to all the         natural manures derived from the de
composition of organic matters — these two layers being eternally
fixed        in     their       relation      to     one        another — we            have       a      slow      and
continued transference                    of the layers always taking place.                              Not only
to cover their depredations, but to dispose of the earth                                                  excavated
from         the      underground              galleries,           the       termites        are      constantly
transporting the deeper and exhausted soils to the surface.                                                      Thus
there        is,    so     to    speak,    a        constant         circulation         of       earth in          the
tropics,      a      ploughing          and        harrowing,           not     furrow        by furrow             and
clod by clod, but pellet by pellet and grain                                       by   grain.         Some        idea
of     the        extent        to   which         the     underlying           earth        of     the     tropical
forests       is    thus brought              to     the      surface       will   have       been         gathered
from the           facts    already described               ;    but no one who has not seen                            it
with his own                eyes can          appreciate the gigantic magnitude of the
process.           Occasionally one                sees   a     whole trunk or branch, and some
times almost an entire tree, so swathed in red mud that the bark                                                        is
almost completely concealed,                              the    tree     looking       as

taken out bodily and dipped in some crystallising                                             solution.            It   is
not only one tree here and there                                    that exhibits            the work          of the
white ant, but in many places the whole forest                                          is   so coloured           with
dull      red tunnels and patches as to give                            a   distinct     tone       to the land
scape — an           effect      which, at          a     little    distance,      reminds          one        of the

naturally          more         favourable          than others to              the     operations of               the
termites,          and to those who have only seen them at work in India,

  or in the lower districts              of Africa, this      statement         may seem        an
  exaggeration.         But on       one   range of forest-clad           hills  on the great
 plateau      between Lake Nyassa and Tanganyika                          I  have walked       for
 miles     through trees, every one of which, without exception, was
 ramified, mors or less, with tunnels.                   The elevation of this locality
 was about          5000     feet   above    the    sea,  and      the    distance from the
equator some 9'            •
                              but nowhere         else   have   I   seen a spot where the
termites were          so completely masters of             the situation        as   here.     If
it is the      case that in these, the most elevated regions of Central
Africa, the termite colonies attain their maximum development, the
fact is of much interest in connection with the geological and agri
cultural functions which they seem to serve                      ;   for it is here precisely
before the rivers have gathered volume, that alluvium is most want
ing    ;  it is here that       the   tiny  headwaters      of these same rivers collect
 the earth         for subsequent distribution             over     the distant plains and
 coasts ; and though the white ant may itself have no power,                              in   the
 first instance,       of creating soil,     as a   denuding and transporting agent
  its ministry can scarcely be exaggerated.
      The direct relation of the termites' work to denudation will still
  further appear,       if   we try to imagine the effect upon these accumula
  tions of earth-pellets and grains of an ordinary rainy season.                              For
  two or three months in the tropics, though intermittently,                           the rains
  lash the forests and soils with               a  fury such       as    those  in   temperate
  climates      have     little    idea of    ; and though           the earth-works,         and
   especially     the larger ant-hills, have marvellous resisting properties,
   they are not invulnerable,             and must ultimately succumb to denud
   ing agents.        From     a  geological point of view, these ant-hills, which
   occur    in such numbers all over Africa that                   the whole country may
   be  regarded as one vast ant-city, are to be looked upon simply                              as
  heaps     of decomposed rock waiting               to be removed           from the surface
   of the earth.       The tunnels, again, being only required for                a  temporary
  purpose,      are made substantial enough only to last the occasion                      ;  and
   in spite of the natural             glue   which      cements       the pellets of earth
   together,     the structure,       as a  whole, after    a  little exposure,         becomes
   extremely friable, and crumbles to pieces at                      a  touch.     Many     trees,
   from which all the earthy material has been long since swept away,
    still bear upon their trunk and               branches    the      long, irregular       stain

 4.   On      Peroxides      of     Zinc,     Cadmium,          Magnesium,        and
         Aluminium.          By   J.   Gibson,     PLD.,     and    K. M. Morri
         son,  D.Sc*
                                 (Bead  July  5, 1880.)
    During    the course of an investigation on the cerite metals we found
 that peroxide of hydrogen, added to the precipitated hydrates                      in
 presence of excess of alkali, is a very delicate test for cerium,               even
 in  presence of Lanthanum         and Didymium,        owing to the formation of
 a dark yellow or brown compound, probably a peroxide, which differs
 from that produced by chlorine under the similar circumstances.
    While examining a residue obtained by boiling                  a solution   of  La
 and Di with magnesite, to free it from cerium,                    we observed,     on
 using this test, the following reaction, which led us to suspect the
 existence of a peroxide of magnesium,             namely, that when H2Os was
 added to      a   solution  containing     chloride of magnesium and free
  ammonia,     a   copious white precipitate was formed.               On repeating
  the experiment with solutions of a number of metals, we obtained
  precipitates which possessed the properties of peroxides.
     On referring     to the literature of the subject, we found that              the
  greater number had been          already prepared       in a  similar manner      by
  Thenard and others       ; but we were unable to            find any mention of
  peroxides of cadmium, magnesium,              or aluminium.        Thenard states
  that   he   Was    unable to     obtain    the   peroxides     of magnesium        or
  aluminium      ; and though he mentions having obtained a peroxide
  of zinc by means         of peroxide of hydrogen, yet he regarded                  it
  apparently     as too  unstable to isolate.      In spite of this      assertion   of

ThenanTs, it does not seem to have been generally believed that zinc
did form any definite oxide higher than ZnO,      in fact,   formed    if,               it
any other at alL           The following quotation from Brand                           is   seems to
represent    fairly the general idea          on the subject held by chemists                       : —
   "
       Thenard has described           a   peroxide of zinc obtained by agitating
the hydrated       oxide with oxygenated water                  ;    at   all      events,     this     is
no permanent        compound, and certainly forms no distinct salts with
the acids.       We may therefore reject the suboxide and                            the peroxide
of zinc     as   indefinite compounds, and consider this                            metal      as   sus
ceptible of one degree of oxidisement only, forming the protoxide."
  Under these circumstances                 we thought         the subject of sufficient
interest to warrantus in bringing     before the Society, although
                                                 it
we have not as yet obtained any of the peroxides mentioned in the
title of this paper in        a   state    of purity, nor are we              as    yet prepared
to assign any formula to any one of them.                       Yet the results              we have
obtained prove the existence of peroxides of these metals, and tend
to suggest the formula of the peroxides of zinc and cadmium.
   The preparation of          these      peroxides in     a   state      of purity, or even
an approximation           to purity,      demands     attention to minute details,
comparatively         slight variations making            a   very decided difference                   in
the products obtained or even preventing their formation.
   After     a   considerable      number of experiments we obtained zinc
 and cadmium compounds containing                     a   high percentage               of oxygen       ;
 but we have not been              so successful in the case of                    magnesium or
 aluminium, partly         perhaps,       because we      have       not had time at our
 disposal    to try   a   sufficient number of experiments under varying
circumstances.
   The following are the results we have obtained                         :  —
   To a solution of zinc sufficient ammonia                      is    added        to redissolve
the precipitated hydrate, and to prevent its reprecipitation on dilu
tion with water to two or three times its former volume.                                  If   to this
solution a dilute          solution       of peroxide of hydrogen be added,                             a
copious      white or slightly         yellow precipitate            is   formed.            This in
itself points to some alteration having taken place,                          as   if   the precipi
tate werestill hydrate of zinc, there apparently no
                                                  is                               reason why           it
should not dissolve in the ammonia which     present.           is                      This preci
pitate, when       filtered   from the liquid and washed                           on the Bunsen
pump six or seven times with cold water, possesses the properties of                                    a

peroxide.        On adding a portion to a solution of iodide of potassium
acidified with hydrochloric acid iodine is set free.              After drying at
a temperature of 100° C. it still retains its properties.              It gives off
oxygen on heating (from one sample of about                  \   of a gramme we
collected 15 cc. of oxygen) ; on treatment with strong hot hydro
chloric acid it gives off chlorine, it oxidises acid solutions of ferrous
sulphate.        These properties     it retains almost undiminished          after
prolonged exposure to         a temperature of 140° C.
     In preparing the zinc compound we            used a solution     containing  5
grm. of zinc sulphate to the cc.            To  a 100 cc. of this solution 450
cc.   of  a  solution of ammonia (0"037 NH3to the cc.) was added, and
the whole filtered to remove the small quantity of precipitate left
undissolved.         To  100 cc. of the filtered solution 350 cc. of a       dilute
solution of peroxide of          hydrogen was       added,   which     produced a
copious precipitate.          This was collected on        a  filter, and washed
rapidly with cold water on the Bunsen pump, and then dried on a
water bath.          The substance thus        obtained is a yellowish-white
powder, which on ignition             yields   protoxide    of zinc,    water and
oxygen being evolved.           It  dissolves readily in cold dilute acids, and
this solution gives, on shaking it up with chromic acid solution and
ether, the blue coloration characteristic of peroxide             of hydrogen.
     In order     to estimate   the peroxide oxygen, we dissolved weighed
portions in standard solution            of ferrous sulphates acidified with
sulphuric acid, and then titrated with standard solution of perman
ganate of potash.         The percentages     of oxygen estimated in this way,
 in three different portions, were 6-92, 6-92, and 6-42 respectively.
 On ignition the substance         lost 20 '9 per cent.
      The composition, and notably the percentage of oxygen, vary very
 considerably when the method of preparation is slightly modified

  tion of ammonia and then of H202 solution, a precipitate is obtained
  which varies very considerably in colour according to the quantity
  of ammonia added.            On adding 27            cc.   of our ammonia solution to
   100 cc. of the      cadmium solution, a buff-coloured precipitate is pro
  duced     by the H 202 solution     ;   but   if   a  very little more or     a very little
  less ammonia is added, the precipitate is much paler                       in colour, and
   approaches     in  appearance     more nearly to the ordinary white hydrate
   of cadmium.
       Three portions,    A, B, and C,        were prepared         as follows  : —
       A. To    100 cc. of the cadmium solution 27 cc. of the ammoniacal
   solution   were added, and then an equal                bulk (127 cc.) of H20o solu
   tion,   the precipitate filtered, and washed with cold water.
       B. The same quantities were used, but the liquid was filtered from
   the   precipitated cadmium hydrate, and H202 solution added to the
   filtrate.
       C.   Was obtained by washing the precipitated hydrate from B
   with    HjOjj solution.

   The properties of this substance resemble closely those of the zinc
 compound.       It  is more   decidedly yellow in colour, however,            and
readily yields on ignition the ordinary brown               oxide of cadmium,
 water and oxygen being given oft On heating a portion of                A to 140*
for several hours, it was partially decomposed,           and became browner
in colour.       This   substance,   on titration,    gave   7 -4   per cent     of
oxygen, deducting carbonate of cadmium as represented                  by 3-1 per
cent C02 and the water the percentage of O = 7-34, in the anhydrous
oxide.
   For    the preparation       of the    magnesium compound             we   used
several   solutions of sulphate of magnesium           of different strengths,
and adding varying quantities       of the ammonia solution.         The quality
of the product varied in         each case according to the mode           of  pre
paration.
   Magnesium      A was precipitated from a solution containing chloride
of ammonium         and free    ammonia, and was filtered, after stand
ing all night in contact with the liquid            from    which     it was   pre
cipitated.    The precipitate, dried at    100"  C,    on titration, was found
to yield only 0 29 per cent of O, showing that it was nearly all
magnesia.      The effect produced by varying the quantity of ammo
nia added,     while   all the other conditions were kept as nearly as
posssible the same, is well shown in the following three oxygen
estimations   : —
                 Magnesium B contained 3-92 per cent. O.

     Magnesium        B was     prepared   from a solution to which ammonium
was added         till  a   very slight     turbidity   was  produced, and then
peroxide of hydrogen added.
    In the     case  of magnesium C, the quantity of ammonia was some
what increased, and in magnesium D to a still greater extent.
    Other portions of the magnesium compound were prepared under
slightly different conditions, and two portions              were dried    over sul
phuric acid       in vacuo, but without showing any decided           difference.
    The dry powder obtained from              these precipitates, by drying them
at 100° C., possessed properties similar to those of the zinc and
cadmium         compounds,        viz., they set free iodine    from an acidified
solution of iodide of potassium, &c.
     Magnesium B was selected for further analysis,                as it contained
 the greatest        percentage of available oxygen.          On ignition    it lost
 36-15 per cent, and was               found to contain 2-17 per cent, of CO^
  30-9     per cent of water, and to leave a residue of 60- 85 per cent,

        In   the   case  of aluminium       our methods had to be somewhat
   altered, owing        to   the insolubility of alumina in ammonia.             We
   tried    a   solution    of alumina in caustic soda, containing no more
   alkali than just sufficient to dissolve the alumina.                100   grs.  of
   ammonia alum were dissolved in the smallest quantity of water,
   and caustic soda        added    until the hydrate    at first precipitated    was
   nearly     all, but not quite, redissolved.          When this solution        was
    filtered and peroxide         of hydrogen added,     a  copious white precipi
    tate was     obtained,     which was filtered off, washed, and dried — one
    portion     at 100°   C,    and another over sulphuric      acid in vacuo.      A
    third    portion was allowed to stand in contact with some of the

152                Proceedings        of the  Royal Society
mother liquor   till  the next day, and then filtered and dried at 100°
C.   We called these respectively          A, B, and    C.
   On titration they gave the following results            : —
                     A,   1 "04  per cent, of oxygen.
                     B,   1-6
                     C,   1      less than on percentage       of O.
   B  was selected     for further analysis.         On ignition     it lost 41-35
per cent.    The percentage        of water found was 3 6 '05, and that of
C02,   3-5.    The    percentage      of alumina       58-65.     The percentage
composition was therefore
                 A1203                                       58-65

   On deducting       the    water and C02         the percentage       of oxygen
equals 2  69 in the anhydrous oxide.
   The presence of carbonic acid in this preparation is probably due
to  absorption from the atmosphere             during    the preparation.      The
water   and carbonic acid were estimated directly; the oxygen by-
oxidising a standard solution of ferrous sulphate, and titrating                the
excess   of ferrous salt by means           of a standard permanganate            of
potash solution   ; the    oxide by igniting       a  portion of the substance,
and estimating the residue.
   Although the    above      analyses   show that the substances         we  have
prepared   are not pure, yet they hold          out the hope that, by modi
fying our experiments, we may yet succeed in preparing the pure
peroxides in a state fit for analysis and for the determination of their
formulae.

being able          to continue            them in the new University Laboratory,

been to us a         subject of much regret, the questions involved being of
no   little interest.
     We have still           in our    possession        specimens           of the various prepara

 deals    mainly, though not exclusively, with                                 peroxides of the rare
earths, refers          to   a   paper by R. Haas,            §   entitled         " Ueber Peroxydo in
 der Zinc         Magnesiumgruppe,"                   dated    30th September 1884,                           which
 we had           not previously noticed, and which                            covers      very much the
 same    ground           as our       paper,     dated       5th      July        1880.         Under          these
 circumstances, the verbatim                      publication             of our paper               is   rendered
 necessary,        in order        to maintain our right to continue our researches.
 There can be no doubt that further                            investigation            is   very desirable.
     In the first place, Messrs Haas and Cleve state that they have
 not been         able to obtain peroxides of aluminium and beryllium by
 means       of peroxide of hydrogen.                   This      we claim to have done                       in the
 case    of aluminium, and some preliminary experiments lead us to the
 belief that        beryllium also          is   capable of similar peroxidation.                             There

seems      little doubt, however, that in                 these cases the compounds are
much more difficult to obtain.
    In the          second    place,    the true character of these bodies is still
uncertain.            It   is certain that the substances                     described by Messrs
Haas and Cleve, as well as those                         obtained by us, were not pure
substances           but     mixtures.     Haas         states        that     he   endeavoured          to
obtain the peroxides of zinc free from admixed hydrate, but that he
never succeeded              in producing       the precipitation                of peroxide when
the formation of hydrate was prevented with sufficient care (sorg-
faltig genug).             This statement        is,   however, too indefinite, and leaves
one    very much in the dark.                     It     is   easy to          prepare      ammoniacal
solutions of zinc salts which remain perfectly clear when diluted
with       three      or more     times their bulk of water, but in which the
addition of their own volume of hydrogen peroxide solution pro
duces      an abundant           precipitate.          This behaviour               makes     it   difficult
to understand how the formation of the zinc peroxide                                     is   necessarily
a    secondary product                 depending         upon     a       previous       formation       of
hydrated oxide.               Our experiments lead us to                     a   quite contrary con
clusion, viz., that the hydrated oxide                           is   a   secondary product, the
result of the decomposition of the peroxide.                                   The mere determin
ation of the peroxide oxygen and of basic                                 oxide does not give a
satisfactory insight into the composition of these bodies                                     unless the
absence        of acids (carbonic, nitric,                &c.)   proved.
                                                                  is     How far this
was the case with the substances                       obtained by Herr Haas cannot be

 2.   Note on the Variation by Pressure of the Melting-Point
        of Paraffin, &c.         By W. Peddie, Esq.            Communicated

     As the result    of Andrews' experiments on the boiling-points           of
 substances, we have        the   law enunciated that There is        a critical
 temperature    for every vaporous or gaseous substance            ; such that,
 only when its temperature is below this,             can   the  substance    be
 reduced    to  the liquid      form  by   any   pressure,     however    great.
 Similarly,  a law may be laid down regarding the passage from the
 liquid  to the   solid state, or vice    versa.   Thus we may say          that
 There is a critical      temperature for every       solid substance,   which
 contracts  in the act of liquefaction,    such that only when its temper
ature is above    this, can the substance be reduced to tha liquid form
by any pressure,       however great   ;  and for every liquid substance,
which contracts      in the   act of solidification,   such   that only when
its temperature    is below this, can the substance        be reduced    to the
solid form by any pressure,        however great.
    There is as yet no experimental evidence         for this law, but  I  Lope

to be able to communicate before          long to the Society the result        of
experiments in this direction.        Meantime       I wish   to draw attention
to the peculiar behaviour of paraffin under pressure, as brought out
by some experiments of Bunsen's, undertaken for            a  different purpose.*
His results    are shown       graphically    in  the accompanying diagram.
The curved lines represent the variation of the melting-point                with
pressure.    Pressure is measured          upwards,     and temperature      hori
zontally.    The least curved line sloping up is that of spermaceti
The markedly curved line is that of paraffin.            The line sloping   down
is that of water.        The direction of slope shows that the substance
 expands in the act of freezing,        as   its melting-point      is lowered   by
 pressure.   If  the paraffin curve continues to bend at the same              rate
 as the pressure   is increased, beyond the point         reached     in Bunsen's
 experiments, its tangent line will become horizontal, and the curve
 will be concave     to the temperature axis.          That is to say, paraffin
under these pressures will behave         as   water does, i.e., will expand     in
 the act of freezing.       The temperature       corresponding to the       point

 4.       On the Temperature of the Water in the Firth of Forth.
     By Hugh Kobert Mill, B.Sc, F.C.S.                               (Plates VI.,               VII.).
     The    temperature          of water can be ascertained                       much more easily
than that of air, and with far greater accuracy                                ;   yet comparatively
little has       been done by meteorologists                in   the way of obtaining data
bearing on the distribution of temperature in rivers and in estuaries.
Some observations of great value have been discussed by Mr Buchan
in the Scottish Meteorological                      Society's        Journal,* but              these were
discontinued after            a few years.
     It   would       be extremely interesting,             and       would lead               to valuable
results,    if   at a number of stations on the River and Firth of Forth,
for example,          the temperature         of the water could be ascertained                         daily,
and also the temperature of the tributary streams at short intervals of
time. The value of such work would of course be enormously increased
if   it could be applied to other river-systems,                         so as to        admit of com
parisons between them.                     A very   complete         system of observation is
at present being arranged by the Tweed Commissioners,                                         from which
interesting results regarding the Tweed may be expected.
      The temperature of           a large     river depends, in the first place, on the
temperature of the deep lakes                       which    supply        it,     where,           as on   the
Forth, such lakes exist            ;   secondly, on the temperature of the feeders,
which      is   affected by the temperature               of the rain falling, and by that
of the land over which                 it   runs.    In   the third place, the colour and
transparency of the water,                    depth of river, rapidity                       of flow,       and
nature of the banks modify the effect of radiation                                       ;    and,     lastly,
the proximity            of the     sea,    and consequent             effect of tide, must be
considered.
     Observations            have been made at the Scottish                             Marine        Station
since     May 1884, and although nothing final                         can be said,            it    has been

 only to suggest the general      law governing the distribution                   of tem
 perature in an estuary at different seasons, but to get the benefit of
                                     any suggestions           that may be made as

                                     to    place      a   thermometer for            a  few

     was employed,           which was strong enough to keep the thermometer
     upright, hut not to             lift  the weight attached              to it.      The accompany

        In the observations to be described the corrections for the thermo
     meters have         not been applied, as from the small number of readings
     obtained at each station                 the    true     temperatures can be of little im
     portance,       and since the same thermometer was used                              during each set
     of observations, the value for comparative purposes                              is not diminished.

           The general result of the observations                      is that   in    the landward part
       of the Firth the range of temperature                          is greater        and the period of
       the maximum earlier than farther seaward; and that                                     as   the sea is
       approached             the range becomes less and the date of the maximum is
        retarded.           Thus in       2 and 3 the       maximum occurs               in July, in      4  not
        until       the    end     of August.          No doubt observations                made at       Alloa
         would       show a       winter minimum of           32°, or nearly so, and the summer
         maximum           would        probably      approach      70°.     The extreme              probable
         range at      Alloa is 40° in          the year;     at Queensferry a range                 just half
         of   that, 20° from 58° to 38°, has been observed                         ;   and at the Isle of
         May it      is most       likely that the annual            range    will not much             exceed
         10°.      The extreme temperatures                observed      near the        Isle of May       were
          in  fact   55' in August and 43° in December.
              The mean temperature for the year appears not to vary more than
         half    a degree       from    47° -5   in any part of       the  Firth     ;   but an extended
         series    of observations is necessary in order to clear up this point.
             In order to show             the continuity       of the seasons, the temperature
         curves      for surface water at North Berwick                       and      at Granton         were
         drawn on a new plan.                   A  circle is divided into 12 sectors, one for
         each    month, and the temperatures                   are measured          on the radii, con
         centric      circles being drawn for 30°, 40°, 50°, and                           60°.      The line
         representing          the temperature        becomes     a closed       curve, and the regu
         larity of its form is very striking.                   The curves        on Plate        VI.   fig. 2,
         representing          the monthly means in the four divisions of the Firth,
         are less     regular, in consequence,           probably, of the intermittent nature
         of the observations.              In Plate VI.      fig. 1   the same curves are shown.
             This      plan       of plotting       curves    by means         of      polar instead         of
         rectangular        co-ordinates will be found to have many advantages                               in

       and November, by means of the registering thermometer, was 8° -7,
       and the average l°-9. It is almost certain, arguing from analogy,
       that the daily range                            is,   like the annual                    range, greatest                  in the river
       and least in the sea.
            The number of observations                                          made at depths beneath the surface
       has not been                     so great         ;       but     a      considerable mass of facts has been
      accumulated                      on the subject                      of the bathymetrical                         distribution                 of
       temperature in the Firth.
            The surface, bottom, and intermediate                                               temperatures              were regularly
       ascertained                at   Inchgarvie in from                         30 to 40 fathoms              ;       at       Inchkeith in
       from 15 to                 20 fathoms             ;       and near the Isle of May, where the depth
       varied from 20 to 25 fathoms. Table V. gives                                                            the means for each
       month, and for the summer and winter periods.
             From June (or probably May)                                                to September the water at the
           surface       is   warmer than that below; but from October to April this
           effect    is       reversed,            the water at the surface                          being then colder.                              It
           was pointed out some months ago* that the density of bottom water
           in the Firth was always slightly                                      greater        than that of surface water
           at the same temperature, and                                    it     is    probable that the difference                                 in
           density       is    sufficient to account for                                the apparent anomaly of cold
           water overlying warmer                                water         during at least half the year.                                     The
           reductions          necessary to settle this point are tedious, and have not

including the cases considered in Table V.                      The former table shows
that the upper        half of the water        has nearly the whole difference           of
the temperature to         account for, and it        is probable that quite a small
layer is heated above         or   cooled below the temperature of the great
bulk cf the water.
     The figures already        given may be considered               as   describing the
variation of temperature with the seasons at the various parts of the
Firth    ;  the  variation of     temperature        with position at the same time
of year must also be considered.                The temperatures         observed   in the
various long water-sampling trips are given in Table VIL                             They
show how, in the 55 miles between Alloa and the Isle of May, the
temperature is never at any one time uniform, and this is very dis
 tinctly brought out by the curves of these figures.                       "With the ex
 ception of the first expedition (in September), all of these were
 made      in the water-winter,      that is at    a  time when the radiation from
  the land and sea at night was greater                   than that to them by day,
  and when as a consequence                the shallower and more land-locked
   waters     were    colder than those        deeper      and    nearer   the sea.    The
   curves have all an upward slope towards the sea in consequence,
   with the exception of that for September and that for April.                        The
   latter is a nearly straight line, showing that at present (20th April
    1885) the lower reaches of the Firth are at an almost uniform tem
    perature of 43° (see Plate         VII.     fig.  1).      Collecting all the avail
    able    observations   of surface    temperature,         and taking the mean of
    those in the four divisions of the Firth for each half-yearly period,
    the following table     (VIII.)   is arrived at     : —

       The diagram (Plate      VII.   fig. 2) shows that in summer the tempera
    ture   falls pretty rapidly from Alloa to Inchgarvie, and more slowly
    right out to sea.     In  winter this state of matters is exactly reversed,
    the  temperature rising continuously from the river seawards.                      The

166                    Proceedings          of  the   Royal Society
mean     of the two is         a   nearly straight line         which almost      coincides
with the line of 50°.            The number of observations made use                    of in
drawing the winter curve was much greater                      than that     available for
the summer line,           a   fact which         possibly    accounts    for the       mean
between     the two not being parallel to the axis of x.
   The mean rise or fall of temperature                  going along the central           line
of the Firth at any time during the year is 0°-07 per mile.                                   In
April   and October       it   is much less       ;  in December and August            much
more.
   A   great deal has to be done in the way of studying                      the effect      of
shallow water, and of the proximity of land in modifying the                             tem
perature     in cross sections         of the Firth.       From what has        been done
already,    it  appears    possible      that if     a large number of        temperature
observations could be taken at different parts of the                    Firth during all
seasons for a few years, data would be procured which might                          render
the thermometer a valuable aid in determining                         the   position    of     a
vessel at night or in a fog.
   At   present    (April 1885)         the temperature        of the River and        Firth
of Forth is in      a position something like the              following : —
   Loch Ard, the principal source of the Forth proper, is at                         a  tem
perature      of 42°'5,  so    far   as regards     the water in the six feet nearest
the surface     at any rate.          The shallow river issuing from the loch
and flowing slowly over             a  stony bed was, on the day of my visit last
week, of the temperature                45°.    At Kippen,       16 miles farther on,       it
was 47°-3, and        some of the          small tributary burns were           as  high    as
49°-5.     At Gargunnock,             7  miles from Kippen, the temperature of
the water was 46c,6.             The Teith, which           is a larger   river than the
Forth, and joins it           near      Stirling,    had  a   temperature      of 42°-3    at
Callander, which was reduced                  to 42° at Doune, 9 miles farther on,
and 6 miles from the junction.                 This evidently shows that          the lochs
that feed the       Teith — Vennachar, Katrine, and Lubnaig — must                        be
colder than Loch Ard             :  but   I  had    not time to ascertain        this by    a
visit.    At Stirling       the     river had the temperature             of 45°, which
gradually fell to 43°-5 at Kincardine; and the whole Firth, from
there to beyond the Isle of May, is at a temperature                       not more than
half   a degree   different from this.            This uniformity will probably not
last for   a  week.     It   is a state of matters represented            by the upward
sloping     winter-temperature            curve being in          a horizontal      position

                            of Edinburgh,              Session 1884-85.                            167
preparatory          to its   assuming         the downward direction characteristic of
summer.
  It is curious how great a difference                       there is between the tempera
ture of river3          in the         same    district     and apparently under the same
conditions       ;    and the only way to arrive at an understanding con
cerning it is by having simultaneous observations at different places.
  The basin of the Forth is very poorly supplied with meteorological
stations, and          if anything            like thorough knowledge of the physical
conditions of this river system is to be obtained, such stations must
be set in action.  This could be best done by the assistance and co
operation of the proprietors on the banks of the river, who would
doubtless in time reap practical advantages                           from the work done.
  I     have to         thank Mr T. Morton Ritchie, B.Sc, for his valuable
help in making many of the observations described in this paper;
various       members            of the        scientific    staff    of the      Scottish    Marine
Station, where the work was carried on                          ;    and in particular the crew
 of the " Medusa," without                     whose care and assistance            it would       have
 been impossible               to do much of the deep-sea work.
  5.     The Relations of the Yolk to the Gastrula in Teleostean
                        Embryos.             By   J.   T. Cunningham, B.A.
                                                  (Abstract).
  c     In   the course of my studies on the development of marine                            osseous
  fishes,    I       have     recently made at the Scottish Marine Station some
  observations  on the living ova of the cod (Gculim morrhua, L.),
  haddock ((?. ceglefinus, L.), and whiting (O. merlaiigus, L.).     The
  eggs of all these species   are pelagic ; that is to say, they are not
  adhesive,          and are of less specific               gravity than the        sea    water    into
  which       they are shed by the                     parent fish,      and they consequently
   undergo development at or near the surface                            of the    sea.     They float
   at the    surface        of still   sea    water in     a glass vessel such as was used to
   contain them             in the laboratory, and          at the surface of the sea in calm
   weather.            But if    the glass        vessel be shaken the eggs are dispersed
   throughout           the water within            it,   and when the surface            of the   sea   is
   agitated          by wave motion, a similar effect                 is   produced,      the buoyant
      eggs   are dispersed through                the water to       a   depth depending on the

168                          Proceedings             of    the   Royal Society
intensity    of the agitation.                       Like      most      pelagic    eggs,         those      under
consideration are transparent, and each egg is separate and spherical.
The eggs of the whiting                     are the          smallest of the three species, the
cod's next in size, and the haddock's largest.                                   The diameter               of      the
latter measures              1   -45 mm.             Owing        to    their     convenient           size and
perfect transparency, the changes                                which     occur in the              embryonic
period of development — that                         is,   from fertilisation           to   hatching        — can
be followed       with       great ease by placing eggs at successive stages                                 under
the microscope,         a        combination of lenses being used magnifying about
40 diameters.               The eggs were obtained and fertilised                                 by squeezing
them from the ripe fish on board                           a   fishing boat into             a    bottle    of     sea
water, into which milt from                      a   ripe male had previously been allowed
to fall.
     The eggs of all the species mentioned have                             a   very similar structure                  ;
the   yolk   is   perfectly structureless, the vitelline membrane very thin,
and the pervitelline space of moderate                             size.    At     one pole of the            yolk
is   the blastodisc,         a    cap of protoplasm                tinged at the earlier stages of
development            of    a     light terra-cotta colour.                    This colour gradually
disappears    towards the end of the process of simple segmentation.
     The processes of the development in pelagic                                   Teleostean ova have
been recently described by various naturalists, and there                                           is
                                                                                                    a      general
agreement         in   the        descriptions         concerning the main features.                          Full
details of my own observations will appear shortly in the Quarterly
Journal      of    Microscopical                 Science.         All  I     wish to do              here    is    to
review synthetically                 certain phenomena of the development, their
probable significance                as    evidences             of remote        ancestral conditions,
and their homological relations to phenomena                                       in the development
of other vertebrate               forms.
     The development of               a     pelagic Teleostean ovum, and doubtless                                 of
all Teleostean ova, differs from that of all other vertebrate                                        ova    in   the
fact that invagination takes place round the whole periphery of the
blastoderm simultaneously.                           This invagination             is   completed before
the    blastoderm begins                  to grow over the                 yolk    mass, and the inva-
ginated layer causes                 the    peripheral region of the blastoderm to                                be
thicker than the central part.                         The thickened part                is      known as        the
germinal ring.               Along         one    radius the blastoderm                      is   thicker than
elsewhere,    even          before the inflected layer appears, and beneath                                      this
radius the inflected layer when                       it    is   formed extends further inwards

                        of  Edinburgh, Session 1884-85.                         169
than elsewhere.          The inflected or invaginated layer when it          appears
constitutes    part of the blastoderm, and is situated between              the rest
of the blastoderm          and the yolk mass.         The superficial layer of the
yolk mass beneath            the   blastoderm is protoplasmic and nucleated,
though not divided into             cells.    This layer  is called the periblast,
and at a later         stage forms a continuous covering all over the yolk
mass,    from which it is never distinctly separated.               The thickened
radius of the blastoderm is the first indication of the embryo, and
is   known as the embryonic rudiment. As the blastoderm grows
over the yolk, the germinal ring, exclusive of the embryonic rudi
ment,      remains of the        same     breadth, but the     rudiment grows in
 length at its posterior end, while the anterior end, that which is at
 first situated near the centre of the blastoderm, does not alter its
 position.      The posterior end of          the embryonic     rudiment is always
  at the edge       of the growing blastoderm.           Towards the close of the
  process    of envelopment of       the   yolk by the blastoderm,     the germinal
  ring is gradually absorbed into           the embryonic rudiment, and finally
  the whole of       it is  seen to form       part of the dorsal region      of the
   embryo.      In this way       the whole     of the invaginated      layer comes
   to lie beneath      the axis of the embryo.          There can be little doubt
   from what is known concerning the development of other vertebrate
   forms, that the invaginated layer ultimately forms the dorsal wall
    of the intestine, the floor of which is derived from the periblast.
       It  was maintained some years ago by the German embryologists,
    His   and Rauber, that the explanation of the formation of the dorsal
    region of the embryo out of the germinal ring was, that the two
    halves of the ring were gradually            fused together by concrescence
    taking place at the point where they were                continuous with the
    posterior end of the embryonic rudiment, and that the edge of the
    blastoderm was the blastopore,           which was thus situated along the
    median dorsal line of the embryo.             This view   is generally accepted
    by more recent students of Teleostean           development, but no examina
    tion has been made of the theory or process                in detail.   His and
    Rauber, in their exposition of the concrescence            theory, connected    it
    with the    discussion     of facts    concerning the development of the
    medullary folds in Elasmobranchs.              It seems to me important that
    it should    be   clearly understood that the         process   of concrescence
    which undoubtedly       takes place in Teleostean ova is simply the closing

   170                   Proceedings         of  the   Royal Society
  of the dorsal blastopore, which has become distended by the increased
  bulk of the yolk developed              in the ventral hypoblast of the               original
  gastrula.      The nerve cord in its original condition was                     a  thickened
  line of epiblast surrounding the blastopore,                  and the formation         of the
  medullary      canal    by which         the nerve cord           is removed        from the
  surface    of the body, is         a   process     which originally took place after
  the closing of the blastopore.             The two processes are only accidentally
  connected     with one another in actual development                    ;  morphologically
  they are quite independent.
      Since the dorsal hypoblast in the Teleostean                    ovum is invaginated
  round the whole edge of the blastoderm,                     this edge forms the         lip  of
  the true primitive blastopore,             and is homologous with the             lip of the
 blastopore in the ancestral gastrula.                As far  as can be     judged from the
 study of living pelagic ova, the posterior end of the blastopore                          is on
 the dorsal surface, and no part of                it  extends    round the end of           the
 body to the ventral side of the embryo.                       In   the Amphibian         ovum
 invagination of the dorsal hypoblast docs not occur round the whole
 edge of      the   blastoderm         simultaneously       ;    the invagination         takes
 place first beneath       the embryonic rudiment, and the rest of the                    lip of
 the blastopore      is not inflected       till  a late stage    when the yolk cells are
 almost completely enveloped by epiblast.                      But ultimately the whole
edge of the blastoderm is inflected, and thus in the                          Amphibian,      as
 in the Teleostean,       the yolk blastopore or aperture                by which the yolk
 protrudes, coincides with the true primitive blastopore.
     In  the Elasmobranch ovum this is not the                     case.     Only   a   propor
tionally small arc of the edge of the blastoderm is ever inflected,
and the dorsal         region      of the embryo is entirely formed by con
crescence out of this part of the blastoderm.                     As far     as the   evidence
goes at present,        the    inflected     part of the blastodermic rim extends
when it is folded together                as   far  as the   neurenteric canal, and the
aperture by which            the yolk         protrudes after the           coalescence     has
reached      this point      is   a  hernia in the ventral wall of the body.
Thus      only the inflected arc of the edge of the blastoderm in the
Elasmobranch         is homologous          with     the whole      lip of    the blastopore
in the ancestral         gastrula, the rest            of  the    edge corresponds to         a
rupture in the ventral wall of the body of the ancestor, or of the
Teleostean      embryo.
     In   the   Sauropsidan         blastoderm,         no part of        the edge is ever

inflected,    nor does the embryo ever extend to the edge of the
blastoderm,        as    it does in Elasmobranchs and              Teleosteans.       In   the
median dorsal    line of the Sauropsidan embryo there is a linear structure
called    the primitive streak divided into two parts by the neurenteric
canal        Along the anterior part the hypoblast and epiblast are
originally continuous ;             the posterior part belongs to the ventral
surface of the           body.      The anterior part of the primitive streak
represents the          original blastopore,       the posterior part, the coalescence
of the non-inflected             part of the       edge of the blastoderm in Elasmo
branchs.     The edge of the blastoderm in Sauropsida corresponds
to a     new ventral hernia apparently not continuous with the hernia
in Elasmobranchs             represented by the posterior part of the primitive
streak.      Thus no part of          the edge of the blastoderm is homologous
with the   lip of the ancestral blastopore, or with the                      edge of the
blastoderm    in Teleosteans or Amphibia, or with the                        edge of       the
blastoderm         in Elasmobranchs.
      The working            out of these     general views in detail will             form
 an     interesting       subject   for   future      researches   in the comparative
 embryology of vertebrates.               There is one point at present which is
 ripe for settlement,            and that    is,   whether any part of the primitive
 blastopore        extends in any vertebrate          to the ventral side of the body.
 From the evidence of Teleostean development the answer to the
 question         seems    to be negative, but Sedgwick and Miss Johnson of
 Cambridge have brought               forward some evidence that the posterior
 end of the blastopore            in Triton gives      rise to the permanent anus.

    After    seeing in the course    of  one of  Sir W. Thomson's          lectures
an experiment showing           the contraction which takes place when a
solution     of common salt is mixed with water,                I  resolved upon
making a number of experiments with a view to noting the result
of mixing various solutions.
    I  find that  a number of experiments of a somewhat similar nature
have     been   made by    MM. Bussy and Buignet (Compt. Rend.,                 59),
Mr     F. D. Brown      (Jour.    Chem.   Soc., 1881), and by Mr W. Nicol
(Jour.     Chem,   Soc,  1883).     The first two of these papers        deal with
organic liquids,      and   Mr Nicol       has  noted the result       of mixing
various salt solutions, whereas         the experiments       I   have made give
the results of mixing salt solutions with water.

   The apparatus          which    I  used in my experiments consisted of a
wide glass tube of        convenient length, with a narrower tube attached
to   one     end,   and the whole tube was accurately graduated, and
contained 262 c.c.          up to a convenient point in the small             tube.       If
equal volumes        are to be     experimented upon, 131 c.c. of the denser
liquid are poured           into the tube, and on this an equal quantity of
the   lighter liquid is poured, which can be done without any
apparent       mixing.        The tube is now placed in a cylinder of cold
water, and the liquid brought exactly to the 262 c.c. mark.                            The
tube is then taken out, and after inverting till no farther streakiness
is observed,       is again placed in the cylinder of water, and as soon
as the       temperature       has   become       the same   as at the beginning          of
the   experiment,        the alteration in volume        is noted.
    The following are the results of experiments which                     I have made

 1.    The Visual,       Grating     and Glass-Lens,          Solar    Spectrum,
         as   observed     in the Year 1884.             By C. Piazzi Smyth,
         F.R.S.E., Astronomer-Royal             for Scotland.
                                    (Abstract.)
     This   paper   is the outcome      of 12 months' private spectroscope
building,     two months' observing therewith,           and ten months' com
puting and graphical presenting of the observations.                 The result is
a   Solar Spectrum map, extending through so many as 60                      double
quarto plates, but capable of being arranged for the cheapest                photo
lithographic      reproduction, in    a  manner very easy to examine, con
venient for reference, and yet at the same time affording at every
point new and severe tests for its degree of accuracy.
    This latter important feature has been chiefly obtained by exhibit
ing on each plate, vertically one under the other, and on the                  same
large, clear scale, five successive      and   independent series of observa
tions of the same Spectrum piece.             Two of these several       series are
eclectic collections from the best Solar            spectra  hitherto    published
elsewhere ; and three, are as many successive             and   perfectly distinct
sets of observations by the Author,             made   during    the   summer    of
1884 near Winchester.           That city being chosen because it was both
as far South as he could go       within    the limits of the    British  country ;
and be free at the same time from a most serious               evil in the atmo

  viz., the excessive   quantity of coal-smoke now vitiating its atmosphere,
  and    almost prohibiting      any of the nicer observations of Practical
  and Physical Astronomy.
     The three several Winchester           spectra   so taken, have      been   kept
  equally separate     during all the following stages of computation, and
 even up to their very insertions into the final collective plate-forms.
  In  the meantime the two eclectic spectra already mentioned, had been
 introduced in pen and ink on those               plates  for the Author, by       Mr
 Thomas      Heath, First Assistant Astronomer,          R   Ob. Edin.    ; ensuring
 thus not only better draughtsmanship,             but a still further degree of
 independence       whenever     a questionable case, whether of agreement
 or disagreement,      should occur, between any of the 6, or 7,000 lines

 the higher regions of the earth's atmosphere,            as shown by the broad
 halo apparently around, or rather           in front of, the Sun during          the
 whole     of that time, — a condition which is considered in the             course
of the paper.

     The lacquer tree (Rhus vernicifera) is indigenous to Japan ; it
supplies a valuable timber, and its fruit yields vegetable wax, but it
is chiefly cultivated on account of its       juice — lacquer ( Urushi) — which
forms the      basis of the famous Japanese varnishes. The juice is
obtained      by making incisions in the tree, and             it is   made  into   a
varnish by      simply stirring in    the sun   in order to drive off     an excess
of moisture.       Different    colours may be imparted to the varnish by
the addition of various metals,          oxides, and sulphides       ; and after it
has been     applied to an object it must be hardened by exposure to                a
moist atmosphere       at a moderately high temperature.*

    Specimens of lacquer juice for this research            have   been received
from different parts of the country.             That on -which    I worked was
kindly supplied by Mr Magaribuchi               from Yoshino.       As this juice
was originally intended for chemical investigation, and as it was
collected in the best place in the Empire, under strict official in
spection, it must have been in the purest form obtainable.
     The pure juice is a thick greyish fluid of dextrinous consistency,
which, under the microscope,          is found to consist of minute globules,
of darker or lighter colour, mixed with small particles of opaque
brownish       matter,   the whole being held mixed in the form of an
intimate emulsion.           It has a characteristic     sweetish odour.       The
specific    gravity is 1-0020 (20° C.) ; but some specimens, such as
that obtained from Hachioji, contained bark, dust, and other im
purities, which raised the specific gravity to l-038.             If the juice be
exposed      to the air    in a thin layer at    20°  C, it   rapidly darkens    in
colour, and dries up to a lustrous translucent varnish.
     Mr   S. Ishimatsu      (now S. Hiraga), in a paper on Uruthi, which
 was written      some years ago at Tokio University, and afterwards
 communicated to the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society,*
 by Professor Roscoe (Feb. 18, 1879), has shown that the consti
 tuents of the juice are a resin, a gum, water, and a small residue
 insoluble in water or in alcohoL            The method of separation        which
 I   employed      was    the same as      that adopted by Mr Hiraga.             A
 resinous acid (urushic acid), together with           a  small quantity of the
 volatile matter, is separated       from the other substances        of the  juice
 by treating it with absolute alcohol, evaporating the solution, and
  drying the acid at 105° to 110° C.            The residue is boiled for some
  time with water, and the extract evaporated           on  a  water-bath until   it
  acquires a constant weight.         This gives the quantity of      gum.     The
  residue, from the water extract, consisting of          a coagulated    diastatic
  matter,   with small quantities of insoluble colouring substances,              is
  dried at 100°     C,    and weighed.       The difference   of the sum of the
  percentages    from 100 gives the amount of water and volatile matter.
  Thus     pure Yoshino lacquer was            found   to  have the      following
  composition : —

   This peculiar acid        is the main constituent of the original juice, and
   also of the portion         soluble in alcohol.                  The juice also contains                    a
   very small quantity              of   a volatile          substance which                 passes        into
   alcoholic solution, and is almost completely driven out during the
   drying of the acid at 105°-110° C.
       Urushic      acid is a pasty substance                    of somewhat dark colour,
   having     the    characteristic        smell       of the juice,             readily       soluble in
   benzene, ether, carbon bisulphide,                  and chloroform, less easily soluble
   in fusel     oil  and      petroleum          of high        boiling         point.        It    is quite
   insoluble in water.          Its    specific gravity, taken at 23°                     C,    is 0-9851.
   The    acid is not affected           by     a  temperature of 160°                    C,    but above
   200°   C.  it decomposes slowly with carbonisation.                              When       exposed        to

    The acid possesses very poisonous                  properties, and produces           a
 most    disagreeable     itching     sensation when          applied     to the skin.
 Although it       does not act    with equal severity upon all persons, the
 attack is worse when one         conies in contact with it for the first time,
 subsequently the effect of the poison is very little felt.                        An  im
 mediate    application     of strong solution           of acetate of lead to the
 inflamed part is the most effective remedy.
    From the alcoholic solution of the acid many metallic salts can
be produced, most          of which      are    slightly   soluble in alcohol,         but
almost insoluble in water.
    Lead    acetate    gives a      greyish     flocculent     precipitate   —    a   very

Ferric     eldoride gives a deep black voluminous                      precipitate,     very

the alcoholic solution was precipitated with an insufficient amount
of ferric chloride in order to            see   whether this fractional precipitation
gave      a salt     of    different     composition.       The compound           obtained
proved to be a salt of a very acid nature.                      Before analysis it was

      These salts have very similar characteristics.               They are light sub
   stances  of a faint peculiar odour;               at 120° C. they melt to a black
   mass   with   some decomposition, and at a somewhat higher tempera
   ture they ignite spontaneously, giving off dense smoke of a disagree
   able  odour.      The roiro lacquer       is produced by the formation of some
   of these   iron compounds.
      Experiments have shown that to prepare                 a good   roiro lacquer, one
   must be careful        to avoid adding too much iron              salt   to the juice    ;

for in that case the varnish will, in course of time, acquire                   a much
browner shade (the oxidised iron urushiate having a reddish brown
colour), losing at the same time in some measure its admirable
qualities of resisting the action of strong chemical reagents.                         A
small quantity of any soluble iron salt added to the juice will                  suffice
for the preparation of the best roiro lacquer.
    Free alkalies impart a very dark colour to the solution of urushic
acid, which by transmitted light looks purplish blue, and by reflected
light very dark brown.          This viscid compound,          if exposed    to the air,
rapidly blackens and dries         up.     It   is a compound of an alkali metal
with the acid, the normal salt of which will probably be represented
by the formula C14H17M'02.             The salt was not quite fit for analysis,
as it seemed to suffer oxidation like some other salts of urushic acid
during the processes of purification and drying.
    Long-continued       action of strong hydrochloric             acid upon urushic
acid produces     a peculiar change in the latter          ;  the resulting body      has
exactly the same composition           as the     original acid, but very different
properties.     When urushic acid          was heated with a very large excess
of hydrochloric acid for about three days, that lost by evaporation
being replaced, it first swelled up to a soft sponge, gradually assumed
a caoutchouc-like state, and         finally hardened        into   a  dark inadhesive
mass.     The substance,      being cut into small pieces, was boiled with
water, filtered,    and    dried    over a water-bath          till   the last trace of
hydrochloric acid retained in the pores of the substance was expelled.
 On cohobation with alcohol a small quantity of the substance dis
 solved,  and this, when examined, showed the usual characteristics                     of
 unchanged urushic acid.           The residue       dried at 105°        C,  gave this
result on analysis : —

    It appears from this that urushic acid suffers                molecular transfor
 mation (polymerisation)        under the influence of strong hydrochloric
 acid.   /8-urushic acid thus formed is a dark brownish solid body, with
 a faint peculiar odour, and soluble with difficulty in the usual

                       of Edinburgh,           Session 1884-85.                           181
 solvents of urushic        acid.     Such being the           case,  an experiment       was
tried to ascertain        whether urushic             acid     dries  in    an   atmosphere
charged with        hydrochloric        acid.     A   glass    plate, very    thinly   coated
with pure urushic        acid,    was placed       upon      a  basin containing fuming
hydrochloric acid under            a  bell jar, dried after standing two days.
The urushic acid         darkened in colour, and looked somewhat similar
to the naturally       hardened        lacquer.       When the /? acid is heated to
100' C.       it merely    softens      a  little, and even at 130° it shows no
sign of decomposition.              It   appears that the substance             obtained by
the decomposition         of   an  alkali   salt of urushic acid        with hydrochloric
acid is the same       body     as /3-urushic     acid.
     Bromine acts powerfully upon urushic acid, evolving fumes of
hydrobromic acid.            To a solution of the acid in carbon bisulphide
bromine was        gradually     added     till it  was in some excess ; the whole
 being      evaporated      to   dryness over          a    water-bath      the    mass   was
 exhausted       with strong alcohol, and the extract again evaporated,
 after    which it yielded a dark semi-solid mass.                    This was tested for
 bromine by        igniting it with         pure    lime.       0'70G0 grammes         of the
  substance gave      1-1510 grammes of silver bromide;                    or bromine was
  shown to be present in amount equal to                69-  37 per cent, agreeing       with
  a   hexabromo     substitution     derivative of the acid, having the formula
  ^u^iaBrjO^         which requires 69'36 per cent, of bromine. At
  ordinary      temperatures it is an almost solid body of a brownish
   colour, and soluble        in  most      solvents of urushic acid.              By using
   regulated quantities of bromine its lower substitution products might
   perhaps     be obtained.       Chlorine also gives a series of substitution
   products ; but the compounds have not yet been                      fully examined.
        The action of    nitric acid upon urushic acid                 gives   rise first to a
    series  of nitro-substitution       products, which appear             to change after
    wards   into another acid containing more oxygen.                       The reaction     is
   very energetic    ; the   urushic acid first swells up to about thirty times
    its  original bulk in the form of         a  yellowish sponge, which disappears
    gradually    with the progress of            the reaction.        A quantity of this
    porous   body was heated for half           a day, treated       with a large quantity
    of water,   dissolved in alcohol, and precipitated with ferric chloride.
     The   precipitate,    after    the    usual purification           and     drying,    was
    analysed,   and the following results obtained : —

  exposed to sunlight.             The barium salt of this acid was also prepared
  by exactly      neutralising its aqueous solution with barium carbonate.
  The solution was evaporated to dryness, and the substance obtained
  analysed.        By carefully and slowly evaporating the aqueous
   solution of either the silver or the barium salt, the substance can be
   got in minute hard crystals.

    of light hydrocarbon,          which, however, appears              to polymerise very
    easily  during     its purification by fractional distillation.                The nature
    of  this   oil is being examined          ;  but one of the lighter               fractions

   II. Examination of the          water extract, the Gum. — Gum is a normal
constituent of lacquer juice, and forms from                    3 to 8 per cent,      of the
original liquid.      Since gum is insoluble in alcohol, it is conveniently
separated      by treating       that    portion   of       the   original      which      was
insoluble in alcohol with           boiling    water,      filtering, and evaporating
on  a  water-bath till the weight becomes constant.                        In this way         a
friable, light-coloured, tasteless and inodorous substance                     is obtained.
This   is the anhydrous       gum.       On combustion it gave the following
numbers : — 0-5267        grammes      of the substance gave 0-7823 grammes
of carbonic acid (C02), 0-2834 grammes                     water (H20), and 0-0267
grammes        ash.   Analysis     of the ash in a separate               sample      of    the
substance      gave the following      : —

 molecules of sugar (C6H1206), the molecular ratio which the product
of inversion       bears to cupric oxide       will  be exactly two-thirds of that
of dextrose         to cupric oxide, and consequently               its cupric     oxide
reducing       power or      K   will   be 75.    This, however, requires further
confirmation.          But whatever may         be the nature of the sugar        which
is produced from         this gum, its physical properties         are identical with
those of gum        arabic.     It is present in urushi juice      in  the form of an
acid      salt  (probably     of arabic acid), in        combination      chiefly with
potash, lime,       alumina and        magnesia    ; and   the   point of difference
which is of interest is the            presence    of an alumina      salt, which    has
not hitherto been observed              in other   gums.     A  mixture of the gum
and     urushic acid with water in the proportion in which they exist
in the juice does not undergo any change even                   when exposed to the
 conditions       most favourable for the drying of the lacquer.                  More
 over, part     of the gum can be extracted in an unchanged state from
 the    perfectly hardened lacquer,           and since it exists in the original
 juice in the form          of aqueous      solution, it probably serves        to keep
  the    constituents of      the   juice in     a state  of   uniform     distribution
 and     intimate emulsion.          It   may also     act as a binding       material,
  and assist the adhering           power of the lacquer when laid on any
  surface.
      III.   The Nitrogenous Matter and its action upon Urushic Acid.                 —
  That portion of the          juice which remains insoluble in alcohol and
  boiling water consists essentially of a nitrogenous matter,                the action
  of which      upon urushic       acid is the cause of the hardening             of the
  lacquer.       It forms from     2 to 8 per     cent, of the original juice.       The
  juice which contains most           of it dries most quickly, but gives a varnish
   of inferior lustre.        The substance,      separated    from the gum by the
   usual method       of boiling   water,    has no action upon urushic acid, but
   the residue     (after the separation of urushic acid) or its extract with
   cold    water, shows its peculiar diastatic activity in an unimpaired
   degree.      When such        a  solution is boiled, the albuminoid            matter
    coagulates    in the form of     a   white precipitate.
       The substance,     first dried on a water-bath, and then over sulphuric
    acid, gave   on analysis, the      following numbers : —

   In the  ash traces of sulphur and phosphorus were detected.
   The substance       is   slightly soluble in water, 10 per cent, sodium
chloride solution, and in weak alkali solutions                   ;   but other liquids
seem to have no solvent action upon it.                  It has no perceptible action
upon sugar solution or gelatinised starch.                  It differs from the other
albuminoids      in containing       a   notably     smaller amount of nitrogen
(only one-third), whilst the numbers obtained for carbon, hydrogen,
and oxygen      for its composition very nearly agree with those of the
other albuminoids.           Active    principles of malt (diastase),          koji, and
saliva do not possess the same property of exerting the peculiar
action above mentioned upon urushic acid.
   Two   series of experiments were             instituted to test the activity of
the nitrogenous matter upon urushic acid, first at different tempera
tures, and secondly        in different     gaseous media.          For this purpose    a
small quantity of Yoshino juice was put into a covered                       beaker and
subjected   to the regulated        heat of the water-bath, the water lost by
evaporation being replaced.            The heated juice was next thinly coated
on a glass plate, and left to dry in           a   box, the air of which was kept
constantly moist by the falling in of drops of water.                       The time of
heating in each experiment was from three and                     a  half to four hours,
and the temperature         of the drying-box was 20° C.
      1.  At ordinary temperatures            (20°   C.)   the sample dried after      3J
            hours in air, and the             same    under a bell jar containing
            moist oxygen gas dried after less than                 2 hours.

    Mr   J.    Takayama, working very carefully on a sample                  bought at
Tokio,      found the limit of activity          of nitrogenous         matter to      be
70°— 73°       C, but with     the Yoshino sample (which contains much less
nitrogenous matter and water) he confirmed my former number of
60° C. as the limit.          His method was to place the juice in a boat in a
tube immersed         in gradually    heated water.
    Next, glass plates coated with urushi juice were put under                    a  bell
jar containing       an experimental gas, and left         to dry at the tempera

     The most legitimate inference to be drawn from all these experi
 ments is that the      combination of oxygen and moisture at the tempera-
 tare of 20°     C. is an essential condition      for the display of the fullest
 activity of the diastatic matter, and consequently most favourable for
 the drying of the       lacquer.     With either     the increase      or decrease of
 temperature,       the drying      power decreases     ;  at   0°   to   2°  C.   it  is
 temporarily suspended,          and at from C0°    to 70°    C,   the substance      en
 tirely loses its activity ; this is then the point          at which the coagula
 tion  of the albuminoid matter takes           place — or, in other        words,   the
 diastatic    action  ceases.     With other    gases,    however,      I  am inclined
 to  think that some atmospheric air, which may have been present in
 them,    might have favoured the conditions for drying                 ;  otherwise it
 would not have         been possible.      Mr  J. Takayama has recently con
 firmed     the view that lacquer        juice never dries in an atmosphere

of hydrogen or of carbonic acid, when kept in a eudiometer standing
over mercury.          These conclusions bear out the practical experiences
of our lacquer men, viz., that lacquer dries most readily in the rainy
season, and better in summer than                    in winter — a damp             atmosphere
at a temperature            of 20° to 30° C. being usual during                      the rainy
season.
     The nitrogenous matter in the juice,                   if it   be really possessed of a
peculiar kind of diastatic action upon urushic acid, ought to be able
to cause the change upon a comparatively large quantity of the acid.
To study this property, and to find out the limit of the quantity of
that substance within which the action can still take place upon
the acid, certain experiments were made.                            Various   mixtures         of a
known quantity of Hachioji juice with a weighed quantity of pure
urushic        acid   were    made ;     after each mixture               had received            the
requisite quantity of water, it was thoroughly                          mixed in         a   mortar,
and left to dry in a thin layer on glass plates in a moist chamber.
     The practical limit within which the action can take place was
found to be       1   of the nitrogenous matter to 413 of urushic acid.
     Although a much less quantity of the diastatic matter can effect
the drying of the acid after the lapse of many days, such length of
time      will unquestionably          be considered            inconvenient in practical
working with the juice            as a   varnish.       These experiments also show
that the amount of gum in the juice can be brought down to a small
percentage       without bad effect.          A     large    quantity of      it,   as   it   exists
in    bad juice,      is   always injurious, as       it     produces     blisters upon the
newly lacquered             ware when    it   is    brought into contact            with water
for any length of time.              Knowing         these facts, we are now able to
prepare any good quality of the juice for varnish making, by                                 mixing
a    regulated    quantity of pure urushic acid with the natural juice.
      The question still remains,          How       does the diastase          act upon the
urushic acid, or what           is   the change which urushic acid undergoes                       in
drying     1     To solve this question, the states of the lacquer before
 and after drying have been examined and compared.
      A   quantity of the fresh juice (Yoshino sample) was rapidly heated
 on   a   water-bath, so as to coagulate the albuminoid, and put     stop                     a
 to its further action upon the urushic acid.                        The heat was continued
 till all the     water      was expelled from the              juice;    the substance           was
 then analysed,        with the following result —          :

     The comparison of these two results indicates that the lacquer in
 hardening had taken np oxygen          ;   and we     see   that, catcris paribus,
 the amount of oxygen thus taken up               is almost quite accounted           for
 on the supposition     that each molecule of urushic acid (C14II180.,) in
 the   juice   has  taken up     one atom of oxygen, and changed                    into
 another    body, C14Hlg03.
     Further proof of this theory has been reached by the preparation
 of oxy-unuhic      acid (CuH1803),    which showed        all  the properties of a
 dried lacquer,      Urushic acid was repeatedly         subjected to the action
 of strong chromic acid mixture containing some excess of sulphuric
 acid to prevent the precipitation        of chromic oxide.            The product,
 cohobated     with strong alcohol     to     dissolve away the           unat tacked
 urushic    acid, gave, on drying at 106°        C,  a brownish powder of the

   This  substance       is very stable, and resists          the   action of strong
mineral acids except hot fuming nitric acid, which gradually changes
it to a yellowish        body, and finally into the new acid previously
mentioned, C81I18(C001I)4.             No solvent has yet been found for it.
The strength and durability of lacquer varnish are due to the
presence   of this oxy-urushic acid.          Many experiments on the harden
ing of lacquer        were    made    by Mr      J.    Takayama,        and they con
clusively establish      the fact that hardening is due to the oxidation                  of
urushic a:id, and not to its hydration.
   Some drying       oil is frequently added to the lacquer juice to make
varnish.     I have studied this point, to learn             how far the introduc
tion of the oil is admissible, without impairing the essential quality
of the lacquer.       It  is ascertained     that the addition of          10 to 15 per
cent, of the drying        oil to the juice does not hinder the hardening
power of the lacquer, and 20 or 25 per cent, of the oil can be intro
duced without much bad effect.               Such   a    mixture gives      a   varnish of
greater transparency and spreading power than the pure juice itself,
but its capability of withstanding            strong chemical reagents              is pro
portionally reduced.         The results arrived at may be summoned up
in the following statements         : —
   1.  Lacquer      juice consists      essentially of four         substances,        viz.,
urushic acid, gum, water, and nitrogenous matter.

                          of Edinburgh,          Session 1884-85.                        191
     2.     The main       constituent, urushic acid,         is a stable    acid, capable
of forming many well-defined salts and derivative compounds.
     3.    The gum is probably identical with gum arabic.
     4.    The nitrogenous matter has              a  composition allied to albumen,
with much less nitrogen, and has                  a  peculiar diastatic property.
     5.    The hardening of the juice is due to the oxidation of urushic
acid (C14H130o) into oxy-urushic acid (C14H1803), which is effected
by the aid of the nitrogenous matter in presence of oxygen and
moisture.
     6.    The hardening         can only take         place  within narrow limits of
temperature,        viz., bet ween    0° to 2°   C, on   one side, and the temperature
of the coagulation of the albuminoid (60° to 70° C.) on the other.
     7.    The gum is essential in keeping up the emulsion and uniform
distribution of the constituents               ;  but in the hardened       lacquer    it  is
injurious, causing blisters on newly lacquered                     ware    when treated
with water for a length of time.
      8.   Any quality        can    be conveniently        given to the juice by the
addition        of pure     urushic      acid,    which    brings down the         relative
 amounts of gum and nitrogenous matter.                      The lacquer becomes thus
 more      transparent and gains in strength.
      9.    The   mixture of       20 to 25 per cent,          of drying oil with the
 juice does not much impair the essential                  quality of the lacquer.

      For many years past some                 little amount of      isolated   work has
  occasionally       been    accomplished in          photographing      certain    of the
  brighter      stars.    But lately, stellar photography             has gone forward
  with leaps and bounds            ;  so that at a dozen different Observatories
  in Europe, America,           South Africa,        and   Australia,   so  much is now
  being done       in that line, that        there     is a speedy prospect        of,  in  a
  manner,      the whole sidereal heavens being photographed,                  and after a
   fashion    that would not only have astonished                Hipparchus, but been

Struve up to within                a very    few years ago.
     The reason of this sudden development of astronomical photo
graphy is twofold.                  First,     a    remarkable improvement, amounting
even to a bursting of its bonds of the previous quarter of a century,
which has taken               place    in ordinary photography                 ;   and second,     the
accompanying circumstance,                         that those          new methods       have    been
found most           peculiarly        suited to the             special requirements of the
Astronomer.
     The new Photography                    of the portrait gallery consists in the re
placement          of inflammable collodions, the silver bath, with all its
sicknesses,         wet films,         soft,       slippery,     contractile       and   perishable,
together     with sensitizations which each worker had to prepare pain
fully   to his own hand, each time of using                        ;
                                                                       — their entire replacement
by dry plates, prepared by the thousand at large manufactories, ready
to any one's hand, and with their bromo-iodised hard gelatine                                   films,
far more sensitive than the best wet collodion of the old silver bath
preparation.
     Now, this enormous               improvement has suited the astronomers                        in
several ways.           They were never very fond of dealing with alcohol
and ether at night, or manipulating                         all the other dangerous, or deli
cate and         difficult   experiments of chemical                     laboratories in the con
fined space of their revolving domes.                            And if     they did occasionally
             "
prepare          wet-plates,"        they had         to    use them        immediately, or lose
them    ;    while     if    the    sky happily remained                   clear   enough      for the
using, — the        wet-plate  would not remain long in its highest state of
sensitiveness,        or cleanliness either; for certain " oyster-shell" mark
ings, as well as"fogging," would begin to form upon     pin-holes                        it,
would multiply, and the image of    brilliant and minute point of
                                                            a
light would begin             to spread            chemically in the film, until pungent
star-points became,            as to size, more            like apples and oranges.
     But    the     new dry plates,                after very easy purchase,             can be kept
waiting for an opportunity, through any length of time.                                  They admit
also of any length of exposure,                        without losing their sensitiveness,
and without spreading the images                           of bright points        so extravagantly
as   the wet films.            And this ability                 of the dry-plates generally to
stand       long exposures            is   simply invaluable in photographing faint
stars   ;   for, contrary to the human eye, which can either                             see   such an

                             of Edinburgh,      Session 1884-85.                        193
object at once, or never (for longer looking merely fatigues the eye,
and at last deprives it of all power) — the photographic dry-plate
goes on        accumulating the        effects of an at first invisible     star,   until by
such accumulation a visible, or rather developable, mark is at length
made      ;   and    if   5 minutes    are not enough to produce that effect, a
\   hour,      i hour,     or even   a whole hour may be tried.
     To compass such an interval, the clock-work                     movement of any
equatorial          must     of  course    be   particularly     good, and      sedulously
watched to keep the star-images always on one spot, and prevent
their       being     drawn      out  into ellipses.       But this correction being
applied, then the only chemical operation left with the astronomer,
is the developing            of the latent   image on the plate      ;  which operation,
 however, may be delayed                  with   these   new plates to next day, or
 week, or month even,             if agreeable.
      Now the special examples of this new stellar photography which
 I have       to lay before the meeting, — have been              kindly sent     to me by
 my friend         Dr David Gill, Astronomer-Royal                at the Cape of Good
 Hope       :  and as he is not present here,           but is now on the other side
  of the world,         I  need have no compunction          about alluding to him as
  a new       rising star, of the first magnitude and richest promise, appear
  ing just now above the Astronomical                   horizon   ; and by his singular
  genius, and surpassing            success   in whatever      he undertakes, doing as
  much honour to            his native city, the Granite Queen of the North, as
  to the      Tercentenary of the Edinburgh University, where he received
  an    Honorary Degree last year.
       A professional photographer, with abundant supplies of apparatus
   and materials, was recently sent out to him,                 to act under his direc
   tions    ;  and he has now accordingly begun, with that aid, the regular
   and systematic mapping             of the whole Southern            Sidereal heavens,
   seTen degrees         by  seven degrees at a time       ; and the examples he has
   just sent, are         merely the first essays.        Yet they      possess already a
   very considerable degree of perfection             ;  and are specially to be com
   mended for the neatness and roundness of all their stellar discs,                      —
   the  long exposures notwithstanding.
       The 1st     of these interesting photographs           represents,    in chief, the
    three    notable stars forming the belt of Orion, on            a scale   of  1 inch to
    1 degree,     and with an exposure of half an hour.
       The 2nd represents the same subject, but               with  an exposure of one

194                    Proceedings       of  the Royal Society
hour; and       a great increase    will   be remarked   in  the number of     smaller
and exceedingly minute stars.
   The 3rd represents, on the same scale though with a larger                     field,
part of the      Milky Way      near that remarkable variable rj Argus.
   While      the   4th shows the instrument with            which the views were
obtained.
   These photographs         are evidently       sharp  enough    to admit of    being
magnified       several   times   linear,    rendering     the  smaller stars     more
easily visible.       Doubtless therefore,        Dr Gill, who       does  everything
well and on        a  continually rising ideal,        will eventually     have   them
magnified to that degree,             or perhaps      more ; and will       make     his
Camera      views of the stars, everything that such short focussed views
can ever become.
   But     I   should warn the meeting that they never can rise up to
the extraordinary importance of supplanting all the older forms of
astronomy, as has been recently bruited about, with                     so  much con
fidence,     by some very well-intentioned             persons ; but who are not
practically      acquainted with         either the excelsior       requirements of
intellectual      astronomy on one side, or the limited capabilities of a
photographic film, on the other.
    As   the art-science     now stands, and with the class of instrument
used     on    this occasion,   — exceedingly pretty, integrating views of
what can be seen, on          a very    small scale, of the really unfathomable
depths of the starry heavens, may be obtained,                  and  will   have   their
 own particular uses and approximate applications.                   But any    one of
these mere Camera views is totally                 unable to differentiate to the
terrible extent required by the higher astronomy                      of the present
day.
    In double-star work for          instance, and its most important attribute
of being able to demonstrate             a  physical connection between one star
and another,       amenable to the calculations of Newtonian gravitational
astronomy,      — we ought      to be enabled        to divide   a second     of space
into    several     parts   with    certainty.      And for that       purpose,    such
portion of space should be represented                on a photograph by not less
than   -j1^  of an inch.     But that implies, in this case, a further magni
fying of not less       than 70 times linear.          Or the making, out of one
of the photographs on the table, 4900 others, each                  as large as  itself,

                          of Edinburgh,         Session 1884-85.                              195
to represent         properly that       one very small portion            of  the    sky.      So
that an atlas, to show the whole sky on the same scale, would re
quire about 5 millions of them               ;  and by no means every photograph
that is taken is always a success, and worthy of being kept                              ;  while
every one that is kept requires at least two companions                            as good       as
itself, to guard against accidental imitations of little stars by either
pin-holes     in the film, or specks in           the glass plate.
     And even if we should replace                  that   kind of magnifying              by the
Achromatic          compound microscope,           — we     are   just  as  badly subject        as
 ever to the       inherent   weakness       of an originally small photograph,                  as
 distinguished        from Nature herself further magnified,                 in this import
 ant   truth   ;   viz., that we do not, by simply magnifying                   a  discoloured
 film, separate       close stars    ;  we merely enlarge           their discs, or discous
 impressions.          And at     the rate     of enlarging already indicated, such
 disc, or spurious photographic              effect, in the case of any one of these
 three stars in the        Belt of Orion, — would swell out into                 a huge     circle,
  no less than 3-5 inches           in diameter!          Utterly covering,        concealing,
  or swallowing        up therefore       any interesting stellar companion such
  star might have, though it should be 800 times as far off as the small
  angular distances which astronomers                  have to deal with.
      While further still, though long                  exposure      may bring       out    more
  stars than short exposure, with               the same instrument,           — it    does not
  by any means enable           a  small telescope to compete with                a large      one
  in what it can show with any exposure.                       Photography of the stars
   therefore,     though begun most meritoriously with small instruments,
   will have       to be continued afterwards, in the accustomed                        ways of
   old,   with larger       ones.       Larger    ones     possessing      more     light,     and
   more magnifying          power ; — but with the inevitable accompaniment
   of smaller angular fields of view                 ;   and    in that     case    there      will
   ensue    a      great   multiplication        of    the    sensitive     plates     required.
    Wherefore in place of the telescopes                of the future being, by photo
    graphy, reduced       to pocket size and minimum cost, — they                   will rather
    nave to be made larger than ever, and worked more expensively.
       Hence     it is that   so able      a   practical astronomer as             Mr Ainslie
    Common, who has been               performing such wonders of astronomical
    photography       with his grand reflecting           telescope     of  3   feet diameter
    of aperture, is casting about now for the                   erection    of another        tele
     scope of 7     or 8 feet in diameter, or considerably larger than Lord

196                         Proceedings            of   the      Royal Society
Rosse's ; infinitely           more         refined     in its mounting, and               requiring an
almost uncountable                  number of photographic plates                             to    represent
everything it is capable of showing throughout the sky.
     By all      means      too,   I   would say, let him be furnished                             with such
an instrument by any one who can afford                                   it,   for he will use          it to
excellent purpose, and                 it   will   be   a   noble monument of Great                  Britain;
— but      do not insist on getting from                        Dr Gill,    the work of so            colossal
an instrument,             when you have only furnished him with                                    a  rather
large Camera, of the portrait-taking order.
     The next and              final photograph             I      have     to    show, was          received
lately from my friend Colonel A. T. Fraser,                                 RE.,    in charge             of the
public works at Trichinopoly,                      south of Madras.
     Though at first sight having nothing astronomical about                                              it,   it    is
surely,     as he      himself says by letter,               —
     "A     very remarkable photograph.                           It   represents      an immense,                   an
almost countless            collection of natives at Combaconam                                in the Tan-
jore District, on the river Cauvery                           ;   where, once       in   every 12 years
the Ganges            of the   North of India               is   said to flow into and             fill    a cer
tain built tank in the town.
     "   For that      day, the 28th of February on this particular                                   12 year
occasion of           1885, the Ganges itself loses its efficacy, and bathing                                        in
this tank        is   equally meritorious.                  Consequently vast             numbers save
a   long journey, and avail themselves                            of the opportunity.               And yet
it   is   well known           that the supply of the tank percolates                               from the
Cauvery River close by.
     " Now why should              I        say that this photograph                will       be specially
interesting to you             1
     "
     I      asked      a   Brahmin, who in private tells me things now and
then, what occasions                the gathering           1     He replied      it   was the rising of
the       star
                 '
                     Mukkum,' in Sanscrit, that brought                                such        crowds            on
that particular day, and the rising only happens once in 12 years.
     " So    here you have hundreds of thousands of natives assembled
to bathe in           a   tank in an out-of-the-way town, in consequence of the
star      'Mukkum' having                   a   peculiar position, that probably hardly
any of them could define                    ;   nor could in fact any of the crowd give
an intelligible            reason      for being in the picture, except                       a     few from
curiosity or obligation.

                          of Edinburgh,        Session 1884-85.                     197
       "I             not having references
           cannot,                                  at hand, find out what       star is
 meant.         According to Bentley, both         the Ganges and the Euphrates
 symbolise       the Ecliptic in Esoteric Astronomy.
      " But apart from this,
                                     look at the photograph and see how closely
it tallies with Isaiah xviii., literally translated, — ' A people scattered
and bald to a         nation     to  be   feared from this and onwards        ;  people
corded.'         The people in the photograph have put           aside their turbans
for fear of losing them, and you pee nearly every head is shorn and
bald ; and you may be able to make out the Brahmins by the piece
of pack-thread slung across their shoulder and chest.
     " Combaconam
                            is an obscure town, principally inhabited by Brah
mins, who are largely pensioned officials.                 It  contains, however, a
College at         which the highest English education is given, and where
 the late      Sir Alexander Grant was once Principal.
       "What star         I wonder     is this Mukkum," continues       the Colonel,
  "  and    why should it be important enough to draw such a mass of
  Hindoos on the 28th of February to N. Lat 10° 45', and East
  Eongitude         79=  30'.    Is not    a multitude   that can be incited by a
  motive of which we have no appreciation, literally               '
                                                                     to be feared.'
        " It                                                            Mr Pogson, is
               may be admitted that our Madras Astronomer,
   as   learned an Astronomer           as any of the day, and yet      I am     certain
    there    is nothing      he   could say about any one of the stars, which
    cculd collect hundreds          of thousands of     men to bathe at an obscure
    town on the Railway.             Therefore natives must know what we do
    not"
         In  a  subsequent letter dated May 4, the Colonel further writes            : —
         " I  am now able to give          you some information       about the stars
     fixing the festival at Combaconam, having got             a Brahmin the night
     before last to actually point them out.
         "It   appears that
                               '
                                 Mukkum,' which      means they tell me    in Sanscrit
     '
       sacrifice,' is not a single star, but the four stars          together, in the
     sign Leo,     forming the four corners of       a rhomboid.      They were just
     overhead here about 7h p.m.
         " The
                 very bright star close to them,         I  was told    was    '
                                                                                 Brama-
     haspiti,'    the   'tutor of    Brahma' — though      I  identify it with the
     Planet Jupiter.
         " Each
                    sacred   town    has what is termed its ' Stalla       Purana,     or
      Purana loci, and the festival         of which   I sent you the Panorama is

 198                   Proceedings        of  the   Royal Society
described    in one of these, — some cure having occurred from bathing,
                    '              '
when the stars        Mukkum         rose at some epochal      date near     10b a.m.,
and at the same instant Jupiter entered Leo.
    " These Puranas      have seldom         been translated, and the      authorita
tive copies,    as of all the Hindoo books, are graven on slips of Palm
leaf.    The importance of what can be written, or found written,                    on
Palm leaves is shown by the Photograph."
    So far this most interesting letter writer, Colonel Fraser.
    Having now looked into           the   Nautical Almanac      on his  day of    the
Photograph being taken, viz., February 28, 1885, there is this close
approach     of Jupiter to    a  Leonis, viz.     : —
                                     H.   m.  s.                    0
            Jupiter     R.A.    =    10   8   59 and    N. DecL  + 12 46
            aLeonisRA.          =    10 2 15 and        N. DecL  + 12 32.
While     12 years     and   a   few days        previously, viz., on January      19,
 1873, the positions were, after         Jupiter    had in the meantime wandered
 through the whole breadth of the heavens               —
                                H.   M.   S.

    I shall inquire therefore         of the Colonel what may have been the
month and the day of the Festival                  being held in 1873,    as  well  as
at any other 12 year periods            of which he can obtain exact informa

     The following results of observations made with four of the ther
 mometer screens, devised by           Mr Aitken of Darroch, form             the com
 mencement       of an investigation which         has been begun         at Granton
  Marine Station,      and which     is to   be   carried   on    there   and at Ben
  Nevis Observatory       during the summer and autumn, with the view
  of finding     a more    suitable screen for exposing thermometers                for
  meteorological     purposes, and,     if  possible,   of determining the mean
  correction to be applied to the readings          of thermometers        exposed in
   the  ordinary Stevenson screens.          So far, the work has been entirely
   of a preliminary     character,   but some points have been brought to
   light which are of considerable       interest.
      Mr Aitken's screens       were described       in  a paper     read   before the
    Society, on 2nd    June last    year, and published        in   the Proceedings,
   •vol  xii. p. 661.
       The screen used as a standard with which            to compare      the others
    consists of a rectangular wooden tube, into which the bulbs of two
    theriiometere — wet and dry — are inserted from above, and through
    which a current of air is made to circulate by means of a suction fan.
    The air drawn   in by the fan     does not come into contact with much

200                      Proceedings            of   the   Royal Society
heated surface, and          the circulation               is sufficiently rapid to keep the
walls of the tube at the temperature                        of the air, and to absorb any
heat the thermometers                 may receive          by radiation, without being                  so
strong    as to generate heat               by friction.
      The readings of this apparatus                   have      been   compared        with       those
given by the ordinary Stevenson screen, and an improved                                           form,
having a double top, and                    the bottom closed           with louvre-boards of
the ordinary pattern.                 Besides these, the readings of thermometers
without screens, simply protected from direct sunshine, have been
taken.     One of these has its bulb enclosed                           in   a silver         thimble,
which reflects          diffused       radiations          of all kinds.       Under another
shade two ordinary thermometers                       are placed      side   by side — the bulb
of one of them having part of its surface blackened.                                The blackened
bulb, of course, absorbs                   part of the heat radiated to                 it,   and the
arrangement        is   so constructed that the excess of the reading                             of   the
blackened bulb above                  that of the clean bulb, subtracted from the
reading of the clean bulb, gives the true air-temperature.
  The curves shown are drawn from hourly observations taken during
twelve hours daily.           Since the commencement                    of these observations
the weather has not been of the character                        required to put the various
screens to     a   severe test, there having been always more or less wind.
The actual differences of temperature                       given, are therefore not nearly
so great as those         observed           by   Mr Aitken under                more   favourable
conditions last summer            ;        but the differences          that do exist are of
considerable interest.
  The positions of the curves                     relatively to one another evidently
depend    to   a   very great extent on the state of the atmosphere                                with
regard to cloud, and the influence                    of the clouds         is   regulated,    not so
much by their amount                  as    by their position — the              effect of    a   small
amount of cumulus cloud situated directly above the instruments
being very marked.
  In    the forenoon, as the temperature                     rises towards the daily maxi
mum, the curves for the two Stevenson                           boxes are steeper than that
for the fan apparatus             ;   starting sometimes             from    a    point below          it,
and    after crossing       it,   gradually increasing their distance.                        This     ia
obviously due to the gradual heating                       of   the boxes, the effect being
much more marked in strong sunshine than in dull cloudy weather.
If the prevailing conditions persist during maximum or minimum,  a

                       of Edinburgh,       Session 1834-85.                          201
 the relative   position of the    curves remains unaltered ; but        if any   change
 takes place     with respect to clouds, the effect is at once noticeable.
In   the curves     for June 9 (Plate VIII.), we have in the morning the
various    instruments reading very close together, the sky being covered
with large quantities of cumulus cloud.              After   1 1  hrs. we have a clear
sky, and temperature          rising steadily till noon, the gradual divergence
of the curves being very well shown. Shortly after noon a maxi
mum      occurs — the sky remaining            clear — and hence          we   find   the
positions of the curves, with respect to each other, unaltered.                        At
13   hrs. a minimum occurs, followed at           14 hrs.    by another maximum           ;
but in this        case   we   have cumulus       clouds passing overhead            and
checking the radiation of heat to the two Stevenson boxes.                         These
boxes have        now    the   effect of cooling the air         circulating    through
them, and hence          the curve for the fan apparatus           crosses the others,
and becomes the highest.             The curves remain reversed            till  16 hrs.,
 when the sky was again clear, and then fall back to their original
 positions, the old form of Stevenson being the last to do so, as the
 double top keeps the improved form from being heated                       as easily   as
  the other.      At  17 hrs. the curves show a minimum point after a con
  siderable fall of temperature.          Although      a small quantity of cloud
  was observed overhead at this hour, its effect is scarcely                perceptible,
  as  it was   of a cirrus type, very high up.           After   18 hrs. a steady     fall
   of temperature sets in, continuing           till   21   hrs., when observations
   were stopped.        Whenever      the  radiation      from the boxes         may   be
   considered    to have fairly commenced,        we find the curves for the old
   and improved Stevenson screens            changing places, the former being
   now lower than the latter,          as the double top and louvred              bottom
   cause the improved form to lose heat less rapidly.                   Both, however,
   as the process     of coding goes on, gradually approach the curve for
   the standard      apparatus.      Throughout      these observations the wind
   was   north-westerly,     varying in force from 0 to            2  (Beaufort Scale).
   The effect of varying       wind force    is only shown        in  the general form
   of the curves     — their relative positions remaining almost            unchanged.
   This shows that although in a dead calm the radiation effects are
   enormously increased, they still require to be taken into account in
   accurate measurements of temperature,              even when the wind-force is
   considerable.
       In the curves shown for 8th June          one point is of especial interest,

   202                   Proceedings         of the Royal Society
  the same effect being produced              as   in one of the curves just discussed
  — but by almost        opposite    causes.         In   the forenoon the weather was
  dull and      wet,  the   sky being overcast               with    a  pallium of cumulus
  clouds.    At   13 hrs. the   clouds cleared away, the sun shining brightly.
  Observations were begun at                 11    hrs.,   when the Stevenson screens
  read lower than the standard ; the rain water drying off the louvre
  boards   probably       cooling     them,        and    so   reducing the temperature
  of the air passing        over   them.          About      11 '40    the curves    cross and
  assume their usual positions.              At    13 hrs. a     maximum occurs, and the
  effect of the clear sky overhead             and sunshine is at once seen by                 the
  standard crossing the others and giving                       the highest reading.            At
  14 hrs. we have the sky again overcast, and the lines rearrange                          them
  selves as before at a minimum point.                     At   15 hrs. another maximum
  comes in, the clouds breaking overhead                     and sun gleaming occasion
  ally, and here again        the standard rises — higher than the improved
  Stevenson,     and coinciding         with      the    old.     After    18 hrs. the clouds
  cleared away almost entirely, but as the boxes had not been heated
  during the day to any considerable extent they give readings slightly
 lower than the standard, but gradually approach                           it as the tempera
 ture falls, and ultimately cross and take up their usual positions.
     The readings of the thermoiretcr                      with    the    silvered   bulb      are
 extremely good at first, the radiation effects being all reduced                            to  a
 minimum       ; and   the   delicacy of the instrument remains almost un
 affected.      One great advantage           of this instrument is that it can                 be
 much more carefully read than those in ordinary use,                         as the radiation
 from the body of the observer                  is almost without           effect.   But     the
 silver becomes       so  much tarnished              in less than         a  week   as   to be
almost entirely ineffective,         the readings being ultimately the highest
throughout.          Very    great      care      is   necessary        in   repolishing     the
thimbles,     as they are    liable to be scratched,              which seriously impairs
their reflective powers.            It    is intended          to   try experiments with
nickel-plated      thimbles,     as    it   has     been     found      that nickel     stands
exposure    to the weather       for   a   longer time without tarnishing.
    The readings of the black bulb arrangement                       are on the whole very-
satisfactory.      They are     as   a    rule lower than those of the standard
apparatus,     sometimes     so much so that one is led to suspect that the
black bulb has too much of its surface                        covered.       At other    times
curious points occur, which are not indicated by any of the other

                            of Edinburgh,       Sestion 1884-85.                        203
 instruments,         and of which the explanation            is not obvious.       As   the
readings are somewhat              difficult to take accurately — the temperatures
being liable to change              before   both thermometers can be read, and
any error in the clean bulb is doubled by the process of reduction—
these      peculiarities      probably    arise  from errors of observation, and it
will be necessary             to  use   the instruments for a considerable time
before anything            definite    can be said.     The chief objection to the
instrument          is that the black coating of the bulb is liable to be
chipped       ;   but as the adjustment of the amount of black surface does
not appear to be            very  delicate,   this will probably be easily got over.
      The readings of wet and dry bulb hygrometers have been taken
 throughout         in the fan apparatus and in           the two Stevenson screens.
 The      dew      points,    as  calculated from these         readings by means of
 Glaisher's        Tables, present some interesting peculiarities           — but    as  yet
  sufficient material         has not been collected      to enable any very definite
  conclusions to be drawn.
       It  was to be expected that the             fan apparatus     would give results
  more nearly         approaching the truth than the others,            as the   operation
   of drawing        the air through the wooden          tube can scarcely affect the
   amount       of moisture in that passing over the bulbs, — at least when
   the air is      comparatively dry, — and the free circulation produced                 by
   the    fan     prevents the      water evaporated       from the wet bulb           from
   remaining        in its immediate vicinity, and            so   indicating    a greater
    amount of       moisture than is really present in the atmosphere.              Again,
    the passage       of a large   quantity of air through the apparatus            should
    enable us to       get  a better idea of the amount of moisture in the air
    around.
        The dew points given by the fan apparatus are                   in all  cases con
    siderably below those given by the other instruments, being in one
     case more     than 5° lower than the Stevenson.              As  a general   rule, the
    curve of     dew points for the improved            Stevenson is the highest of
     the  three,    but it is in most cases an almost exact reproduction of
     that given       by   the fan apparatus.         The    curve for the ordinary
     Stevenson       usually lies about midway          between the two — on             the
       hole  nearer to the curve for the improved Stevenson than to that
     for the     fan apparatus.        On some days this curve resembles the
     others  only in its general outline — the maxima and minima being
     greatly  rounded off, and sometimes            only hinted at.       This    effect   is
        VOL.  XI  il                                                             p

probably due to the thermometers being freely exposed underneath
— evaporation and condensation of moisture from                      the grass neutral
ising the various changes.
    It is intended to compare            the   dew points given by these screens
during the hourly observations with those given by                      a  direct hygro
 meter;    the   form to be       used       being    that   designed     by   Professor
 ChrystaL      This   consists   of   a   copper     box, nickel-plateJ,     into which
the bulb of     a  thermometer is inserted.               By   means of a double-tap
arrangement communication                can    be kept up        with two reservoirs,
one of which       is filled with warm water, and the other                  with water
surrounded with ice or         a  mixture of snow and salt.               The tempera
ture of the water flowing            through       the   box can thus be adjusted
until   a  film of moisture has just begun to form on the plated
surface, and the reading of the              thermometer at once gives the dew
point.     With this instrument results differing from                   each other by
not more than 0°'3 can easily be obtained.
   A few experiments        have been         made    with this instrument, but        in
circumstances under which the dew points given by the wet and dry
bulb hygrometers approached each other more closely than usual,
although still maintaining          their usual order.           The results are some
what different from what was expected,                  but are perfectly consistent
throughout.       The direct hygrometer invariably                  gives the highest
dew    point, being always         a    little   above    the    improved Stevenson.
The mean of fifteen observations shows the dew points given by the
improved Stevenson to be about 0°'7 lower than the direct hygro
meter — those by the ordinary Stevenson about 1° — and those by
the fan apparatus       about l°-5.        These show a much closer agreement
throughout than        could have been expected              ;  and the fact that    the
direct hygrometer is always highest tends                      to  confirm the result
arrived at by       Mr Shaw of Cambridge, that the film of                     moisture
begins    to  deposit on the silvered surface                 before   the  actual  dew
point has been reached.

1.   Notes on the       For Tribe of Central Africa.           By Dr Robert W.
          Felkin, F.R.S.E., F.R.G.S., Fellow of the Anthropological
          Societies     of London and Berlin, &c.             (Plate IX.)
    It   may be     within the recollection of the Fellows of          the Society,
that in December 1883            I had the honour      of reading, in this room, a
paper on        the Madi Tribe of Central Africa.
     I  have now to       lay before you     a similar paper on the      For Tribe,
which, as        in the former    case,  I have   written from notes of my own
observations        when in the country, and from information supplied to
 me by people         of the tribe.    I am  able  on this occasion    to introduce
 to your      notice a For boy, who has been with me since 1880, when               I
 was     in Darfur.        The boy was rescued         from slavery by General
 Gordon        in 1878, and he entered my service at Dara in 1879.                  I
 hope     it will add to any interest you may take in my remarks to               see
 the    only representative of his tribe, who,            as  far as  I  know, has
  reached      Europe.
      The country        of   Darfur is bounded        on the     south by    9°  30'
  A. lat     ; on   the north by the 16th degree N. lat.          ; on the east by
  about the 22° 30'         E. long, j and on the west by the 28th            degree
  E    long.
       Darfur,    or Darfor, means the land of the Fors, who were once the
   owners     and sole     inhabitants    of the whole     province.    They have,
  however,       been driven back into the western        part of the country, the
   remainder of       which is now inhabited by various invaders, namely,
  the   Homr Arabs in the north, the Bertis Turkruri in the east, in the
   south-east      the   Rezigat, while in the south the Baggara            and the
  Turkruri are mingled.            There has been no intermarriage between
   the Fors      and the strangers,      and the regular features       and lighter
   colour of the latter at once proclaim their          Arab origin.
       The whole population          of Darfur may       be roughly   estimated at

 206                     Proceedings       of  the  Royal Society
 from     3 to 5   millions,     about half that number being Fors ; but it                  is
 impossible to obtain exact information                on this    point
     It  is not my intention to give any account of the                 political history
 of the country, as that may be found in                  a learned    paper   by the late
 Dr    G.   Nachtigal, entitled
                                     " Darfor, die      neue ^Egyptische       Province,"
 Petermann's Mittheiluntjcn,            1875, p. 281.        Some further information
may be obtained in            Dr Perron's        Voyage     au Darfour, which is the
translation       of    an    Arabic work         by   Mahommed          Ibn    Umar        or
Mohammed el Tunsi.                 His    notes   on   the    manners and customs of
the people are wonderfully             correct as far     as  they go.
     Darfur    was    taken    by the    Egyptians      in   1874, after the battle of
Menowatzhi, when Zebehr Pasha conquered                       and   killed king Brahim,
but the       province was not really subjugated until                    after my visit
there, for Haroun held out             in  the Marah mountains           till 1881, when
he was      killed   by the Egyptian        troops under Slatin Bey.
     The Fors are pure negroes, and are the most northerly tribe in the
eastern      part of Central Africa.          They form one of the three great
negro       Mohammedan kingdoms,               the   other two being          Wadai     and
Bornu.
     I was    unable to spare the time for making detailed measurements
of the For people.             The average        height     of twenty-five     men    was
173-0     ;   of fifteen      women,      1GS'7.     Pulse,     72; respirations,        19.
Temperature in the axilla, 97° -2 Fahr.
     The following measurements              of my boy's head are given          as better

      Physical Powers. —         I was not able to test the physical                   powers of
  the Fors, but both men            and women are strong, and can march well.
  They carry loads from 70 to 80                   lbs.    weight with         ease   for fifteen
  miles a day, but they do not like the occupation, as oxen and asses
  are, as a     rule, used   as baggage      animals.
      Their sight, hearing, and smell are very good, but the sense of
   touch is     not very acule, and their sensibility              to pain is decidedly less
   than that of Europeans.
       Reproduction. — Marriage takes              place      at    about the       age of     17.
    The women are prolific.           I saw a good number of women with seven,
    eight, and      nine children.       Twins     are common,             and more especially
    ¦welcome     if  females ; a great     feast    is held after their birth, and the
    whole    village rejoices.      I  never heard of         a case     of triplets.
       Polygamy exists.           Barrenness is common                 in the     Gebel Marah
    district,   where the men always make sure of                          a woman's fertility

208                    Proceedings         of  the    Royal Society
before     marriage.       In the other parts of the country it                   is  not so
common.          Divorce does not take place in consequence of sterility.
There are no restraints on population.                         Infanticide is unknown.
If a girl should have a child before she is married, and its father
will not marry her, he has to pay a fine of cows to the chief of the
village.       The child belongs to the mother's father, and when she sub
sequently marries it remains with him.                       If  it should   be a  daughter,
its grandfather is by no means displeased                     by the arrangement.
    Hair. — The Fors have fairly               good heads of hair, black in           colour,
and naturally         frizzled     in    character.        The men       sometimes      shave
their heads, but will never plait their hair or otherwise ornament                            it.
The women dress             theirs with        numerous small            plaits, which     are
flatly pressed down on the top of the head, and then hang loosely
as   far    as   the shoulders.         The hair is much greased with butter,
scented by various substances.                   Some      of the men have beards             of
which they are very proud                ; they do not shave them off, as they
say   it  is wrong to make           themselves        look womanish.          A  man    with
a very long beard            is very      highly     esteemed.       The men shave         the
hair     from the armpits, and from off the chest                      ;   the women      pull
out the hairs from under the arms by the roots.                            The hair on the
pubes is not removed.
    Colour. — The people are all very much of the same colour, No.
 42 and 43 of Broca's table.                 They rub their bodies            all over with
 butter or with castor oil.             Small white patches,           due to the absence
 of pigment, are occasionally met with, but are not nearly so common
 as  in    some     other tribes      ;  the natives         attribute    these   patches      to
 syphilis.       One celebrated         hunter was affected           by this malady       ;    it
 attacked      the left part     of his     forehead,      the bridge of his nose, and
 the upper part of his cheeks.                 It   injured     his power of smell, and
 he had     in   consequence      to give up his place             as chief hunter.       The
 children are of      a  slightly lighter shade of colour.
    Odour. — Their odour            is rather offensive,        although it is to    a certain
 extent masked by castor oil, or by the various scents they use                                to
 perfume their bodies          ;  still after     a  long march the smell from them
 is very noticeable.
    Motions.      — The Fors generally           sleep upon the right side,          with    the
 right arm        bent under the head               as   a  pillow.     When standing          at
 ease,    they balance      themselves       on one leg, leaning on a spear or staff,

                           of Edinburgh,             Session 1884-85.                                      209
the other foot resting upon the knee.                               They are very good riders,
and bestride        their    horses     in the usual            manner.          They walk with a
long, easy,       swinging stride          ;   the body is well balanced,                          the head
slightly thrown back, and the                        arms       are permitted to swing                   with
easy     grace.     All     their     attitudes       are       unconstrained.               They     climb
trees    very   well, swarming up them                      ;       no   ropes    or other aids are
used     in climbing.   In moving heavy                     objects,          such     as    the trunk of
a tree,    they make         use of rollers and levers,                       and push, but rarely
or never        pulL       They can move              their scalps              backwards and for
wards.      I
          never noticed them moving their ears, but found that
they bad great difficulty in opening one eye, the other being shut.
They can extend each finger separately                          ;    they point at objects with
one finger,       often the middle             one, but have                 no tricks of sleight of
hand.      Their joints            are pliable,      with the exception of their toes                         ;
in rope-making,        however, they can grasp the strands with the great
and second toes.             They occupy the squatting position when follow
ing the calls of nature.               The most common                   position for        a woman         to
 occupy    in labour is that of standing, leaning against the hut wall.
 In isolated      cases, a rope is suspended                to the roof of the hut for the
 woman      to support herself with           (see Labour).
    Clothing.     — With          the exception of a very few chiefs, who are rich
 and have come much                 in contact with the Arabs and adopted their
 costume,       all the Fors         are dressed        alike.           The     men        wear    damoor
 cloth shirts, open          at the neck, and extending to about the knee.
 They have large open sleeves, which                        they tuck up when at work.
 The women           wear a loin cloth, and also                         a    loose    sheet,      which is
 wrapped round the body and thrown over the shoulder, leaving the
 arms free.         This    is,   however, dispensed with very frequently.                                 Till
 puberty the boys and girls go naked, and then the girls wear                                        a   skirt

       Tattooing.   — The For          men      do    not tattoo.               A     good    number of
  women,     however, make             three    vertical and two horizontal                         cuts    on
  each    cheek, which            custom   has evidently                 been    introduced          by the
  Arabs.        In order to       add to their beauty, the women                       also prick their
  lips with sharp-pointed thorns, and then rub in kohl                                   to make them
  black.     Kohl    is    also used round the eyes and on the eyebrows.
        Personal Ornaments. — Some few ornaments have been introduced
  among     the upper classes in Darfur from the Arabs.                                 The     men wear

210                   Proceedings      of  the  Royal Society
no bead ornaments,        but   a plain ear-ring is inserted into the top               of
each   ear.    They also wear rings, one of which is                 a  wedding     ring   ;
unfortunately,      I  have    forgotten upon which            finger    this is   worn.
The women wear         a wooden     stick about half an inch in length,              or a
small crystal through the left nostril.              The septem of the nose           and
lips are never pierced,         but ear-rings are almost universally               worn.
They also affect numberless necklaces               and   girdles made of various
kinds of beads, and bracelets and anklets made of iron or brass,                      and
more rarely     still of silver.     At festivals many of             the  women also
wear tinkling bangles        and small bells around their wrists, waists,
and ankles, to please their lovers.              Many women adorn their fore
heads   with    three   or four thin,       round gold plates,          having various
patterns, and fastened        to a band.        Filigree    ear-rings are also made
of silver or gold,       modelled after Arab patterns.                 Both men and
women     wear amulets and love          tokens, which are suspended               round
the women's      necks and fastened round the upper arm of the men.
No ornaments       are employed as badges of distinctive rank, nor have
they tribal marks, save those worn in war (which see). The Fors
never deform themselves, nor do they extract the incisor teeth,
which is an almost universal custom among the tribes living farther
south.
    Customs. — The usual mode of salutation                is by shaking of hands.
 To this is added kneeling on one knee,               if the persons have not met
 for a long time.       Women always kneel to men, and, rarely,                   a   man
 kneels to   a woman      if she is a relation         and they have not met for
 many weeks.         Women always kneel to their husbands, except in
 private.     Kissing   is confined to mothers and their babies.                   When
 people pass one another         in  the streets they say         " Kilonya."       Mem
 bers of a family       meeting each other in the morning say
                                                                                 " Konas
 kav kor," which is analogous             to   " I   hope    you have       slept well."
 "When    friends or relations have been absent a long time, or been in
 any danger, and meet for the first time, they kneel down on both
 knees, put their arms round           each other's shoulders, and then shake
 hands.
    Rules of precedence         in serving food are          as   follows   : — Puggees,
 aged men, chiefs, younger men, youths.
    Women       aro   evidently     considered inferior         to men,     whom they
 must respect and obey in all things.               The aged women, however,            as

                             of Edinburgh, Session 1884-85.                         211
¦well    as men,        are treated   with  great  respect    and care; when begin
ning to bend with              age they are not permitted to work in the fields
any more, but            are supported by their children.
      The Fors are not particularly hospitable, and they are very sus
 picious of strangers. Should any appear in the village, they are
 closely questioned as to whence they come and what their business
 is ; and if their answers are not satisfactory they are at once taken
 to the chief.
       Both boys and girls are circumcised shortly before arriving at
  puberty.        A feast is held on such occasions at which all the village
  takes part.         If   the children bear the operation bravely, they receive
  presents from their father.
       The following        is a rough description of the Fors' daily     life: — They
   rise at dawn, and after washing, the man                prays and then goes into
   the fields to work.           The woman does household work and prepares
   the breakfast.           When breakfast      is over,    the man    returns to the
    fields, where he is soon         followed   by his wife, and they both work
   together till midday.           Then the man rests while the woman prepares
    the dinner.        After dinner,     the man    sits down and spins cotton, or
    makes mats or basketwork.              When the woman has washed            up, put
    the fire out, and fetched water, she joins her husband at his work, or
    else they severally go and         join working     groups,  until the cool of the
    day, when they go again to their gardens and fields, and work                  until
    the sun has set.           They never work in the huts, but in cool sheds
    provided for the purpose.            No work    takes   place after supper,   a few
    hours being then given to social intercourse, or occasionally                     to
    dancing.     The very rich women and chiefs' wives spend                  most    of
    the mornings       in perfuming     themselves,   or bathing and dressing their
    hair.    In  the afternoons,        they also spin and make light mats of
    grass,  but all women, to whatever class they may belong, always do
    the  cooking.
        Huts. — Some of the huts in Darfur are the ordinary                   beehive
    grass  huts, but by far the greater number are made with stone and
    mud walls     ;  they are circular, and very large.            The people    build
    about two feet each         day, and then leave the work to dry till the
     next day ; they never build           higher than they can reach, and no
    scaffolding    is used.       The roof is supported by five poles,          one of
     them  being in the centre, with cross bars placed on the top to which

212                              Proceedings                 of      the    Royal Society
circular           bundles            of supple sticks have been fastened.                                     The roofs
are conical, and overhang the walls about three feet;                                                   the    thatching
is very neatly done,                        The entrance is small, and is made still smaller
by   a stone            which         is placed          in it         on the ground.                  The door           is of
wicker-work,                 made to slide backwards and forwards, and                                              fastened
behind             by    a    bar and             pins   ;       a    handle        is placed          in    the     middle
of      it,   both           inside         and     out,         to    move        it    with.         There        are       two
fireplaces         — one chiefly for cooking,                                made        with    three       stones       ;   the
other for the people                        to sit round,              especially in the cold season, as
the mornings are very chilly.                                    There are no chimneys or windows.
The young men in the village have one hut in common for sleeping,
into which they are banished                                         at puberty.           Outside          the hut           are
cooking             places,      store-houses,               and cow               seribas,      all    of which              are
enclosed           by    a    fence, and beyond                      it    extend the gardens.
     Food. — Although the staple                                 food of the Fors                is    dhurra,      it    must
not be supposed that this                           is    the only item in their                       bill of fare, for
their larder             is   well stocked with fish, flesh, fowl, insects, vegetables,
and fruit.               Fish     is    very abundant in the lakes and the rivers                                             of
western           Darfur.             There are many different kinds, all of which are
freely eaten by the natives                              with the exception of the eels, which
it   appears             are     only consumed                        by the       blacksmiths              (see    below).
Cows, sheep, goats, gazelles, hares                                        (rare), rabbits,       wild       dogs (eaten
by      wandering               beggars),           buffaloes,               various       antelopes,          elephants,
rhinoceros, rats, and wild boars, form                                       a    plentiful      and    varied supply
of animal food.
     Fowls          are reared              in large         numbers, and pigeons,                          guinea-fowl,
parrots, storks, wild ducks, owls (eaten only by beggars in great
want), and various small birds, are found in abundance. Ostriches
are eaten sometimes,                    but only when other food                          is    very scarce, as their
flesh     is       supposed            to    induce          a       disease,      the    principal         symptom of
which         is   a    very red and repulsive face.                              Locusts, water beetles, and
grubs         from           trees,     are       considered                luxuries,      and         form        favourite
entrees.            The vegetables                 are tomatoes,                  bananas,       cucumbers,           water
melons (used also for washing and drinking purposes when water                                                                is
scarce), various marrows,  and onions. The fruits are not very
varied        ;    dates,      bananas,           lemons,             and     a    kind of cherry from which
wine      is      made, are cultivated;                      and       sugar-cane grows in great abund
ance in the west.                      Wheat        is   grown to             a   limited extent in the Gebel

                       of Edinburgh,         Session 1884-85.                             213
 Marah district,       but,     curiously      enough,      it is    never       eaten,    but
exported as an       article of barter.        Rice is also sparely grown in some
parts of the     country.
     Dhurra and rice are ground, and then made into bread, as also a
root which is      considered poisonous until well boiled.                      In   order to
keep the bread,       which is in the form of pancakes, it                   is broken up
into small pieces,         dried for      a   day or two in the sun, and then
preserved      in leathern      sacks.      Milk    is much used        as   an article Tof
diet; it is obtained           from cows,        sheep,   goats,    and camels.          Very
good butter,        cheese, and curds are made.                 The butter is chiefly
used    for anointing the body and as pomade ; for this purpose it is
 mixed with dried odoriferous plants.                  The flesh of goats and sheep
is considered to be the best meat, and that of young kids the most
 strengthening.        As     a great    luxury,     a  fat she-camel       is sometimes
 killed   ;  this, however,        can only be indulged in by rich chiefs.
 Meat is not much used in hot weather, fowls being preferred then,
 and     they are     also considered         the    best   food for invalids.           Rice
 boiled for a      long time in new          cow's     milk   is one of the         best  and
 most expensive        dishes.      Cow's liver, raw, with Cayenne pepper, is
  eaten by     rich people and        by invalids.        The brains of all animals
  are   thought     a great    delicacy   ; marrow is also        a  tit-bit   ;  the   bones
  are   cracked, and it is taken out with              a  chop-stick or knife.            The
  blood     of bullocks and of fatted          he-goats     is eaten    after being well
   boiled, strongly     flavoured with Cayenne pepper.
      The poor buy meat at open-air sales                  ; the   rich   kill their own
   cattle, and after    drying    the meat      in the sun, store it away in huts.
   These     are  built like     the   dwelling huts, and          are   surrounded         by
   thorn    hedges ; there are separate            store-houses    for meat and corn.
   The granaries are constructed as            follows : — A circular framework              is
   made     of poles,    and this is tilled up by bundles of dried grass,
   bound securely to       it by  rope made of fibre.           The roof is formed of
   thatch, shaped at the top        like  a pinnacle.       A deep hole is dug inside
   the   hut, and it is lined with mats or hides, and then                       filled with
   grain.     The    meat   store-houses     are narrower, higher, and stronger                ;
   the   door is made of very strong wickerwork,                and halfway down the
   roof a wicker-lattice       provides for ventilation.            Inside the hut are
    shelves made     of sticks   on which to support the small pieces of meat;
    the   larger pieces are suspended              from     poles   fixed     in    the  roof.

214                        Proceedings               of   the       Royal Society
People of small means, who have                                     less corn to stow away,                               build
miniature granaries             within their dwelling huts                                 ;    they are supported
by stones, and the top is movable.
     In    times    of scarcity the people resort to wild fruits, roots,                                             and
leaves     ;   at all times the poor live chiefly on dhurra                                           and    wild fruits.
When hard work               has to be undertaken, mutton,                                        dhurra, porridge
and       milk    are preferred, as they are considered                                          to form the               most
strengthening diet.                  Oil       is only used                     for frying            purposes.             The
chief spice is Cayenne pepper                        ;   it   is taken with                     almost everything,
and       even      the   poorest          person         contrives                   to   cultivate         the          plant.
Various          other spices have              been          introduced                   into the         country          by
Arabs.           Onions are much relished, and                                    largely cultivated.                       The
best       salt is obtained from                 a       salt lake               near          Gebel Marah            ;    it is
exceedingly expensive, and is used                             as money.                       The salt eaten by the
poor is procured either from burnt grass or from salt beds.                                                                 No
sugar is used, but sugar-cane                    is largely chewed,                             and    the people           are
very fond of it.            Honey too, of which                             a   large quantity is obtainable,
is much relished.               Earth is never eaten.
     Fire. — Fire         is obtained           whenever it is required by friction,                                            a
round, soft, pencil-shaped piece of wood being rotated by the hands
in   a    small hole cut in          a flat piece             of hard wood.                      I am       not aware of
any superstitions connected with the kindling of fire.
     Cooking.      — Cooking          is performed as a rule by the women;                                                 even
the richest women prepare their husband's                                         food.          The food for both
men and women is cooked                        together         ;   there are no professional cooks.
Culinary operations are carried on either in the dwelling                                                     hut or in
small huts erected for the purpose                                  by the wealthy.                         Meat is pre
ferred well cooked              ;    it is roasted,             boiled, stewed, and fried.                                 It   is
preserved          by drying in the sun or cured by smoke.                                             This   preserved
meat is either eaten as               it   is or soaked before cooking.                                 Meat is never
salted.          Roasting is managed                     as   follows :— Two forked sticks                                  are
placed on either side of                   a   bright fire          ;       another is laid across them,
from which the meat is suspended.                                       In order                to stew or boil             the
meat, flat stones are placed round the fire                                           in groups of three, upon
which large earthen                  jars are            placed         ;       for    frying,         shallow round
pans are used.             No       pots are hung over the fire.                                Sometimes         a       whole
or half        a sheep is       roasted         at a time           ; a         spit is put through                   it,   and
it   is   turned occasionally.                  Meat and bread                         are never         baked in the

                            of Edinburgh,         Session 1884-85.                            215
ground,        but vegetables       are prepared        for  use as follows      : — A hole     is
dug in the ground,              and  sometimes       lined with flat stone3           ; in this  a
fire is    lit, and is subsequently            removed to be replaced by the veget
ables, which are wrapt in large leaves                      (Dameregy)      ;  they are then
covered        with earth and remain until               cooked.       These ovens are not
permanent          structures,     but after being used they are tilled up, new
ones      being constructed           as    occasion    requires.       Hot   stones      are not
used in boiling.              Bread   is baked on large flat stones, supported over
the fire.        Vegetables       are generally boiled         in  the same      pot with the
meat.         Butter is used for frying.              Dripping      is collected, and        after
being scented          with various herbs          is used as pomade          and for anoint
ing the body.             In   the huts there is sometimes           a  permanent fireplace,
 enclosed on three sides by large flat stones and on the                            fourth by a
 lower one.
      Cooking        vessels     are made       of earthenware, the only exception
  being the       iron pots which are used when travelling.                         Most of    the
  vessels      are round with flat bottoms, and without necks ; they                           are
  always       well washed after use and scrubbed with sand.                       Knives, and
   sticks bent at one end, are the only cooking utensils employed.
        Corn is ground between two stones, mixed with water and baked
   in thin cakes, but the more                usual plan of preparing it is to boil it
   into a      thick porridge ; it        is served     in  a large pot,      with      meat   and
   gravy      round it.       No yeast     is employed.
        If animals have         been shot by a poisoned arrow, the                 flesh around
    the wound        is cut out    as   soon    as  possible,   and the entrails of such
    animals are thrown away.                No pickles     are made, and the only fruits
    preserved       are   the kuma and cogna, small fruits about the size of
     grapes;     they are simply dried in the sun.                They are either eaten in
     this condition, or soaked in water and softened,                   the water being also
     drunk.
         Outside      each village     there is a public yard,         in which all rubbish
     is deposited ;      it  is subsequently used as manure.
         Drinks. — No spirits are manufactured.                  Water and milk are used
     freely.      Beer is made from dhurra, and wine from kuma.                          The beer
     is  brewed as follows:        —  The dhurra is placed in a hole in the ground
     until    it begins to sprout ; it is then            spread   out in the sun to dry.
     then    cleared of earth by shaking in               a round sieve       made of plaited
     grass,   and afterwards ground between two stones, mixed with ordin

ary flour, and put into large jars, which are then filled up with water.
After being well stirred, dry flour is                                scattered         upon the top of the
water, and the pots are covered                         with      a   lid    made of basket-work.                      In
a   few days it begins to ferment                       ;    more water is then added, and                           it is
well stirred and again left for several days.                                       A little          more water        is
then poured on               it,   and   it   is   strained through               a    sieve made of damoor
cloth.    It            ready for use the next day, and will keep for                                            week;

the longer              is   kept the more intoxicating                       it    is,   and after        a    week    it
becomes       sour and unfit for use                        ;    it   is     kept in jars              in the huts.
Each family brews for itself, but widows sometimes                                                make     it   in   large
quantities and retail it.                     The utensils employed in the manufacture
of beer are earthenware pots of various sizes, sieves made of plaited
grass and others of damoor                         cloth, and sticks bent at one end, which
are employed for stirring.
     The wine       is   made as follows               :    — The fruit           is   either dried first for
the best wine, which                  is   intended to keep                   a   long time, or            it   is   used
quite fresh.            It   is    then well boiled, strained through damoor sieves,
placed   in small jars with tight-fitting                              lids, and put in                a   dark cool
hut.     It   is   ready for use after                 a     few days, and             is     very intoxicating.
Kogna     fruit         is   sometimes         soaked           in water for              a   day or two, after

  Meals. — As general rule, three meals are partaken of in the day —
                         a
breakfast, two hours after sunrise                           ;    dinner, an hour or so after the
sun has reached                   its zenith       ;   and supper,                two hours after sunset.
Breakfast and dinner are partaken of separately                                           at home, but supper
is   eaten in   a       public yard, where                   the      men         and boys over 14 meet
together for the purpose.                          A    large        fire    is   made        in the yard soon
after sunset, and social intercourse                            is    enjoyed by its light until the
supper   is   brought by the                  women.              The latter and the children eat
at home,        often outside their huts together with their neighbours.
Each person provides his own food for the public supper, and those
who are not possessed of means for the provision of                                               a   good one must
eat at home.
     Breakfast consists of stiff porridge with milk,                                     little salt being
                                                                                              a
sprinkled over it.                 All   help themselves                    with their fingers out of the
same dish.
     For dinner they take either porridge or bread                                             cakes       broken up
into small pieces, with chopped or minced meat and gravy round                                                          it

Water is drunk at dinner out of                     a  gourd, all drinking out of the
same, and          holding it between their wrists or            between   the left hand
and the         right wrist.       It  is a very general     custom for the right hand
alone to be used             in eating     ;  this practice was introduced by Arab
fakirs hundreds of years ago.
      Supper,       like breakfast, consists of porridge and milk ; roasted
meat,       stews, and vegetables are added to create variety.                   Water is
almost         invariably      drunk       with food    ; beer   and   wine    are   drunk
between meals,            the only exception being          at great feasts, when they
are     immoderately         consumed.
      Feasts      take place      at births, weddings, and at the great             yearly
religious festival.            At   funerals there is a solemn meal, when laughter
and       jokes are unheard.            A   description of these will be given later
 on.
       On occasions of rejoicing a man will call his friends together to
 drink       with him.         Friends      are well   looked after at meals, tit-bits
 often being presented               to them.      Meat is sometimes      ready cut into
 small pieces before being placed on the                 dish;   sometimes,   however,    it
 is served         in joints   ;  occasionally also      a sheep is servod    entire.    In
  this case one         of the party, generally       a young man, carves for every
  body; otherwise each person helps himself.                    The older people always
  take food        out of the dish first, for though visitors are requested to
  begin, they          would     be considered very rude          if they did    so before
   older     persons than themselves           ; the  same custom      applies to drink
   ing.       Food is always taken with the fingers, and it is considered
    very    unbecoming for all the fingers             to be put into the    mouth; the
   first and second and thumb are used.                 Young    people are not supposed
    to talk    before their elders unless they are spoken to; and if anything
    is    needed      at   a repast,     they are     expected     to  make    themselves
    generally       useful.    When       no   youths are     present,  the   women      are
    called    to fetch or take anything away, but they are required to crawl
     on   their knees when the men are engaged in eating.                   It  is thought
     the   height of impropriety           for a woman      to convey anything        to her
     mouth       when in the presence           of her husband or of any grown-up
     man.
         The    Fors    are considered by surrounding             tribes to be very ob
    jectionable       in their eating,    as  they like their food so "high."          There
     are no   traditions     that cannibalism has ever prevailed in this country,

218                       Proceedings           of the Royal Society
and the Fors speak with the greatest contempt of the Niams-Niams
on account of their cannibal propensities.
     Tobacco is not smoked,                   but chewed and snuffed, and no other
narcotics are used.              The tobacco            is indigenous,     and very strong.
It   is carried about in small bundles, the leaves having been first
dried and broken up small and mixed with fine wood-ashes,                                   and it
is rolled up        in palm      leaves.         After    a plug has been        chewed         it is
stuck behind the ear             till next wanted.           Various roots and barks are
chewed for medicinal purposes.                      Some of the Fors         who have come
into intimate connection with the Arabs have learnt to smoke, but
they are looked down upon by their compatriots.
     Religion,      Fetishes,    <kc.   — It is     a   very difficult    matter,    if not im
possible, to give any account of the original                        religion of the Fors.
Mohammedanism has been professed by them for hundreds of years                                         ;
at the same time it is tempered by their original beliefs, and a great
many of its tenets are totally ignored.                       For   instance,       they are so
much addicted to drink that the decrees of Islam on this point remain
altogether unregarded,             although several           of their kings have made
great efforts to put down this vice.
     In the following remarks about their religious beliefs it will be
perfectly possible for the intelligent                    reader    to recognise      which of
them have          been   assimilated from the teachings of Mohammedan
fakirs.
   " Kilma " is what seems to correspond to our idea of " souL" It is
called " the power of the liver," for, believing that the liver is the
seat of the soul, it is considered that an increase of a man's own                              soul
may be obtained by partaking of an animal's liver.                              Whenever         an
animal is killed its liver is taken out and eaten, but the people are
most      careful not to touch it with their hands, as it is considered
sacred; it is cut up in small pieces and eaten raw, the bits being
conveyed to the mouth on the point of                         a   knife or the sharp point
of   a   stick.     Any   one who may accidentally touch the                  liver   is   strictly
forbidden to partake of                 it,   which prohibition      is   regarded as      a   great
misfortune         to him.       Women are not allowed to eat liver,                       and are
believed not to possess           a     " kilma."
     When     a    man    dies   his kilma         is   supposed to go        to Accra, and
there he      is   told whether he has been good enough to go to Mola.
Molu     is   the ancient native name               for God.        The name of        Allah      is

used    now by many            of    the people     for God, but they have             a very
confused       idea as to         the difference between          God (Allah) and the
Shereef at Mecca.              Some few of them go on pilgrimages to Mecca,
and they say that           this Allah       is a very fat man, who lies on a white
mat   and never does anything,                 but receives    those who come to him,
and lets them         kiss his hand.           When   a man starts on       this pilgrimage
he takes      with him a small drum called Beedi, which he beats in all
the    villages he passes through.                 It has a very low, solemn sound,
and is a signal to         the villagers that he is going to see Allah, and that
they may       join him if they like. Perhaps a party of five or six is
made     up altogether,           and the rest of the people are satisfied                with
crying     out,
                  " Aga be        nasaba bani, zidzi domabani ye ka duo deba,
dinzidisi dongab           ani dinesidingtong suma karaky,"                the meaning of
 which     is  somewhat as follows : — " You are going                    to our master's
 house,    give him my hand, and tell him that                   I  am so weak and that
 his house      is   so   far that       I cannot go."     The district of Khartoum,
 through which           they must         pass to get to Arabia, is called Urebiah,
 and    Arabia      itself Baribaru,          or  " the country beyond           the   water."
  When the        pilgrims       come      back they are called Arch-barr,            and are
 considered       very holy       ;   they never have their heads shaved, and are
 supposed never            to do wrong.          Their title    must    not be confused
  with Arch-barch,           a  term of honour sometimes             bestowed      on people
  in acknowledgment             of bravery.
     The dead are supposed                only to stay in Accra about          a day,   when,
  if they have been good,              they go to Molu, who lives in Jouel,
                                                                                         " the
  sky," and are very happy there.                  If they have been wicked, they go
  to  Uddu, the place of punishment, where they meet with all sorts
   of disagreeable        things, and are finally         burnt up.       The people       are
   very   fond    of singing         a  song   which speaks       of the     fire in    Uddu,
   rejoicing greatly because            it has plenty of work to do          in burning up
   wicked people.           The oldest tradition, and one            which is still firmly
   believed    in the extreme           west of Darfur,     is that after death         a man
   remains    in the grave          for two or three days          ; he  then passes in       a
    mysterious    manner to a new country, where he becomes young again
    and  marries.       Women, however, are supposed to have no life beyond
    this one.
       The ghosts      of departed spirits are called         " Malal" ; they     are said to
    appear   to their friends         most frequently      during the first few nights
       VOL.   XIII.                                                                  Q

after their decease, and to be clad from head to foot in white                damoor
cloth (this material forms their shroud), and they appear much
taller than when in life.        They are supposed         to visit houses     during
the night, and to alter the position of different articles of             furniture.
Should any one be unable to find some article in the morning,                    they
commonly say,
                  " So  and So's spirit paid us      a visit last night," and thus
account for its temporary disappearance.             The ghosts are thought to
hide, but not to steal things.
    Great fear is felt of going into or near burial-places on dark nights,
as  the apparition of ghosts is dreaded.          They think that      if the grave
has not been     firmly built, and any air finds its way in, there                will
also be room for the spirit to find its way out.             This spirit, however,
is not the  " kilma " which      has gone to Accra, and which possesses            no
power of return.
    The Fors have priests or fakirs, who go by the name of puggees.
They are in no sense hereditary, and there is no ceremonial induction
into their office.    Any   one may become         a puggee     if he chooses,    but
he must first be educated        by a priest,  in reading and writing, in the
Koran, and in the For law         ; for the Fors have        a written law, which
differs considerably from that found            in the      Koran.     The date at
which it was reduced to writing          I was unable to ascertain,          but it is
certainly more than 300 years            old.    Some     parents   set apart their
sons to be priests,    and  send    them to be educated while still very
young.     The puggees are the teachers of all who wish to learn, but
the instruction     they give is very meagre       ;   only a little reading and
writing are taught, and      a  few prayers from the Koran.            The schools
are held in the evening after the work of the                day is over, and are
conducted by firelight.        The puggees      have a great deal of influence
over the sultan and      chiefs, who consult them much, and generally
follow   their   advice.    They     take   precedence       over  the   chiefs, and
nobody is allowed to eat with the sultan but the priests.                 Chiefs are
sometimes    priests too.    There are three ranks of priests          ;  they wear
little white caps, the embroidery of which               tells their status.       Al
 though each puggee is under no practical obligation to obey those of
higher rank, still they do defer to their opinions, and are ready and
willing  to receive instruction      from them.        The difference      in rank is
 caused by age and experience        ;  those   men too who have been a pil
grimage to Mecca       are naturally more       respected,     and hold      a higher

rank than their fellows.                     The puggees             appear to be sincere in their
beliefs       ;   they do not practise austerities or live secluded lives.                                 They
may        marry, and have as many wives as they please.                                     They do not       as
a   rule do manual               work themselves, their time being chiefly                             occupied
in teaching,             writing amulettes or charms, in attending the councils
of the chiefs,                 and   officiating     at    the various              religious ceremonies.
They do not pray so continuously                            as their          Arab        compeers,      nor do
they spend so         much time in telling their                            beads.          They advise the
chiefs       in points of law, and act themselves                            as     judges, most matters
being       submitted to them for decision, but in cases where the penalty
of death or              mutilation        is passed,       the chief's consent is                    necessary
before        the    sentence            can be      carried out.            The puggee's wives and
daughters are the                only women who            are taught a smattering of reading                       ;
even these           women           do not pray, but it is said                     that they will go to
Jouel        if   they lead exemplary lives.
      There appears              to be no idolatry in Darfur, and the various powers
of nature are                 not associated in any manner with various gods.                                The
Fors used to believe                   that they alone worshipped                     a    God at all, and
this idea           still lingers, especially in the west and among the very
 ignorant            The one God Molu, who lives in the sky, is believed in
and        worshipped.               He    is regarded         as    the Creator of men, and                   as
    Supreme         Ruler of         the world.           Prosperity and adversity alike are
believed          to be the result           of his ordaining; and when evil                        happens or
    death occurs              the people console themselves                 and each other by saying
    that    they could            not help    it,   and    that Molu              willed     it.     The wind
    is   thought         to be Molu's        breath,      and   it    is   considered        very wrong to
    swear at       it,   even though       it   should unroof their huts or damage their
    corn fields.              The thunder     is    supposed         to be Molu speaking to some
    one,    and     is    feared in consequence.                    They attach considerable im
    portance        to        the rainbow, believing that Molu causes                          it    to ascend
    from the        water to the sky in order to prevent men thinking that
    there    is   no God, and to warn them that                      if    they do not behave them
    selves    they       will    be burnt up in        Uddu with             fire    like    the red of the
    rainbow.             It    seems to be rather          a   difficult       thing to get to Jouel,
     otherwise      heaven       ;   most of the people seem rather to expect to go to
     the other      place, and       if   they do    so they    will       never leave      it     until the fire
     ends    their existence         ;    the length of time that this occupies depends
     upon the       life they have led on earth.                    They believe that the puggees

 222                        Proceedings              of   the   Royal Society
and their sons will certainly go to Jouel, and their wives and daughters
also appear to have a pretty good chance, as also the Medchera,                                                  who
 are the puggees'           pupils.         In   fact, all learned men are considered                           more
likely      to be rewarded in the                    next world           than the ignorant.                     If       a
man has accidentally                  killed     a   puggee, he is supposed                     to   inherit the
priest's       spirit, and will therefore go to Jouel.                          If   a    man is       killed in
battle,       or if killed or murdered                by    a   For, he    will   go to         Jouel, and be
provided         with       a    white      horse.         If    any one murders                 a    man,        the
murderer inherits his spirit, and has to bear the consequences                                              of the
murdered         man's actions in the                  next world.             This       is,   however, not
the     case    if   one    man       kills another accidentally.                        The priests and
those who have been taught by them are influenced by                                             a   strong de
sire to be received              by Molu when they die, and are greatly afraid of
the punishments meted out in Uddu.                 The unlearned people do not
think       much about an after life, and are far more                               influenced by the
fear of having their hands cut off                         if   they steal, or their lip?               if      they
are guilty of falsehood.                   There are still        a   few stone huts in existence,
which were devoted to the worship of Molu before Mohammedanism
was introduced, and the people                        still     reverence      them.            Drunkenness
is   not considered to be              a   sin, nor        is   want of hospitality to strangers
or unkindness to human beings                             thought     a   mortal sin,           if
                                                                                                 I     may use
the expression         ;   but ill-treatment of tame animals                         is   said to be very
wicked, as they have to suffer                       without being able to defend them
selves      or to retaliate.           Animals, however, are not believed to have
souls   ;   when they die there                is    an end of them.
     Animals      are not held sacred, but there                          is   one sacred            bird   ;   this
bird     is    often    seen      sitting        on       the    trees     near water.                When           a
puggee notices             one   of   them       in this position,          he calls out to            it       " Te
bate salewate" (1), at which the bird dives into the water, returns to
its perch, and shakes                 the    water from its wings.                        The priest runs
underneath, in the hope of this water dropping upon him, as                                                     it   is
supposed        to contain the spirit of Molu.
     The Fors have another very strong belief, which                                       has        been       un
affected by the            Mohammedan religion, that                       a    great      spirit lives          on
the summit of Gebel Marah.                           They do not worship him, but they
believe he has an innumerable army of spirit                                   servants,         zittan,        who
possess extraordinary powers.                         A    limited       number of magicians                     are
supposed to stand in intimate relation to this great mountain spirit,

                          of Edinburgh,        Session 1884-85.                          223
 and requests made          to them are conveyed to him, and granted,                if they
 be accompanied         by a sufficiently large present to the magician.                 The
spirits are supposed          to reside in    large trees    ;   they protect cattle from
robbers     ; and it is a curious fact that, with an exception mentioned
later on, no       For would dream of stealing another                man's cattle, as he
thinks he would           be at once seized         upon by the zittan, become in
sensible, and so        remain until      the owner of the cattle arrived on the
scene.      Any one can enlist           the services     of a zittan to protect his
house,     and more especially his milk-pots, and epilepsy in girls is said
to be caused        by them.        The girls are supposed           to have     interfered
with the      milk-pots, or      stolen the milk, in the absence of their mother.
       same disease        is believed     to attack them as a result of miscon
duct under a tree           inhabited by a zittan (see Epilepsy).               The brides
aLo have         a  wholesome dread of these trees, for if they pass under
them     without wearing          an amulet they       will  be sterile.
     The old custom of praying to Molu has become almost obsolete,
 and has been         replaced     to some extent by a few prayers                 from the
 Koran learnt from the puggees.                The practice of regular prayer, how
 ever, is   now limited to the educated              classes, and the poor people do
  not pray at      alL     In  the enclosures     of the rich there is a small place
 surrounded        by stones, and carpeted with sand, set apart for prayer.
  The father       prays    at  one   time,   the   sons    at another.       The regular
  prayer hours       of Islam     are unobserved,        and bead-telling is only in
  vogue among         the puggees, the chiefs, and         a   few of the rich people.
      W arriors     returning from war are not allowed to enter their village
  until they have seen a puggee, and he has offered a prayer.
      No idea appears to prevail of                the   existence of an evil spirit
   tempting people to do wrong.
      There     is   a   very ancient belief         prevalent that some           men    are
   possessed    of the power of transforming themselves into wild beasts,
         lions, jackals, hyenas, and that when in this condition they are
   able to     traverse immense         distances     in  a     remarkably     short time.
   They have       also the power of divination,          can restore lost cattle,       tell
    fortunes,   and     perform     various other miraculous            feats.    They are
          versed in the medicinal properties of various roots,                      and the
    knowledge      of these is committed to writing.                One or two of these
    manuscripts      which    I saw   were very old, but           I was unable even to
    procure a    copy of any one of them.             All  these     powers are believed

224                    Proceed ings      of the  Royal Society
to be bestowed        by the great mountain         spirit, and they are not here
ditary.
    On the death of one of these men there                 is always a very        lively
competition for his manuscripts, the proceeds of which are handed
over to his youngest son.            These men       are not bound          together by
any common         interest, but are all deadly rivals, and use every means
in their power to damage the repute of their opponents.
    Social Relations, including Education             of Children,     <J"c.
                                                                             — Children
are brought       up very strictly.        Disobedience is not permitted, and
is very rarely seen.         They are punished either by whipping                  or by
being tied up without food or water for a given time.                          They    are
compelled to be very polite            ;  they may not sit in the presence              of
their parents, nor may they speak when their elders are conversing,
nor play about the hut.             If   they wish to amuse themselves, they
must go to the village yard.              They are just     as   respectful and well-
behaved to women as to men, also to strangers.
    As  soon    as   they are old enough they are taught to make them
selves    useful — first, they must help their mother about                   the house
and    garden,     and   fetch water.       They    are   then taught to spin, to
dance, and to fight.          A little later they    are employed in tending the
cattle and     in helping their        parents   in the fields.       There does not
seem to be much systematic instruction given                   them in any      of  these
things, but they are obliged nevertheless              to perform their duties          in
a  satisfactory manner.
     With the exception of        the schools     for boys who are set apart fur
a   higher education, the children             do   not receive      much schooling.
The puggees         hold classes for an hour or two after supper, by the
light of   large fires, and in these the boys are taught a smattering of
w  riting and reading,      and    to repeat    various portions of the Koran.
Those who are going to be educated                for priests     live in a puggee's
 village,   where      only     puggees     and    their    pupils     reside.     There
                                                                                           *
are sometimes         200   or 300 of the latter, and no females                are per-
mitted there.
     Treatment     of  Women.    — Notwithstanding that          the women associate
with the men constantly in all their daily pursuits, they are by no
means     considered their equals,          and are obliged to pay very great
respect    and absolute        obedience     to their    husbands.       They are not
supposed     to possess souls, and do not receive any education.                   Great

                          of Edinburgh,         Session 1884-85.                               225
 consideration         is shown towards women when                    they are old, as well
 as towards aged          men.      Widows have           a large    amount of sympathy
shown them,          their female friends going daily to lament with them
after the death          of their husbands.            If good-looking, however, they
usually      marry again        in a month or two's time. When women die
they are      buried without prayers.                On the whole, the women make
fairly good         mothers,      but indifferent        wives   ; one     cannot,     however,
say that the men            make much better husbands.
    Festivals. — The          oldest festival which the Fors possess appears to
be    that of      "sowing the seed." In the days when                         the    sultan of
Darfur lived          in great pomp, it was carried out on                      a    very    large
scale,   and even now it still obtains and is observed by                       the chiefs of
all the     For districts.         It is a kind     of consecration ceremony, and is
performed         now    in the following         manner : — As soon as the ground
is ready to        receive the seed,      a day is set apart        for the ceremony,          and
 messages       are sent       by the     chiefs    to all    the    surrounding        villages,
 inviting the presence of the people                    to   take    part in it.       They all
 assemble       by midday,        when beer is partaken of under the shade of
  trees.     A small      company of virgins, the most beautiful that can be
  found, are each provided               with an ornamental wickerwork                     basket
  containing seed; these baskets are covered with fresh green leaves,
  and sometimes             decorated      with     flowers.      A     procession      is    then
  formed ; the         virgins, carrying the baskets           on their heads, lead the
   way ;   next come the musicians, and after them                    a  group of unmarried
  young men and women dancing                   ;  then the chief, decked out in his
   best,   generally       riding    on   a   horse,    and accompanied              by    a   few
   puggees     (this only in recent times) and magicians.                    He is followed
   by the    heads of the villages, and afterwards by the villagers them
   selves,    and    the rear of the cavalcade              is formed by the women,
   carrying      on    their   heads    large     pots   of beer       and all      manner of
   provisions.         They     proceed     some     distance,     and halt       in   a    forest
   glade,    in which        a small     piece    of ground       has     been    cleared      and
   prepared      for sowing.        Here halt       is made,      a prayer is        offered     to
   Molu asking him to take care of the seed, and to supply them with
   plenty   of rain, in order that they may have an abundant harvest.
   Each    of the virgins then makes a hole in the ground and plants one
   seed.     Then the chief plants a Beed, after which all the people
   follow   suit in order of their respective ranks, the virgins having first

226                     Proceedings     of the Royal     Society
handed     round their baskets, from which each person takes a seed.
As   soon as this ceremony         is over the whole company separates              into
two parties, the men on the one side, the women on the                       other, of
the glade.        The people belonging to different villages group them
selves    together,      the  food is set out, and the midday meal                takes
place.     The afternoon is spent           in   singing    and    dancing,    and     at
sunset they return to the chief's village, where large fires are               lit, and
a  convivial evening closes the day.
    The     next     in    importance of       the   For festivals is the great
Mohammedan feast of Bairam, which lasts                    for eight or ten days.
A    large   level piece of ground is enclosed             by stones and strewed
with    sand.      Within this     enclosure   the male     portion of the popula
tion meet after breakfast,          prayers   are said   for an hour or an hour
and a half, and         sometimes    a  short exhortation is delivered by one
of the elder puggees.            The rest of the day is spent in feasting,
singing, and dancing, in which latter of course the men are joined
by the women.             During  the days of this festival an entire holiday
is taken by all the people,          work in the fields      ceases,  and   their time
is wholly given up to prayer and feasting.
    I  have now to describe        the proceedings     which follow the birth of        a
 child.     A   few hours after the child is born messages are sent round
by the happy father to            all his friends and relations living in the
neighbourhood, inviting them             to assemble     in   the village yard.        A
puggee     is also invited to attend,          and   for this duty he receives          a
present.       It  is true    that he generally makes          a show    of declining
the gift, saying that it is his duty to come, but it would be con
 sidered   bad form on the part of the father were he not to insist                   on
its acceptance,         l'rayers of thanksgiving for the birth of the child
are first    said by the puggee         and  the grown-up men         ; these prayers
last about half an hour.            Afterwards     the boys    join  the men, and       a
feast takes place;         the father provides the guests with food, but            it is
 considered      a friendly and complimentary thing for each to bring                   a
little offering of        food.   When the       meal   is over the old men          are
invited by the father to accompany              him to his house to drink, while
the younger men and boys, being joined by the fair sex, spend the
night in dancing.            Seven days after the child's birth the people
assemble      again     outside the father's hut.         The father and mother,
who      holds the child, stand in the              doorway,     and    their   nearest

                         of Edinburgh,           Session 1884-85.                        227
relations      are  grouped on either side of them.                     The puggee then
arrives, and asks the father what the child's name is to he.                               He
then reads a prayer, and afterwards calls out the name, and the
ceremony is closed          by another        prayer.    For     the performance      of this
duty the puggee          is not allowed to receive payment, and it can only
be performed by the highest class of                                  The name given to
                                                        priests.
the child on this occasion may never afterwards be altered.                              The
rest of the        day is      spent in singing, telling             tales,   and   then    in
dancing,       the   child being exhibited with much                     pride,  and    if it
happens       to be a daughter the father receives                 very hearty congratu
lations, the       wish being always         expressed    that she may grow up to-be
very    beautiful, and to be as supple as a bending branch, in order
that    his riches may be increased by an extraordinary large dowry.
     Marriage Customs. — I have referred in another place to courtship
and elopement          ;   I will here   describe    the nuptial ceremonies.
     Large stores        of food and      immense      quantities of beer and wine
 are prepared        for the marriage       feast, and    if  a  very poor man is about
 to be    married he is allowed          to select    a cow       and   a  few  sheep from
 his richer friends' flocks, provided that he kills them where they are
  feeding,     and subsequently explains why he does so. If the bride
  and    bridegroom live in different villages, the wedding takes place
  in the bridegroom's          village.    The marriage ceremony is observed                in
  the evening       in the village     yard.      The fathers, brothers, and invited
   friends assemble together,            but, strange        to   relate,   the  bride    and
   bridegroom themselves are not present.                    Prayers are said, and then
   the priest, standing in the          midst of the group, announces              that the
   bride and bridegroom, giving their names, are hereby married, and
    calls upon the assembled         company to bear witness to the fact.                  As
   soon as this is over, the man             in the company who has the loudest
    voice calls out       with all his might " Ku-ru-ru," in order that                   the
    bride and bridegroom, who are in adjacent but separate huts,                         may
    hear   that their marriage is accomplished.                Then food is served, the
    most   of it being provided by the bridegroom's father                    ; the   bride's
    father, however, provides a small share.                  The boys are allowed to
    join in this feast, and when          it   is over the      younger portion of the
    company dance         all night long,     the older people retiring to the house
    of the    bridegroom's      father to drink.         More or less dancing takes
     place  for several days, lasting, however, only two or three hours in

228                    Proceedings     of the   Royal Society
the evenings.         The drinking goes on until the beer and wine are
finished, the visitors going away at night,            if they live in   the  village,
and    returning early       next morning.        If  they are from a       distance,
house-room     is provided for them.           Among the higher classes, sing
ing and dancing women, of whom there is                  a  small class in Darfur,
are engaged        to add    to   the enjoyment of the evening.             Music is
always provided.
    During   the     following week the bride and bridegroom do not see
one another      ;  the bride is engaged in perfuming herself, dressing            her
hair, and in other mysteries into which              I  have    not been initiated.
The bridegroom is occupied in counting over and over the dowry
which he will have to pay for his wife, and in receiving the visits
of his young male friends, who help to wile away the weary time of
waiting by songs and stories, expatiating on the charms and duties
of wedded      life, and expressing,       in terms of rapturous eulogy, the
captivating graces of his dusky bride.
    On the sixth day after the wedding the bridegroom sends the
dowry to his father-in-law, and if it           be correct   he receives a message
to   say that      he  may    arrive to claim his bride next day.              In the
morning the bridegroom's unmarried friends take presents from him
to the bride, such         as   one or two cows, a few loads         of grain, orna
ments, &c.         In  the afternoon the bridegroom is conducted to the
 bride's hut   ;   she meets him at the door, and he presents her            with the
marriage    ring, she making him in return a present               of  a  love token
and a ring.         He then enters her hut with some of their chosen com
 panions, and another feast is held outside provided by the bride's
 father.    After this      is over the father of the bride retires,          and the
 bridegroom, leaving the bride, joins            the company.       Soon after, the
 bride is taken round the village, preceded              by music and lighted by
 torch-bearers,      and after having received the congratulations of every
 one she retires       to her hut with some dozen            of her female    friends.
 A  few hours later the bridegroom is conducted thither by an equal
 number of his friends, who remain outside the hut, he alone enter
 ing.    These young men then ask            if they   too may enter, and having
 gained    permission they arrange          for three or four engaged couples
 to keep watch over the bride and              bridegroom for the night.          This
 watching is kept up for several           nights, and three or more may           pass
 before   the bride and         bridegroom lose their patience       and send     their

friends away.         Then at last the        marriage is consummated         amidst the
"Ku-ru-rus" of the assembled                    friends.     The     next morning the
wife leads her husband           and     presents      him to her parents     ; he looks
them     in the face and        speaks      to them for the        first time since his
engagement       ;  he salutes them, and presents             them, as also his wife's
unmarried brothers and sisters, with a ring.                   He lives with his wife
at his father-in-law's         until his first child is born, when he is per
mitted to take his wife away and set up housekeeping on his own
account.      During the whole of this                time  the   father-in-law   has to
pay all housekeeping expenses for the young couple, and the husband
is entitled to three meals during each night.                    Amongst the poorer
classes the     whole of    these festivities, which usually occupy twelve or
fourteen days, are compressed into seven days, the bridegroom being
 led to the bride's hut on the evening of the marriage day.
      Burial Customs. — Funerals           take place    within  a few   hours of death.
 The corpse        is wrapped in      a winding        shroud of damoor cloth, and
  carried to the grave on a rude bier hastily constructed of wooden
  poles lashed      together with rope.          It  is not used a second time, but
  is burnt.       Graves are dug     6   or  8 feet deep    and covered with stones,
  but the Arab method of burial is being rapidly introduced into the
   country.      The   graveyards   are situated at some considerable distance
   from the villages.
       When    a woman dies her body is buried without                  much ceremony,
   hut her friends accompany           it to   the grave uttering       mournful   cries.
   When     a man dies,    however,      a  priest is sent for, and his friends and
    relations collected.     The priest recites some prayers, and the body
    is then conveyed to the grave, accompanied                  by the friends and by
    women wailing for the dead.             The usual Moslem rites are performed,
    and the   company then disperses,            to meet again a     little later in  the
    outside  village yard, where an hour is devoted to prayer, and where
     they then hold a solemn funeral            feast.    The food for this occasion
    is provided by the deceased's nearest             kin, but contributions     are also
    brought by friends, and        if they should arrive           too late the animals
    they give are reserved     until two months later, for it is the custom to
    kill a cow or a goat every two months for two years after the death
     of a father.     On such    occasions       the   meat  must not be taken into
     the hut where the man died, but eaten outside, and the whole of it
     consumed before nightfall.          Any     passers by are at liberty to partake

230                         Proceedings             of   the   Royal Society
of this meat           This    custom            is by no means universally carried out,
for one reason, on account of the expense,                                     but     a    man          who thus
honours his father is much respected.                                   If    it should          be done             by a
husband in memory                    of his wife, it is considered to be                                 a    mark        of
extreme     affection         for her, and men will often do it for the sake                                              of
what     people        will    say.           No animals           are       offered       as a sacrifice                 at
funerals.
   Superstitions. — The Fors are not particularly remarkable for their
superstitious beliefs           ;    other tribes         I    have visited are far more credu
lous.     Some strange ideas, however, must be noticed.
   The cry of the owl is believed to foretell                                a death.           It is        supposed
to say   : — "To-morrow                  a grave      will     open for some one."                        A       gazelle
crossing one's path is taken                        as a good       omen.         To knock                   one's    left
big toe against anything                      on going out in the morning                            is supposed
to bring bad luck.                  It    is also very unlucky                to forget anything                     and
to return for        it,   especially when going out hunting.                              It   is   a   very lucky
thing for any food to fall to the ground when eating.                                                    It   must be
picked up and swallowed with any earth that may adhere to                                                          it,   for
in the next world, should                       a   man be accused of having                          starved his
body, the earth will bear witness that he has fed it.                                                    There        is   a
great    objection to cutting anyone                           else's nails, for should                       the    part
cut off be lost and not given into its owner's hands,                                           it   will have            to
be made     up to him somehow                       or other after death.                  If    a   person cuts
his own nails he bears the consequences                              of his own acts.                         The nail
parings are buried in the ground.                             If   the sound of         a       drum          is   heard
proceeding from Gebel Marah                           a   national calamity                 is       expected,            or
the defeat of an army, should the tribe happen to be at war at the
time.      It   is     supposed           that an old woman who has always                                           been
faithful     to her         husband            has power over                fire, and that should                         a
village take fire her presence will stop the flames.                                             Such women
are, however,          few and far between.                         When        several          deaths             occur
about the same time in one family,                                  it   is    thought to be due                          to
falsehood or perjury on the part of one of its members.                                                  It    is    very
unlucky for        a   bride to pass under                a     large    tree or to cross                     a    broad
road unless she wears an amulet to protect her from the zittan.
   Cups made of rhinoceros hern are supposed                                         to detect poison in
water,     beer,      or    wine, the fluid changing colour;                                to give one                   of
these cups to         a    friend        is   the highest honour that can be paid to him.

(I think this idea must have             been derived from the Arabs.)              Twins
are supposed        to be very lucky, especially girls              ;  they are believed
to bring good        fortune to      the whole village.
    Crimes. — Wilful           homicide     is   considered       a   great  crime.    The
murderer      is followed       by the friends of the deceased, then tried by
the chief, and        the invariable     sentence      is death;      neither he nor his
friends can by any possible means evade the immediate execution
of the sentence.             There is no definite executioner, and, with the
exception of the puggee (who may never shed blood), any bystander
may be called upon to carry out the rigour of the law.                         Should the
person      whom the chief         orders to undertake the office of executioner
refuse      to do so, even        if  a relation or friend of the criminal, he is
compelled to pay           a fine  of two cows.       The usual method of execution
is as   follows : — The        murderer's hands are tied behind his back, he is
 made      to kneel down, and is then struck on the back of the neck
 With a heavy knobbed stick.                Another       less common       plan is to call
 on a    party of      men to pick him up and drop him head foremost on
 the    ground, and to repeat this until his skull is completely smashed.
 This method is called " breaking the water melon," as that fruit is
  broken by being thrown upon the ground.                      If an aggravated     murder
  has been committed, or the murderer has killed more than one man,
  or has tried to escape from or fight with                  his   pursuers,  he is slowly
  beaten to death.           The criminal's friends are obliged to bury him at
   once, at a considerable distance            from the village and cemetery           ; no
   prayers may be said at his grave, nor may the grave be marked in
   any way.         If   a man    kills another accidentally           he i3 tried by the
   chief, and has to give a full account                  of the circumstances       which
   ended so disastrously.            If he has no witnesses          to confirm his story,
   he is required to take an oath on the Koran,                         or on one of the
   ancient religious books of the Fors              ;  he is then kept for a week in
   prison, and        if  none   of his relations die in the meantime,                he  is
   declared     innocent and set at liberty.               He is then expected to call
   together the friends and relations                of the      deceased    man,   and   to
   express his sorrow for what has happened,                  after which he is treated
   in a   friendly way by them, but on no account will they                      eat out of
    the  same dish with him.            Suicide is unknown in Darfur.
       If  a  man wounds another in hunting or in the games no notice is
   taken of    it :   if  on other occasions,     a fine    must be paid.       If two men

232                               Proceedings               of   the      Royal Society
quarrel and fight, they are not punished, unless either is hurt on
the head, in which case both of them incur                                           a fine.       If   a rape should
be committed               upon         a     very young girl, a circumstance of extreme
rarity, the whole of the offender's                                   cattle are confiscated.                If   a man
runs away with                a   girl, both his and her parents have to pay a fine
to the chief.             Seduction in our sense of the word is unknown.                                                  If
a   woman is caught in the act of adultery her husband is allowedjo
kill the  man and beat the woman.         It is very common for a
married woman to fall in love with another man and ask him to                                                           kill
her husband           ;   if this            gets found out, as is usually                              the case, both
the guilty parties are executed.                                 If    a man sets fire to               another man's
hut, he has to pay all damages                                   ; he       also gets a good             beating, and
must pay        a   fine to the chief,                 as the fire             is so liable to spread through
the village.          If      a person              steals, he receives a thorough beating for
the first two or three offences                         ;    but       if      repeated, one of his hands is
cut off, the arm being made fast to                                   a   log of wood and the wrist-joint
divided.        If    a person               insults a puggee, or in any way injures him,
he     must     pay       a    fine both to the chief and to the injured priest.
Lying      is held to be a great                       crime         ; even       the youngest            children are
severely      beaten          for      it,   and any one over fifteen or sixteen who                               is    an
habitual liar suffers the loss of one lip as                                     a   penalty.
     "When several                of   a     family die,          it      is   supposed        to be the result of
lying    on the part of the father, or rather                                     a   denial of an accusation
of lying while placing the hand on the Kiiab, the falsehood having
been really committed.                            On such occasions the priest says — "                           If   you
are not speaking the truth may God turn against you," and then                                                           if
deaths     in       the       family soon              follow they are thought to be God's
judgment.            To obtain His mercy                              a   white pigeon          is   brought to the
puggee      by the man, accompanied                                   by his accuser           ;     the priest        kills
the pigeon, puts some of the blood on both accused                                                       and accuser,
and    then the pigeon                       is   carefully           put away and not eaten.                      This
seems to be the nearest approach to sacrifice                                         that obtains in Darfur.
     On the whole, Darfur      singularly free from crime, adulter)' and
                                                  is
inciting      to murder in order to get rid of    jealous husband being              a
the most heinous offences.
     Morals.    — The words                       used to express               right and wrong are those
which denote also good and bad                                   ;    namely Tulai, good, and Geitee,
bad.     A     good       man          is    one       who       is   truthful and             honest,     brave, and

                         of Edinburgh,         Session 1884-85.                        233
kind to animals,           who    bears    pain with fortitude, and is loyal             to
his neighbours         and his sultan        ; the   bad man is the reverse of all
this.
    The Fors       are    rather    wanting       in vivacity, and       are   somewhat
sluggish    in action.         They are, however, very quick tempered,                 and
even passionate         and brutal when excited by drink.                They are very
avaricious    and      little given      to hospitality,    except     from    interested
motives.      They are not very cleanly. They are very intemperate,
and drunkenness           is not considered either sinful or degrading.
    The women are associated              with the men in all their occupations,
save   in war   ;  but their      presence      does not appear      to have exercised
any softening influence           upon the character of the men.
    The men are not much given to jealousy, unless                      with very good
cause,   and therefore        the women do not avoid the society of men,
 and girls and         even married women think nothing of passing                      the
 night with men who please them.                   They wear bells on their ankles
 and bangles      round their necks         and waists, and perfume themselves
 extensively in the hope of attracting lovers.                   Before marriage the
 young men and women are most lax, and indeed a father would be
 held up to       public ridicule, if not well           beaten,  if   he attempted       to
 preserve his daughter's chastity.               Indeed, excessive ugliness or very
 bad health could alone secure to a               girl her virginity.
     At markets,        at feasts,   and at dances, the young people              have as
  much freedom as they could possibly desire                   ; the    men    visit their
  sweethearts     at night, or the girls go to them, and          it  is not considered
  immoral.       If,  however,    a  father has any strong objection to any par
  ticular suitor for his daughter's hand, he may forbid him to visit her,
  and give    him     a thrashing     if he catches     him in her hut.          Adultery
  is considered      a purely personal         injury, and   no sympathy is shown
   by outsiders     to a man who is not brave            enough to     kill  the   rival in
   his wife's affections.        Should he ask for help, the only reply would
   be — "You cannot         be a good husband or your wife would be satisfied
   with you."       A   police of eunuchs was once instituted to put down
   this open immorality,         but   it totally failed and     was soon given up.
   The chiefs and rich men have               all fairly large harems,       and   usually
    have one   or two eunuchs, who are slaves, to look after their women.
    But notwithstanding         this precaution, the women do pretty much                 as
    they please,     for either young men are dressed              up    as  women     and

 234                       Proceedings       of the   Royal Society
smuggled       into the harems, or the women steal out at night to                     carry
 on their intrigues.
    It  is not considered          right to rub strangers,      but the chiefs     wink at
this offence, and the stranger                runs but    a  poor chance of obtaining
justice.       Cowardice is regarded            as a  very grave delinquency, and           if
 a man ran away             during     a  battle his wife would be entitled             to   a
 divorce, and no one would marry either his daughters or sisters.
    The virtuous side of the For character                    may    be summed up          in
three words        : they are industrious, brave, and remarkably truthful.
    Slavery. — The Fors             are not large      slaveholders, and they do not
themselves        make       slave   raids  ;  but they are permitted           to capture
slaves     in  war.       The chiefs and the very rich people                 occasionally
buy slaves from the Arabs, who are constantly passing                         through the
country with their slave caravans,                but it cannot be said that a slave
population exista              A  good number       of eunuchs, who       are also slaves,
are    employed         by the       chiefs.    They     are  treated    as   confidential
servants,     and often attain great wealth              and influence.      Some of the
most influential          of them marry, in order that they may appear to
have a family.           The few slaves who are found in Darfur are well
treated ; as a rule they are permitted to marry amongst                        themselves,
but some are treated             as concubines.        It  must   be remembered         that
a good      number of the Fors have been enslaved                  themselves     by their
Arab     conquerors.
    Marital Relations. — I            have described the marriage           ceremonies in
another place.           The woman enters into the man's family circle after
marriage.         In   a   first marriage,       when the contracting          parlies   are
still young, they are compelled to remain in                       the   bride's father's
seriba until the first child is born.                       When     a  man marries        a
second      or third         wife this custom         is  limited   to a week or two.
A   man may have as many wives as he can afford to buy and keep,
but    as    they are very jealous of one another, they are provided
with      separate      huts     in different parts of          the    village,   or even
sometimes        in   separate      villages.    It  is this custom,     combined with
the large harems           of the chiefs, which induces the very lax morals
everywhere met with.                 The first wife married is the chief wife;
her children take precedence over the children                      of others.      A  man
is expected       to visit his wives in regular rotation, but the chief wife
enjoys the society of her husband for a fortnight, whilst the others

must       be content          with only           a       week at a time.             Concubinage            is
permitted,        but seldom             occurs, only a very few slaves being held as
concubines.            Polyandry is not permitted. There is no class of
prostitutes.           A man may not marry his near relations, and it is
considered        better that              he should             marry out of his own village.
But many of the young                     people       become       engaged at a very early age
when thrown together                 in tending the cattle.                     A mutual understand
ing exists between              the young people,                   and it is only when other
young       men   begin to pay marked attention to the girl that her
accepted       lover goes to her father and asks his permission to marry
her.       Such permission               is usually given, and they exchange                          presents
before      their assembled friends                    ;    if   they    met     with a refusal           they
would       probably      elope, and then the                     parents on both sides                  would
have to pay a heavy fine.
   The        presents mutually given are kept as great treasures, and                                        if
any evil befall           the    separated             lovers, they console              themselves           by
 saying  (pointing to the                charm)
                                                — " Never mind,                   I   am engaged to so-
 and-so."   The engagement                    lasts         generally for         a   year   or two, and
 during this time the young man is not allowed to speak to or to visit
 his intended's parents              ;   should he meet them in the road, he must try
 to avoid      them     ; he   may however visit his fiancee at nights                           as   often   as
 he chooses.           On arriving          at puberty every girl has a separate                           hut
 built for herself.             From        what has been said, it is obvious that the
  relation of husband and wife in                          Darfur   is not of a very satisfactory
  character.
       Mythology.      — Although           songs          and stories          are handed down               by
  tradition      in Darfur, the            people          have    no bards or story tellers by
  profession.

       "
           Upon a certain day, many years ago, some boys were in the fields
  watching a herd of cattle.                  A thunderstorm,                   accompanied          by much
  rain, came          on, and the boys drove the cattle home,                                but in their
  haste     they lost a cow belonging to an Arch-Barr.                                The cow happened
   to be a     valuable one, so as soon as the rain ceased the Arch-Barr
   seloff to seek for          it,   and during his search he was obliged to cross
  a
       very     broad swamp.                As     is       usual       after    a     shower         of rain,
   authe       frogs    in this swamp were singing (croaking).                                   The Arch-
   Barr waded           through the swamp,                       when    one      of the     frogs       called

out — ' Arch-Barr you've gone too far, your cow is on this side of the
swamp;'     so, thanking      the frog, he retraced      his steps, but had no
sooner    returned than another frog called out to him — 'Arch-Barr
your cow is not there, it is just by me;' but when he reached that
frog he discovered      that he had been misled again.              This went on
for some time until the poor man got quite tired with wading back
wards    and  forwards across the swamp,            and    the frogs laughed so
much at his expense         that they had not strength to call out to him
any more.      Seeing that he had been made           a  fool of, he tried to      kill
one of the frogs with a stick       ;  but this angered them, and they cried
out that they would        kill him,  at which he was so frightened that he
ran away.      On his way he met another frog who told him the real
whereabouts     of his cow, and he drove it home at last in triumph                    ;
but his jubilation was short-lived, for one of the frogs hopped after
him to the village and told his friends how they had made                  a fool of
him.     Everybody       laughed at him        and    gave    him   the   name      of
Sandara (the frog), which nickname clung to him to his dying day."
It is said, too, that his sweetheart lived on the other side of the
swamp,    and each night       when he went to      see her    he was laughed at
by the frogs and insulted with many rude remarks.
    "Once upon    a time an    elephant and    a camel were great     friends, and
they agreed that they would plant             a large  field with dhurra      ;  this
they did, and then        they got    a hare   to watch      and  take care     of it
until  the time of     harvest arrived.       The dhurra was then gathered,
thrashed,   and winnowed, and two great heaps were formed — one of
grain   and one of husks and stalks.             When      they began to divide
the grain they had a dispute, and          it waxed so hot that their friend
ship vanished and they decided to fight for the biggest                  share   ;  so
each    went   away      to   collect an    army.     The     elephant    gathered
together all the large animals into his army, while the camel enlisted
the services of the small animals.            Now the captain of the camel's
army, although       so small, was very wise        and    cunning, and he said
to the camel    — Unless
                   '
                               we cheat    the big animals we shall not be
powerful enough to beat them.'             So he told the camel to lie down
on the ground, and all the little animals covered him up with a heap
of dhurra stalks, with the exception of one knee, and told him                      to
lie  perfectly quiet and still.          They then      all  ran  away, and hid
themselves at a little distance to watch for their big enemies.              At  last

the elephant and         his army arrived on the scene, and were much
surprised       to find no one to fight with. However, one of them, with
                                 rest, noticed the camel's knee, and said — What
                                                                           '
eyes sharper       than the
is this?' and       went up and                gave   it   a good bite, at which                   the     camel
roared out        with pain, and this                  so frightened the          elephant's army
that they        turned tail and ran                  away.        The camel's       army then left
their hiding-places            and pursued the fugitives, coming up at last with
the elephant,           who    was quite alone and unprotected, and whom they
killed, and then devoured.                       By this          means the camel              obtained all
the corn        for himself;         he        thanked        his army very much, and paid
them       well for the great service                      they    had rendered               him.         Little
people can beat           big    ones   if they        are   only sharp enough."
   "     One    winter day       a hyena climbed up a tree to gather some leaves
for food.         After he had collected                a great many,          he saw below him a
little lamb who had wandered from her mother and was all alone.
 At this he came down so quickly that he lost all his leaves.                                             When
 the     lamb saw him she was very frightened, and said — ' Hyena, what
 do      you want?' he answered — 'I want to eat you up.'      The lamb
 knew      it would be of no            good to        run away         as    she would                then very
 soon be       caught, so she thought of the following                            plan to save her
                                    hyena — There is
                                           '
 life.        She said to the                                       a   pool of water              a   little way
 from here ; before you eat me you must go and get your mouth                                                full
 of water,' and the hyena went, and the lamb went off as fast as her
  legs could      carry her towards the village.                        After    she had proceeded
  some     little distance on her way, up came the hyena with his mouth
                          '                                                               '
  full of water.              Now you can't                eat me,'     she said,             because       your
                                           '
  mouth is       full of water.'               Oh yes,' said he, and in                       so       saying the
  water was       of    course    spilt.        Then replied the lamb — Now you cer   '
  tainly can't eat me, because you have                           no water in your mouth,'                     so
  he     turned and ran away to get some more.                            On his return he found
  the lamb       just entering the village, and when he followed her, she
   turned      and said — ' Now you can neither eat me with your mouth full
   or empty,      for   I am   safe,' and with this she jumped into the seriba, and
   the dogs came         and drove the hyena away.                           So the lamb was saved
   by her      cunning, and the hyena was very angry because he had lost
      so much    time and also his leaves, for when he came to the place
      where    he had left them the wind had blown them all away."
         The   following story of the rabbit and the hawk                           (?)   is       rather long,

238                           Proceedings              of   the   Royal Society
but    as    it contains          a good many different                       ideas    I    think it is worth
repeating   :—
     " A rabbit and               a   hawk once had            a cow as            common property ; they
used        to take         it in turn        to       watch this cow                 while      grazing.       The
rabbit is         a    very deceitful animal, and, liking milk very much, on
the days when he had charge of the cow he milked it and                                                 drank the
milk     before         driving the cow                home.          The hawk was honest, and on
the days when he drove                       it    home      there          was      always plenty of          milk
for both.             Not content with obtaining                        most of the       milk every other
da}', the         rabbit thought of               a   plan to deceive the               hawk still more, so
said to him — '              It   is not good for you to                     drink     the thin    milk, but it
is good for me, so                 if   you will        make      a    hole at the bottom of your
milking       pot,      I   will      place mine under            it    ;    then the thin milk will flow
into mine, and you will keep the thick milk.'                                          The hawk agreed to
this, but of course all the milk ran into the rabbit's bowl, and the
hawk retained                the froth        alone,        which           vanished when he put it on
the fire to boil.                 The hawk could not understand this, and so went
to ask        the rabbit              for an explanation.                    The latter said       — ' Oh you
silly bird, you must stop up the hole in your pot, and put some
water in it before you place it on the fire to boil, and then you will
get good milk.'               Next diiy           the hawk did so, but found the                        milk very
poor, so went to the rabbit                       for   a taste of his milk.                    He said     it was
in his hut and he would go and fetch                                   it,   but he brought out           a    bowl
of water to which he had added                               a    few drops of milk.                    Thus    the
hawk was deceived                       again, and was very angry with                            the    cow for
giving such poor milk, on which the rabbit suggested that he should
drive her to new pastures                     a       long way off,           as   that might improve her
milk.         The hawk consented                       to the rabbit taking the cow, on con
dition       that his son should accompany                                  him.      After proceeding for
some distance,              the rabbit made up his mind that, as he could deceive
the    hawk no longer,                  it   would be best to                 kill   the cow, so he         killed
the hawk's             son and the cow, which                         he devoured.               He then went
home        and told the hawk that he had                             left the cow with his son, and
that they would return in                         a   few days, but he was very much                        afraid
of the hawk finding out what had happened,                                             and thought of the
following plan to escape from his vengeance:                                    — Far, far up in         the sky,
so    far    as       to be invisible             to mortal eyes, there                is   a   place where     the
animals meet to dance and sing and to amuse themselves,                                                   and to

this place the birds carry the four-footed animals.                              The rabbit there
fore proposed to         the hawk that they should go up and amuse them
selves        until the cow returned, and to this plan he consented, only
stipulating           that they should                first dress    themselves          nicely,     and
perfume             themselves       well, in order to be received               with joy and         to
find        mates     quickly amidst the merrymakers                      above,    and he asked
the rabbit            to    prepare        him   a     nice scent.        The    latter,    however,
prepared            himkind that smelt exactly like the 'kurkinja' (a
                            a
small        animal that lives in holes in the ground, and whose smell
is       very    much           disliked     by the       Fors). This scent the hawk
placed          upon       some      glowing         embers, and fluttered about in the
smoke           until      he     was    thoroughly          perfumed.      He then took             the
rabbit on his back and flew up to the animal's paradise.                                           After
they had been               there some little time and had become acquainted
with the denizens of the country, the rabbit requested permission to
sing a song.          On this being accorded him he procured a drum, and
began         to sing — '
                          Oh ! the hawk stinks like a kurkinja ! Oh ! the hawk
 stinks       like a kurkinja!' at which everyone laughed, and cried out —
 'Yes, yes, he does.'                   This much          enraged the hawk, who flew away.
 As soon as the rabbit had made sure that he had really gone, he
asked         his new friends              to make a long rope and to let him down to
 earth again.       This they did, and he told them that directly he shookthe
 rope       they were to let it go.  But he mistook his distance and shook
 it too soon, by which he got                    a good      fall, and coming in contact with
 a       thorn bush         a    thorn went right through one of his ears.                          The
 rabbit         was very angry at this, but the thorn bush said — Never                       '
 mind,' and gave him some gum, whereat                            he went away.             He soon
 found a      bird sitting on            a nest of eggs, and gave her the gum, whicn
 she      ate; his anger was             aroused again, and to appease              him she gave
 him an egg.               He     then soon came up to a group of boys taking care
     of some sheep, and gave               them the egg to look at, which they dropped
 down and broke.                   Once more he was very angry and demanded                            a
     sheep,     which      he got ; and this he drove before him                 until     he came to
     a   village where the people had many cattle.                        He    showed      them     the
     sheep    and they killed and ate                it,   he partaking    of the meal.            After
     they     had    finished, and all had washed their hands, he told them
     that he        must have a cow in exchange                   for his sheep.           This they
     refused,    but he made such                a   noise    that at last they made him              a

240                      Proceedings         of   the   Royal Society
present of a big fat          bull, which      he took into the forest near by.                  He
killed and       ate    it   and afterwards stuffed the skin, and came                    back to
the village and asked them               if they would        exchange     it for     a camel.
They consented, and he mounted his camel and rode with them                                       to
the place where the stuffed bull lay.                     He told   them to beat the            bull
and    it would     wake up, and then rode off and vanished in the distance.
When         the villagers found out how they had been treated                      they were
very incensed          against      the rabbit, but he took care never to come
that way again."
  This story           is told to show how deceitful the rabbit                     is,    and to
warn people that             if   their path   is   crossed by one they must be                 very
cautious during the whole of that day, or they will probably                                     be
deceived       by some one.
   War. —       A   class of regular soldiers exists            in Darfur, and they are
called dalimars.             They are in the service of the chiefs, and any strong
young man may enlist in their ranks, but they receive                             no regular
pay.        They are liable to be called on for service                  at any time, and
they then receive             proper rations of food, and at the close of                   a   war
they get presents of damoor cloth and grain.                        They all possess land
just    as    others    do, and       in times      of peace cultivate     it   and       support
themselves        and their families.             All   the dalimars of    a   district reside
at the chief's headquarters.                 They are divided into two classes              ;    the
one    is    composed        of well-to-do men, the other of common                       soldiers.
The former live in separate huts with their families, in an enclosure
on one side of the chief's quarters,                      and are treated      by him with
much respect            and consideration.               Notwithstanding       this       they do
not seem to be very contented,                    and the puggees often have to bring
their influence to bear on them to settle disputes between them and
their chief.           The lower class soldiers live in long sheds on the other
side of the chief's enclosure,               and    a   strong grass wall divides the two
classes.       A    similar       one forms an enclosure            all round the chief's
village, and outside this again               a   strong hedge protects the place from
attack by men or intrusion                   of beasts.      Between the two walls               are
gardens,        but the principal            gardens     and the fields are outside the
seriba.
   An under chief lives in               a   hut at the door of each division, and                is
responsible for the gate being properly guarded,                         as    watch       is   kept
there night and day.                No   one can go and speak to the chief without

                          of Edinburgh,         Session 1884-85.                                241
first having his        business ascertained by the under chief.                      The lower
dalimars      are  very badly treated by the upper class dalimars                          ;  most
of them        drink to excess, and a good many chew tobacco.                                   The
dalimars are       exercised in throwing             spears,    <fcc,   outside the village,
on    ground set apart         for the    purpose.      A young         man     may become          a
soldier when about             1 5, but boys are allowed to go and live with
the dalimars        long before this        age   if they  have friends among them,
and     their     parents have no             objection     to     their       following        that
calling when           th*>y grow       up.     A   sub-chief      is    responsible for the
whereabouts of           all the dalimars, and they have                to leave their names
with the gatekeeper              whenever they go out of the seriba.                         These
gatekeepers         have a remarkable power of remembering                           names       and
faces,    and are able to give the chief the names of all absentees, who
 sometimes        may number         a hundred or two.            Although         the dalimars
 form the      nucleus of       an army, they by no means represent                    the entire
 force     of fighting       men,    for every      man capable           of bearing arms is
 required to fight when necessary.                  The dalimars are employed very
  much as a police            force   in time of      peace   ;   should war break out,
  they are sent         round to all the villages to collect those who intend
  to fight,    and    to tell them to assemble            on a given day at the head
  chiefs seriba.          When all      are collected the march begins, and definite
   positions     are occupied during the march by the various constituents
   of the army.         The chief leads the procession                ;  on his left hand is
   the second       chief at the head of the rich dalimars                 ;  on his right, the
   third chief at the head of the lower class dalimars.                             To    the left
   of the     rich dalimars march the villagers, led by their                          respective
   headmen.          The chiefs and        the headmen         often ride on horseback,
   but    they    do not like fighting         on their horses (this does not apply
   to   the     cavalry).      The distinctive dress when at war is a white
    girdle    of damoor cloth wound round the waist.                           The chief does
   not wear his unless walking,               but uses it       as    a saddle-cloth.           If   a
    man distinguishes himself             greatly by bravery in battle he is often
    made a     chief, and such chiefs are more respected than the hereditary
    chiefs.      The    minor      rewards     are by election to            be    sub-chiefs or
    headmen        of    groups     of villages.      There       is     no punishment            for
    cowardice,       as the disgrace        is in   itself   a    sufficient       penalty    ;   the
    news    of it soon spreads, and is made the subject of sarcastic                          songs
     at  the village       feasts.     The    Fors believe that             if they      are     very

242                    Proceedings     of tlie Royal Society
brave     in battle they will       have a white horse       to ride upon      in the
next world.         Duels are common in battles, and are often resorted
to   in order   to regain the favour      of  the sultan.
     As   soon   as  the army nears       the enemy's       country the order         of
marching is slightly altered.           A  vanguard and      a rearguard    and right
and left wings and           centre   are formed   ;   skirmishers are also sent
out (Sandanger) in couples to look out for the foe.                   The attack is
 often delivered from various            points in order to throw the enemy
 into confusion.         They choose their camps if possible near           a river or
 by wells, and seribas         are formed for their protection.           The people
 encamp      in exactly the same positions they occupy when at home,
 so   that there is no difficulty in finding         a  given man when wanted.
 Fires are allowed in camp, unless            they are very near      the enemy,      in
  which    case they are     forbidden to talk loud or to sing.         All   sleep on
  the ground, their girdles (mulpa) being              spread   beneath    them.      In
  marching they are not obliged to keep step.                 The arrangements as
  to  scouting and the various divisions of the army are made by the
  heads of the villages in consultation          with   the sub chiefs.      The only
  baggage     carried is the food, which is taken by each man in                 a  skin
  bag carried on the          back,  being hung round the neck by a cord.
  Camp followers are not allowed.              The war songs are numerous and
  spirited, and are sung in camp, on the march, and sometimes                    during
  the    fight   itself.    The    particular   cry in     danger   is   " Ku-ru-ru."
  When in      camp, war dances are sometimes performed              for the purpose
   of cheering the sultan or chief.            They advance      in rows, each man
   holding   a spear    aloft with his right hand and trailing another in his
   left.   On approaching the chief they kneel down on one knee sing
   ing all the time an inspiriting          song, and on rising they touch the
   ground with the tips of their spears.             They then move off, and are
   followed by successive         rows, who go through the same manoeuvre.
   The same thing is done by the dalimars to the heads of the villagers
   and by the villagers to their own           headmen.       Camp life appears to
   possess great     charms     for the people, and for the time being they
   appear to be much drawn together,            and to avoid quarrelling.
      There used to be about 3000 cavalry, with headquarters                       at El
   Fascher;    but their number is now much reduced.
      During    a  war the women       are sent   to places     of security, and do
   not accompany       the men.

                        of Edinburgh,        Session 1884-85.                       243
     The Fors do not        like to encounter their enemies if the latter are
on    a  height above them.          In such a case they do not stop to throw
spears      while advancing, but go rapidly forward and try to dislodge
the    hostile ranks from their position.             One of their favourite means
of warfare is to surprise their enemy by getting round them through
a wood or a valley, or in some such
                                                     way to take them unawares.
When about          a  mile from      the   foe   the army is often divided,         the
smaller portion         making     a direct advance, while        the others form a
circuit and take        the enemy in      the   rear, the latter being meanwhile
deceived      by those who are attacking them from the front pretending
to run away.          The enemy       is also   very often attacked at night, the
army     advancing very quietly and throwing a spear with a light tied
on to     it so as to strike one of the enemy's huts. Sometimes they
approach the hostile camp just before dawn, and lie down under the
 seriba    until the people begin to get up, when they rush in and easily
 gain a      victory.     At other times they fire the seriba at different
 points, and when the whole is ablaze                  and the enemy run out the
 latter are impeded by rows of spears                firmly planted in the ground
  slanting towards the seriba.            They are careful to prevent the enemy
  attacking      their villages during their absence by means of scouts, who
  are   very clever.      In retreat they keep together, and halt at the sound
  of the    drum.      Alliances  are frequently       made    with other tribes for
  mutual defensive          purposes.     The villages      are all surrounded by a
   strong hedge composed of stakes and thorn bushes,                 7  or 8 feet high
   and 12 broad,       with flat   tops.     In the Gebel Marah district earth
   works     are also employed as        a means     of defence.     If  the   Fors  are
   being attacked        by an enemy they often light fires in their village
   in order     to deceive their    foes, and then retire to a short           distance,
   returning as soon as the enemy are well inside the village                 ;  by this
    means they hem them in and prevent                 their escape.     The wars in
   which the Fors engage are generally of short duration, one or two
    battles   being usually sufficient to settle their disputes.             Prisoners
   taken    in war   are sometimes kept for a long time ; they are chained
   and   confined in strong huts and are compelled to work, but they may
   be   ransomed or exchanged.          Unless they misbehave themselves they
    are  well    treated, but    any one trying         to escape   is killed.     After
    conquering     another tribe the Fors do not stay and govern the country,
    but  after    collecting together all that is movable              they burn     the

244                    Proceedings       of  the   Royal Society
villages and retire      ; the   main object in war is to           kill  or    capture the
opposing chief.
    Weapons.   — The       weapons     used    by the Fors are spears, bows                and
arrows,    throwing knives, swords,           a  few guns, clubs,          shields, stones,
and two machines            for throwing      large   stones      and javelins.         Bows
and arrows are not very much used; the bows are very strong,                            about
4 feet long,    and are strung with the sinews of animals                      ; the arrows
have very varied        barbed heads, and are made so that the head                      shall
remain in the wound when the arrow is withdrawn                            ;  they have     no
feathers,    but are notched for the string, and are ornamented                          with
bits of iron wound round them.                   Six  spears      make a complete          set,
five of which are light, so as to be easily thrown                  ;  the other is     much
heavier,     and is used in hand-to-hand               combat.          There      are  many
different shapes in use, some plain and others barbed.                           Shields are
 made of bulls' hide         ; they are oval and convex, and from                3 to 5   feet
long.      A  wooden      rib runs down the centre inside, in the middle                    of
 which     there   is  a    wooden    handle,    which     is grasped         by the hand.
 Most of the swords in use are imported                    ;   they are straight, two-
 edged,    and   used     for both cutting and          thrusting.           The    throwing
 knives are curiously curved, and are thrown with unerring aim, as
 are also stonen, the latter being much used, especially from heights
such   as  occur in the Marah district         ;  they  are also      thrown with      a split
 stick.    The machines         for throwing       heavy stones, and the catapults
 for javelins are well and dexterously made.                      I do   not know when
 they were introduced into the country, but they have been there for
 hundreds of years         if tradition  be correct.
     Government.     — The Fors      have had a long hereditary line of despotic
 sultans, the last of whom, Haroun, was killed by the Egyptian troops
 in 1881, after      I visited Darfur.          Until this time         the sultans lived
 in great state, and the Arab tribes who had encroached                           upon their
 country had been compelled               to pay them        taxes     in    order   to enjoy
 their    protection.       Wherever       the    sultan     lived     his residence      was
 called   El  Fascher,     and it is only since the Egyptians                 conquered the
 country that      El Fascher        has become a definite spot                  Darfur    was
 divided into five large provinces,            severally ruled by         a   high dignitary
 of state, and      each of these provinces were                 subdivided into small
 districts under the management              of shartays or local governors.               All
  these rulers are hereditary, but the succession                  goes to the youngest

son,     who   inherits the chief's private property. The local
                 also
government is carried on by each chief independently, but they are
all responsible to the sultan for maintaining order in their                                            respective
districts.       The people                 are not allowed to appeal                        from the chief's
decision       to the       sultan,              and their        only means             of redress         under
oppression is to rise against their chief, which action is usually
followed by the sultan's interference, who either compels the people
to   submit, or removes                    the chief, as the case may be.                         The chiefs are
compelled to pay certain taxes to the sultan, which they must present
in person.           No one            is allowed to speak to the sultan directly, but
only by means             of    a go-between.
      Laics. — Any         person may occupy                 as    much unappropriated land                          as
he       pleases      without          paying          for it.      Encroachments                  on    land    are
prevented           by thom         hedges, broad paths, or ridges of earth, which are
 employed           as boundaries.                Game is not preserved                  ;   it   may be     killed
 whenever found.                  If a      man dies without heirs, or leaves the country
 without giving up his land to                         a successor,       it may             be reoccupied by
 any one who chooses.    Land                          is either left to daughters                      or to the
 youngest           son, that
                                  it is,
                                       if       they are still infants, for their support until
  they are married          ;          is   subsequently equally divided amongst them.
     The elder       sons are supposed                 to be able to occupy land for them
     selves.     As   a   rule,    a   father leaves nearly all his personal                             property
     to his youngest son.                  If   he should die without any special orders to
     this   effect, the first wife's children                draw lots for the property, and
     thus divide the           cattle, grain,          &c,   between          them.           Smaller parts of
     the property, however, are in the hands of the other wives, for their
     own support and that of their children, and these goods and cattle are
     divided amongst their children on the father's death.                                           There      is   no
      provision made for the widows, as they mostly marry soon after
      their husband's death.                     When    a   man         is   thought to be dying he
      sends    for two    puggees           to hear his          will,   and they are charged                   with
      the carrying of      it   out.        If   a   man dies without             a   puggee being present,
      except   in    war, he    is    thought to die like            a    dog.
         The chiefs and puggees are the judges.                               Persons who are waiting
      for trial are chained and kept in                      a    hut by themselves.                     Strangers
      are   never put          to death            except for murder.                    Suspicious-lookir.g
      strangers entering          a    village are confined in                a   hut until they can give
     a   good account       of      themselves.            Failing this, they                 are escorted           by

246                     Proceedings       of the Royal Society
two men outside the village and sent away.                     For other     laws, see the
paragraph      on Crimes.
    Hunting.    — During       the dry season          the people     devote      much of
their time to hunting.            While spinning their cotton in the village
yard the hunting          parties    are   planned and arranged, chiefly by the
young men.          Their  leader, generally the best and most                 experienced
hunter, is called the       ageet   ;  he settles the district       to be hunted         in,
and    lets the     people   in the neighbouring           villages know when the
hunt is to take place.           At   the given time        the   several    parties    meet
there, each led by their ageets,             and    blowing their horns, to hasten
those who are late.          When all       have arrived at the place of meeting
the chief ageet takes the supreme direction, and arranges everything
connected      with the hunt.          After it     is over they reassemble          at  this
place,    and    the   ageet    tells them where the next hunt is to take
place.      These     hunting     parties     are   not at all identical          with    war
 parties.     There are no rewards             given to successful        hunters     ;  each
 man hunts        for himself, and retains his own spoil                ;   if  a  man has
more     game      than he wants,         he gives      to   his friends or sells the
 remainder.         If  several    shoot     at   the   same    animal, it is divided
between       them.      Very few        serious    quarrels occur      while      hunting.
There are no laws for the preservation of game, and                             they shoot
everything that comes in their way                 ; the   whole country is free for
all to hunt in, even should the hunters belong to                       a    neighbouring
tribe.      The skin and horns of an animal belong to its slayer.                        The
meat is preserved by drying it in the sun or smoking                      it over   the fire.
The hunting weapons are used for war too, but not                       as tools.       They
 use spears, and bows and arrows.                  They can hit birds on the wing.
 Dogs    are  trained to hunt            The Fors very often fire the forest, and
 then place themselves          in a favourable spot,          so  that the frightened
 animals may fall an easy prey to their spears.                        Guinea fowl are
 driven into nets; snares made of string are used for catching birds.
 Game is carried home in the hand or on the shoulder, or on a pole
 carried    between     two or four people.              Should the animal be very
 large   it  is cut up on the           spot    and    taken home      in pieces,       none
 being left to waste.            Sometimes        small hunting parties           are made
 up of horsemen,          who go long distances              in search     of game; the
 horses    are used     for hunting the wild boar and for running down
 ostriches.      All other animals           are attacked on        foot        Should    the

                         of Edinburgh,          Session 1884-85.                           247
chief ageet of a district die, the hest known hunter                          is appointed in
his place.
     The wound of a poisoned animal is cut out immediately.
     Boys go      hunting by         themselves       ;  they catch       birds, mice, rats,
guinea     fowl, and hares.           Guinea fowl and           a  kind of partridge seem
to be the        only animals taken alive             and    kept.     Their eggs are also
taken and hatched by fowls.
     Traps.   — The Fors       resort to various means of trapping game.
     A stout post is         placed     in   the ground on either side              of  a path
frequented by animals going to drink                     ;  a cross    bar   is fixed at the
top, on which           a slip noose       is fastened        which hangs almost to the
ground      ;  into this the animal runs            and is secured.
     Small holes        are dug      in  the ground and covered              with twigs and
 grass.       Around them slip knots            are arranged, their ends being made
 fast to a heavy log of wood or the trunk of                          a tree.     The animal,
 walking over         these holes, gets its feet entangled,             and while trying to
 shake them loose tightens the noose and makes                           sure its captivity.
  Sometimes large animals drag the block of wood with them, thus
  leaving a trail for the hunters to follow up.
      A  trap for lions is constructed           as  follows : — A large hole is dug in
  the ground and covered with mats, which are again covered by earth.
   A tall     pole is placed       in  the middle         of the hole with some meat
   suspended at the top          ;   when the lion attempts to jump up to the
   bait, it of course falls into the hole.
       A  tall pole is fixed in the ground with                a  bait at the top     ; around
   it are placed spear heads firmly embedded                     in the ground, with their
   points upwards.          The animal jumps to get the bait, and falling back
   impales     itself on the spear points.
       A  stone house is built,        with    one end open.           A swinging door        is
    arranged to close      it when     an animal has entered            for the bait which
    is placed at the opposite end.
       A basket trap      is employed for birds.              One edge is supported by
    a stick, so arranged that when the birds enter the basket                       imprisons
    them.
       The roof of a big hut is sometimes                   lightly supported by        stakes,
   to one or two of which a rope is tied.                   A    man   conceals    himself at
   some    distance from the hut, holding               the    ends    of the ropes in his
   hand, and when animals enter the hut for the bait which                           is placed

248                       Proceedings       of the Royal Society
there, he pulls the          ropes    and the roof falls over them.                                   This con
trivance is sometimes             placed       over     a   small stream                      where      animals
come to drink.
   Nets are also used for trapping birds.
  Fishing.     — Although          the    For     women                 do     not take          part in the
hunting, they join in fishing;                 in fact, the whole population                              in the
western part of Darfur fish, and consider it fine sport.                                              They fish
with the rod and line, with baited hook                             ;    they spear the fish, and
they catch them in wickerwork                     traps.                Fish      are also       netted,      but
this method is rarely employed except                                   by the blacksmiths,                  who
always fish by themselves.               Small pieces of the bark of                             a   bitter tree
are sometimes           thrown    into the water            ;       the       fish eat them              and are
poisoned.       Dams are also constructed in the river, from which the
water is subsequently drained and the fish caught by hand.                                                 When
caught,     the fish are cut open, and then smoked                                     on a stand over a
fire or dried           in the sun.      The harpoons are made with movable
heads, to which            a line is attached          ;    they are usually barbed.                           As
soon   as    the fish is struck          the    head        becomes               loose and the fish            is
played by the line attached to the head                         ;       this same remark applies
to the      hand spears.          Bows and arrows are used                               by the boys for
shooting fish       ;    the arrow has a line attached                       to   it,   but the heads are
not loose.      Fish       are not preserved          alive.
   Trade. — Men devote               themselves            entirely to no trade save war,
with the exception of the blacksmiths,                              and in war alone are the
services of the women dispensed                  with.              All      other employments are
followed by men and women alike.
   The following           articles are manufactured:                        — Damoor cloth, shirts
of damoor, caps of damoor,                 leathern sandals,                      water skins, leather
bags for carrying grain, earthenware,                      string, mats, basketwork, rough
spinning      wheels        and    looms,       shields,            spears,            bows and arrows,
bracelets     and       rings, and iron implements used                                in cultivation.          A
few of the Fors are very expert in the manufacture of filigree work,
and in ivory turning.
   Damoor cloth, wheat, and dhurra are employed as the principal
articles of barter, but almost everything                                is    used      for exchange          as
occasion     serves.       All   the Fors are very industrious,                              in fact they are
the most industrious tribe         I     have ever visited.                       It    is   quite   a   pleasure
on entering one of their villages to see the whole population, men

                            of Edinburgh,      Session 1884-85.                             249
and women, young and old, engaged in some useful occupation.
Work is paid for with dhurra, food, and drink. The people
consider it to be an honour to work for the chief without pay, but
he provides them with food and drink.
     The blacksmiths             are the only class         of special     workers who do
 nothing but follow their own trade.                     They are a class quite apart,
 live in their own villages, enjoying a very bad reputation, and being
 looked down upon by the rest of the community.                               They are great
  drunkards,        and are continually          quarrelling      and fighting, and the
  dalimars have to be constantly employed in keeping order in their
   villages.       They are the only men who take apprentices.
       Strangers      and very poor people          are sometimes         employed by the
   rich, and are paid         in dhurra and cloth,        besides receiving their         food
        Exchange      of goods is carried on with several of the surrounding
    tribes, and with the Arabs.             Markets are held once or twice               a week
    at convenient      places near several villages.            There is     a free exchange
    of food, cattle,       tools, arms,     ornaments, &c.          Beer is also sold, and
    disputes and fighting in the market are of common                         occurrence.      A
    few    dalimars    are usually sent       there to keep order, and they levy a
    small toll      on the villagers.         Any      one may      engage      in trade,    and
     most    people have something to sell.               Credit    is sometimes        given to
     people    living in       the    neighbourhood       ;  should    they not pay,         the
     dalimars are sent          to exact the      debt,     and   the     debtor      must also
    pay    them for their services.           All     people    have    a   right of way so
    long as they behave             themselves.       There is no hongo.              People go
    in companies         to the      markets,    but     each   trades     on    his own      ac
    count ;      this applies        also  to  fishing       and    hunting        expeditions.
    Goods are carried in          skin   bags or in mats upon their heads or backs.
    Camels,       donkeys,      and     oxen are also        used   as    beasts    of burden.
    There are no porters proper,            but sometimes         men are hired to carry
    things.      There are no boats, nor is there any river navigation.
        Ancient      tools,    weapons,     knives, and ornaments are sometimes
    found on the sites of deserted            villages.
       The Fors are not at all wasteful             ;   dry bread, for instance, is kept
    after being dried        in the    sun, and when needed for use              it  is chopped
    up fine   and eaten with water.              Remnants of food are not thrown
    away,    but given to the dogs.            Meat and fish are cured and stored,
    as  also  dhurra and dried          vegetables.

      People are rich or poor according to the number of cows                          they
   possess.      A poor      man    often becomes      rich by working           hard, and
   thereby accumulating presents of cattle.
      Money — Exchangeable             Values. — A good          bull is worth fifteen
   sheep, and      some favourite bulls         are sold for not less than           thirty
   sheep.     A   cow is worth fifteen young goats           ;   a he-goat,   three sheep.
  A    sheep    values     six hoes, eight or nine common                spears,  or three
  good spears, or one damoor cloth.
      Wedding dowries depend much upon arrangements                        made between
  the parents,      and     also very much upon the class of the contracting
   parties and the beauty          of the bride.
      No  beads or cowries are used as money, the standard money being
  damoor      cloth, but in the large towns imported                   cloth   and Maria
  Theresa dollars are used.              Forty small      pieces     of damoor cloth, a
  foot long and       4  inches broad, equal in value one white cloth, two of
  which equal       a dollar,   a  small blue cloth being used to represent            half
  a  dollar.     The standard white cloth is called             a  fob;   the blue cloth,
 faradinh ; and the smallest pieces of cloth, rubieh.                       The prices at

  Daia, when was there, were as follows : An ox, from 3 to 6 dollars;
 a sheep,      three- quarters      of a  dollar;   a goat,     half   a  dollar;  a good
 riding camel, 50 to 70 dollars; a pack camel, 25 to 30 dollars.                         A
 horse cost 50 or 60, though some horses and hygeenes (riding camels)
 fetch as much as 300 or 400 dollars.
     The taxes then paid to the Egyptian Government were in tobs or
 grain, and the inhabitants were obliged to provide camels and oxen
 for transport, but for these they were paid at a fixed rate in tobs.
     Weights and Measures.           — The standard       measures are two sizes of
 wooden      vessels,    the largest     of which holds about          a  peck of grain    ;
the other is half this size.               Small adansonia         fruit-shells are also
used ; they vary in capacity.               Strangers who come to the country
to buy must use these measures.
     Damoor cloth is measured by the length of the arm, from the tip
of the middle finger to the elbow, or to the axilla.                   If the  whole arm
is used,      three    fingers'-breadth more cloth is added,               to make    this
measure double the length of the fore-arm and hand, which latter is
the    standard measure           for cloth.     Cloth   is    also   measured     on the
ground, either by placing one foot before                  the other or by strides.
When cutting out cloth             and   measuring its breadth, the span of the

 hand is used, from the        thumb to the end of           the middle finger,       but
people with large hands must use the span of the thumb and the
first finger.      Short distances     are measured     by strides, and long ones
by the sun and a day's journey.               Land  is not measured.           Weights
are    not   used.     Two    handful of dhurra          are     considered a meal
for one person, and this         quantity is supposed        to be contained by an
adansonia      fruit-shelL      Counting      is performed with         ease.    Tallies
are not used,       but for counting high numbers             beads    on a string or
marks on the        ground   are made use of.
    Communication. — The          roads    in the northern and north-eastern
parts   of Darfur are simply             paths which      lead through the open
country.      In the south, paths          between    villages are worn by use.
No roads are         made.      Very    deep   swamps    are sometimes        rendered
passable    by grass, stones,       and branches of trees sunk              into them.
The only bridges         that are formed are those made by felling trees
and placing       them   across   small deep rivers.          Ferries do not exist
Wells are kept       up in   the caravan     roads and in the north-east part of
Darfur    ; where water is very scarce, adansonia reservoirs are con
structed,    which    are filled by the neighbouring           villagers during the
rains,  the passing caravans        having to pay       a   tax for the water they
use.    The pack-saddles which            are used   for donkeys and oxen are
simply pads made of platted grass, and fastened                   round the animals
by a rope       or leathern thong.          The goods      are then slung on each
side of the     animal      The camel       and riding-saddles        are exactly    like
those used     by the Arabs.
    Pastoral Life. — The Fors          are  in no  sense nomadic, but reside in
settled    habitations.
    No store of hay or any other fodder for animals is kept for winter
use.     They are all fed on grass in the fields all the year round,
 whether    it is  green or dry.      Horses and he-goats           are allowed corn.
 In  colour the cows are either all black, all white,                white and black
 mixed, red and white, grey, grey and white, dark red, almost black.
 These and the grey variety are considered the best breeds.                      All  the
 cattle   have     beautiful   horns  ;  the bulls'   horns are generally much
  straighter than the cows' ;        if they grow      too long they are cut to
  prevent them       breaking off.       The cattle are not used          for draught
  purposes,   but they are ridden and employed                 as  beasts of burden.
  They are eaten as well as milked.

    The horses are white, grey, or dark brown.                Many of them           are
splendid creatures      ;  they are well-proportioned,        and have        perfect
action.     They are very well framed, and some of them are so swift
that they can run down an ostrich with            ease.    The people feed them
with    great care, as   if they  get too much corn they become ungovern
able.     The dark brown horses are nicknamed                " dongolwies           the
white and the grey are        called " kuruks."
    The sheep are large,       have   very short wool, and fine long tails.
The rams have long twisted horns.               The wool is only used to stuff
saddles.     Their milk is     used for food.
    The goats are very fine animals, with splendid horns                 ;  they are
black, white, grey, or black and white mixed.                Their milk      is used,
and considered the most nourishing               milk obtainable.       The       goat's
hair is not made          use  of, but the skins        of goats and sheep are
employed as mats, and also made into bags to carry water or babies
in.    Sometimes they are used as loin-clotha
    Camels are made to serve          as   baggage   and riding   animals       ;  they
are also eaten, and their        milk is   used.   They have only one hump               ;
some of them are very            vicious.    They cannot live in the south
western part of Darfur.           Their skins    are used   for  mats,   for    extem
pore beds, for sandals, and to make ropes.
    Two   breeds of dogs are found        in the country.     The best are fawn-
coloured, and have smooth skin, short hair, long legs, long curly
tails, and erect ears.       They are used for hunting and as watch-dogs.
They are much attached to their masters.                   Hydrophobia         is not
known.       The other is      a  mongrel breed,      miserable   curs,    white or
black and white       ; they act    as scavengers,    and serve no other useful
purpose.      There are cats similar to our own, but somewhat larger,
with long tails and long silky hair.
    Fowls are kept and eaten ; their           eggs are not often used as food,
but usually kept for hatching.            Cocks are sometimes      encouraged to
fight  ;  but  if this  becomes     known     to the dalimars the perpetrators
 of the cruelty are made to pay a fine in damoor cloth.                 Gelding is
 not practised.
    A  trade exists in horses, camels, cows, sheep, and goats.                Horses
and    hygeenes    are the most valuable.          There are no special cattle
 markets, but in the ordinary markets             a space   is set apart      for the
 cattle.    Donkeys     and horses     are trained by being made           to carry

heavy weights, stones,              or sand.       If a cow is wild     its legs are hobbled,
and      it is not milked for several days.
      An epidemic disease called rutpoia sometimes attacks the cattle                             ;
it     occurs       in the hot        season,      and    is   very   serious     and    usually
fataL         The animals         when       attacked     are   either     killed or at      once
isolated       ;  the only cure tried is smoking the animals.
      The bits, saddles,            and stirrups employed are               copied from       the
Arabs.           The cattle are guided by a nose-ring, to which                        a  line is
attached.            There are no            carts.      Horses    are    either   hobbled       or
picketed         by a rope tied round               their necks, and fastened to a stick
buried       in the ground or to            a stump.
      Butter is made as follows               : — The evening and morning milk                 are
mixed, and then set aside for an hour                        or two, after which the milk
 is shaken         in skins until the butter is formed.                 Butter-milk     is much
 preferred to fresh           milk.       Cheese      is made    in the following way          : —
 As soon as the            milk   becomes       sour and the curds form, it is strained
 through a          palm-leaf    sieve ; a     little salt is then     added,    and the curds
 are    tightly wrapped          in damoor cloth, upon which                   a heavy weight
  is placed.          This   cheese    does     not keep long, but the Fors prefer it
  mity.        Butter i3 often bought, but the                  cheese    is always made         at
  home,      the reason for this being that butter                 can    be washed, but not
  cheese.         The women make both butter and                   cheese, as also the beer.
  The cattle         are   milked before breakfast, after which the boys and
  girls drive        them to their       pastures,     from which they do not return            till
   about sunset         ; they are milked again in the evening.                Women usually
   milk the animals, but there is no reason why men should not do so
   if necessary.           Cows, sheep, and goats are herded together.                    During
   the dry season the men sometimes drive the cattle to a considerable
   distance, and stay away for several days at a time.                          When on      these
   expeditions         they do not use tents, but form            a  simple seriba, to which
   they return at          night  ;  they sleep on the ground on skins.
       All    the cattle     of the village        are herded      together.      Every family
    must send a boy or a             girl  to help to take care of them, or         if they have
    no children they must hire help.                 The children all unite       to protect the
    cattle, and       if  danger is apprehended men go with them to act as                          a
     guard    ;   this duty is performed            in regular rotation.         Wild animals
     rarely attack the         cattle in the daytime, and              if they should do          so
     they are usually scared away by the children                        shouting.      The boys

254                    Proceedings        of the  Boyal Society
are all armed with         spears     and bows and arrows,           which they know
well how to use effectively.              Most people       have   a   private shed for
their cattle, but in some villages there is            a   public seriba as welL
    All animals are killed by having their throats cut, except camels,
which are speared         in the neck.         Wood      alone   is used     as   fuel, the
dung being used for manure.                Animals are never branded or marked,
but are each known by name.
    Agriculture.  — The whole population                  are  agriculturists.         Each
member of      a family has       a   plot of land which they can call their own,
but notwithstanding            this division     the    land is cultivated           by the
whole family together.            After   the ground has been cleared            it is hoed
with iron     hoes      having      wooden handles.           Manure       is sometimes
mixed with the soil.            Sowing is performed at the beginning of the
rains.    The men make holes in the ground for the seed with stakes,
the women,      who carry the seed in small baskets                or adansonia fruit-
shells,  drop them in the holes, the children following and covering
them with earth.           A  great deal     of attention is paid to the growing
crops.    Children       watch them to scare             away the birds        ;   they are
carefully weeded, the weeds being collected into heaps and subse
quently used       as    manure.         Every   one helps at        the harvest; the
corn is reaped by small knives, and put into baskets which the reapers
carry with them       ;  it  is carried home        in   these  baskets      and stacked
near the house to dry.             When dry it       is spread      upon the ground,
which    has    been     beaten     hard for the purpose,          and     thrashed     and
winnowed by the women.                  The men measure the grain and store it
away in the granaries,              which     have    been     previously        described.
Wheat, tobacco, and onions require to be watered, and this is done
by irrigation.       Most of the fields are at some distance from                        the
village.    If  a man     wishes to enlarge        his possessions       he chooses any
uncultivated ground near            ;  he cuts down the shrubs, which he makes
use of to form a seriba          round the land, and generally pastures his
cattle there for the lirstyear.            Hedges are not built          as a   protection
from wind.       The Fors have no idea of leaving the ground fallow or
of improving it by         a  rotation of crops.
    Games    and Amusements. — One                of   the    most    favourite       games
played    by people        who      have    horses   very much          resembles      polo,
and is played       as    follows:— A flat field         is chosen     for the purpose,
and a large square         formed by       a ridge of earth.       At    each corner of

the square inside, a goal is placed,                          formed of two stones or posts.
Four companies             of horsemen are formed in equal number, and,                                          if
possible, the horses in each company are of the same colour.                                                  Each
man      is armed        with      a    long hooked stick, and two large balls are
used.         Two      men        throw      these       balls in the air three times,                         and
then throw          them in the direction of two companies                                   of horsemen,
who       try to       drive       them       back        through           the    lines of horsemen
defending        the    other goals.              The latter endeavour to prevent this,
and      at the same          time to drive the                    balls    through their              enemy's
goals.        Should      the      ball      be        thrown       outside       the     boundary,            the
horsemen        may not follow                   it,   but    it   is   thrown in again                 by the
umpires.         When both balls                   have       been      sent      through        a    goal,    the
game     is   finished and commences                     anew.          Much agility             is   displayed
by     both men        and      horses.          Sometimes several                villages combine to
get up    a    match, which            is   followed by            a   supper and       a   carouse.          The
game     is   called puknun.
  A      game called          dadarn         is    played by boys.                 A        large      heap     of
stones    is   divided equally amongst all the players, who sit in                                     a   circle.
They place the stones on the ground before                                     them, then throw one
into     the air,    pick up           another,        and catch        the falling          stone.         They
then     put one of the two stones in                        a    separate     place, and repeat the
manoeuvre       until all their             stones have been removed,                       or they fail to
catch one.          If they       have used all their stones, they are allowed to
help themselves          from their neighbour on the right hand, and then
from the       neighbour on the left until all are finished.                                If   a    boy loses
all his stones          three     times, he has to pay                  a   forfeit   ;   either he must
dance or       must pinch the tips of each of his fingers, or roar like                                         a
lion, or run     a     certain distance and back again.                            After this, all             the
other players          give him        a   few stones that he may commence again.
     Another      game for boys             is   played       as   follows:    —   A    large number of
holes are       made in the ground in                    a    circle, in the middle of which
there          large hole with four other holes round it.                                     The players
         is
         a
are    provided      with     a   number of small stones, and they move round
the outer      circle in turns, dropping                 a    stone into each hole, but taking
 one up       whenever an equal number                       is   found.       The boy who has the
 most     stones       then     puts them              into the hole in the centre                      of the
 ring, and      each     of the other players forfeits                       a    stone to him.               The
 four boys      who have the next largest number of stones place them

256                  Proceedings     of  the  Royal Society
in the four     holes   round the central one, and the best player                   gives
them each a stone.           Then the five        most     successful players          play
against each other until one remains victor.                  He  has to    stand up in
the middle and sing, turning round as              if on    a pivot, while the other
boys dance round the outer circle of holes.                     This  game      is called
 aringari.
     Hide and      seek is    played,    and     they call out        kee     lu.    It   is
 played by boys and girls            together.       Sometimes       two parties are
 formed, each having         a  piece of ground        marked off by a circle of
 stones.     The one party hides and the others look for them.                       When
 found, the hiders run back to try to get into their ground before the
 seekers    catch   them.     If  any are caught they go to the victors'
 party.
     Another    very favourite game is played as follows               : — Two parties
 are formed on either side of the village yard ; the leader on                    the   one
 side   has   a  short   stick, which      he   rubs backwards and               forwards
 between      his hands.      He   stands    a  short distance in front of his
                   out   " kiri kirine daw." One of the
 party calling                                                          opposite party
 then tries to catch the stick, running across the yard on his tip toes
 and    holding    his breath.       If   he succeeds in so doing, and says
  " Dang    doga pute kora kite
                                     "  without once taking his breath, he is
  at liberty to take back the stick to his own side, but                 if  he   fails  he
  is detained as a prisoner.          When     a    party has lost several           of its
  members     in this way, it cannot gain possession               of the stick until
  each of the prisoners have been redeemed by a successful                   run.    Then
  a run may be made for the stick, and            if it  is taken, the opposite side
  take their turn in running.          The opposing parties           do    all in their
  power to make the runners laugh,              so   as    to compel them          to take
  breath.      They    laugh, shout, cut capers,            and make sarcastic            or
  joking   remarks.      This  game is played by both boys and girls ; the
  girls are more successful in holding their breath than the boys.
     The most famous game among               the boys is that of mimic war
  fare.   The company separates into two armies; they then mark off
  a neutral zone, which        must be    so  broad     that the best throwers are
  not able to throw       a stone   across it.     The captains then order the
  opposing armies to retreat and gather stones; they then adTance on
  each other, singing and throwing stones as they go                  until they      reach
  their respective      boundaries, beyond which              they may not proceed

                          of Edinburgh,                Session 1884-85.                                      257
until the whole of their stones                          are     expended.           Then, at a given
signal, they charge each other                    with sticks, holding them                      as    if   they
were spears,          but they may not throw                         them.        Many of them fall
down as       if dead, and the arrangement                           is,   that the side on which
most     fall should be considered the                           bravest,        and that the others
should       then retreat, being pursued by the conquerors, who capture
a    number of prisoners.               These they bring back in triumph,                                   with
dancing and      singing, and forming circle around them they compel
                                                        a
them to      dance for the amusement of their conquerors. Then they
chase    them and let them go.
     Another      mimic war            is   carried on in the water.                       The         players
divide into two parties and swim against                               each other, trying to drive
their opponents out of the water.                            Those who are driven out arm
themselves        with    grass     and mud, which                       they throw against                 their
adversaries      in the    water.          These dive to get out of the way, and at
the    same      time try      to prevent           their enemies             regaining the water.
When both          sides are tired, two captains are chosen                                     to end       the
play by       single     combat.           If    one      of these          is    driven    out of the
water, or beyond          a    certain point, the other remains victor                            ;    should
neither      succeed in expelling his opponent, the game                                   is   considered
drawn.
     Sometimes the boys make an artificial ostrich.                                  A     long stick          is
fastened      to their backs, having                   a    cross      stick fastened           just    above
their    heads    ;    upon     this       framework             a   piece        of damoor       cloth        is
arranged, and this represents                    the bird, which             is   then hunted by the
other boys and girls.
     They also make artificial                   ghosts     in   a     similar way.             Two sticks
are tied to      the boy's arm, over which                   a   damoor cloth         is   placed      ;    this
he    holds over his head, and bends about in all manner of directions.
By the light of the fire this has                      a    very grotesque           appearance,             and
spreads      consternation among the children.
      Another game        is   played       as   follows    :    —   A   row of boys and girls sit
with their       legs stretched out, while another boy, beginning at one
end     of the line, repeats           a    sentence, singing              one word        for    each leg
that    he    passes.     When         he        comes      to    the end of his sentence,                    he
touches      a   leg, whose owner must draw                       it   up;       he goes on      until       one
of    the players has both legs drawn up, and the                                 latter must then go
away     and hide.       The    sentence          is   then repeated, until all the children

258                              Proceedings         of the Royal Society
save one have gone to hide, when the last boy left must go and                                                try
to find them.                    The boy who touched                the legs has to remain                  as    a
" touch       post
                        "
                            on the ground, to which each child that is found runs,
but    if caught by               the seeker         before    touching him, he has to aid                       in
finding his companions.                        One of the sentences which they sing is as
follows : — " Kamal dolge-jam kune-bort-plo diu-tier tilgam."
   The For children have a good many more games of this descrip
tion, including              a   tug of war and leap frog.
      Medicine.        — When ill          the Fors are             fairly well looked after, and
some of the old women are considered                                 to   be good       nurses,    and are
often sent for in illness.                     Except in cases of small-pox, the patients
are treated            in   the ordinary huts.              At     times, however, they           partition
off   a part       of the hut for the patient's separate use.
      Although          a good deal        of belief exists in the power of charms and
amulets,       the Fors have also a very decided                           knowledge of the medi
cinal properties             of many barks, roots, and leaves.                   They are gathered
and stored in horns or jars, and decoctions                               are made from them when
required.              Some       books exist        as to     the method      of employing                 these
drugs, and             the way in which they are to be prepared and partaken
of is definitely laid down.                       Most of          them are given in a decoction,
but some roots are chewed.
      Phthisis         is well known.             It occurs chiefly among the inhabitants
of the Marah mountains.                          It is called korlo-koro, and many people
die from it.                Headache is treated by allowing butter to run into the
nostrils, the patient being placed in                          a   recumbent position.            It       is said
to "grease the brain."                     I   have noticed this custom among the                          Arabs
too, so       it   may have          been introduced                by them.    Toothache is very
rare, and          I    never saw caries in Darfur, although                        I   must note that
my boy has had three teeth affected by it since his stay in England.
Pains are treated                  by rubbing or by cupping                  if very         severe    ;    small
iron knives and cows' horns are used in the operation.                                         Ague is not
very common,                 and occurs mostly in hunters who have crossed                                    the
Bahr-el-Arab                in search of game.                It   is treated by decoctions                made
from roots, which act                 as   very powerful diaphoretics.                   Sometimes the
attacks       are very severe,                 and    the     people      seem to       be    afraid of          it.
Guinea worm                 is   also very frequently met with in hunters who have
been     in   the Darfertit district.                   The tumour caused by the worm                            is
poulticed with leaves soaked                          in water, and tied over the part by                        a

                           of Edinburgh,            Session 1884-85.                               259
 damoor rag.           As   soon as the worm makes its appearance,                       it   is care
fully drawn out and wound round                         a stick,   a little    each day.
     All  fevers are treated by heat.                   Large fires are made in the huts
near to the patient's bed, who either rubs himself with castor oil, or
is rubbed and            kneaded well by his friends.                     Warm       decoctions      of
leaves are given him to               drink.
    There is one drug celebrated                     far and near.          It  is said    to make
women sterile, and             in   men    it   causes the testicles         to atrophy.          It  is
often given out          of   spite.      I   saw two men— one about 40, the other
an Arab about            25 — who said they had had                    this drug given them,
and certainly         their    testicles      were     very small      ;   but   I  confess     I  was
dubious,      though most strongly assured of the power of the drug. An
antidote     is known by a very few of the magicians, and is very dear.
Syphilis is treated by a decoction made of twelve parts of                                a root to
 one   of pepper, and boiled over the fire for about six hours, water
being added occasionally.                    A small gourdful            is taken twice a day,
 and the patient          may eat nothing             salt or sour for six days, and must
 drink   as    little fluid     as possible       ;  then for six days he must eat only
 bread,    and perhaps         a   little fowl, but no salt          ;   for the next week           he
 may eat a       little   meat, and then return to ordinary diet.                       The medi
 cine is     taken for twenty             days.        Slatin     Bey told me he had seen
 twenty or thirty cases thus treated and cured                     (1).    I saw a good      number
 of people suffering from secondary                    and tertiary symptoms.              Necrosis
  of the   skull     bones is apparently common.                    The people say that this
 disease    was introduced by the Arabs from the north many years ago.
  Persons afflicted         by it do not try to communicate it with the hope
  of  curing themselves, as is the case in some neighbouring districts,
  Kordofan         for    instance.       Inoculation          is not      practised.      A     pecu
  liarly virulent form of gonorrhoea,                    accompanied         by cystitis, is very
  common ; the          Fors are very noted for this disease.                         Leprosy and
  elephantiasis        are   far from uncommon               ;   the   former is said           to   be
   hereditary.        Ulcers of the leg are not so general in Darfur                      as among
   the tribes    farther south.          Ophthalmia is very rife, but is invariably
   cured  by the application of             a  lotion made from the root of                a   shrub.
   Epilepsy is frequent          ;  girls are more prone to it than boys, in whom
   it is rare.      It  is thought to be caused by the afflicted                      person      com
   mitting   some     fault,   such as pilfering food, or going into a hut which
   is under     the protection          of the Zittan (see above),                 or committing

  260                    Proceedings       of  the  Royal Society
  some offence under a tree          in which     a  Zittan is thought to live.           The
 aura    is   said   to   be a peculiar       smell which        they attribute        to the
  Zittans, and which           is  usually smelt under           trees     where they are
 supposed       to reside.    When girls suffer from this            disease, they     hardly
 ever find husbands, and            in consequence         lead    immoral lives.         The
 priests try to cure them with charms                   and amulets.           The internal
 medicine which alone is used for epilepsy is                  as   follows    : — A puggee
 writes    a  few prayers       upon    a board,    the  writing       is then    washed    off
 with   water,     which is then drunk by the patient.                   Epileptics are not
 systematically ill-treated, but their fathers cannot be said to have
 much affection        for them,    as  they cannot expect any dowry for them.
 Although        I made     many inquiries       on the subject, no single case              of
idiocy     or mania came          under my notice,         and    the     people    said that
 they were very rare.             Small pox is very common.                    Persons who
 suffer   from this disease are kept strictly isolated               ;   an old woman        is
 deputed       to nurse     them.     She gives       a  diet of porridge and milk,
 keeps     the hut very warm,         pricks    the   pustules      as    soon   as  they are
 well formed with         a  thorn, and anoints the patient's body with castor
 oil.
     Wounds heal very rapidly            ;  they are dressed with a pulp made
 from various roots and barks.               Arms are sometimes              amputated for
 disease,     but the legs never.           The Fors also remove               parts of the
 tongue     affected    by epithelioma.         Splints    well padded with cotton
 wool and fastened           by strips of damoor          cloth are used for broken
bones.       A few of    the magicians are very celebrated for their dexterity
in removing cataracts           ; they travel round the country, and enjoy                   a
 wide reputation, and for successful             operations      receive very consider
able remuneration.            Deformities are very rarely seen.
    I  never saw      an albino.        They are said to be very exceptional.
They are called abortions,           as the people      believe    that they were born
before their time.           They are mostly beggars, and much despised,                    as
they are said to be very cowardly, silly, and cry whenever they                           are
pinched.         They are also said to have little power of smell.
  -X^abour,     — As     before    mentioned, married women have                     huts of
their own, and        as a   husband does not live with his wife during                   the
later months of pregnancy,             she has only to send            her children away
to her friends        to be free from observation.                A    few of her female
friends attend her during               delivery.       A group of         women      usually

                       of Edinburgh, Session 1884^85.                             2G1
stand outside the enclosure        uttering cries to encourage           her, but all
men are kept at a distance, and           it is considered very        bad   manners
for   a man    or lad to go near a compound in which a woman is in
labour ; the woman either leans against a             wall of   the hut     with   feet
apart or    in rare   cases supports herself from a rope           attached    to the
rafter.     Her friends meanwhile         keep     up the fire, supply her with
beer, and     from time to time rub her abdomen,             and    as   the  child is
born they receive       it and cut    the cord    with   a knife (rarely, a sharp
stone).      The cord is never     tied, and   if it  bleeds  it  is held between
the teeth.       Cases of difficult    labour appear      to be rare, and no         in
 quiries could    elicit any information of      measures taken to aid delivery.
 Should    it  be impossible,    the woman and child           die, for abdominal
 section is not practised either before or after the death of the woman.
 The child      is washed after birth and rubbed with oil, and then
 wrapped in damoor cloth.          The woman does not bathe but is washed,
 and she    then lies down near the fire       ;  the child is put to the breast
 as  soon as the mother has been made             comfortable.       The woman is
 perfectly secluded for a week after the           birth of  the child.
     For  some days before a woman expects               her labour she abstains
 from    meat, and      during   the week     afterwards she is fed on thin
 porridge, and eats no meat         until the   feast is celebrated     at which the
  child receives     its name.     No superstitious       practices    take place at
 the   birth of a child.
     Ironwork.    — Brown    haematite iron is to be found         in   great  abund
  ance,   and used to a large extent, but no flux is employed.                     The
  smelting furnaces are about 6 feet high ; they are conical, and have
  at the   bottom a number of holes to which the draught from the
  bellows is led through       clay pipes.      The bellows are made of clay
  pots covered     with soft skins into which        a  hollow stick is fastened.
  Each man works two of them, one             with   each hand.       The ironstone
  is broken up into fragments about as large as walnuts, and these are
   placed  in the furnace with charcoal in alternate layers.               The iron is
   purified and shaped by long-continued hammering ; stone hammers
   and  anvils are alone used.       The work turned out is of            a very good
   quality.
       Basketvork.  — Various kinds of       baskets     are made, some of open
    wickerwork     but others so closely woven as to hold water.                    The
    shapes are oval    and round   ; some are made        with lids.      The bottom

262                   Proceedings       of   the  Royal Society
of the basket, which is always flat, is first made and the sides are
worked up from it.           Dhurra      stalks, palm leaves, and the            bark of
trees are used for basket making.               The baskets       are never     painted       ;
they vary in colour according to the kind of material used.                          Good
and pliant mats are also made, and                 some of the patterns are very
nice.     Trays and open baskets            are constructed for food,          and it is
protected     by ornamented        covers     of tasteful and fanciful patterns,
and invariably      round.
    Tanning. — As      soon as animals have          been skinned, the         skins     are
scraped and then put into water in which okun (the bark                       of   a tree)
has been      mixed.      After   several     days   they are taken out, scraped
again with iron knives, and afterwards pegged out under the shade of
a tree or   under    a shed made      for the purpose        ;  they are then rubbed
and beaten with flat stones.        At   times they are also rubbed         with butter.
    Pottery.— The jars and pots constructed by the Fors are of fairly
good quality.       They are chiefly made by the women, and no potters'
wheel is used.        After  the clay has been freed from stones and lumps
it  is beaten with heavy stones, and water is added                   to bring    it to    a
proper consistence.          A   ball    of this     dough is then made,             large
 enough    to form the bottom         of   a  jar, which is then moulded by                a
series of     stone    or  solid   clay-blocks       being pressed       into    the soft
clay   ; rings of clay are then added to form the sides of the                   jar   and
it  is smoothed     by the hands.         Sometimes they ornament the pots                  ;
 plait, cross lines, and herring bone patterns are alone used, and                      are
 formed    by a sharp-pointed stick.
     The pottery is burnt in       a large     hole dug in the ground in which
 the pots are placed, and which is then covered                   by   a framework       of
 wood strewn with earth.           Over this       a large   fire  is made and kept
 up for   a day or two.       Small images of men and cattle               are made      in
clay as toys.
     Dyeing. — I was unable to gain any information on this point, but
 I know that red, black, blue, and dirty green dyes are made.                         The
 black is called dego and is procured             from the bark of         a tree named
 pedan.      The red is known       as  pucki from       a  plant called kluiu.
     Music — The Fors         are very       fond    of music,      and    have    several
 musical instruments, which they play with more or less proficiency.
 They have drums of various sizes — some so large                    as to  form   a good
 load for a man, others of smaller calibre.                Each village has      a collec

                              of Edlnl/urijh, Session 1884-85.                                         203
tioo of drams            in   common,         apart from those possessed by individuals.
The drams, which are broader at one end than the other, are made
of hard        wood, hollowed               out by knives.              They are covered          at the
ends by parchment,                   and the two coverings are laced together by
thongs,     which           can     be tightened at             will.     They are      played with
sticks and fingers.
  There are           two varieties of           flutes, made from reeds or hard wood.
One    kind is blown from the                   side, and has six notes, producing low
tones;      it is about 18 to 20 inches long.                            The other flute is much
larger ; a plug is placed at one end, leaving only a small aperture,
through        which the instrument                   is blown.          The flutes are held       as   in
Europe.
  Trumpets are made from                          the     horns of bulls, sheep, goats, and
antelopes, and             from elephant's            tusks.      Signals are sometimes given
by them,    but mostly by drums.                           There are two kinds of harps.
One    shaped somewhat like a lyre                      ; the     half of    a large gourd       is taken
and two        holes made in            it,   into which are fitted two upright sticks,
which diverge            a    little from       each other.             They are united near the
top    by   a       cross      bar, from which six strings made of sinews                               are
carried down,              and passed through small holes made in the gourd,
on the      inside of which                 they are fastened            to small pieces of wood.
The gourd           is   then covered            by   a   skin.       This harp    is   rested    on the
knee     and played                with both     hands.          The other one       is   much larger
and heavier,          and rests upon the ground when played on.                              It   is   con
structed       like    a    mandolin          and has twelve strings, all of which are
 made     of the sinews               of animals.          Another        kind of musical instru
 ment     is   a   small bow, strung with horse-hair                     ;   one end of this bow         is
 placed     in the mouth against the teeth, and the music                            is   produced by
 striking the hair with                 a     switch.          Gourds filled with small stones
 are used as        rattles.         Bells are made, the clappers of which are con
 tinuous        with the handle                 and     do not move,           but the bells strike
 against       them.     I      will mention          one more instrument            resembling our
 hurdy-gurdy.                 An   elongated     drum has         a   large number of holes bored
  in   its side,       through which             pointed sticks of varying lengths are
  driven.       A     crooked stick passes through the centre of the drum, and
  when      turned         it      causes     the pointed          sticks to vibrate, producing
  strains      of   music marvellous.             The only real orchestras                to be found
  in   Darfur       are those composed            of flutes, rattles, and sometimes small

264                               Proceedings             of   the   Royal Society
drums, which discourse                          really harmonious melodies.                               There are no
professional musicians, although they have some women who make
a livelihood            by singing and dancing.                         They attend feasts, marriages,
&c.         The For           songs are very numerous, and are usually                                                  accom
panied by music.                        Solo songs are sung, and songs                             in chorus        ;    some
times       both are combined.                        The Fors can apparently pick up very
readily foreign airs, and are not slow in learning to play European
instruments.              I       often heard the Dara band perform, and although
they had only been                       a    very short time under instruction                                  their per
formances          were highly creditable.
      Writing.     — The only writing in Darfur is in                                        the       Arabic character.
Few       people use              it,   but   it    must have been introduced centuries ago,
as    all   the books of                For law, and           those    giving instruction in the pre
paration of drugs and charms, are written in the For language in
Arabic          characters.             I      was        unable to obtain any specimen                                  of   it,
much as         I   tried to do               so.    The art of drawing                      is   unknown.
      Astronomy. — The Fors' knowledge of astronomy                                                        is    very rudi-
mental.           The months                   are lunar, but               there    are no ceremonies con
nected          with      seeing          the new moon for the first time.                                       The day        is
divided by the heights of the sun.                                      They have names for only                                a
very few stars.
      Arithmetic.         — The Fors count                      as far as           hundreds, but have no
word for          a     thousand.              They use strings of beads for counting,                                          as
 also small stones.                      As far      as        could make out, fingers and toes are
 not used for              the          purpose.
                                                      I I       inquired         particularly                 about       this.
 The        Arabic        notation             is    in    vogue       amongst           the educated                   people.
 They are only capable of making the simplest calculations, and this
is    done mentally.

2.    On Bisulphide of Carbon Prisms.             By Dr Daniel Draper.

   C.  Piazzi Smyth,
        Astronomer Royal of Scotland.
   Dear Sir, — I take       pleasure in answering your kind     note   of May
9th, in regard to the experiments made by my brother               Dr Henry
Draper, on bisulphide of carbon prisms.
   In this letter   I  shall only refer to those portions of my brother's
experiments, which did not appear in sufficient detail in the paper
published in the American Journal          of Science, by Professor George
F. Barker of    the   University of Pennsylvania.
   My brother     was led to perform these experiments       with bisulphide
of carbon prisms, with the stirrer, and uniform temperature bar, on
account of the trouble he had experienced while working upon
" Oxygen in the Sun " in his old laboratory, in getting coincidences
between    the solar spectrum, and the spectra        of various other sub
stances with the electric spark.        He found that   sometimes    the lines
of the overlapping spectra        would coincide, and at other times there
would be discrepancies,       although the experiments appeared to have
been made     in exactly the    same manner each time.
   On continuing these experiments on oxygen in his new laboratory
he found that the discrepancies were            much greater     than before.
This led him     to suspect     that the lack of coincidence was due to
temperature.
   At about this time Mr Lewis M Rutherfurd told my brother of
his experience, in shaking the bisulphide of carbon prisms just before
using them, and the surprising results they gave, and also the short
time of their continuance to give good results.
   My brother and I, in talking this subject over, decided to            see if
some    simple plan could not be devised to keep the fluid in the
prism continually       stirred, or shaken by some small steady motor
power.     To   try this     device  brother  Henry borrowed from          our
brother-in-law,    Dr Mytton Maury, his Edison electric           pen,  which
consists of a very small magneto-electric engine,          mounted on the
upper end of a (stylus) or light tube, through which a needle point

is caused          to move          very rapidly up and down, and having power
enough          to prick      holes in this legal cap paper.                          On attaching           a   pro
peller or stirrer to               it,   it   was found that there was sufficient power to
keep the propeller                 in motion, and obtain                   the results       that are men
tioned in Professor Barker's paper.
    To prevent the             dangerous             escape of the bisulphide of carbon vapour
from the prism, which you justly fear,                                a   mercurial stuffing box was
employed.            ....          In     the      neck of the            bisulphide        prism bottle,              a
little below the upper                        edge,    is   a   cork, that has through its centre
a   small glass tube               ;   through this passes             a   steel wire or shaft having
attached to its lower end the propeller, half an inch in diameter.
On the upper end of the shaft                           is   fastened      a   small glass cap with its
opening downwards, so as to dip below the surface of the mercury,
in the upper portion                          of the neck of the bottle above the cork.
On the top of this cap                        is   fastened     a    pulley to receive            motion from
the Edison electric motor (just described) by means                                          of    a    thread or
 small belt.             It   was found that, even when the propeller was caused
 to revolve very fast, there was not the slightest leakage of the vapour
 of the bisulphide of carbon
         The controlling of the temperature                           inside of the prism box                    is   ac
 complished by the use of two thermostat                                  bars that were made under
    my direction for brother Henry.                             They are on the same principle                         as
    those that    I      invented many years ago for the taking of observations
    on temperature            at the New York Observatory.                              Each bar consists
    of   a   strip of vulcanite           a    foot long, one inch wide, and                      -fa   of an inch
    thick, riveted to          a   similar strip of brass only                             of an inch thick.
    The rivets are in two rows set one inch apart.                                    One end of the bar
    is   fastened firmly to              a    block, while the other end                    is    free to move
    with the changes               of temperature.                  The vulcanite          expanding more
    than the brass, causes the thermostat bar to bend towards the brass
    side, on an increase               of temperature           ;   but   ifit   falls, the bar bends the
    reverse       way.        On   the loose          end of the bar             is   an    adjusting screw
    (with     a   platinum point for electric contacts),                          so that        it     can be set
    for any temperature.                      We     used two of these bars so as to have very
    quick action.             If   there        is   the slightest        fall of temperature                in       the
    prism box, the platinum points of the bars come in contact,                                            causing
    the current          of the battery to pass through the electro-magnet,                                       and
    open the valve            of the gas lamp to give more heat in the metal pipe

of the prism box.                   If   it    becomes too warm         in    the box, the            reverse
action takes place              ;   the current is broken, and the heat is shut                            off.
     Just    before my brother's death,                    it   was decided         to make         a slight
change in the heating part of the apparatus,                                because on one occasion,
as we were        watching               it,   we   found that the sudden                 action of the
electro-magnet             on the valve of the gas lamp             in shutting off the heat
had caused the              light        to become       extinguished.   On the cooling of
the inside of the                   box the electro-magnet              opened          the    valve, and
allowed the gas to escape into the room, making                                    it   very dangerous.
It   was then decided to change this portion of the apparatus.                                        It    was
thought that          it    would be safer to have the electro-magnet                               control       a
damper in the hot air pipe, than the lever of the gas lamp
It   was also decided                    to have     the hot       air pipe in the prism box
make        several        turns around its inside,               so   as    to dispense        with        the
double box and cotton filling, and have                            a   more even distribution                 of
heat throughout the box.
     What you         so    kindly         say of my brother's early death                    is   too pain
fully    true.        It   awakens reminiscences                  that cannot,          and should not
be   forgotten.            If   some twenty years ago you could have looked into
the laboratory at Hastings, you would have witnessed the interesting
sight of my father John William Draper, and his three sons all dis
cussing      together        the best plan to be followed in the building of my
brother Henry's observatory, and then after its construction father
would often leave his work on the Intellectual Development of Europe,
and go to the observatory to deliberate what observations should be
made,       and   how they should be carried on,                               Father         was    a   born
astronomer,       scientist, and historian.                      When only eight years                of   age
he attempted           to make           a     Gregorian telescope          like   the one he saw his
father using.
     But how      strange           is   death.      Brother Henry, in the prime of life,
followed father to the grave in ten short months. —                                I     am, very truly
yours,                                                                             Daniel Dkaper.

            ALB.         Communicated by Professor Turner.
      In    entering     upon the consideration of a subject so important,
 one cannot        but feel surprised at the very general               obscurity which
 envelops a question upon which                so large a mass         of accurate detail
 has been        collected.      In looking for the      cause of this unsatisfactory
state      of affairs,    it would     appear to be due to      a    lack of appreciation
by one set of workers, of the methods pursued by another, and this
in two directions.             In   the first place, the student of normal cell          life
relegates        aberrant vital processes           entirely to the domain of pure
pathology ;        whilst     the    pathologist, relying mainly         on organs      as a
whole for his views on                 function, normal and abnormal, is apt to
ignore the         value of the study of the cell processes as carried on
under normal             conditions.      How without the aid of            such study are
we to       explain inherited variability in cells'?                How without its aid
can we        interpret     aright the numerous processes which, minute or
almost imperceptible                in the unit, in     the aggregate,        constitute a
disease f        Conversely,        how is the student of cell life to make a
complete analysis of normal vital phenomena                     if   he fails to contem
plate      the   striking     analogies    presented    in morbid conditions?            Mr
Geddes, in a paper on the cell theory, read before                       this Society in
1883,      attempted to remove this reproach on the one hand, whilst
on the      other there are already signs of a growing recognition among
pathologists       of the claims upon their attention of              those fundamental
vital      phenomena         of cells so fully         expounded       by    Goodsir    and
Virchow.
   For our present purposes it               will   be necessary to quote merely a
definition       of pathological          changes    in cells   as    "those    variations
which happen not to be conducive to success in the struggle for
existence."        Taking the theory that
                                             " variation and disease in the
cell are     closely allied," to start from, it will be curious to observe
how the cycle            in cell life, or parts of      it,   may be traced      in    those
processes which            are   initiated   through     the action upon them             of
micro-organisms.
      That such    a     " variation"     theory of disease     is   now largely held     is

 270                   Proceedings       of the   Royal Society
 evidenced      by the     definitions     quoted in our paper,           as given      by
various modern pathologists.
    These may        be shortly     summed       up in such      a phrase     as    "vital
processes under abnormal external conditions."
    In  the    present    paper     are   considered     those    external     abnormal
conditions supplied by the presence of micro-organisms.
    The subject must be approached             from two points of view — (1)           the
nature and function of the altering agent, represented                   by the micro
 organisms   ;    and (2) the nature of the alterations and reactions                   set
 up in the elements acted upon, represented                by the tissue changes.
    It has now been proved experimentally that micro-organisms act
upon complex nitrogenous bodies,              as do several     classes higher in the
organic scale, e.g., animals and insectivorous plants, by                     a   process
very nearly allied to true digestion.               Their function from         a chemi
cal point of view, as Frankland                and others      have   pointed out,       is
analytical and not synthetical, and by this difference                     they are at
once widely        separated    from the majority          of the more specialised
members     of the vegetable kingdom.
    In  carrying      on  their    analytical     functions     the   same     sequence
occurs   as  in the      digestion of albuminoid            matters    in   the   animal
digestive apparatus,        and experiment shows that their action upon
an insoluble       albumen, such        as  fibrin, produces       a soluble globulin
and other bye-products             identical    with    those    evolved in       tryptic
digestion.       Further,    Pasteur has       recently expressed         the   opinion,
basing his view         on numerous        analogies,    that perfect digestion in
animals cannot take place without the presence of micro-organisms;
and Duclaux         states that the process        of caseation in tubercle is        due
to, or at least advances       pari   passu with, the production of a ferment
which    acts     upon milk in        the    same    way    as  pancreatic juice        or
trypsin.    We may consider            then, that it is after      the   production of
these ferments,       and   after   they have      exerted    their digestive action
upon the       tissues, that     micro organisms       can     obtain food material
in an assimilable form, which they can utilise in their growth                        and
development.
    The same soluble products of the ordinary                 processes of digestion
are equally well adapted for the nutrition of the animal.                    Digestion,
then, from this point of view, is a process of fermentation, in which
the ferment-producers do not utilise the whole of the material                         on

                           of Edinburgh, Session 1884-85.                               271
   which they act, but set free             a  very large proportion of elaborated
   food material       which may be applied to the use of the organisation
  in which the process is carrried on.               It  would appear that this same
  law governs the processes              set up by micro-organisms          in the tissues
  of their host      in   several    of the specific infective diseases, and that
  the  products of the fermentation set up, are applied, at least in part,
  to the nutritive       purposes      of the organisms themselves,          and, in part,
  to prepare      living or only partially           devitalised     tissues   for further
  assimilative     processes      on the part of these micro-organisms.                 But
  beyond this,      in  some cases, a product is elaborated          which, acting as an
  antiseptic,    destroys the vitality of the organism which produced it.
     The     existence        of   these     special   products      is   now     generally
  acknowledged.            They     are   not necessarily      accompanied        in their
  distribution by the organism which produced them on account of
  their greater diffusibility.            The organism will, however, usually be
 found at some point whence absorption of its products might occur.
 In   those cases where          it  is not found in such a position, and where
 typical traces of its action may be met with, we have abundant
 evidence that, owing to the exhaustion of the material necessary                        for
 its nutrition,      it  has ceased to exist, but its progeny have                migrated
 to,   and are found           in, the less     altered   tissues    in the immediate
 neighbourhood, prepared               for their reception by the products of the
primary fermentative process.
     Up to this point         the paper deals     with the subject of the        organised
irritant agent       ;  we must next turn to the reactions brought about                  in
the cell elements of the invaded tissues, and we shall find that these
reactionary changes             have a definite relation         to the nature of the
irritant     and     the conditions         under    which    it   is applied.      Under
normal and constant conditions we might anticipate that the cells
of any part of one of the higher organisms would                          continue to be
reproduced at a fixed rate, to perform their function and die, a
regular     proportion        of young, functionally         active and dying cells,
being      maintained        throughout.        We    know,    however, that such          a
 cycle,   if left alone     goes on for a certain period only, and that there
 comes a time at which the reproduction is not equal to the removal,
 and that consequently organic death                   takes   place,    and the species
  dies out    if the process is not again commenced                  ab ovo.     But  there
  are   conditions in which the regular cycle is interfered with.                       The

272                     Proceedings      of the Royal Society
external conditions or moulding forces may be so altered                         that    the
reaction of the tissue to these forces manifests itself in a form which
varies somewhat         from that observed under normal conditions.
    The constant presence of micro-organisms                 upon the free surfaces,
and    within    the cavities    of the body, gives rise to the question, Why
are they not normally present               in the tissues    1    Here we may adopt
Lister's theory of standard vitality, based on the absence of micro
organisms       from the healthy urethra and from                a  wound healing by
first intention.          Unless this standard vitality of cell elements                  be
in some way impaired, all the conditions are unfavourable to the
growth of micro-organisms.               The circumstances          in which we        have
depression       of tissue vitality include, in addition to general                 organic
depressants,       such    structural features      as   the formation        of cavities,
pouches,       and    wounds,      in which      there    may    be    accumulation        of
 secretions     or other effete products,            the   structure, function,          and
arrangement         of the epithelium covering           a free surface,     the   position
 of the surface       and     its relations, first,    to the external world,           and
 second,     to   the    deeper    tissues,   especially to the          lymphatics,     the
 number, size, and relation of these lymphatics, the tissues in which
 they occur, and the relations of the lymphatics to the small veins.
 Several    instances might be quoted from the paper in illustration                       of
 the bearing      of these several factors on the invasion of the tissues by
 micro-organisms.           According to certain differences             in the character
 and distribution        of these invasions, it is possible to form               a general
 classification of the action of the organisms which give rise to them.
    (1)   This   action maybe purely local, and accurately                 confined to   one
 area, beyond which neither the micro-organisms                      nor their products
 have any effect.         (2) There may be a purely local action               in  the first
 instance,    but this localisation is only temporary.                The invasion      goes
 on    in  stages,     point     after   point    being     attacked.         The    spores
 developed      at one point are transported           to others, and so the process
 goes on intermittently,          as  in actinomycosis.         (3) The organism        may
 be limited       to a definite tract,        but its products may be diffused
 throughout the whole of the invaded organisation,                    as  in certain   cases
 of septicaemia.        (4) There is no limitation to the sphere of activity
 of the micro-organism, which, with its irritant products may pene
 trate to all parts of the tissues, and so give rise to a general disease,
 as  in  the case of the organisms          which give rise to the specific fevers.

In all      these cases        several      factors    must be taken into account             in
considering        the changes           which        result from the presence,           during
their life history,           of micro-organisms in the            tissues.     They may act
(a) merely as mechanical irritants, as do particles of coal or stone in
coal    miner's or stone mason's lung.                     (6)   By the evolution of          an
irritant digestive            product or "ptomaine," which may act generally
or locally,     (c) In the third place, it may be suggested that in certain
cases    there is, in addition to the preceding factors, a subtle physico-
chemical or molecular               reaction between the micro-organisms and the
cells, which       may give rise to changes, local or general,                      and which
might be compared to the action of the sperm cell on the germ cell
or ovum.          It   is in connection with            these points, and with regard to
the varied        degrees      in which       the infective      process   occurs   in various
species    of parasitic           organisms,    that we wish specially to speak, for
recent work            of numerous observers             upon these        questions appears
capable     of throwing           a clearer    light upon the matter than has pre
viously been the case.
   The five following types                    of tissue    reaction may be          taken    as
illustrative of the principal pathological processes of micro-organismal
origin. (1) Septicaemia, in which there is an absorption of septic
products from an external or localised internal source, but no
absorption        of    the organisms         which give rise to them.            Diffusion of
products.         (2) Specific infective fevers.  No localised source after
period      of    incubation.    General diffusion of both organisms and
products.    (3) Abscess formation. Micro-organisms in area strictly
 localised by "pyogenic membrane."     Rapid death of that area.
  (4)   Tubercle.        Micro-organisms localised.               Slower death      and   casea
 tion of area      in which they          occur.       Slight tendency        to fibrous tissue
 formation.            (5)   Actinomycosis.            Localisation    of micro-organism.
 Little tendency to death of proliferated cells.                      Greater tendency to
 fibrous    tissue formation.
    Without        attempting to enter fully into the description of the
 process     involved         in tissue     reaction in each of the classes above
 named, we        may briefly summarise                the many features, and illustrate
 them      by one or two examples.                 Amongst the chief forms in which
 cell   activity exhibits           itself during various stages of the life cycle,
 are,   according       to   Mr   (1) the amoeboid stage, where nutritive
                                  Geddes,
 activity    is   well marked, but where formative activity      not yet            is

274                     Proceedings     of   the  Royal Society
distinctly     manifested.       (2) The plasmodial stage, where there u
excessive      nutrition    or excessive stimulation, and where there if
latent formative tendency,          which comes into play on the removal of
excessive     stimulation.      (3) The encysted stage, where the formative
activity is a more prominent feature than the nutritive.                     In normal
tissues under normal conditions, the metabolic processes balance one
another.       Under the influence of irritation,             this balance       is lost    ;
there is      first, excessive     nutritive      activity,  corresponding         to the
amoeboid stage,        in which   the process of aggregation          is well marked,
 as  instanced by cloudy swelling of the cells of various organs during
 the early     stages of specific infective          fevers.     If  the   irritation     is
 continued, this is followed by greatly increased                  nutritive activity,
 or rather digestive power,         which is found in the plasmodial stage.
 In both    these   forms, if the irritant be     excessive, complete aggregation,
followed by disintegration,           takes    place ; while,   if irritation     be not
 excessive,     formative     activity     is evolved, and we           have    a   tissue
 formation corresponding to the encysted stage of the cell                        In our
 paper we have attempted          to illustrate these processes by a description
 of the phenomena observed              on a septic granulating          surface,   in  an
 abscess, in actinomycosis, and           in  tubercle.
     From Marshall Ward's recent              researches    on the mode of repro
 duction in certain cellular organisms,              it  appears    that it is possible
 for  a parasitic fungus to reproduce its like without the direct aid of
 a sexual process, the necessary stimulus to multiplication                   being sup
 plied by the highly organised proteids, derived from the tissues of
 its host, which in their turn are also stimulated into proliferation.
  Applying this      to the case   of cells in    an animal,   it would     appear that
 the stimulus applied by the presence                 of micro-organisms,        or their
 chemical products, acts in a manner comparable                  to the action of the
 male element upon the ovum in setting up segmentation.                          There is
 thus a reappearance         of excessive      reproductive activity without the
  process being re-initiated ab          ovo.    Cell proliferation may be set up
 by effete products or other chemical irritants, or even by mechanical
 irritants,   as  pointed out by Charles and lyrancis              Darwin in connec
 tion with their researches on insectivorous plants, and the results,
 ihougn varying greatly in degree, are absolutely one in kind.                      Apply
 any irritant to      a surface,  or a tissue, and the result is a tendency              to
 proliferation of the cells.         This    appears    to be the case especially        in

the connective         tissue group, where the increase                in the number of
cells is extremely        marked.        With this      increased    cell formation there
is apparently a        taking up of         the  irritant material by       the cells, and
if   one cell is   not sufficient        for the task      a  number combine to form
Plasmodia or giant cells.              That the taking up of these products, or
the micro-organisms            themselves, further lowers the vitality of the
cell, may be      inferred from the fact that              as soon    as the  cell becomes
filled    with the irritant          particles     it  dies,   and   with its contained
material,     acts as an      irritant     to other cells.        The chemical products
then may be        looked      upon as the prime movers in bringing about                   a
proliferation      of the cells with which they               come in contact     ;  by this
proliferation       the cells appear to attempt to get rid of the irritant
 material     by which their resisting power is greatly diminished.
     Edinburgh        is now       thoroughly        equipped for bacterological in
 vestigations,       as   there     are complete        apparatus     and very     complete
 arrangements for carrying              on such       investigations in several       of the
 departments.          A   part of the pathological laboratory has been adapted
 for such work ; and in the surgical department Professor Chiene
 has established         a complete bacterological              laboratory.    There is     a
 similar laboratory         in the department of            practice   of physic.      In all
  these laboratories       useful work is at present going forward, under the
  guidance     of the several professors, and there is every prospect that
  the    Edinburgh School may contribute additions to the science of
   mycology     not unworthy of her high reputation in other branches of
  science.
       In conclusion,       we desire     to express      our sense of indebtedness to
   Professors    Greenfield and Chiene for suggestions                and encouragement
   whilst carrying on in their laboratories the work upon which                          this
   paper is based.

        The electrical     resistance      manifested relatively by certain fused
     salts is peculiar.      The following communication contains the result
     of observations      on time changes of resistances              noticed during the

also of molten glass.
    The salts (analytically pure) employed                     were   —
    Group         I. — Potassium        chloride,       potassium          iodide,     potassium
bromide (three salts of the halogens).

    The fusions were made in                a   platinum crucible, using a Fletcher's
 Bunsen burner,             either with or without blast                    as  required.         The
 galvanometer          employed     was an astatic one (the R. of which at 20° C.
 was 521 ohms) of known constants, and which, to ensure                                  accuracy,
was carefully calibrated during the investigation.                              With     the     salts
in fusion and raised to the high temperatures                            given, it    was    found
that when           a  Daniell's element          (zinc in cold saturated solution of
zinc sulphate,           copper     in concentrated sulphate of copper with
crystals)        was    placed     in   circuit      (using     two platinum             wires      as
electrodes),        the resistance of the fusing salts or glass varied of course
very greatly with the temperature.                       On allowing           cooling to       com
mence, the conductivity              in the      ca3e   of the salts (Group I.), almost
immediately ceased, although the temperature                             would only be just
below their fusing points.                It will    be seen, however,           from Table A.
that the current from the Daniell's continued to pass, in the                              case of
the other salts and glass, for a considerable                      time.
    Owing to the difficulty of obtaining                    a steady and         gradual    rise of
temperature           in melting the salts and powdered                      glass, the reverse
method         of taking the time change resistances during gradual cooling
from the highest temperature                    to recrystallisation was adopted.                  A

                     of Edinburgh, Session 1884-85.                             277
 weighed    portion (300 grains) of each salt, <fec, contained in the
 platinum crucible was first melted and raised to the high temperature
given (consistent     with the nature of the substance), which                  was
 measured    by a special arrangement with            a   Siemen's pyrometer.
 The ends   of two strong platinum wires (0-063 inch diam.), connected
 with the   Daniell's element, remained deeply immersed in the salt
from commencement,         at equal distances apart in each case         (\  inch) ;
the galvanometer       and resistance    coils were      also  in circuit       The
resistance was then taken at the highest temperature,               the source of
heat instantly removed,       and the fused salt or glass allowed gradually
to cooL    The time      changes   of the deflections     of the galvanometer
were then recorded every 15 seconds (the resistance,              values,   &c, of
which were     known from the calibration of         the galvanometer),        until
final solidification  of the salt or glass ensued, and the current from
the  Daniell's ceased to pass.
   This method afforded an indication of the nature of the resistance
of both groups of the fusing salts         and glass through considerable
ranges  of temperature, during the varying molecular changes incident
to recrystallisation on cooling.
   The curves of the resistances thus obtained are given in Table A.
                            Remarks on Table A.
   Potassium Carbonate. — This salt allowed a feeble current to pass
until 8 minutes        from commencement,          at   a   comparatively       low
temperature.
   Potassium nitrate and Potassium chlorate.          — A very faint current
continued     to pass    (through    higher   resistances)    after the above
measurements      were taken, until the salts were quite cold.
   Potassium chloride, Potassium iodide, and Potassium bromide.—
The resistance    of these fused salts was observed           many times with
the above results, after a very short time from the commencement
of cooling     in  each    experiment,    the   resistance    almost     instantly
increased to an enormous extent, allowing            only the feeblest current
from the Daniell's      to pass, although the salt was still at             a  high
temperature,     the KC1 quite a bright red, and the             KI    still show
ing distinctly red.       The property of bad conductivity during such
high temperature      appears    peculiar to these salts.        In the     case of
 KBr, when     at 845°   C,   there was a free passage of the current, but

on    reducing the         temperature to about 676°             C. (the salt being
apparently in a red hot semi-pasty condition), the flow of the current
was almost stopped, the R. of the salt was then about 154,830 ohms.
With      a   temperature somewhat below the last named,                       the   salt
entirely ceased to conduct.
    As all      the experiments       in this memoir were            conducted under
Bimilar conditions, the comparative results are interesting, and afford
a   further indication        of the generally non-conducting             character     of
these salts     of the halogen group, below their fusing points (KC1 fusing
point 731*       C,   KI   fusing point 634°       C, KBr    fusing point 699"        C),
the reverse being the case            with the other salts and glass employed.

5.    Notice of a Second            Specimen of Sowerby's Whale (Meso-
          plodon bidens), from Shetland                 By Professor W. Turner,
          M.B., LL.D.,        F.RS.
     The Shetland        seas are frequented by several            species  of Ziphioid
 whales.       Since the year       1870     I have   come   into possession of, and
 placed in the Anatomical           Museum of the University of Edinburgh,
 the    skull of Ziphius caeirostris* the skull and                a large  part of the
  skeleton of Hyperoodon rostratus, and the               skull  and almost complete
  skeleton of Mtsoplodon           bidens.^      They    were   all captured      on   the
  north-east side of the mainland of Shetland.
      On the 2nd       June of this year       I was  told by one of my students,
  Mr Charles        Anderson, that      a   small whale had been taken             a  few
  days    previously at Voxter          Voe,     Delting.    This     voe  is about 13
  miles from       Urafirth Voe, where in April        1881 tho specimen        of Meso-
  plodon bidens, above referred          to, had been captured by his brother,
  Mr Thomas Anderson of Hillswick.                  Mr Charles Anderson informed
   me that,    from the description which his brother had written to him
   of the Voxter Voe specimen,            it   was also,   he behaved,      a Sowerby's
   whale.      I  telegraphed,    therefore,     to  Mr Thomas Inkster of Brae,
   near Voxter      Voe, to secure      the animal for me as little injured as
      *

  possible.     On the 15th June it arrived             at  the   University, and
  proved to be a fine specimen of an adult male Mesoplodon bideus.
     The whale had been flensed,              eviscerated,  and cut into blocks
  before    being despatched        to me   ;  all the skin had been        removed
  except    that of the tail and flippers.           The thoracic and abdominal
 viscera had been removed             en masse,    and accompanied      the   divided
 carcass.     From the extent to which the animal had been cut up,
 my notes on the soft parts are necessarily            very fragmentary     ;  and   as
  the specimen reached        me in the hot weather         in June,    more than a
  fortnight after    the   death     of the whale,     the viscera    could only be
  examined     in a very general way.
     When the various blocks were put together in their proper posi
 tion, the length from the tip of the lower jaw                to the mid-point      of
 the   tail was    15 feet   8 inches.      The shape of the tail and flipper
 closely   corresponded     with the Ziphioid which Burmeister has named
 Epiodon patachonicum or atisirule (Ziphitus cavirostris).              The tail was
 dark slate grey, almost black on both surfaces.              The flipper on both
 surfaces had the colour of a well blackened boot.                A pair of mandi
 bular teeth projected        for one inch beyond the gum,             but no rudi
 mentary denticles were seen.            The blow-hole was transverse, and on
 the surface     of the head      was    not   divided into two nostrils.         The
 position and form of the tongue,             the relation of the larynx to the
 nares,   and the branching of the              trachea   and   bronchi,   were     ex
 amined.
    The stomach       was seen to consist          of ten compartments,        viz., a
 proximal cavity, which freely communicated with the oesophagus                        ;
 eight globular or saccular          compartments,     which varied in size from
 a moderately     sized orange to about three times that magnitude.               The
first saccular compartment         communicated       with the hinder end of the
proximal cavity, and the various saccular compartments                    communi
cated in succession      with each other, whilst the last one opened into
the tenth compartment          of the stomach.
    The tenth or distal compartment was in size and shape not unlike
a large    human stomach       ; it  showed     an indication of a division into
two parts by      a  projecting fold of mucous           membrane     which passed
across   it; it communicated       with the duodenum.         A large  duct opened
into the duodenum which was traced to the pancreas, and probably
represented     the combined pancreatic and biliary duct.             The compart

mente of the         stomach,     from one to seven inclusive,           contained a
brownish       mucus,   — the eighth and ninth contained              a  bile-stained
fluid, with a number of opaque               crystalline lenses and hard white
calcareous bodies,         which    looked    not unlike       the otoliths of fish.
The tenth       compartment contained several              ounces  of  a bile-stained
fluid, but no other contents.
    The liver, heart, lungs, pelvic bones and penis, hyoid apparatus,
and other bones of the skeleton were                examined.      A  dissection was
made      of the extensor and flexor musjles of the flippers, and of the
vessels    and nerves of these limbs.           [It is intended   to publish a more
detailed account of the visceral           anatomy in the Journal of Anatomy

6.    Preliminary          Report on        the    Cephalopoda collected           by
                     "                       Part    II.    The Decapoda.

          William      K   Hoyle, M.A. (Oxon.), M.RC.S.
    It   is rather remarkable that the Decapoda should have                   yielded
fewer      new    forms than       the Octopoda,        although judging by the
number of genera contained            in  them, the former is a much more ex
tensive group than the latter, and is furthermore                  represented    by  a
larger     number in the "Challenger"               collection,   as  the following
synopsis*      will show : —

     As usually    happens    the largest genera received the most additions,
 e.g., S^pia and Loligo        ; while the new        genera are each represented
 only by     a single specimen.
     All   the   Sepias obtained by the Expedition                 were   got between
 Stations 163 and 232,        — that     is to say, during       the cruise from the
 eastern coast     of Australia, through the Malay Archipelago                to  Japan  ;
 and when this is taken in connection with the fact that of                   some fifty
 previously known species, no less than thirty come                    from the same
 area,  it  becomes    obvious that this Indo-Pacific            region is the metro
 polis of the genus.       It   is further remarkable that most of the new
 Loligos come from the same region.
     One of the most curious of the new forms is               a  small creature from
 the Southern Ocean, which has been called Bathyteitthis abyssicola
 (fig. 2)  ;* it  measures about 5 cm.         in length, excluding      the tentacles;
the body is subcylindrical, tapering to a blunt point behind, where
are situated two small rounded fina                 The head is broad, with pro
minent eyes, and there is a very large oral membrane                    provided with
suckers.       The arms are very short, the longest not quite reaching
 1   cm., and the      suckers are minute and arranged                biserially ; the
tentacles    about equal the body in length, and have no clnbs, but
gradually taper to       a point armed with numerous               very small suckers
like   those of many Sepia;.           The funnel is provided with a valve,
and the pen resembles that of Ommastrephes                  (see p. 308 postea).
     The structure of this form seems to adapt it for life at great depths,
and to    justify   the belief that     it really   came from the depth reached
    * This seems to be at     all  events                with a form which Professor
                                            congeneric
Verrill   has recently dredged in the North       Atlantic,  and named     BtntkoUvthU

 by the dredge          (1600 fathoms) ; the small fins are in marked contrast
 to   those of pelagic species, while the small suckers and delicate
 tentacles      are equally      little fitted for raptorial purposes         ;  but, on the
other hand,          the large circumoral            lip would     seem  well suited for
collecting       nutritive matters from           an oozy bottom.
     A  new genus has also been                erected   for the reception of another
interesting Decapod,             Promachoteuthis megaptera (vide posted), and a
third for a specimen nearly allied to the genus Histioteuthis, which
was obtained         in the South Atlantic (Station 333) ; the web is very
small     in comparison with that of this genus, not extending quite
half-way to the            tips of the    arms.     In the  present state of our know
ledge     it  seems impossible           to refer this form to any type hitherto
described, and           it has therefore       been erected into a new genus under
the name         Histiopsis atlantica.
     Among the Challenger               Collection is also one mutilated individual
of Taonius          hyperboreus, Stp., a species hitherto known                   only from
examples in the Copenhagen Museum ;* there are also two medium
sized specimens             and a small one, which appear to be referable to the
same genus.             It   is remarkable that many of the most interesting
 specimens        are mere       fragments      ; among others may be mentioned
 part   of a tentacle of Mastigoteuthis                 Agassizii,   Verrill, which       was
 found adhering to the dredge rope,                    and numerous pieces of a long
 gelatinous pen, taken from the stomach                      of a shark     ;   these   latter
 seem to        resemble nothing hitherto known                 so nearly as the pen of
 Chiroteuthis         lacertosa,     Verrill,t though, if this determination                be
 correct,      that species must sometimes attain a length of several feet.

   The Body is short, barrel- shaped, rounded behind                  ; the fin is  large,
transversely elliptical, and extending beyond the end of the body
posteriorly   ;  each half is wider           than long.       The mantle-margin is
transversely truncated.             The mantle-connective        consists    of a linear
ridge on either side, fitting into an almond-shaped depression                           at
either side of the base of the siphon, which is short, slender, and                    has
the  distal margin, everted like the neck of a flask                    ; the specimen
 was so small and indifferently             preserved   that it was not opened           to
ascertain    whether     a  valve was present.
   The Head is very small and narrow, almost the whole of its                        sides
being occupied by the            eyes,  which are not prominent, but covered
 with  a  transparent membrane,            and    with  a  distinct pore in front        of
 and below each.
   The Arms aro unequal,             the fourth being the shortest (considerably
so on the right side) ; the first, second, and third aresubequal ; they
are on an average about the                same length as the          body, smoothly

conical, and      taper evenly to fine points.            The suckers      are   in two
series     throughout,      pedunculate,     spherical, with a lateral aperture
directed inwards ;        the horny ring is smooth and surrounded by a
few large papillae.          The hectocotylus is not developed. There is no
trace   of an umbrella.          The buccal membrane is well developed and
has the     usual seven       points, but they are not very well marked nor
provided      with suckers       ; the membrane       is not connected        with the
arms    by ligaments.          There seems to be only one lip, which is thick
and    papillate.
    The Tentacles arise directly between the               third and fourth        arms,
exactly resembling          them at their origin, and obviously being part of
one series      with them       ; the  stem is swollen      at first and somewhat
more    than one-third up the arms narrows rather suddenly to about
half its previous diameter.            The club is wanting.
     The Surface is smooth.
     The   Colour is   a  dull purplish madder, paler on          the fins (especially
 their under
                 surface) and on the arms and tentacles.

      The Body     is elongated, widest anteriorly, and tapering gradually
  to an acute     point behind.       The  fin is comparatively short, only            one
  third the     length of the body, elliptical, slightly broader than long.
  The mantle-margin           passes almost straight       across the back, except
   where a    long narrow median process juts out over the head                    ;  it is
   slightly sinuate ventrally.         The siphon is short and blunt.
      The Head is short and very nearly as broad as the body                     ; it  has
   the usual   auricular crest and preocular pore.
       The Arms are unequal, the order of length being 3, 4, 2, 1, and
   about    one-third the length of the body        ; the   first has  a  distinct web
    on its  dorso-median angle, and the third           a still broader web on its
    outer aspect,   passing back nearly       as far as the eye, where it becomes
    connected    with another passing up the dorso-lateral               aspect    of the

286                       Proceedings     of  the  Royal Society
fourth.      The suckers are in two series, pedunculate,              oblique, notched
distally, and somewhat larger on the lateral than on the other arms.
The horny rings bear from five to seven large pointed teeth in their
distal portion, but are smooth             proximally.      The hectocotylus is not
present        The buccal membrane            has the usual seven points, each            of
which carries two or three small suckers.                The outer lip is thick and
marked with radial grooves             ; the inner was not seen.
    The Tentacle is slender, approximately cylindrical, and about two-
thirds the length of the body               ; its terminal fourth is occupied by
the club, which is but          little expanded, and       has a delicate      protective
membrane        along either side of the inner surface and a well-marked
web externally.           The large median suckers are about ten in number,
and about twice as large as the alternating lateral               ;   the proximal are
about twenty, and gradually                increasing;    the distal occupy nearly
one   half  the    club, and are in four series diminishing.                  The horny
rings of the largest suckers             have    about twenty-four distant square
pointed teeth, much longer on the distal margin                     ;  the lateral ones
have about       half    as many similar       teeth on the outer margin, and the
terminal suckers are armed in the same way.
    The Surface has been almost entirely denuded of skin.
    The Colour appears to have been pale buff with purple chromato-
phores.

    The Body is about three                times    as long   as   broad,     cylindrical
anteriorly, and pointed behind.                 The fin is rather less than half the
 length of the body,* about               as   long as broad, and with rounded
 lateral angles.         The mantle-margin curves out rapidly to             a  triangular
 process in the dorsal         median line, for the rest is almost transverse,
 except where       it forms two      obtuse angled processes, one at either side
 of  the ventral emargination.

     The Head is comparatively broad and with prominent rounded
eyes.     The siphon is moderately large and of the usual form.
     The Arms are unequal, the order of length being 3, 4, 2, 1, and
not quite one      third   as long as the body.      The dorsal have a distinct
keel on the       upper margin, the second are keeled on the ventro
lateral aspect,     the third are stout and flattened and have a broad
web on the outer aspect,          which unites with the web running up the
dorso-lateral     aspect of the ventral arms.          The suckers are in two
series throughout, with short peduncles, and not very oblique ; their
horny rings        bear nearly     twenty distant blunt teeth.         The hecto-
cotyltu    is not developed.         The    umbrella   is  absent.    The    buccal
membrane has the usual seven              points, each of which bears a few
suckers.       The outer lip is thin, the inner thin and papillate.
     The Tentacles are comparatively short, being not quite so long as
the    body; the      stems    are sub triangular.    The club occupies       more
than     one-third    of the length, and has a protective membrane at
 either side    of the suckers and       a distinct web on the outer aspect.
The large       central   suckers  are eight to ten     in number, and nearly
 twice the diameter of the lateral ones ; the proximal             group consists
 of about ten,     while the distal portion     bears four series of diminish
 ing suckers.        The horny ring bears long, distant, bluntly pointed
 teeth, about twenty-four        in the largest suckers, proportionally fewer
 in the    smaller, which are much larger in the distal and external
 portions    of the ring respectively.
     The Surface is smooth.
     The Colour is pale yellowish,         spotted with brownish-purple         and
 red chromatophores.

   tapering posteriorly, and terminating in a blunt point.              The Jin is

   lateral angles ;  the extreme breadth is less than the length and is

288                   Proceedings oj the Royal Society
situated anteriorly to the middle of the fin.                        The mantle-margin
presents a triangular        process       in the mid-dorsal line and is deeply
sinuate ventrally.         The siphon is short and bluntly conical.
    The Head is short and not so broad                  as  the body       ; the eyes are
comparatively       small and have              a bracket-shaped          auricular   crest
behind and a minute pore in front of them.
    The Arms are unequal, the order of length being 3, 4, 2, 1, and,
 on the average, rather more than one-third                 the length of the body          ;
the first are the most slender,                and have the dorso-median angle
 raised into a prominent keel           ;   the second have only a faintly-marked
 angle    ventro-laterally    ;  the      third   have   a   broad web externally,
 passing    over   at   the  base    into one which           extends up the dorsal
 aspect of the ventral arms.              The suckers are arranged in two series,
 pedunculate, very oblique, and rather larger on the lateral than on
 the   other arms     ;  the  horny ring has about               nine    short,  close-set,
 square-cut   teeth     on its distal side, and is smooth on the proximal.
 The hectocotylus was not observed.                The buccal         membrane    has five
 points, each of which bears two or three small suckers, the two ventral
 points are rounded off; just within the ventral margin is a small
 papilla surrounded by two elevated rings, probably for the reception
  of spermatophores.         Both the outer and inner lips are folded.
     The Tentacle is faintly three-sided           and shorter than the body, one-
 third of its length being taken up by the club, which is expanded
 and triangular in section        ;  there is a protective membrane              on either

    The Body       is   moderately stout, being about three times                                    as   long       as
broad,  cylindrical in its anterior third, and tapering gradually to                                                  a
bluntish point.    The fin occupies     little more than half the length

of the body,       is rhomboidal, not quite                 so broad as long, and broadest
anteriorly       to the middle           ;    the    lateral         angles      are      rounded.                  The
mantle-margin has             a   slight projection in the median dorsal line and
a   broad shallow sinuate excavation ventrally.                                      The        siphon          is   of
moderate     length and bluntly pointed.
    The Head       small, with prominent rounded
                   is                                                             eyes,     and bears the
usual    auricular      crest and preocular pore.
    The Arms are unequal, the order of length being                                        3,   4,   2,    1,       and
about    half    as long as the body.                The first are very slender and bear
a   distinct keel on the dorsal aspect                      ;       the second are thicker                          and
triangular, and have              a   broad keel almost expanding into                            a       web on
the lateral aspect       ;    the third are the stoutest,                       flattened from above
downwards, and distinctly keeled                      externally           ;   the   fourth are inter
mediate      between          the third and            second,          triangular,             and with             a
broadish     web extending the whole way up the dorso-lateral aspect.
They all have       a    web      up each side of the inner face.                               The suckers
are   in two series, very oblique, and with slender conical peduncles,
their size varying        with that of the            arms on which they are situated                                ;
the horny       ring    bears eight long square-cut                   teeth on its distal margin.
The hectocotylus         is   developed as usual on the left ventral arm, which
bears    proximally ten rows of                suckers,     then      a    minute sucker with an
exaggerated        peduncle, and beyond this two series of long conical
papillae.       The buccal            membrane        has   the usual seven angles                              pro
duced    into long lappets,             each of which           bears about eight suckers                            in
two rows    ;    the outer        lip   is   moderately thick, the inner much thicker
and    marked with deep radial grooves.
    The Tentacles are about as long as the body, with flattened stems                                               ;
about one-third         their length          is    occupied by the club, which                           is   only

about sixteen in number and about one-third larger than the laterals;
the proximal         are about ten, the distal are closely packed                      in four
series.    The      horny rings of the              largest  are provided       with      about
twenty larger teeth,            with    which smaller ones alternate somewhat
regularly     ;  the lateral bear about ten distant acute teeth on                  the outer
margin, while the proximal and distal groups are similarly armed on
the distal margin.

    The Body is only moderately elongated, being about three times
 as  long   as    broad, and bluntly pointed behind.                   The   fin    is a  little
 more   than half the length                of the body, about         as  long as broad,
 rhomboidal,        rounded       laterally, and very slightly            notched at the
 anterior angles.           The mantle-margin curves gradually forward to                       a
 projecting point in the dorsal median line, and is deeply emarginate
 ventrally.        The siphon is short and of the usual form.

    The Arms are unequal, the order of length being 3, 4, 2, 1, and
 on an average         about half      as    long as the body       ;  the   first are very
 small, slender, and rounded              ;   the second have a prominent ventro
 lateral angle, not amounting to a keel                    ; the  third   have a distinct
 web on the outer aspect               of the       distal portion, which is continued
 backwards         as   a    faint   ridge      which     joins the    web      lying along
 the   dorso-lateral edge of the fourth.                     The   suckers     are     in two
series,   and      vary in size in accordance                with the arms         on    which
they are situated         ;   they are subglobular and oblique.                   The horny

 hedoc-jtylus is present       on    the left ventral      arm   ; the distal suckers
 of    the   ventral    series    only      are  modified     into conical    papillae,
some of     which hear a minute sucker at their tips.»                The umbrella    is
absent ; the buccal membrane              is well developed, has the usual seven
points, each     of which      bears a few small         suckers (occasionally only
one).      The outer    lip is thick, thicker than the inner ; both            are cut
up into papillae      along the    edge.
    The Tentacles are as long as the head and body together, and
have very slender,        almost cylindrical stems ; the club occupies about
one    fourth of the whole length, and is but slightly expanded.                   The
large central suckers       are about eight        in number and fully twice the
diameter of the        lateral   ones   ;   proximally to them       are about   half   a
dozen suckers       of different   sizes, and beyond them a large number of
diminishing ones arranged in four series                 and occupying nearly half
the length      of the club.      The horny ring in the largest suckers bears
about     twenty-five square teeth ; in the lateral suckers it bears more
than twenty close-set         acutely-pointed        teeth, and in the distal ones
about the same number of similar character.

    The Arms are subequal,            the order of length being 4, 1, 2, 3, and
 nearly half    as  long  as  the body     ;  they are all more or less compressed,
 especially the ventral ones            ;  they have a distinct web                along the
 outer margin, and a rather broad membrane                       runs up either side of
 the sucker-bearing face.           The suckers are in four series throughout,
 not very obliquely          set;   they are large and spheroidal, and                     have
 meridional markings on the outer surface; the horny ring is smooth
 and   surrounded by a narrow papillate area.                       In the   hectocotylized
 arm of the male the first four rows of suckers                   are normal, then come
 two rows of gradually diminishing                 suckers,    succeeded     by four rows
 of minute        ones,   after    which       they again         regain their        normal
 dimensions.        The umbrella is narrow,             widest between          the second
 and third arms, where it reaches up to the fifth row of suckers
 The buccal membrane has the usual seven points in the male ;                           in the
 female   the two ventral are rounded off                 ;  the spermatic cushion is
 exceedingly well developed,              and   has four deep transverse             grooves.
 The outer lip is thin and longitudinally                   corrugated     ;  the inner is
 thick and bears numerous very long papilla;.
    The Tentacles are absent.
    The Surface is smooth throughout.
    The Colour is dull grey, mottled with black above, yellowish below.
    The   Shell      is elliptical     in outline,       somewhat broader behind
 (especially in     the female) ; the chitinous margin is narrow and does
 not form    a complete      ridge across the shell below the spine              ;  it  forms
 two slightly       expanded wings           behind, and          extends    but     a   little
distance    over the dorsal          surface,      which     is    marked     with     coarse
rugosities disposed        in curved lines parallel to the anterior margin                      ;
a  distinct but low rib runs down the centre.                     The ventral surface is
elevated    on either side        of a    deep median groove ; the last loculus
covers about one-fifth of the surface, and is bounded posteriorly by
two slightly wavy lines, meeting at an acute angle                    ; the striated area
is long, and the angle          between      the    stria widens posteriorly.              The
inner   cone   is very     well developed         ;   the limbs arise        one-fifth the
length of the shell forward, and gradually                      become    more      elevated
until they       enclose     a deep      conical     cavity.      The   spine    is strong,
pointed, and somewhat curved laterally in the female example.

     The Body is ovoid, broadest one-third                from the anterior margin,
pointed behind.              The fins   are one-third       the width of the body,
broadest in the middle,             extending the whole length of the body,
and approaching           within    2  millim. of each other posteriorly.             The
mantle-margin         not very prominent          over     the head dorsally.         The
mantle-connective is rather            short and     deep,     but otherwise normal.
The siphon is conical, reaching              within    1  millim. of or quite up to
the space      between the ventral arms.
     The Head is very short and broad, the eyes prominent.
     The    Arms   are subequal, the order of length being 4, 3, 2,             1 ;  they
are    nearly    half the length of the body, and taper evenly to fine
points     ; there is a distinct but narrow ridge along the fourth and a
delicate     web along each side of the oral aspect of the arms.                      The
sucker* are     in four series throughout, and of moderate size, marked with
 inconstant meridional          grooves,   and there is a large notch proximally
 and   distally in the rim.          The horny ring has for the most part no
 distinct teeth,      but   is marked in the distal       half with shallow irregular
 notches,     which     are    occasionally    more      regular.    A papillary      area
 surrounds the horny ring.            The hectocotylus is developed in about the
 middle third        of the left ventral arm        ;  beyond the eighth row            of
  suckers the     two ventral series are continued of the normal size, but
  the two    dorsal are each represented        by five minute suckers, gradually
  diminishing      to the middle       one and then increasing again          ;   beyond
  this the     arm    exhibits     no peculiarities.         The  umbrella is widest
  between     the two lateral arms, where it extends               as far as the sixth
  row of suckers.         The buccal membrane bears the usual seven distinct
  points in   the male, whilst in the female the ventral pair are lost in the
  thick swollen spermatic cushion           ; this   is subdivided by four or five
  deep grooves      into   as  many transverse    ridges.       The outer lip is thin;
   the inner bears about        half  a dozen   rows of distinct hemispheroidal
   papillae.
      The Tentacles      are about as long as the mantle ; the stem is indis
  tinctly three-sided ; the club is long and wide, and bears eight series
   of minute     equal suckers      ; there  is a protective membrane on either

294                    Proceedings     of  the   Royal Society
side    and a broad     fin  on the dorso-internal aspect.            The horny ring
is small and has a smooth margin.
    The Surface is smooth.
    The Colour is a dull grey dorsally, pale yellowish below.
    The Shell is broad, subelliptical in outline, the anterior extremity
bounded by two straight lines, which form obtuse rounded-off angles
with each other and the sides of the shell              ;  the posterior is       rounded
gradually off.       The dorsal surface has         a faint ridge passing to each
of the three angles just mentioned, and is covered with curved rows
 of tubercles parallel to the anterior margin.               The ventral surface is
 but little elevated     ;  the last loculus    occupies    one-third of        it, and is
bounded        behind     by a broadly       open     curve with        three     or    four
 irregular sinuations in it.        The striated area is hollowed posteriorly,
 and    is marked by grooves           corresponding        to the sinuations           just
 mentioned.        The inner    cone arises about      half-way along the striated
area, curves evenly outwards, and then rises                  into a distinct ridge,
 forming a wall separate from the margin of the shell                      ;  its ventral
surface is marked by a number            of   striae  pointing in the direction           of
 the spine,     which is of medium length and strength, and curved
gently upwards.

     The Body is of medium breadth,               widest one-third back, curving
 evenly to a pointed posterior extremity.                   The fin is nearly one-
third the breadth of the body, extending from the anterior margin of
the mantle       to within four millim.           of its fellow at        the    posterior
extremity.        The    mantle-margin projects to a considerable extent
over the head        dorsally, and is slightly emarginate             ventrally.        The
siphon     is long, reaching up to the interspace               between       the ventral
arms.
     The Head is of medium breadth and the                 eyes   prominent
     The Arms are subequal,           their order of length being              4, 3, 2, 1 ;

 the smallest     and subcorneal,       the ventral wide and with a narrow
 web on the      outer aspect     ;  they all taper gradually        to fine points.
The tuckers are       in four  series   throughout, pedunculate, oblique, and
notched proximally          and distally, and with meridional grooves              on
the margin ;    the horny ring has about twenty blunt triangular teeth on
the distal   semicircumference, and is surrounded by a broad papillate
area.     The hectocotylus     is not present.      The umbrella is but slightly
developed, reaching in its greatest            extent (between the third and
fourth arms) only to the fourth row of suckers.               The buccal membrane
has the usual seven points, but there is no spermatic cushion.                   The
outer   lip is moderately thick and longitudinally ribbed                ; the inner
is  provided with many rows of elevated rounded papillae.
    The Tentacles are about as long as the mantle, and have                     stout
three-sided stems ; the club occupies           about one-fourth       of the whole
length,     and extends fully          half   round     the    stem ;  a   protective
membrane       is found at either side of the suckers and a web along
the dorso-median        aspect of the club.      The suckers are very numerous,
minute and closely packed           ;  the horny ring has about eight or ten
stout distant teeth on the distal margin.
    The Surface is for the most part smooth, but there are about five
elongated elevations down each side of the body near the origin of
the fin,   and   a few minute papilla? on the dorsal surface.
    The Colour is a dull purplish grey above, pale ochre below.
    The Shell is roughly elliptical in outline ; the anterior extremity
is bounded by two          straight lines forming        a   blunt rounded     angle ;
 the sides curve evenly outwards            (the greatest breadth being a little
 anterior to the middle)         and form a bluntish point behind.               The
 chitinous margin is narrow and vanishes              in the median ventral line
 behind.     The dorsal surface, is rough, with granules arranged in rows
 parallel to the anterior margin ; three          slightly   elevated tracts diverge
 from the spine to the three anterior            angles.     The ventral surface is
 little elevated    ;  the last loculus occupies one fourth of the length,
 and is emarginate,       being bounded behind by a more              or less evenly
 curved line ; the striated area         is excavated,     so that the whole shell
 is thin ; the inner cone is well developed,           with    a thickened rounded
  margin,   and encloses     a deep     pit ; the limbs extend half-way along
  the striated   area.    The    spine   is long, tapering, and curves gently
  upwards.

   The Body is cylindrical in its anterior fourth, then tapering gradu
ally backwards, and pointed behind.                      The fins are one-fifth the
breadth of the body, commence                 2  millim. from the anterior margin
of    the    mantle,      and    approach within          5   millim.      of each        other
posteriorly     ; the mantle-margin reaches             far over the head dorsally,
and is evenly truncated below.                 The siphon does not extend up                  to
the interbrachial space.
   The Head is broad and the                  eyes   very prominent         ;  in the only
specimen     it is much      retracted    into the mantle.
   The     Arms are subequal,            the order of length being 4, 3, 2,                  1 ;
they are one-third the length of the mantle, and taper gradually to
slender points       ;  the first are thin and rounded, the fourth flattened,
each has a distinct ridge on the outer side, which                      in the fourth ex
pands to     a  broad membrane.             The suckers are in two series               in  the
first and second arms, but with             a   tendency to form four series            in  the
others, more especially           in the distal portions       ;  they are pedunculate
and very oblique, and the margin is marked with meridional grooves
and has     a deep     distal notch     ; the     horny ring is small, smooth, and
surrounded by          a  papillate area.        The hectocotylus is present along
three-fourths of the left ventral arm in the form of                        a groove       with
convex bottom, bounded on either side by                    a narrow fillet      ;  on either
margin of the groove            is a row of minute suckers,              which are larger
and more distinct, and even              form two series on the ventral aspect                  ;
the tip of the arm bears two series of small suckers.                         The umbrella
is   better    developed       than usual, its greatest extent (between the
lateral arms) being up to the eighth row of suckers.                            The buccal
membrane has the usual seven points, but not very strongly marked;
the outer     lip  is smooth and thin, the inner papillate.
    The Tentacle         is as   long as the head and body together, with                      a
slender and somewhat flattened                 stem ; the club is short and rather
broad, and has a protective membrane                   on either side of the suckers,
and a broad web on the dorsal aspect, extending for a distance equal

to half its length down the stem                          ;    there       are from six to eight rows
of very minute suckers, subequal, and                                with smooth horny rings.
   The Surface is smooth, except that on one side of the ventral sur
face are three            slightly raised linear ridges, apparently                              due      to con
traction, and a few minute papilla; on the dorsal surface posteriorly.
   The Colour is,               on the whole,           pale yellowish          below, purplish above.
   The Shell is hemielliptical                    in outline anteriorly, tapering                    to a point
behind.         The chitinous margin is rather broad, widest about two-
thirds back ;             it covers all except the median third of the dorsal
surface,       which is finely rugose where free, and has                               a   slightly elevated
median portion              and       a faint linear ridge           in    the middle line posteriorly,
about 3        millim. long, and terminating                         2   millim. from the base of the
spine.         The ventral surface is but little elevated ; the last loculus
occupies        more than one-third of                        it,
                                            and its posterior boundary                                              is
almost semicircular,                  inflected in the centre.                  The inner cone            is   evan
escent     ;   its limbs are chitinous and form                             a   ventral margin to the
terminal cone.                 A   spine    is   present,       but, as      it    had been broken off,
its length and             form cannot           be determined.

   The Body           is    very long, broadest one-third of the way back, pointed
and    acuminate behind.                     The fins are narrow, commence                           3    millim.

of    its fellow, end              slightly on the dorsal                  aspect    of the body.               The
mantle-margin                  extends well over the head dorsally, and                                   is   very
slightly emarginate                     ventrally.       The siphon extends rather further
forward than the middle                       of the eyes, but not up to the space be
tween the ventral arms.
      The      Head       is   decidedly narrower                   than    the body and somewhat

very slender tips.       The suckers seem to be normally in four series,
but in some cases the arms are           so  compressed       that they seem to be
in only two, especially       at the   proximal extremities of the first and
second arms ; they are globular, slightly oblique,                  with  a  small aper
ture and smooth horny ring.             The hectocotylus occupies             the  distal
half of the left ventral arm        ; the  suckers are normal up to the twelfth
row, after which the arm widens and has a median groove from
which about twelve shallow grooves               pass outwards on           either  side,
separating   raised    portions, each of which bears             a  minute sucker on
the dorsal side of the groove.           The umbrella is present only between
the second    and third and third and fourth arms up to the fourth
row of suckers.        The buccal membrane            is well developed         and   has
the   usual seven points        ; in  the   female    there     is a deeply grooved
spermatic  cushion.       The outer lip is thin and smooth, the inner thick
and papillate.
   The   Tentacles     are somewhat longer than               the     head   and   body,
very slender and somewhat flattened.                   The club is flattened and
expanded   ;   along its outer margin is         a   very narrow membrane, and
along the median edge, at some distance from the cupules, is                            a
broad web, marked on the dorsal aspect with fine parallel shallow
oblique grooves     ;  along one margin        it  bears     three     or four series of
small pedunculated suckers, whose             horny rings bear very numerous
and acute teeth.
   The Surface is smooth.
   The Colour is a dull purplish grey above,                       ochre   with purple
chromatophores      below.
   The Shell has a narrow elongated             oval outline, somewhat           pointed
in front and tapering gradually backwards                  ;   the chitinous      margin
 extends about one-third across the dorsal surface, which shows the
boundary     lines of the loculi clearly          as   brown      striae,  and is very
minutely    roughened      ;  the   ventral surface is elevated, so that the
shell is thick     in proportion to its breadth, a narrow groove runs
down the centre      ; the   last loculus occupies one-fourth of the surface,
and is bounded posteriorly by           a  shallow open curve.            The posterior
extremity is a very flattened irregular cone, to the apex of which
the spine is attached ; the inner cone is very shallow and its open
ing is some    4 millim. from the margin or the outer cone.                    The spine
is long, straight, and points directly backward.

first and         second are conical, the third flatter, with                                         a    slight ridge
externally,          and the fourth broad and flat with                                  a   distinct crest.             The
tuckers are          in four           series throughout, small, spheroidal, and not very
oblique      ;     the            horny ring            is      smooth.            The       hectocotylm            is    not
developed.                 The umbrella                is   evanescent,        extending at most only up
to   the second row of suckers                              :   the buccal membrane                   has five points
and      is    rounded                dorsally     ;    the       spermatic         cushion         is    but slightly
developed.                 The        outer      lip   is   thin and grooved longitudinally,                              the
inner       thicker and papillate.
     The Tentacle                 is   as long as the head                     and body         ;   the stem being
slender        and          indistinctly               three-sided.            The       club    is    very slightly
expanded         ;   a protective membrane,                           grooved obliquely on the dorsal
aspect,      is   situated on the outer margin, and there                                        is   a   web on the
internal side.                    The suckers               are      in four or five            series,     which are
slightly larger towards the inner margin                                       ;   the horny riiig presents a

   The Body is long and narrow, widest near the anterior margin,
and tapers gradually backwards.                                       The   fin   is very narrow,                       only       one-
eighth         of the             body      ;    it    commences            3     mill      i m.       from           the     margin
of the         body,          and       posteriorly           passes         on        to     the          ventral            surface
and terminates                2    millim.            from its fellow and                      4       millim.          from        the
extremity of the body.                            The mantle-margin has                            a   narrow projection
over     the head,             and       is evenly truncated ventrally.                                        The siphon is
short, not reaching half-way to the space between the ventral arms.
   The         Head          is    of       medium breadth,                     and           the          eyes        prominent
laterally.
   The Arms are subequal,                              the order of length being 2, 4, 3, 1, and
less than one-third the length of the body ; the first two pairs are
subcorneal          and       slender,           the third            broader      and         with            a web        running
up the ventral aspect,                          the fourth            wider and with                       a   distinct          ridge
along the outer edge                    ;       they all taper to very fine points.                                         Many      of
the suckers are deficient, but they seem to have                                                   stood        in four          series
throughout          ;        they are spheroidal                       and very               oblique,                the        distal
margin of many has                      a deep         notch      :   the horn y ring is smooth                             in   most
cases,     but          occasionally                  possesses         a   few         angular                 teeth.            The
hectocotylus            is not developed.                   The umbrella is but little developed,
its greatest            extent being on                     the        ventro-lateral                  aspect,          where it
reaches the fourth                  row of suckers.                     The buccal membrane has                                    the
usual seven points, the two ventral being the least                                                               distinct            (as
usual in female specimens)                             ;   the spermatic               cushion             is    small.           The
outer    lip   is   narrow, the inner thick and papillate.

        The Tentacle is shorter than the body and slender                     ;   the stem has
    three sides,       the inner       being slightly hollow, with a slender fillet
   along the middle.               The   club   is slightly expanded with            a   distinct
   protective membrane              ; the  inner side of the club is deeply grooved,
   and internally to the groove is a rather broad fin.                       The tuckers are
   in about       five   series,    near the inner margin are three rather larger
  than the rest, which              gradually diminish       towards the outer margin.
  The horny rings of the larger suckers have about twenty fine teeth on
   the   distal semicircumference, the smaller have fewer in proportion.
       The Surface is smooth all over.
       The Colour is a dark purplish grey above, paler below.
       The    Shell     is a very elongated oval in outline                ;   the chitvwiut
  margin        is very      narrow       and extends one-third          over the dorsal
  "ur/ace,     which is smooth and evenly convex, with                    the exception of
  a  slight ridge along the middle line               :  the ventral surface is elevated,
  so that the        shell is thick,      with    a shallow   median     groove becoming
  evanescent         posteriorly,      the last loculus occupies        one-third        of   the
 surface, and is bounded by a                  slightly curved line with        a cusp where
 the median          groove meets it        :  the inner cone is formed by two limbs,
  which       arise half-way along the              shell and form a rounded fillet
 slightly       more elevated           posteriorly,    where they bound            a   shallow
 'lepression       :  outside them the margin of the shell expands into                          a
 subcircular          plate,     from    the centre      of  which    the    spine     projects
 backwards         ;  no information          can be given as to its form or length,
as    it has been broken off close to the base.

     The Body is elongated,                broadest     about one-third back, pointed
behind      :  the fins extend the whole length of the body and are one-
third of its breadth, a little wider behind ; they extend to within
1    millirn.      of the anterior margin, but              are  separated       by about        5
millim. posteriorly            :   the  mantle-margin       projects far over the head
doreally,        and      is  slightly     emarginato      ventrally.      The siphon           is
conical,       reaching       two-thirds       up to the gap between              the    ventral
arms.

    The Head is short and broad                  ;   the eyes prominent.
    The Arms are subequal, their order of length being 4, 3,                                       1, 2 ;
they are about one-fourth as long                         as   the body and taper                to fine
points    : the dorsal          are    conical with          a   very slight           ridge    up    the
outer aspect, the third pair have a similar ridge                                ;   the ventral      are
flattened    and bear a distinct              crest.       The suckers are in four series
throughout and of moderate size, set obliquely                                on short peduncles,
with     meridional        grooves       on    the outside          :    the    horny      ring    bears
twenty to twenty-five long, square-cut,                         irregular teeth           in its distal
 semicircumference,            and    outside it is an area covered with                       close-set
 papillae.     The      heciocotylvs        is not         developed.             The     umbrella       is
 slight, reaching only as high as the sixth                           row of suckers           between
 the    third   and fourth            arms,     where it is widest                 ;  as   usual it      is
 entirely absent between              the two ventral arms.                  The buccal membrane
                                                                                                           ¦
 has the usual seven points.                  The spermatic cushion is not developed
 the outer    lip   is smooth,        except     for    a few     ridges due to contraction                ;
 the inner bears numerous small papillae.
     The    Tentacles       are     about     as    long as the body, the stem being
 three-sided     :   the   club     is short,        flattened,        and     expanded,         with     a
 protective membrane                on either side            and      a broad        web down the
 back, reaching along               the   stem        for   a   distance        equal     to half the
 length of the club         ;    it bears six larger suckers in the central line,                         a
 series of smaller ones on either side,                        and some very minute                 ones
  along each margin           :   at the top are fifteen                to twenty in four series.
     The horny ring of the large suckers                            has twenty-five           to  thirty
  teeth in its distal semicircle            ;  those of the smaller about ten.
     The Surface is smooth,                   except       for   a    few irregular         inconstant
  papillae on one side of the ventral surface and below the eye.
     The Colour is        a pale      yellowish grey, darker above.
     The Shell is oval in outline,                   broadest       anteriorly to the middle,
  tapering somewhat               rapidly     in front and ending in a semicircle;
  posteriorly      it  tapers      gently, and, then              rounding off, ends iu two
 almost straight lines, which meet at a right angle at the base of                                     the
 spine.     The chitinous margin extends but slightly over the dorsal
 surface,    which shows two grooves                    diverging         as   they pass forwards,
 separating     three ribs, and is covered                  with rounded papillae arranged
 in curves parallel to the anterior margin.                            The ventral         surface    has

    The Body is elongated, broadest               about the middle of its length.
 The   fins   are    rather narrow, about one-fourth             the breadth of the
body, commencing            2  millim. from the anterior edge of the body and
approaching within           5  millim. of each other posteriorly          ;   the left is
somewhat broader than the right.                   The mantle-margin extends far
over the bead dorsally and is not emarginate but slightly undulating
ventrally.       The siphon is short, terminating far short of the                  depres
sion between the ventral arms.
    The Head is broad, and the              eyes  very prominent.
    The Arms are subequal, the order of length being                         4,   3, 1,  2 ;
they are one-fourth           the length of the body, all are flattened and
taper evenly to fine points.             The suckers are in four series, except in
the   right dorsal        arm,    where    they appear to be in two, probably
owing to       its   state    of extreme compression         ;  they are of medium
size,   many       are     deeply    notched       proximally     and    distally,      and
provided     with fine meridional            grooves   on the margin         :  the horny
ring is smooth and surrounded by a papillary area.                     The hectocotylus
is not developed.           The umbrella is small, widest between the lateral
arms, where       it  reaches    up to the sixth or seventh row of suckers.
The buccal       membrane        has   five distinct     points,    the ventral       edge
being thickened           and forming a large folded spermatic cushion;                   it
bears     no suckers.         The outer lip is thick, and marked with fine
 longitudinal      grooves ; the inner is papillate.

    The   Tentacles     are  as long       as the   mantle,      with a three-sided
flattened   stem,   much broader proximally           than distally.        The clul    is
slightly   expanded,       with   a  narrow protective membrane below,                   a
broad one above, and a distinct web outwardly.                      There are five      or
six series of suckers, slightly larger in the middle than at the margins,
on very long slender peduncles            : the horny ring is smooth.
    The Surface bears a number of small irregularly scattered papillae,
and four or five elongated warts near the origin of the fins on the
dorsum,    and    some folds in the skin           on the ventral surface; pro
bably these are due to contraction.
    The Colour is a dull grey with              a bluish shade above inclining
to yellow below.
    The Shell has an elongate oval outline, broadest                one-third of the
way back and rounded off at both ends.                   The chitinous margin           is
narrow anteriorly, then broader,             evanescent    posteriorly,     a deep cal
careous ridge forming the posterior extremity of the shell;                  it extends
very little over the dorsal surface,              which    bears only       faint indi
cations of a median ridge, and is beset with tine granules disposed
in rows parallel     to the anterior margin.           The ventral surface is ele
vated so as to give the shell a          more than average thickness : the last
loculus occupies       one-third the surface        and   is bounded by         a trans
verse hemielliptical curve       :  the striated area is excavated, but slightly
convex in the middle line.               The inner     cone    consists   only of     the
slightly elevated limbs, which run along three-quarters                 of the striated
area and unite with each other as a flattened               fillet posteriorly.      The
 spine has lost its extreme point, but is strong, and has raised a knife-
 like ridge developed       upon its ventral aspect.*

     The Body is short and stout,             broadest    about the middle of          its

                                        of Edinburgh, Session 1884-85.                                     305
The  fins are one-fourth as broad as the body, and placed much
nearer the dorsal than the ventral surface ; they commence 2 to 3
millim. from the anterior margin and are connected by a narrow
fillet behind               ;   a   slightly raised ridge             passes down the ventro- lateral
aspect of the body, similar to that seen                               in many       specimens     of Octopus
and Eledone   (possibly due to contraction).   The mantle-margin pro
jects very slightly dorsally, and is a trifle emarginate opposite the
funnel        :    the connective cartilages are deeper                          than in most species of
Sepia, but               there          is no distinct           knob as in Sepiella.            The siphon
reaches up to the depression between                                  the ventral arms.
    The Head is broad, and the                              eyes   prominent.
    The Arms are subequal, in order of length 3, 4, 2,                                           1 ;   they are
rather more than                        half   as   long   as   the body and distinctly three-sided,
having            a ridge        on the outer side of each, broadest on the ventral
ones ; they taper                       evenly to very fine points               ;   the inner surface of
each is            roughly papillate and has hemispherical                                depressions      into
which the suckers are retracted.                                    The suckers are in four series
throughout,                 almost hemispherical, not very oblique, and marked with
meridional               grooves          :    the horny ring bears              irregular     square    teeth.
The     hectocotylus                is not developed.              The umbrella is larger than usual
in the genus, reaching on an average                                  about one-third up the arms                 :
the buccal             membrane has seven not very prominent points, and there
is a spermatic cushion as usual                             :   the outer lip is very thin, the inner
thick and papillate.
     The Tentacle is about as long as the body, stout, indistinctly                                      three-
sided, and             tapering.               The club is short and but little expanded, with
a   narrow protective membrane                              on its outer side        ;   the sucker-bearing
area    is,       as   it   were, undermined on its inner aspect by                          a   deep groove
or fissure,            and internally to this again                    is   a   broad fin which reaches
down the tentacle for                          a    distance exceeding half the length of the
club.         There are three suckers much longer than the rest, whereof
the middle              one      is     the largest and the proximal                 the next, placed on
stout peduncles                     arising in deep depressions             ;    towards the outer side
of   the          club      is      a    series     of about four medium-sized suckers,                    and
beyond these again one                              or two series of minute ones.                 The horny
rings appear smooth under                             a    powerful lens.
     The Surface                 is     smooth in          general,   but there are        a   few irregular
papillae          in the ventro-lateral region.

     The Colour is               a     dull grey, with indications of annular markings
on the back.
     The Shell has                a    rhomboidal outline, with rounded                              anterior and
lateral angles             ;   the chitinous margin is narrow, widest behind, where
it   forms          a    flat, acute-angled             plate, the posterior                 extremity of the
shell    ;     it       covers       entirely, however,             the        dorsal        surface,       which is
slightly raised                mesially and marked                   by    a       number of faint               striae
radiating from the posterior                             end.       The ventral              surface        is much
elevated on either side of a median groove                                     ;   the last loculus occupies
one-sixth               of the surface, is bounded                   by a wavy line, and deeply
emarginate in the middle.                           The inner        cone is represented                   only by       a
narrow rib reaching half-way along each posterior                                             side of the shell
and meeting                its fellow in           a rounded          angle         behind, from which                   a
number of radiating calcareous streaks pass outwards                                               into the horny
termination.

     The Body             is   short, conical       ;    acuminate        and curving gently down
wards posteriorly.                      The fin    is   about one-third the length of the body,
and      considerably                 broader       than    long     ;   each half            is     roughly     semi
circular, and narrows                         in to its insertion both in front and behind.
The mantle-margin                      is     in general transverse, but projects slightly                         as   a
blunt rounded                  angle in the dorsal                  median          line.      The     mantle-con
nective consists                 of   a   groove     with       a   narrow fillet in the mid-dorsal
line fitting into               a    corresponding         median cartilaginous                    surface on the

 back of the neck, and            of a long linear ridge extending                    up to the
 margin, which fits          into a shorter groove on the base of the siphon ;
this is broad, short, and conical, has a                    thick suspensory ligament,
through the      skin of which two         muscles        may be distinguished, and a
distinct valve.
     The Head        is as large as the body, rounded at the sides                           and
flattened above and below.             The   eyes appear        to have been enormous,
one is    distended and protrudes from its orbit, whilst                          the other is
shrivelled.      There is no auricular       crest nor preocular pore, but behind
each eye     is a white papilla.
     The   Arms are about equal in length                      to   the head         and   body
together    ;  the dorsal are the shortest, the other three pairs subequals,
the order      of length being 3, 4,          2, 1 ;      they are quadrilateral,          with
rounded angles externally, with two slightly raised ridges internally,
on     which the suckers are situated             ;    they taper        gradually to very
 slender tips    ;   the third pair have       a  delicate narrow web along the
 third quarter       of their outer     aspect.        The suckers are in two series
 throughout ; they are small and distant along the proximal                               third
 (the webbed       portion) of the arms, then larger and closer, and finally
 minute and very closely set             towards the tips           ;   they are set trans
 versely on short conical peduncles,              spheroidal with            a  swollen band
  round the face.           The horny ring       is smooth proximally,               distally it
  bears about      five close-set, broad, bluntly rounded teeth.                      No   trace
  of a hectocotylus         could   be  found.         The     umbrella is found only
  between     the dorsal, dorso-lateral, and lateral arms                  ;   it takes  origin
  from    the sucker-hearing ridge and extends about one-third up the
  arm.     The buccal membrane is broad and somewhat contracted over
  the mouth ;      it   has the usual seven points, but they are very                     blunt
  and   indistinct    ;  it is united by  three ligaments         with     the web between
  the dorsal    and dorso-lateral arms, by            a  ligament with the inner side
  of each ventro-lateral arm on its ventral                  aspect     and by another to
   the inner surface of each ventral arm, there being altogether seven
  ligaments.       The membrane bears no suckers                  ;   its inner surface        is
  much creased        and folded.      The outer lip is very thin and smooth,
  and   hidden between the creased integument of the buccal membrane
  and   the inner     lip, which is thick and marked with irregular radial
 grooves.
      The Tentacles have been removed               ;   the stumps which remain are

308                    Proceedings     of the  Royal Society
not half the length of the arms         ; they are quadrangular and flattened
from above downwards.
   The Surface        bears a large    number of papillae, slightly elevated,
resembling those of Calliteuthis ; they are arranged most thickly                   on
the ventral aspect of the head and body, but also on the dorsal, and
extend up the outer aspect of the arms, three series on the ventral
arms, two on each         of the  others.    Near the tip of each dorsal          arm
is a series    of   four    or five black, elongate,       egg-shaped     swellings,
gradually    diminishing       in size, and forming       apparently an extreme
development of the papillae above mentioned.                  The   second pair of
arms appears to have         been   similarly provided     ; the third has       been
so stripped of integument towards the tips that it is impossible                     to
ascertain their original condition.           In   the fourth the warts at         the
tip are quite similar to those lower down the arm.
   The Colour is a dull purplish madder, paler above than below,                   the
papillae   are  a deep      black, with a white         centre,   usually   situated
towards the anterior margin.            The   buccal    membrane, both      sides of
the umbrella, and the inner surfaces of                the arms,    so far as this
extends,   are a deep purple.
   The    Gladius has not           yet been      extracted    from   the    solitary

   The Body is        subcylindrical,    somewhat narrowing          towards and
bluntly   rounded at the posterior extremity.               The fins are small,
separate;  each is somewhat rectangular in shape, with rounded angles,
and attached to     the body by one angle.
   The mantle-margin is almost transverse,              but projects slightly in
the dorsal median line, and forms a shallow sinus behind each eye
and the siphon.        The   mantle-connective      consists of a long linear
ridge, extending quite to the margin, and fitting into              a   similar but
somewhat shorter and broader             groove   on the base of the siphon,
which is short,      tapering, and bluntly pointed, fits into a shallow
depression   below the head, but has no dorsal bridles.
   The    Head    is much broader than           the body, being          distended

310                   Proceedings     of  the  Royal Society
laterally by the enormous eyes which look outwards and forwards,
and have bright, prominent, glistening lenses.
    The Arms are unequal, the order of length being 4, 3, 2,                  1, and
about one-fourth the length of the body               : they are all conical and
taper to slender points      ; each has a   distinct angle along the outer side,
which expands to a distinct web in the fourth pair                ;  there is also   a
very narrow delicate web along each side of the sucker bearing                   face.
The suckers are very minute, pedunculate, and are arranged in two
rows,    almost embedded        in the arm    : they are spheroidal, and have
a smooth horny ring,         surrounded by two or three rows of conical
papillae.     The hectocotylus     was not present.         The buccal membrane
is very large, has the usual seven points, connected by ligaments
with    the arms ; each    joint   bears one or two suckers.
    The Tentacles      are almost equal      in length    to the head      and body
together   ;  the stem is very slender, cylindrical, and grooved along the
inner aspect     ;  they taper away rapidly towards the extremity, no
club   being formed      :  the suckers      cover only the distal eighth of
the tentacle in its inner aspect        ;  they are smaller than those of the
sessile   arms, and almost imperceptible to the naked eye; they are
urn-shaped, and have a smooth horny ring, surrounded by about two
rows of very small papillae.
    The Surface is covered with minute wrinkles, probably due to the
action of the spirit
    The Colour is a very deep purplish brown.
    The    Gladius    was     unfortunately     somewhat damaged          ;  for   the
anterior     two-thirds    it  resembles     that    of an Ommastnphes,            but
posteriorly    it expands into    a broad blade, resembling that of Loligo ;
it  was impossible to ascertain whether           it forms   a terminal cone.

     In    several   papers communicated to the Society              within   recent
years the thermal         effect   of compressing water has been dealt with
by various observers.            The present     paper   gives the results of ex
 periments of a similar        kind   to ascertain   the thermal effects of com
pressing certain solids and liquids.              These experiments were con
 ducted in the      University of Edinburgh, under            the superintendence
of Professor Tait,
    Pressure      was applied     by forcing water by means of          a  powerful
force    pump into a strong steel tube, called the "small gun" (shown
in section       in the accompanying figure).           Within this, a thermo
electric    junction of nickel and iron wires           was placed,    most   of the
wire    within the gun being in the form of           a coil, so that the junction
could be     drawn up and pushed down as required.                The wires passed
out of the     gun between two well-oiled          leather discs, which could be
tightly     screwed    together between       a steel   plate and    a  similar one
 forming the lower part of the           gun      The nickel wire formed, with
 an iron wire,     another junction, called the " outer junction," which
 was kept      in water at a uniform       temperature.       The two iron wires
 were connected       with  a Thomson's dead-beat        galvanometer (resistance

 1"5 ohms at 10°   C).    When the wires were      reversed     the deflections
differed by about      1 per cent.    The upper orifice of the gun was
closed  with   a steel plug, of the form shown        in the diagram, and
secured   by  a slot passing through plug and gun.               At the lower
orifice was a tap to allow      of a sudden release of         pressure.       The
gauge for measuring the pressure has been already described, and a
figure of it will be found in the " Challenger

                                                tons on the square inch
                                                could be applied almost
instantaneously by two strokes of the pump handle;                  the deflec
tion of the galvanometer was simultaneously taken, and when                     the
spot of  light had  steadied,  the pressure was let off instantaneously,
the deflection of the galvanometer being observed.               The data for
converting these     deflections into degrees centigrade were obtained

                         of Edinburgh,      Session   1884-85.                         313
from experiments          made from time to time         to determine       the deflec
tion arising from known changes of temperature of the outer junction.
The     galvanometer        was   delicate   enough    to enable      us to      measure
differences        of  temperature      amounting      to   less   than     -01     degree
centigrade,        and yet not so sensitive       as to be     seriously affected by
the traffic     in  the street without.       Each result recorded below is the
mean     of at least five experiments; in the          case   of pressures of about
two tons each result is usually the mean of ten.                    22 o divisions%f
the    pressure      gauge correspond      to   a  pressure     of one ton on the
square     inch, or about 150 atmospheres.
    Each day, with the exception              of those on which we found the
exact     value of galvanometer          readings   by observing the            result of
known changes of temperature               of the outer junction,         it was       our
habit to take a series of observations            for water alone, by means of
which we could verify the                previously ascertained        equivalent        of
galvanometer readings.
    It  was    generally observed that the fall of temperature               on relaxa
tion of pressure was greater than the corresponding                 rise on applying
 pressure,     owing to some extent        to the fact     that pressure could be
 more     suddenly     relieved    than applied.       In   the case of water,          we
 observed,      as the   mean result      of many     experiments,      that the two
 differed   in the proportion of about         14  to 13.      Thus, on applying          a
 pressure of      two ton3 on the square inch, we obtained                a deflection
 of T3, equivalent          to   0o-31   C;    while on releasing        pressure      the
 deflection    was 1'4, equivalent to 0°-33 C.           This   at a temperature         of
 16°   C., at which, by      Sir W. Thomson's formula,          the rise of tempera
 ture should be 0°-35 C.
     Some    reduction thus seems necessary of the results              given      in the
 tables     below,     though     not in the      same     proportion,     since      con
 vection    currents    present in the considerably large quantity of water
 which filled the gun, would be wanting in the solids and the com
 paratively small quantities of liquids used.
     To furnish an idea of the general agreement                  in the results, we
  give the    full data from one experiment,          taken at random         ;  namely,
  the   effect    produced    in   vulcanite    by changes      of pressure       to   the
  extent of about      two tons on the square inch.

    Thus taking the mean of nine experiments,                           and having found, in
the manner referred             (o above, that 4-8 divisions on the galvanometer
scale are equivalent to 1°                 C,   we deduce the rise of temperature                     on
applying       *|!| tons      on the square inch, to he 0C*5G                 C,   and the fall       on
relieving \,1'- J tons        to be 0o-52 C.            Hence we can deduce the rise or
fall per ton,       as  shown in the table under Vulcanite.

could be obtained.               A    reference      to the      following       table will show
that, for this substance, the fall of temperature                        on relieving pressure
is considerably less than the rise on application of pressure.                                    This
result had been given by Professor Tait in                              a   Note      in    the Pro-
ceediiujs (May 16, 1881), and                   it  was to some extent             with    a view to
the discovery of like anomalies                     that the present          investigation        was

5.    On a Method of Measuring the Resistance                         of Electrolytes
           without endeavouring to prevent Polarisation.                           By Mr
           W. Peddie.
      In the     case of a metallic conductor the resistance              may be got at
  once by means of Ohm's Law.                  But when the conductor,           the resist

ance of which is to he determined, is an electrolyte, the electromotive
force acting along the circuit                     is only partly employed                        in producing
the current.              So that we obtain the equation
                                               E       =   I!x    +   P,
where        E      is the electromotive force,                   R the         resistance,       x   the current,
and      P   the reverse electromotive force of polarisation.                                         Since, for       a
considerable stretch of values of the current,                                    P    seems to be propor
tional to        it,    we may write
where
             p
             is      a    constant for the given values of x.                                That      is     to    say,
if    the ordinary method of measuring resistance                                      could be used, what
would be measured                   is    the actual resistance plus an unknown quan
tity.        Hence,       in   most       methods           of experimenting,                alternating cur
rents, or non-polarisable electrodes,                           are used so as to prevent polarisa
tion.        In Horsford's            method,      p       is    eliminated by giving                 R    different
values, while             x remains constant.                     The difficulty             here consists            in
the fact that polarisation may not be the same in both cases, for the
nature of the solution at the electrodes                                   may be different because                   of
the liberated ions.                 The object of this paper                     is    to describe        a   method
of measuring the resistance which                                is   free from this objection.                     The

Hence the difference between        the resistances     of the two parts of the
electrolyte   may be calculated    in   terms of a known resistance and of
known currents.         In this form of the       experiments,      however,   it  is
assumed that      polarisation is proportional        to   the current    density.
Also there     is the objection that heating is going on, usually to
different   extents, in the two parts, because           of the currents being
different.    Both   these sources    of error vanish       if x' is equal   to   y\
and then equation (3) reduces to
                                     p =  r.
    I have  as yet made only     a very rough series of experiments with
the view of testing the steadiness           of the currents, but it seems to
indicate that the method      will be successful.       The form in which the
experiments     were  conducted is that to which equation (3) applies.
In addition to the errors above indicated as affecting the results,
there  were causes tending to produce large variations arising from
the roughness of the apparatus         set up provisionally.         Three cylin
drical glass cups were connected        in  series by two glass tubes inserted
near their    lower    edge.   The electrolyte (a 5 per cent, aqueous
solution of sulphuric acid) was poured into this arrangement,                   and
the electrodes    (platinum)    dipped into it through the open ends of
the cups.     The cups were of large volume, so that the resistance of
the portion    of liquid   between   the electrodes and the extremities of
 the tubes could be neglected.      The lengths of the tubes were 9-2 and
 8'5 centimetres   respectively, and their diameter was           -65 centimetre.
 The metal wire used to connect        the extreme electrodes had        a  resist

sary to produce a current.          The following figures show the       readings,

This    series of readings is one of the most unsteady obtained, and it
was found       on testing that most of the variations          might be due      to
alteration of the electromotive force of the battery employed, or                 to
alteration of contact         at the various junctions      of the circuit.     The

The value of the specific resistance deduced from these observations
agrees very closely with previous determinations by other methods.
    Evidently the method may             be used to investigate       the laws of
variation     of polarisation      with current density.        For   we have     as
above
                           ry = (R  + p)x-ny+Pl-p.2.
 And    we may put generally
where     / (y)   is some     function   of the current y,     P is the E. II. F.
required to decompose the electrolyte, and a is the area of the                elec"
trode.      Hence,    if x = y, we get
                               -='+
                                       &4)/M-
 So  if  a = a    we get    r = p.   If now   we make a'k = a and adjust the
 currents to equality by altering        />, we have
where     p  is known in terms of p, so that        / (y) is determinate.
    Again, either of equations        (1) or (2) may be used to find the value
of p, which        is the electromotive force of polarisation produced by
unit current.

 6.    Note on the Contraction of the Auricles of the Pig's Heart.
           By   J.    MacFadyean,         M.B.,   B.Sc.,     M.R.C.V.S.,        and    G.
           Sims Woodhead,           M.D.
    It    is a familiar      fact that the heart of cold-blooded vertebrates
may continue          to beat    for a  long period — even for days — after its
removal from the          body, but it is not   so  well known tbat contractions
may occur        in the heart of the higher vertebrates            for  a  considerable
time      after death.        On this latter point, however, there are many
observations on record.             Harvey noted that rhythmical contractions
continued in the heart of the pigeon for some time after death, and,
further, that after        it  had ceased to beat,    it recovered     its vigour, and
both      auricles     and    ventricles   pulsated     on   the     application    of  a
stimulus, such as the tip of the finger wetted with saliva.*
    Lewes also quotes from Donders, that                " Harless     observed    it (the
heart) beating       in the body of      a decapitated     murderer one hour after
execution.         Margo found the right auricle beating two hours and a
half after the execution, although not a trace of               irritability could     be
detected      in the other parts of the heart.              Dietrich,     Gerlach, and
Herz found that both ventricles contracted                if one was irritated forty
minutes after         death."      The same author further quotes, from Emil
Rousseau,       the    case    of a woman whose         heart had these rhythmic
movements          seven-and-twenty hours after she had been guillotined.
Landoisf points out that numerous observations have been made by
Pannum, Valentin,            and others    during recent years on the excised
heart      of  rabbits,     dogs,   &c, and that       even    so early as 300 b.c.
movements         in an excised heart bad been recorded by Clean thes.
    Our attention was specially drawn to this subject by the behaviour
of a pig's heart        which    was obtained at the Edinburgh             Abattoir for
some     inoculation experiments in connection with pig typhoid.                       At
10.25 a.m. the         animal was killed in the way commonly practised
by butchers,        viz., by first stunning      it by    a  blow on the cranium
with     a  heavy mallet, and then by cutting             across    the great vessels
at    the   root    of   the neck.      It  was   allowed to bleed          for   a few
minutes until apparently dead.               The thorax was then opened, and

 the heart and lungs were cut out together.                       While this was        being
 done, the heart was observed                 to give a few pulsations,          which      led
 the butcher        to remark       that the animal was not quite dead.                       A
 string was then firmly tied round the great vessels at the                           base of
 the heart, which was next separated                   from the lungs by cutting the
 vessels on the distal side of the ligature.                   The heart on being laid
 aside    on a table       began      to   pulsate slowly        but rhythmically,         the
 contractions taking place in both auricles and ventricles.                           After    a
 few    minutes spent in            examining         the   remaining    viscera      of   the

 of other organs          were     wrapped up together,            and carried        to   the
 University      Now Buildings, the Abattoir being left at 10-35.
     At    10.50,     when     the     parcel    was     opened    in  the    Pathological
 Laboratory,       it   was    observed     that spontaneous          contractions       were
 st ill occurring       at   intervals     in   the     auricles   of the     heart.       On
 stimulating      the right       auricle by slight          scratching with a pin,           a
 contraction      of     that cavity       was     easily    obtained,   and      this    was
 immediately followed by contraction of the left auricle.                          Stimula
 tion of the left auricle produced               a  contraction of that cavity, but
 did not affect the right auricle.               These     experiments were        repeated
 several times, and always with the same result.
     Both    auricles continued to beat spontaneously                    till   11.12,    the
 contraction occurring first in the                 right, and this being          followed
immediately by          a contraction of the left
     After   11.16     contractions of the left auricle were obtainable only
 by direct stimulation, the right auricle, however,                   continued      to beat
till   11.19.
    At    1 1.28   fibrillary    twitchings       were obtained on slightly stimu
lating the posterior part of the right                    auricle, where      it  was still
moist,    and by increasing the stimulus, stronger contractions resulted.
    At   11.33   the     same results were obtained on stimulating                  the left
auricle.
    At   11.28, and again at         1 1.40, stimulation produced only fibrillary
contraction.
    At   11.44, on stimulating strongly the upper and inner part of the
right auricle,      a  strong contraction resulted, with              a peculiar     tetanic
appearance of the muscle along the line of stimulation.                     This    part, as
compared       with     the   other parts,       which      had   previously     failed   to

respond      on stimulation, had more blood beneath                 it in  the cavity of
the auricle, and        it  was also     still moist  on its outer surface.
     Between 11.47 a.m. and              1.25 p.m. the left auricle was stimulated
seventeen       times,     a  contraction following        each    stimulus.      In   one
instance,      at     12.43,    two     strong contractions followed           a    single
stimulus.
     At 1.28, on slightly            distending the right auricle         by squeezing
blood into         and from        the   ventricle, contraction was obtained             on
stimulating        any point, each contraction being circumscribed.                     At
1.38 contractions          were fainter, and not obtainable at every point.
     At    1.40, after      fully distending       the auricle,  a  very marked con
traction followed, and extended                  along the whole inner border of
 the auricle.
     At   1.50 a    similar but less extensive contraction was obtained in
 the same way.
     At    1.5  stimulation        of the distended      auricle   produced     a double
 contraction along its border,            and strong but circumscribed contrac
 tions at several other points.
     At    2.1  the empty auricle was stimulated, but without                  response.
  On distending          the    cavity,     contractions at several       points     were
  obtained on stimulation.
     At   2.6  the auricle was distended,            and on stimulation some feeble
  contractions       were      obtainable, but        only   at  a  few points.        The
  heart was      immersed       in water at 100° Fahr. for about one minute.
  On    stimulation        there     was    no response.      The    organ    was     next
  immersed      in cold water (about 50° Fahr.), but no contractions could
  be obtained.
      Summary.      — Spontaneous contractions in left                  auricle    for   47
  minutes.        Contractions could be induced in it on stimulation                      of
  right 4 minutes after this.              It  responded    to direct stimulation       for
   exactly 3 hours from the             time    the animal was killed.        The right
   auricle    continued       to    beat    spontaneously for        54   minutes.        It
   responded      to stimulation for 3 hours and 41 minutes.
      In    another     heart    obtained at the        same time,      which was not
   otherwise      examined,      fibrillary contraction of the muscular wall of
   the    right ventricle,         near    the    auriculo-ventricular      groove,     was
   observed    half an hour after death.

malian heart         should   have     a   most     important         bearing upon the
question of resuscitation, after death             from haemorrhage,           chloroform
poisoning, and other forms of syncope, and we determined to make                                a
series of experiments with the view of clearing up some points still
under discussion.          As yet   we have had opportunity                of making but
 one of these experiments, but we hope                 ere long to be able to com
 municate      further observations.          Immediately after we had formed
 this resolution an opportunity presented                 itself, but before we            had
 made the       necessary arrangements         as   to recording apparatus.                The
 observation is of the roughest             kind, but      appears      to   us to    be      of
 sufficient importance to put on record.
    An animal       condemned     for pig typhoid was killed as in the                  other
              was noticed that the animal " bled very slowly.

 case.    It
    The heart was removed          as    rapidly   as possible,       and whilst all        the
 cavities   were   still beating.     In    the   meantime         defibrinated     sheep's
 blood,   mixed with       2 parts  of        per   cent,    salt    solution    had been
                                          %
raised to    a  temperature     of 99° Fahr.
    A cannula      (too   small) was tied into one of the pulmonary veins,
 and    connected     by about 9 inches of elastic tubing with a similar
 cannula in the       pulmonary artery.          A third cannula            was tied      into
 the   inferior   vena    cava, and     another was fastened             into the     aorta.
 The superior vena cava was firmly ligatured at                     a  distance    of about
three-quarters      of an inch from the auricle.                All   these   tubes     were
first filled with the blood mixture,               as  was       also a   " Higginson's        "
 syringe,   which was fitted on to the cannula in the inferior                          vena
cava.     These operations       occupied     20 minutes, and by the time they
were completed          the  ventricles had        ceased       to contract,      and      the
auricles   were beating very intermittently            and feebly.
    Warm blood solution was now pumped slowly and steadily                               into
the right ventricle, and        the heart was suspended               in the   same    fluid.
Tl us    was almost      immediately followed by            a   full and     regular     con
traction of both auricles, the beats being,               as    far as we could       deter
mine with the eye, quite synchronous.                 This went        on regularly from
12.40 to 12.55, when the right auricle suddenly ceased to beat                               at
all regularly, and only       a  few irregular contractions could be              obtained
on stimulating with the point of a needle.                     Whilst     the auricle    was
contracting, the lower part of the superior vena                        cava    (that part
below the ligature) was also contracting regularly and firmly.                          This

beat    did not merge into that of the auricle, but was perfectly in
dependent of             it,   and the cava continued to beat for at least two
minutes after the auricular                     beat had ceased.         Whilst       the examina
tion and stimulation of the right auricle and superior cava were going
on, the heart        had been withdrawn from the blood, and the distension
had not been          kept up.
  At      1.30, on examining the left auricle,                    it   also was found to have
stopped      contracting.             It   was stimulated with           the point of       a   needle,
bat there was            still no contraction.                 On removing the connecting
tube from the            pulmonary vein and immersing the heart, and pump
ing in blood solution              until the left auricle          was moderately distended,
there     were      several       distinct        contractions which were repeated                    on
touching the         wall with           the poiut of a needle.              Similar contractions
were obtained            at 1.23, 1.24, and 1.26,                on applying      the point of         a
needle.
   1.23,         on stimulating             the    left   auricle with the needle,               slight
fibrillar contractions were observed.                          On distending the cavity the
contraction was more distinctly                       marked.
   1.40,     after       distension,           on stimulating      with needle,       several      very
strung wavy          contractions were observed.
   1.52, dead        ;   not     even      a   fibrillar twitching.
   An attempt was made to induce contraction in the right auricle
 by    distending,        after the left auricle had been distended and had
contracted,        but without any effect                 ;   not even   a   fibrillar contraction
after 12.55.
   Summary.          — The right auricle                  beat    regularly     for    35     minutes
after      the    animal commenced                    to bleed to death, and 15 minutes
after the heart            was placed             in blood.      Irregular     contractions          con-
 tinned      for not           more        than   a   minute after this.          Contraction          of
 the superior        vena cava continued for two minutes later.                               The left
 auricle     beat regularly              for about 55 minutes             from commencement
 of    the   bleeding,         and 35 minutes after the                  heart was          placed     in
 blood.          More or less regular contractions could be induced for at
 least 25 minutes              longer.
   It     will    be seen,      on comparison of the two cases, that contractions
 ceased      much sooner           in      the heart specially prepared.               It   should be
 noted       in   this connection that there were two points of difference.
  (1)   In   the first     case,      tension was maintained in the cavities of the

328                     Proceedings      of   the  Royal Society
heart by the ligature which was applied whilst some blood remained
in the organ     ; whilst in the second            case   the tension was kept up,
irregularly and intermittently, by means of the "Higginson"                     syringe,
and by stopping the outflow of the                  fluid at the various points in
turn.     (2)   Whilst both        pigs were      diseased, the    lesions were     more
pronounced in the viscera of the second animal, and the vitality                         of
the tissues might be expected             to be somewhat       lower.
    The points to      be  specially noted in the second          c ise are — (a) that,
contrary to what is usually observed,                  movements     were   arrested in
the right auricle before          those    in  the left had     ceased  ; (b) that     the
contraction of the superior vena cava was quite independent of                        that
of the auricle, a contraction occurring before                   each contraction        of
the auricle.
    The latter observation coincides with those quoted from Haller
and Xysten by Landois, loc. cit., p. 69: — "Independent rhythmical
contractions of the vena;          cava? and    pulmonary veins are often        noticed
after the heart has ceased to beat."
    Stirling   also notes     that such contractions can be observed in                the
veins of the rabbit after the heart is cut out of the body.
    The contraction of the superior vena                 cava   was   so distinct and
forcible that it suggested to us the idea that it might, under                   certain
conditions,     be sufficient to produce        a  distinct sound which might           be
referred   to the orifice.
   It is interesting to note, in connection with this contraction,                   that
we were      able   to trace     striped muscular fibre in the wall of                 the
superior vena cava at least          1
                                       1 inch from the orifice.

        Presence       of Water,       as determined         by the Measurement
        of the Electromotive Force of the Zinc-Iodine                       Cell.      By
        A. P. Laurie, Esq., B.A., B.Sc.
   During     the spring     of  1 882   Mr Burton       and  I communicated       some
preliminary experiments on             a new method         of measuring the      heats
of combination of the metals with the halogens.*
   In this     paper   I  propose    to show the result of the application              of
                      *
                         Proceedings   of R.S.E., 1881-82.

  the method to the            study of the heats of combination of iodine and
  zinc in presence of water.
     The heats         of combination are in each case obtained from the
  electromotive force           of either the zinc-iodine         cell, or of the zinc-
  cuprous    iodide celL
     The zinc-iodine           cell consists of a zinc rod and a platinum wire
 dipped    in    a  water solution of iodine and iodide of zinc.
     The zinc-cuprous           iodide cell consists of       a zinc rod, and    a copper
 wire coated       with cuprous iodide, dipped in          a solution of iodide of zinc.
    When        a   current passes through          a given zinc-iodine cell, various
 changes      take place requiring either the production or absorption of
 heat     In      the fir3t place, there        is the combination of the zinc and
 iodine,   producing heat          ; in  the second place, there is the solution of
the zinc       iodide formed, producing heat.                On    the  other hand, the
disintegration         of the zinc, the decomposition of the iodine             molecule,
and the      removal of the free iodine from its solution in zinc iodide,
absorb    heat
    If  now a series of cells are made up differing only                 in the strength
of    the    zinc iodide         solution,     the heat of       solution   of  the   zinc
iodide formed           in   the   cell during the passage of        a current  will vary
with the strength of the iodide of zinc solution, and that probably
in a way      familiar       to chemists    from the behaviour of sulphuric acid
when added           in larger and larger quantities to         water.
    On the         other hand, the heat           of combination       of the zinc and
iodine, and the heat absorbed                 in decomposing the iodine molecule
and disintegrating the zinc, will probably remain the same.                            We
shall, in fact, find that the infinitely small quantity of zinc iodide
dissolved on passing a current has a definite heat of solution deter
mined      by the amount of zinc iodide already dissolved                   in the water
contained in the cell.
    Further,        if  a series of cells are       made     up differing    only in the
amount of free             iodine dissolved in a given iodide of zinc solution,
we shall        find the heat absorbed            in removing the iodine from its
solution       in zinc iodide diminish             as   the    amount    of free    iodine
present     is increased.
    It  is also probable that the heat of solution of a constant quantity
 of iodine       will vary with variations in           the strength of the iodide of
 zinc.

electromotive force of                      a   cell with the heat set free by the reactions
taking place,              assumed              that this correspondence                existed.     Recent
experiments have shown, however, that this                                   is   not   a   true assumption
in       many cases,        and Ilelmholtz has recently treated the subject from
a   new point of view.*
     The following               is,   as
                                        I       understand        it,   the outcome         of his work   on
chemical combination, in                         so   far   as   it   applies to finding the connec
tion between the heats of combination and the electromotive force                                          of
the cell.
     In    general,        when an infinitely small current de passes through                               a
cell at     a   given absolute temperature                        6,
                                                                  a     certain   amount of heat, dQ,
must be supplied to or removed from the cell to keep its temperature
constant, apart from the heat developed by the electric resistance                                         of
the liquid.
     If    the electromotive force                    of the cell corresponds exactly to                  the
heat given out by the reaction taking place in the cell, then no heat
need be added or removed.
     Now the          measurement                of this cooling or heating of the cell would
be difficult          in    practice,           but, applying           the second          law of thermo
dynamics, Ilelmholtz obtains the following formula, showing that                                           •
measure of dQ can be obtained from the variations in electromotive
force due to temperature                        —
where dp         is   the variation in electromotive force due to temperature.
     It    is   necessary,         then, in practice to measure                         the electromotive
force of the cell experimented upon at different temperatures                                           and
find the variation,               if   any, of the electromotive force.

variation of -0001 volt per deg. cent, would mean     correction of                         a
•03      volt, or   3   per cent to be applied before determining the heat                                 of
combination from the electromotive force.

    The heat of          combination       can    seldom     be  obtained with much
accuracy      from books on           thermal chemistry, the conditions under
which the reactions have been performed                    in the calorimeter differing
considerably from the conditions in the cell.
    For example, three numbers are given by Naumann                        as represent
ing the heat        of combination of zinc and iodine in presence of water             —
    1st,   The heat of combination of zinc and iodine in water, 60540
calorics.
     2nd,    The      heat   of    solution     of   zinc iodide     in water,     11310
calorirs.
     3rd, The heat          of combination         of zinc and iodine obtained by
 subtracting the second from the first, 49230 calorics.
     Now the first and second numbers                  are obviously average results,
 the zinc iodide        formed dissolving in pure water at the beginning of
 the reaction,       but in   a  strong zinc iodide solution towards the end.
     If   care    has been      taken to use the same quantities of water and
 zinc    iodide     in both experiments, no doubt the third number repre
  sents   fairly well the heat of combination of zinc and iodine.
      The above        criticism     applies to Thomson's          book, though more
  details are usually given by him.                 It  is consequently impossible to
  compare        with    exactness     these    numbers with those obtained by
  measuring the heats of combination in the iodine cell.
      In   the following       experiments on the zinc-iodine and zinc-cuprous
  iodide cell,      I  have used Professor Tait's Thomson electrometer                   to
  measure       the electromotive forces           obtained.     Alder Wright      recom
  mends       a   high resistance       galvanometer       for the purpose,     which is
  certainly more delicate,           but not more reliable than this particular
  instrument.
       About      50 divisions      of the scale correspond       to one volt, and    it  is
   possible     to read to half a division.
       As   a   standard of electromotive force              a  Daniell cell   was used,
   made up        according to the directions given by Alder Wright,* but
   specially constructed         to make diffusion of the two liquids practically
   impossible.        This cell     has,  according to Wright, an electromotive
   force of     1107 volts.

    To check this cell,        I  used  two Latimer Clerk       cells, one made up
two years ago, the other made up quite recently.                       Taking     Lord
Raleigh's recent determination of the electromotive force of this                   cell
(1 "454       volts), the three cells agreed with          each  other within       the
errors of experime nt.
     The electrometer       was connected     to a vocker so constructed that the
zero of the instrument, the deflection due to the cell to be measured,
 and the deflection         due to the Daniell cell, could be noted one after
 the     other.     This   was always done, and the numbers given at the
 end are always the mean of several readings.                  The Daniell did      not
 alter at all from week to week.
     When very small variations in electromotive                  force   had    to be
 measured,        two or three cells were placed in series, and        in  some   cases
 cells were connected        to the electrometer through similarly constructed
 cells, especially      to note the effects of temperature.           !No   correction
 has been        made for the new determination of the            B.A. unit,    as this
 affects      both the electromotive force and the zinc dissolved by unit
 current.        Consequently      the  error   introduced in calculating from
 electromotive force to heat of combination is very slight.*
     With       the   above     apparatus    the    following    experiments      were
 made      :—
     1.   Experiments       to find the effect on the        electromotive force      of
 the cell of varying the nature of the zinc.
     2.   Experiments       to find the effect on the electromotive force of
 the cell of varying the temperature            of the cell.
      3.   Experiments      to find the effect of varying the strength of the
 iodide of zinc solution.           For these the cuprous iodide cell was used,
 as   simplifying      the changes taking place in the cell.
      4.   Experiments      on varying the       strength of the free iodine       pre
 sent.
      5.   Experiments      on   varying the strength of the iodide of             zinc
  solution in the iodine cell.
      (1)    In making      measurements     with the electrometer,       the surface
  condition of the metals used is evidently of great importance,                  as so
  little current     is drawn from the cell.         If  wet zinc is exposed to the
  air it becomes         coated   with   a film of hydrate, which perceptibly
  lowers the electromotive force of the cell.

    I     could find no difference                   between           the deflections           given by zinc
electro-deposited                  from pure zinc, zinc "                    free   from arsenic,"           zinc
cleaned      with sand-paper,                  zinc corroded by the iodine solution, and
zinc    with       a    freshly-broken           crystalline surface.                   Probably,       if two or
three      cells       in     series      had been used, slight differences                        in    electro
motive       force would               have     appeared,         as   is shown by Alder Wright's
results     with modifications of the Daniell cell.*                                      It    is well known
that      when          a     crystalline       metal        is treated        with      a     weak acid the
crystalline structure is brought out by the dissolving of the crystals,
which have been cut through in smoothing the surface of the metal,
and there              is,   therefore,       probably   a     slight difference of electromotive
force between                 a smooth-filed zinc surface                    and    a    broken crystalline
zinc surface.                 This   difference,     however,           is   too small to be shown on
the electrometer                  with one cell.
    (2) Two iodine                   cells     in series, containing                a   dilute    solution of
iodine and of iodide of zinc, were raised from 10° C. to 50° C.                                               No
variation of electromotive force could be detected,                                       showing that the
electromotive force does not vary -0001 in 1° C.
    Consequently                the correction,      if      any, to be applied before calculat
ing the heat of combination from the electromotive force                                          is    less than
2   per cent.
    One iodine cell, made                       up with       a   saturated         solution of iodide of
zinc,     was raised              from 17° C. to              70s C.         No variation of             electro
motive       force could be detected.

           A   series of measurements                   of the electromotive force of the zinc-
cuprous        iodide cell, with varying strengths of iodide of zinc, were
made.        The amount of zinc iodide in each solution used was esti
mated       by    determining volumetrically the amount of combined iodine.
    The temperature                    of the room during the experiments varied                               a
little above and below 20° C.
    The results               of the observations are given in the table (a) at the
end of the paper.

possibly present       in the distilled      water, but probably this number
sbould not be taken         as being   a trustworthy statement       of the heat  of
solution of the first few molecules of iodide of zinc, as the reactions
in   the  cell are very complicated in this           case.    The next number
obtained for    a  solution of    •003 grms.     Zul2 in  1  grm. of water is pro
bably safer as     a  starting-point for a curve.
    Evidently    the determination         of the heat of solution of the      first
traces of a salt is difficult even by this method,         though   a  much  nearer
approximation can be obtained than that possible in the calorimeter.
    It was   noticed, in the case of the stronger solutions, that on           first
placing the zinc rod, damp with distilled water, in the solution,               the
electromotive force of the cell was           2 or 3 per cent, too   high, quickly
falling  to a constant value.       This    was no doubt due to the temporary
dilution of   a  layer of liquid next the zinc, and the effect disappeared
on drying the zinc with filter paper.
   On looking       at the table,    it  is noticeable that the electromotive
force begins to     fall off   more rapidly again as the solution approaches
concentration.       This is possibly       due to the more concentrated solu
tion containing,      as  is well known, an excess          of zinc, and being in
fact no longer zinc iodide.         This part of    the table requires, however,
further investigation.
   (4) The variations in the electromotive force, caused by gradually
increasing the amount of free iodine in a cell containing a constant
amount of zinc iodide, are given in the table (b).
    The free iodine present was estimated with standard hyposulphite
solution in the usual way.
    This table requires no particular remark.
    (5) Three determinations of the variation of the electromotive
force of the zinc iodine cell were made, due. to varying the strength
of the iodide of zinc, one in an iodine solution in distilled water,
one in a zinc iodide solution            of medium strength, and one in             a
saturated    iodide of zinc solution.           The results are to be found in
the table (c).*
    If these numbers are subtracted from those obtained for correspond
 ing solutions in the cuprous iodide cell, the numbers obtained show
that the curve for the zinc iodine cell is slightly different, rising               a
   *
      Very similar results have been obtained for sulphates and chlorides         by
Alder Wright, Phil. Mag., 1884.

little    higher for     distilled water, and not falling quite                so low for
saturated      iodide of zinc.
    On comparing          these   numbers with those            already mentioned         as
given by Nanmann, we find that the                    number (expressed           in volts)
which he        gives for the heat of combination of zinc and iodine is
l'Ooo volts.         The electromotive force of an iodine cell with about
¦04 crm.      of free iodine, in saturated       iodide of zinc solution, is          1 082
volts.      Naumann gives the heat of solution of zinc iodide in water
as    -1 62  volts.     The    average     number obtained          from the      curve is
•110     volts.    The number given by Naumann is higher, because it
does not represent           the  average     heat  of solution up to          a saturated
 solution    of zinc iodide.
     In conclusion,       I  think   these experiments are sufficient to show
 that we have here          a method    peculiarly suitable for the determination
 of   the heat      of solution     of salts,    as   it  is   possible     to study the
 behaviour of the salt under any required constant conditions.
     For instance, the heat of solution            of zinc iodide in       water contain
 ing other salts      in solution could       be evidently determined with great
 accuracy     by this method.          It   seems probable that another advan
  tage   of the method is that no heat requires               to be absorbed       in vary
  ing the salt     from    a solid to  a  liquid   state.     I  have     not found any
  indication that the heat required for this change, in the case of zinc
  iodide, is at    all considerable.

 one another, each being equal to            r  the radius of the inscribed circle
 of the polygon    ;  and thus the area becomes

     Note. — In the     case  of   an equilateral          triangle and a square, th*

      10.    Note on the Salinity of the Tay Estuary and of St
        Andrews Bay.                 By Hugh Eobert               Mill, B.Sc, F.C.S.
     In January        I  read a paper on the salinity of the                Firth of Forth,*
in which the law governing the distribution                          of salt in that estuary
was pointed         out.      It   appeared     that in the eastern or seaward part
of the     Firth    the change         in  mean salinity per mile            was very slight,
and the       tidal range        was small,       while both decreased gradually                as
the sea was approached.                  On the other hand, the riverward half of
the    Firth showed a rapid alteration in density along its length, and                          a
correspondingly          great range between high and low tide.
     The estuary of the Tay               is shorter, narrower,           and shallower than
that of the       Forth, and          the river is much larger,             of great     volume,
and more       rapid.        It   might then be expected              that the condition of
the     seaward part of the              Firth   of Tay would resemble             that of the
 riverward portion of the Forth in its main characteristics,                          while the
sea    around the mouth of the estuary would be perceptibly freshened.
      A slight dip in the salinity curve                at the Isle of May was referred
to in the       paper cited above,           t  and the suggestion           was thrown        out
 that this     might be due to the diluting                  action of the fresh water of
 the Tay.        This hypothesis has been              confirmed       by observations      made
 during the       first week of June 1885.

    This indicates            the increase of salinity from                    Inchkeith        to   off Elie,
and then its increasingly rapid decrease                              to the mouth of the                  Firth
of Forth, across St Andrews Bay, and up the Tay                                       as   far as Dundee.
The tide being on the ebb to Crail, increases                                   the apparent rate of
freshening very slightly,                     while its flowing reduces                   it  to a greater
 degree in the latter part of the journey.

 this area was freshened more or less by the Tay, taking                                      as a standard
 of average salinity                the   usual      state of the          water     between         St   Abb's
 Head and the Isle of May.                          Off St Andrews the water was slightly
 Salter at low than at                 high tide,         a   fact which        may be accounted               for
  by the drying of the Abertay sandbanks,                              about half ebb, leading the
 brackish flow of the river further east than at high tide.

    These observations,              while insufficient               to trace out the form of the
brackish       area beyond the mouth                     of the Firth of Tay, show that St
Andrews Bay is affected with the fresher water, and that the                                                Firth
of Forth        to a few miles west of the May Island is also slightly
freshened.          Both       these    effects       must be subject                to variations           from
the direction          of the wind            and the amount of flood in the river.
Until further examination                     is made, speculation                   on the subject of
the general variation               of salinity along the coast had better be post
poned ; but          it is certain that if such work could                                 be carried          out
valuable results would be obtained.

   This table shows that,         as on the     Forth, but in        a more    pronounced
manner,     the effects of tide and          of flooding in the river are very
considerable       in  the upper part of the estuary             ;  so  much so that the
observations recorded above are of almost no use in determining                             the
normal salinity of the            Firth    of Tay at any point.                 The      serial
densities     observed      on each day      when plotted in a curve,                 show      a
state of matters very similar           to that existing in the Forth.                   From
Newburgh          to   the   Abertay     Lightship corresponds in regard to
surface salinity with the         stretch of the Forth from Alloa to Queens-
ferry, but the closer proximity             to   the open      sea     produces     its effect
in raising     the salinity of the       bottom water about the mouth of the
Tay.
   It appears that in the Tay, while the salt sea water runs up along
the bottom so as to produce           a  very marked         difference     in the density
of the bottom and surface water at the                      Lightship,       it  is rapidly
mixed    as    it   passes on, no doubt on account               of the shallowness of
the channel and the strength of the current.
   The position of the highest point to which brackish water extends
in the Tay at high water is effected by the amount of tidal rise and
of flooding in the river.          In  summer       it is said to be always undrink-
able  at high water          at  Newburgh; while           some fishermen say that
the salt can be tasted at Perth during very dry summer                        weather      and
at high spring tides.
   Although not connected with the salinity, the colour of the water
when looked down into on                a clear     day'may be noted.              At New
burgh it is      a clear    amber-brown, which lower down becomes                      a little
muddy, and as the salt manifests              itself  a green      tint  is added, so that
at Tayport        it  is an exquisite olive-green,          a   colour which prevails
with   a lessening        of the brown ingredient right across St Andrews
 Bay.    This       contrasts   with   the     pale    muddy green           of  the    upper
reaches of the          Firth of Forth, which          gives   place     to a deeper and
more transparent blue-green             tint as the Isle of May is approached.
The effect is very much that which would be produced                             if   a green
liquid  (''.;/., solution of dark transparent cupric chloride) were diluted
gradually with          water   for the Forth,        and with        a  brownish-yellow
liquid  (e.g., very dilute ferric chloride solution) for the Tay.

                                                 Vice-President.
     At this, the concluding meeting of                              the Session,        some observations
and information                    are expected         from the Chairman for the night, and
which         I     now, at the request of the Council, proceed to offer.
   During the past Session there have been sixteen ordinary meet
ings of the Society for the reading of papers, which may be classed
under the following heads: — 22 in Natural Philosophy, 11 in
Chemistry, 10 in Mathematics, 7 in Physiology, 6 in Meteorology,
4    in            in Mineralogy, 3 in Geology,
            Zoology,          3                                                      1   in Anthropology,
1    in Astronomy, and 1 in Mechanics.
      The total number                    of papers is             72,      being two more than            the
average           of the last two years.
      It will           be observed, that               all    these        papers   are   on branches of
Physical Science.                    There have been none of a literary character —
though            literature         is one of the                objects     which      our    Society   was
intended to encourage                     — and though Lord Moncreiff, till lately our
President,              has       more than once,             from this Chair, expressed              a   wish
and a hope               that there would be contributions to our meetings under
that head also.
      But       this object,          I   fear,    it   is difficult          to accomplish.         The dis
coveries            and speculations of             a   scientific nature are now so important
and so          urgent, that they crowd in upon every                                 Society which       will
admit           them      ;   whilst,      on     the    other hand, speculations                 in mental
philosophy               come before the public                    more      readily, and perhaps more
suitably, through the columns of innumerable magazines, journals,
reviews, and newspapers,                         published monthly, weekly, or daily.
      I   see     from looking at some of the addresses delivered from this
    Chair at the close               of   a Session,          that it has occasionally been the
    practice        to express an opinion                regarding the merits                  of the papers
    read.       I    shrink from following that                        practice,     first, because of not
    having heard              any of the papers               ;    and,     more     particularly,   because
    I frankly avow my                incompetence             to form an opinion on three-fourths
 of the papers,               judging from their                  titles.      But in our Society there
 is some guarantee                  that any papers               by Fellows         of our Society shall
    not be unworthy                 of    it,   because       we admit         no    person     to become   a

352                  Proceedings    of  the  Royal Society
Fellow who is not recommended             and   vouched     for hy trustworthy
persons, as having a taste for and a knowledge of either scientific or
literary subjects  ;   and having been        myself on many occasions             a
member of Council, before which applications for admission come,                   I
know that this rule is honestly acted on.
    I do not find that this rule keeps back any whom we would desire
to welcome    within our    walls.    During    the past Session      the number
of Fellows    admitted was twenty-five, whereas          the average      number
during the four previous years was twenty.
    I am sorry to say, however,      that during the past year an unusual
number of deaths       among     our members       has occurred — one in the
Honorary class, thirteen in the Ordinary class.
   The Honorary       Fellow   deceased     was Professor     von Siebold, who
died last spring at the age      of eighty-one.      For  the last thirty years
of his life he was Professor       of Zoology and Comparative Anatomy
in the University     of Munich.       He is said to have written altogether
130 scientific papers, several      of which were so appreciated           in this
country, that they were translated        into English by Professor Huxley
and   Mr Dallas.      Von Siebold was a corresponding member                of the
French Institute, and      a honorary member of the Royal Society of
London.
    Of the deceased Fellows in our         Ordinary class, the first name to
be    mentioned is that of       Sir Alexander Grant,         the distinguished
Principal of Edinburgh University, who died on 1st December 1884.
He was the representative of         a  branch of the Seafield        family, and
inherited   a baronetcy which had been conferred           in the year 168S.
    Though eminently qualified to take         part in the business         of our
Society, especially in the department of literature, Sir Alexander
Grant's other    important duties      too much      engrossed     his attention,
to allow him to do more than deliver an address               at the commence
ment of one of our Sessions,       and to give several obituary notices.
    At Oxford University,     as   a student,    he distinguished himself by
his attainments in classics, philosophy, and general              literature, and
whilst resident there, he brought out the edition of Aristotle's Ethics,
with   English   notes,   which    at once    stamped    him     as   an  eminent
scholar and a man of intellectual power.            His first appointment        to
a post  of duty was that of Inspector of Schools at Madras.                 A  few
years afterwards he was elected to the higher position of Professor

                       of Edinburgh, Session 1884-85.                                  353
 of History in Elphinstone           College.       Subsequently he was promoted
 to be Vice-Chancellor of         Elgin College, Bombay, which last position
he held     for four years,     till 1868, when he was choson to be Prin
cipal of   Edinburgh University.
    In  all these positions      Sir Alexander threw himself earnestly and
enthusiastically into the work which these positions implied, and at
the same     time by his genial spirit he gained the hearty co-operation
of all with whom he came              in  contact.     To the academic interests of
the   students     of our University he especially devoted                    himself, not
only by opening almost every winter session with an address                         full of
encouragement        and good advice, but by aiding them in organising
for themselves       a Kepresentative Council and a Students'                  Union.
   The immense efforts           made       by Sir Alexander         Grant during the
last year of his life, to        celebrate       suitably the Tercentenary          of our
University, were probably the cause of the failure of health which
supervened       when these       labours were         over.    The compilation         and
publication      during    the previous winter             of two volumes on the
History of the University           ;   the arrangements for bringing to             Edin
burgh in tho spring          of  1884, from         all parts of the world, men of
academic renown, and the organisation necessary                     for providing suit
able  hospitality to these distinguished strangers               ;  whilst    these things
acted as a     stimulus    at the time, they left           Sir Alexander, when the
celebration was over,        in  a state of prostration, from which, notwith
standing      a   holiday taken during            the summer in Derbyshire,               he
never recovered.
   I   might say much more, especially                   in  reference      to   what    our
distinguished       associate    did for        the extension of our University
Buildings.        But this is not          the opportunity,      nor am      I the person,
to   enlarge     on this subject.           I  have    no doubt there will         be   laid
before us,     by  some one of our number (who known better than                       I do
his character,       and his deeds           of usefulness),     a   fuller    and better
biographical account than             I  can venture on.
   It  was    only a becoming tribute              of general      esteem and respect,
that the    civic authorities of Edinburgh resolved that                 there should be
a  public funeral         It  was attended not only by all the professors
and students of our University,                 but by representatives         from every
 scientific and literary society          iu Edinburgh.
    The next deceased Fellow whose name                       I  mention, is the Rev.

354                     Proceedings      of the  Royal Society
Dr Lindsay Alexander.             He died at his residence         in the parish of
Iuveresk on 20th December 1884.
    He was for     a time one    of our Vice-Presidents        ;  and he frequently
attended     our meetings,       and took an interest in our discussions.
But    I   am    not aware that he contributed any paper                  beyond an
address at the opening of one of our Sessions,                and   several obituary
notices.
    Born in Leith, and obtaining his earliest education at our High
School, he subsequently went to St Andrews University to attend
Dr Chalmers' Lectures           on Moral Philosophy.           At   the early age of
nineteen     he became Professor of Classics and Mathematics in one of
the Theological Training         Colleges    of the English Congregationalists.
After holding that position for four               years,   he occupied in      Liver
pool a chapel        as  a  lay preacher; and he            thereafter resolved        to
follow that profession        for life.
    With that view         he went to Germany to attend              theological    lec
tures, and on his return to Edinburgh                received    an appointment as
minister of the Independent              Congregation then        meeting in Argyll
 Square   ;  after which he became minister of the handsome building
in George IV. Bridge, called the Church of St Augustine, erected                       at
a cost   of £15,000, and where he continued for about                   twenty   years,
till  he resigned     from failing health.
    He was deeply reverenced             by the members of his congregation,
 and   much     respected    by persons      of other denominations,         who     fre
 quently went to listen to his discourses                 ; two of whom were, I
 know, Dean Eamsay and his brother Admiral                       Kamsay, who       were
 always   with him on terms of social intercourse.
    Dr Lindsay Alexander          was a man of a tolerant and liberal spirit.
 I  remember      when, some years ago,         it  was proposed      to give a testi
  monial to the Eev.       Mr   Beveridge,     the parish minister       of Inveresk,
 on   his   completing      the   fiftieth    year    of his ministry      there,      Dr
 Alexander      not only joined         in the subscription, but went to              the
 public meeting       where the testimonial was presented, and spoke                    in
 commendation of Mr Beveridge.
     Dr Lindsay Alexander was distinguished for his scholastic know
 ledge.     His acquaintance with theological works was so great, that
he was appointed to the Theological Hall of the Congregational
body, first     as  Professor of Systematic Theology, and afterwards                    as

                        of Edinburgh, Session 1884-85.                                  355
Principal of the College.             He  was also a member of the committee
for revising the authorised version of the Old Testament.
    He published several           treatises,    chiefly    theological.      Ho contri
buted articles to the eighth edition of the Encyclopaedia                    Britannica
on " Moral Philosophy
                                "
                                  and   " Scripture Theology."            The collection
of hymns now used in the Augustine                  Church was entirely composed
by him.
    In  these circumstances,         it was natural      that Dr Alexander should
receive     many public testimonials of the esteem in which                        he was
held.      In February       187G, on the completion of the fortieth year of
his ministry,       the congregation of his church presented                   to him an
address,     from which      I quote    these   words, "     to express their grateful
recognition of      his profound learning, and of the              fearless fidelity and
true   Christian love with which he had discharged the duties of his
sacred office."       Since his death,        as  I see   from to-day's      newspapers,
a marble      bust was placed last Saturday in the corridor of Augustine
                                                                         "
Chapel, bearing Dr Lindsay Alexander's name, as                            the honoured
minister of      this Church for forty-three          years    ;  eminent as a theolo
gian, preacher,      and scholar."
    Profeisor Flceming Jenkin, who died suddenly only a few weeks
ago, was Professor of Engineering in Edinburgh University, being
the    first   who    occupied     that    chair.     He     was    skilled in various
branches       of engineering, especially in electricity with reference to
its   mechanical      applications.       For several years he worked in con
nection with       Sir William Thomson of Glasgow University in the
manufacture        and laying down of several great submarine telegraph
lines.      During the       last  two years of his life he is said to have
occupied himself          in endeavouring to invent              a system    of electrical
locomotion, to which he proposed               to give the name       of " Telpheragi."
    In    the year     1877    he gave     two lectures        before    the   Edinburgh
Philosophical Institution on             " Sanitary Houses," which             created    so
much interest that            they led to the formation of the Edinburgh
Sanitary Protection          Association,      the first of its kind, and the use
fulness of      which    has been so generally acknowledged that                it  has led
to the formation of similar associations               elsewhere.
     Professor    Jenkin     was    the  author of numerous important papers,
which appeared          in  magazines      and reviews — one on Magnetism and
 Electricity (published         in    1883),   so much       appreciated      that   it  was
 translated into German and Italian.

356                  Proceedings    of the Royal Society
    Professor Jenkin began his education at a school in Jedburgh,
from which he passed to the Edinburgh Academy.                  Subsequently
he visited Germany, Franco, and         Italy, staying in  each country long
enough to master the language.          He took his M.A. degree at Genoa
University,     after which   he proceeded    to Marseilles, where he began
the    practical work    of life in the employment of a Locomotive
Steam-engine       Company.      Thereafter he returned to England, and,
becoming an associate        of the Institute of Civil Engineers,         soon
advanced     into more extended and profitable employment
    Thomas C. Archer, Director of the Museum of Science and Art,
died on 17th February         last, very suddenly,    in a hotel in London,
whilst    speaking to his daughter, though          then apparently     in his
usual health.
    He had been in charge of our Museum since the year 1860, having
been    appointed on the death of Professor George Wilson, who was
then Director of that Institution.
    Mr Archer directed his whole time and thought            to the procuring
of objects of interest for the         Museum, not only by purchases         at
the    expense    of Government,     but even by occasionally obtaining
temporary loans for exhibition        of valuable objects from individuals
to whom they belonged.
    He went frequently to the Continent in search of specimens,            and
in   1876   he was sent    as  Joint British Commissioner to the Phila
delphia Exhibition of Arts and Industry.             He had    great  business
tact, and,    in particular, never omitted any favourable opportunity
of pressing the Government for additional grants to extend or               en
large   the   buildings, to accommodate      the stores he collected,   and of
which he generally contrived to show a supply in boxes unpacked,
 to prove the necessity of more space for his treasures.
    I am  not aware that he ever took any part in the business of our
 Society.
    Professor Morrison Watson, who died on the 25th March last, at
the early age of thirty-nine, began his short life of usefulness by re
ceiving his educational training in Edinburgh.           He took   a degree in
our University      as Doctor of Medicine, receiving for his thesis     a gold
 medal.     He became Fellow       of the Royal College of Physicians,        a
 Fellow of our Eoyal Society, and subsequently              a  Fellow   of the
 Zoological Society of London.           For some years      he was    Demon

                       of Edinburgh, Session 1884-85.                            357
  strator of     Anatomy       in  Edinburgh University, under Professor
  Goodsir and Professor Turner.            In   1874,   on the amalgamation of
  the Manchester       Medical School and Owens College, he was elected
  there Professor    of Anatomy.         Whilst holding that appointment he
  wrote   valuable     papers     on zoological    subjects, the last being       an
  elaborate   memoir    of above     200  quarto pages on the Penguin, from
                                                 " Challenger."
  notes taken    during the voyage of the
     Professor Morrison        Watson's career of usefulness was cut short in
  a strikingly impressive manner.           Whilst delivering      a lecture to his
  students he suddenly became speechless              and unconscious, owing, as
 was afterwards      discovered, to the rupture of           a blood-vessel in the
 head.     So precarious was his condition,             that for three weeks      he
 could not be moved from the college.                 He   was   then carried to a
 convalescent     hospital     adjoining   the college,     but he survived there
 only a few days.
     General    Sir James Alexander, K.C.B., of Westerton (Stirling
 shire),  who died      a  few weeks ago, occasionally attended           our meet
 ings, but    I am  not   aware that he contributed any papers.
    As an officer     in  a  Scotch regiment, he saw much active service in
 foreign lands, viz.,       New Zealand, at the Cape of Good Hope, and
also   in Egypt
    When in Egypt, he became interested in the great buildings and
 obelisks of    antiquity    ;  and when he returned home, endeavoured             to
bring about       some      arrangement     for   transporting     to  this country
 Cleopatra's Needle.          Having heard that      the late Captain Donaldson
Boswell,    RK,     of Wardie, had entertained           the same idea, and had
submitted to the Admiralty            a report showing how the transport of
the obelisk     might be accomplished, Sir James applied to me to assist
him in procuring access to these plans, my brother,                   Sir Alexander
Milne,    being then at the          Admiralty.        These plans having been
obtained,     Sir James went with them back               to Egypt,    and satisfied
himself of the possibility of removing the prostrate obelisk.                Having
received    from the Khedive permission to construct                a huge   box, to
contain and float the obelisk, he returned to England, and applied
first to the    Admiralty, and then       to the Treasury, for the necessary
funds, which       he estimated     would amount to £10,000.              His appli
cations in these quarters having been peremptorily refused,                  he next
appealed     to a wealthy personal friend,         Dr Erasmus Wilson of Lon

358                  Proceedings of the Royal Society
don, who eventually agreed          to give the money.      Sir James   then
went back to Egypt to superintend the removal, which was entirely
successful,   notwithstanding that in the course of the voyage,     a heavy
gale   having come on, the cable which dragged the barge containing
the obelisk broke, and there was much difficulty           in recovering ik
It  finally reached    the Thames, and the obelisk now stands on          the
Thames Embankment.
    Another object of public interest which next occupied Sir James
was a fortification     with heavy guns to be erected on Inchkeith, for
the protection of Leith and Edinburgh against enemy's ships.               He
was at great     trouble to get petitions from the Magistrates of Edin
burgh and Leith, and from the towns on the shores of the Firth of
Forth, to the Government, urging the erection of these defence*.
He at length succeeded, and had the pleasure of seeing the fortifica
tions erected and mounted with guns.
    He next    engaged    in endeavouring to procure    a similar protection
for Greenock and Glasgow, by fortifications at the entrance of             the
 Firth of Clyde.      He did not live long enough     to see the erection of
 these fortifications,   but before    he died he knew that his proposal
had been adopted        by Government, and that it only remained to fix
 on the spot where the fortification should be erected.
     Out of respect for the memory of an old personal friend,          and    a
 Fellow of our Society, I have thought it right to mention these
 details regarding Sir James Alexander, as a tribute due to one who
 did useful work for his country at home, after serving his country          a?
 a  brave soldier abroad.
     These obituary notices     of life and work apply to only six of      the
 thirteen Fellows who have died during the past year.             Had   there
 been more     time for inquiry, perhaps others might have been found
 also deserving some special notice.
     But  even from those few to whom        I  have been enabled to refer,
 on account of their services       to science and to the public   interests,
  may   I not  venture to infer that the prestige of our Society has       not
  deteriorated, and that,    as the past year has shown an unusual acces
  sion of new members         and  a greater   amount of business, we    may
 hope for a continuance of prosperity and usefulness        1

   1.  In   the circle of an unifilar knot every crossing a is read twice,
once in an     odd and once in an even place              ;   and the thread is sup
posed to pass     under and over itself alternately at successive crossings
   Every     contiguous duad of the circle is a different edge of the
knot      Let every mid-edge        round the circle be dotted on the right.
   Let                         128   ..  . a213    . . .   5,  .        .       .        (A)
of 2b terms 1, 2,      &c, where      51 is a contiguous duad, be the circle
of an unifilar      „N of n     crossings.       We      see    that     1  and      2 aro   the
crossings    of a 2-gon    ; for no mesh of „N but               a 2-gon can          have two
snmmits joined        hy two different edges of the mesh.                           (A) is    the
circle of any     unifilar which    has the duads 12 and 21.
    Let us write the above thus, omitting only the crossing                              1,  and
simply reversing one of the sequences between                       1  and   1 —
                                 28  . . .  o25   . . .  3,      .        .       .
                                                                                          (B)
where 32 is a contiguous duad.               What     does this mean, when                in  the
projection of      .N  the 2-gon is shrunk          up to      a   point 2, the edges 12
and 21 disappearing?
    It is the circle of an unifilar         ,.XM of      n   -  1    crossings,      which has
every duad of       (A)   except 12 and 21; for            it  has 51 and 13 because
it has 52     and 23,    2 and 1   being now the same point.
    2.  In (A) as we walk from              1  to 2, and later from 2 to 1, we
make the circuit of the 2-gon              12   in the      same direction round               it;
therefore      our two dots will be both inside or both outside of it.
This     12   is an even 2-gon;        and every even 2-gon mn of an uni
filar is    known by       a glance    at the circle, by its exhibition                   of mn
and nnu
    3.  We have demonstrated            the following
    Theorem A. — Every unifilar knot „N of                       n crossings,        which has

an even 2-gon, can be reduced                                      to an uuitilar n.1Hl of n                                     -               1 crossings
by shrinking up that 2-gon to                                      a   point.
      4.    Let    the sequence of                       In    terms
                                                   128        . . .    al23      . . . 5                .               .                    .        (C)
be the circle              of an unifilar „P of                        n crossings.
      This „P          has an odd                  2-gon           12; for since we pass over both                                                           its
threu Is from                  1   to 2,      it   must            have one dot within                                  and one without
it.        An}- unifilar that has an odd                                 2    gon is representedby (C). We
now write this, omitting the duads                                               12 and no other, and simply
reversing          3 . . . 5 — one sequence between                                     2 and                 1 ;
                                                     28       . . .    xlT)     . . . 3         .               .                    .               (D).
      What means this, when from the projection of „P we have                                                                                        deleted
the two edges, and consequently                                        the two crossings                            of the 2-gon                          12!
      5.   The edges of the crossings                                   1     in (C) are 12, la, 12, 15
                                                                             and    2
and        21,     28,         21,     23.         These           make angles 212 and 51a vertically
opposite,          and          121       and      823 vertically opposite,                                  where 51a and 823
are angles          of the (4             +   r)-gon          1"   laid bare by deletion of the 2-gon                                                       12.
The points                 1    and       2   of these angles are merely bends or                                                                 creases at
the mid-points of the edges 5a and 83 of the (2 + r)-gon                                                                         F.                Effacing
the creases            1       and 2, (D)           becomes

of (C) except                  12,     la,    15, 23, 28, and has besides                                          the new edges 83
and 5n of the (2                      +   r)-gon          This (E) is the circle of an unifilar

„    J)    of ii   -   2       crossings.            We have thus proved
      Theorem          1!.     — If       any unifilar                 knot „P of           n               crossings                    has an odd
2-gon, the knot is reduced                                to an unifilar „_aQ of n                                      -    2   crossings by
the deletion               of the two edges, and consequently of the two crossings
of that 2-gon.

be    two circles of two unifilars of n crossings.                                                           In both of                            them     56
and 67 are contiguous 2-gons, having a common                                                                crossing                        6 — that        is,
both knots have                    a   double 2-gon                    (a    plural flap) 567.                               Let                 the first   7

                          of Edinburgh, Session 1884-85.                                         361
 in each be in an even            place   ;   then the second         7  is in an odd place,
 art. 1.    Let the thread cross over itself in the even places.                           In both
 circles  (F) then      the thread,       passing      under itself at d,       6, and       r, goes
onwards till it         passes over itself at p, 6, and s, proceeding                          till it
comes under        itself again at        d.     Let now      the double flap 765 in the
projection      of  each circle be shrunk              to a point       7, the   four edges of
its two 2-gonal          loops 65 and           67 disappearing.          These circles          thus
become      the two unifilars of n           -2    crossings,
                                    . . . dlr    . . . pis   . . .
                                    . . . dlr    . . . pis  ...            .       .         (G),
which of course           differ exactly        as do    the circles     (F) in   the portions
 omitted.       The thread in each goes under at d, over at                     7,     under at r,
 and so on its course          till it  passes over at       p, under      at 7, over at        *• . . .
 and finally comes again under at d, as before the shrinking.                                    And
 this is true whatever be the crossings                    d, r, p, s,       in 2-gons or not,
 and whether         these four be or not crossings                 in like meshes on the
 knots.      Thus is proved
      Theorem C. —       If   any unifilar knot „R of n crossings has                     a  double
  flap, the   two contiguous terminal 2-gon3 of                   a (2 + t)-ple      flap, (f'>0),
  it is reduced, by the shrinking up of the two 2-gons to                              a  point, to
  an   uniiilar S of n - 2       crossings.
      7.  Returning to the even 2-gon 12 of art.                   1, it is plain that at its
  crossings    it is   co vertical with two meshes whose edges, meeting                           at   1
   and at 2,    will  be dotted both of each pair inside or outside                       its mesh,
   according as the         2-gon 12 has its dots both outside or both inside
   of it.   And it is equally plain that every crossing r of                            a  knot has
   two covertical angles          about      it so evenly dotted, and another cover
   tical   pair which        have     both one, and only one, dot inside those
   angles about r.          We     may call the latter pair the odd angles, and
   the former the even angles about r.
       In the unifilar „_;M whose circle is (B), art.                  1, we can reverse the
   process   by which „_]M is obtained from „N, i.e., we can, by restoring
   in the   projection of „_iM the deleted 2-gon 12, construct upon it „N.
    In the circle (A) a28 and 315 are even angles about the crossings 2
    and 1.     In (B), the circle of ..jM, we read along 32 and next along
    28, dotting     both on the right, and later along a2 and 25, dotting
    both on the     right   ;  i.e., a28       and 325 are even coverticals about                      2.

By making               these two covertical with a 2-gon we construct „N, whose
circle is (A), and thus demonstrate
     Theorem AA. — If at any crossing                                      r of     an unifilar           knot of   n     1
crossings          we make the two even angles of                                   r covertical with          a 2-gon,
thus adding an edge to each collateral of the 2-gon, we construct                                                       an
unifilar of n crossings by one of its even 2-gons.
     This      is the constructing converse of the Theorem                                           A,   art. 3.

we come to the crossing                       b, and proceed from b below to a above past

the lower pq to q, planting                       a     dot      (t)   inside the 2-gon on that pq                  ;   at

a bifilar „U.     Thus we have proof of
    Theorem      BB. — If in    the projection   of any (2    +  r)-gonal mesh
F of    an unifilar of   n - 2 crossings   we connect   by  a 2-gon     the mid
points of two edges of which one, and only one, is dotted (art. 2)
inside F, we construct an unifilar of n crossings by one of its odd
2-gons.
    This is the constructing       converse  of Theorem B,       art.  5, and is
true when rJiO.
    10. The constructing converse of Theorem C is
    Theorem CC. — If in any unifilar knot of n        -2   crossings we make,
at any projected crossing r, either pair of opposed           angles covertical
with    a double flap, adding two edges to each of the other pair of
opposed meshes about r, we construct an unifilar of n crossings               by
one of its plural flaps.
    No   base which has a plural      flap, not fixed, can be operated upon
by Theorem        AA  or BB, unless the operation abolishes the plural
flap.     And every    flap, single or plural, is fixed,   if its deletion lays
bare a section through two edges only.             Such a fixed flap cannot
compete for the lead, nor hinder an operation by            AA    or BB, which
does not abolish the fixture.           Every construction is by       a leading
flap (ride my paper, xvii.), and the leader has the most 2-gons.
 2.   On the Twists of Listing and Tait.              By the Rev. Thomas
                          P. Kirkman, M.A., F.E.S.
    In the figure 1 following, the knot tAj has a triangular section
Prr cutting away on each side of it a (3 + r)-gonal mesh, and 9ArJ
has such a section Rpp, through one crossing only.              Make in these
knots creases at     rr that approach to meet at E in 2, and creases pp
 that meet at P in 2.        In 3, 2 is prepared for a rotation through
two right angles about the fixed axis PR, through the crossing P
and the crease-kiss      R, or, as a more learned    man would say, through
 the decussation      P and the plicatorial osculation R — taking 2 for
 ^kj: exchange here P and R if 2 is jAr2. In 4 the rotation is
 effected, undoing the crossing P of 3, which has become a kiss P' in
 4, while the kiss R of 3 has become the crossing R' in 4, if 3 is
 t\j : exchange here P and R, if 3 is 9Ar2. In 5 the crease kiss is

undone,    and   9Aj  has been   twisted into 9Aq, as jAr2 has into ,Ai,
both by the twist of Tait, which is above analysed.           In Tait's twist
the part rotated    is not the same figure between      P and R after rota
tion as before.
                                                                         R
                                                                         P
   There may, of course,      be any number of crossings     in the rotating
part about   PR
   If  here we consider     P  and  R   as both crossings, 3 and 4 are two
unsolids of ten crossings, complementaries       of each other about PR.
   When the knot to be twisted is such that the rotated          part is   the
same after     rotation  as before,   3  has  no complementary, and the
result is simply one pair of convertibles, viz.,     K  on the  left  instead
of 9A/, turned into    K'  on the right instead of $Aqj, and not two pairs
as here,  gAj turned into 9Aq and 9Ar2 into 9A6.
   If,  in the above process, we have only two summits a and                 b
between    P and   R  in 3, making the 2-gon ab collateral     with  the tri
angles abV and abll, we have the simplest possible case of twisting;
and in this the rotation makes       no change, 4 and 3 being as projec
tions identical.

    This is the twist of Listing, who found                                         it in his study of knots of
seven crossings,                   under what seems to me the needless disguise                                              of
gracefully            flowing            curves.            It    was      sharp        wit      in Listing            so    to
observe      it   ;    it    was      still      more acute             in Tait         to detect under a more
complete      disguise the manoeuvre of his twist of greater complexity.
    The figures               3 and        4, considered              as    unsolids of ten crossings, are
the complementary                        pair C71 and C74.                       If   we had these two before
we had      obtained 9Aj, 9Aq, 9Ar2, and                                 9A&,       all of which are subsolids
to be    regularly constructed                         by their leading flaps, we could, without
the    minute              comparisons             of that process, at once draw these sub-
solids — the               first     pair by unkissing                     at    R     and       P', the second by
unkissing             at    P      and    R'.        And if           we had           all the unsolids of ten
crossings, having each a linear section                                     PR, which            cuts away on both
hands a (3            +    r)-gonal mesh, we could with the same                                   ease    draw every
knot of nine                 crossings           that has         a   triangular section              Prr.         All       we
have     to do is to take first every                                   complementary               pair of        10-      fold
unsolids, and by unkissing, as                                   just shown, write down from it two
couples of 9-fold convertibles                               ;    next to tako every unsolid 10-fold
without       complementary,                        which          has      a       linear section           PR,       above
described, of which the two crossings                                           P     and    R    are not identical,
and by unkissing first at                          P   and then at R, to obtain from each such
unsolid      one couple of                         convertibles.                The     remaining unsolids                    in
which those crossings                       P      and      R    are identical          will     give, by unkissing
at either     in each, every 9-fold not already found which has                                                    a   linear
section      Pit;             where        the       words just used, "remaining unsolids,"
include every unsolid before handled as having a section                                                       PR with
P     and   R unlike,                to be handled again once, twice,                             &c,     according           as
it has one, two,                     &c,      different           linear sections             PR with P                and    R
alike.       And            every        9-fold        so    got from            P     and     R alike       is a 9-fold
having a triangular                        section          at     which         it can be twisted into its
reflected         image.              It will            sometimes              happen           that amongst                our
couples      obtained                of convertibles, AB, BC, &c, the couple                                   CC will
be found.              This          means that the knot C has two different sections,
Prr     and Stt, at which                     it    can be twisted into itself, besides                                one or
more at      which              it   can be twisted into                   B    or B' of the couples               BC        and
B'C.        For the truth                  is,   that the number of different crossings                                 P     in
the linear sections                   PR      on all the knots of n crossings                           is   exactly the
number       of different triangular sections                                   Prr,    above       described,          on all

366                  Proceedings        of  the   Royal Society
 the knots of n    - 1   crossings.      Wo shall obtain repetitions of                some
 nine-folds, but no vain repetition         ;  for when the unkissing is finished
we shall have grouped all the convertibles in twos, threes, sixes,                      &c,
 without ever attempting to perform a twist, as well                      as have     given
 an accurate account of the number of different triangular sections                        on
 the grouped    ones and on the uniques, without                  ever trying to count
 these sections,   or to distinguish them by their symmetry.
    In all that  precedes, no distinction           is made or supposed           between
unifilar and plurifil      knots; nor do        I  know any reason why uniiikirs
 only should    be considered.
    The crossing    P   in fig.  1   may stand for any tessarace             in   the pro
jection of any knot, or of any «-acron whatever,                    through which lies
the triangular section       Yrr   there described.          The twisting can take
 place   in them all, no matter          what the faces and the other                 n     1
 summits may      be,    and   the groups        can   be formed of which            every
 figure can be so twisted into one or more of the others.
    The question here presents itself — Will it              be   profitable, supposing
 that the census of all the knots of            n crossings      is wanted, to employ
 the method of unkissing above opened               ?   I am of opinion that it        will
    Let   the subsolids (which        have    no linear section         PK)   be divided
 into   S„, all that have       no triangular        section    Pjt   cutting away        on
 both hands    a (3 +   r)-gonal mesh, and T,„ all those which admit                    one
 or more such sections          Yrr,   and    let U„ comprise         all the unsolids,
 which have each one or more linear sections                    PR, cutting       away on
 each hand a (3 + r)-gonal mesh.
     Suppose   that S„ and U„ are found, and that the subsolids T„, in
 general    more   numerous       than S„, are wanting.              If   we can obtain
  U„+i, wo shall readily get by the simple process of unkissing, not
 only the missing T„, but every pair of convertibles possible out                          of
 T„ and the unsolids U„ that admit a triangular section Pjt,                            and
 every fact required for our table of uniques and grouped                               con
 vertibles.
     I believe that even when U„+1 is more                numerous       than T„, it     can
 be more easily found than T„, which comprises                     only subsolids     to be
 obtained by the minute and often many comparisons                        that determine
 the   leading flap   ;   whereas     U,t+I    is rapidly      put together        without
 minute comparisons        by laying      2   upon    n - I,   3 upon      n - 2,  &c,    by
 the simplest marginal sections ffc only.

     The reader, having before him in the plates of vol. xxxii. Trans.
RS.E. nearly all                   the     knots     unifilar       or not of fewer than ten
crossings,         can       amuse       himself     by considering            the     question above
proposed.               He     can begin      with    S6
                                                           =    ;,B
                                                                +     5C.     Compounds               like      0E
are rejected            all through.          But the student will not                  be able to con
fine his        attention to unifilars only.
     Observe that in the linear                    sections     PR    neither      P    nor      E   can be     a
non-terminal             crossing of      a   plural flap.      Also,   if    in   PR   R        is
                                                                                                 a    crossing
of   the 2-gon          RR', PR and PR'              are for our purpose the same linear
section, because we get the same n-fold                             knot whether we unkiss at
R    or at       R' upon the (n+ l)-fold.                     Hence    it    follows that            Prr     and
PrV         are    the       same       triangular     section when            rRr          and r'Rr'        are
covertical angles at the crossing R.
  It       is   not difficult to give simple rules whereby S„                          is   found without
error or repetition                from    S,.,    and     S„_, by the leading flap of each
knot of           S„.        But   a    definition    of   a    fixed flap must be made and
stuck to.
I         conclude       with two useful little             theorems.
     a.    On every unsolid               unifilar   V     in U„+i     each    of its linear          sections
PR        (P    and     R unlike)         lies through four angles at                P      and      R,   which
are       all odd or all even.
     b.    The couples of n-folds obtained by unkissing                                     on   V, or on V
and       its complementary, are all unifilars                       or not, according as these
angles (in          a)   are odd or not.
     My objection to the twistings, that they put                                  a   twist upon the
tape, has         been answered by Tait.                   In the      case of Listing's              twist, I
have       satisfied myself that his answer                    is   sufficient.        It   appears to me
that      it    ought to be formally demonstrated                      as   sufficient in all          cases.
     After all, as           it   is   certainly not on record who invented kissing,                            it
may come            to be forgotten who invented unkissing.

filars only             of U.+1, required for unifilar                 couples,        by operating on

Professor      Tait the requisite unifilars in U12, and thus hope to save              I
him        much time and trouble in grouping the unifilar convertibles of
eleven          crossings.

 1.   On the Motion of        a  Liquid within an Ellipsoidal Hollow.
                         By Sir William Thomson.
    I  have    only recently noticed the            propositions      regarding fluid
motion within       an ellipsoidal    hollow which form the subject of                the
present    communication, and which,              though     obvious      enough     and
remarkably interesting, do not seem to have been previously                          dis
 covered.
                                  Preliminary.
    I shall  use the expression      homogeneous        rotation, or homogeneous
molecular rotation, to designate the condition of              a   fluid in respect     to
rotation,   when throughout it the amounts of its molecular rotation
are the same     and the axial lines parallel.            This designation       clearly
includes the case of       a rotating solid     :  but it is applicable of       course
to the more complex        case of a fluid, in which irrotational motion                is
superimposed      upon homogeneous        rotation    as of a solid.      To illustrate
the complex      motion thus signified, consider the following                     three
examples,     of which (1) and (2) are        included in (3): —
    (1) Let a liquid kept in the shape of a figure of revolution,
by a rigid containing vessel, be given in a state of homogeneous
rotation round the axis of the figure.                Let   an impulsive       rotation
round a line perpendicular to this axis be given to the containing
vessel.     The instantaneous      motion of the liquid, at the instant            when
the impulse is completed,          consists    of an irrotational motion          super
imposed      on   the   given    homogeneous          rotational      motion.        The
molecular rotation of the liquid            does not generally remain homo

 geneous           after       the first instant.             But    I find    it   does continue homo
 geneous,         however the containing vessel be moved, provided the shape
 be ellipsoidal  that is to say (for the present limited case), an
                           ;
 ellipsoid of revolution whether prolate or oblate.   The possible
 incident of the containing vessel being brought again to rest                                            in any
 position after any motion round any succession                                           of diameters per
 pendicular* to the figure of revolution is of course included.
      (2) Given a rigid solid,                 with       a    hollow        space of any shape not a
 figure      of revolution,             within          it,   full of liquid         :    solid and liquid
 all rotating homogeneously.                           Let    the given rotation of the solid be
 impulsively           brought          to    rest      or to any             other       rotation, whether
 rotation         with         changed angular velocity                      round        the same axis, or
 rotation         round         another axis.             The instantaneous                 motion       of the
 liquid,      at     the instant             of the completion of the impulse,                           will    be
the       resultant            of the given          homogeneous              rotation, with an irrota-
 tional      motion            superimposed upon                it  ;   this irrotational          motion of
the    liquid being the same                  as     the motion which would be generated
from rest by           giving to the solid (whether impulsively or gradually)
an     angular        velocity  the same as that which, compounded with
the       first    given         angular       velocity,         produced           the     second      angular
velocity to           which         we supposed               the first       angular velocity of the
solid to be suddenly changed.
      In this second              example,         as   in the first, the molecular rotation
does      not       generally          continue         to be        homogeneous            in the altered
condition          in which the solid and liquid do not rotate                               as   if   all solid   ;
but    it   does continue to be homogeneous,                            if   the shape of the hollow             is
ellipsoidal.
      (3) Given        a       spherical shell full of homogeneously rotating liquid,
or    a   hollow of any shape in                   a    rotating solid full of liquid, rotating
homogeneously                   with    the     solid.         By impulsive                pressure      at     the
boundary            of the liquid, supposed                     now      to be        perfectly        yielding,
generate          any prescribed normal components of velocity in all parts
of    the boundary.                 The effect          will    be to generate              throughout          the
liquid an irrotational                  motion, the same                 as   would have been gene
rated       had the fluid been                     given        at rest.        The resultant motion
throughout           will       be the resultant              of this irrotational            motion, com-
                                                                                                  »

       Rotation of the containing vessel rotind the axis of figuro has no effect on
the   liquid, and need not be included to complicate our considerations.

pounded       with the given rotational motion.                 The irrotational motion
in the    case of the spherical          hollow is of course easily calculated by
the well-known          spherical     harmonic analysis for fluid motion.                   We
consider      here only the instantaneous                motion,      which exists at the
instant      when the         impulse is        completed.         The      infinitely     more
difficult problem of working out the consequences                          according    to any
 prescribed      conditions      as to force,      or  as to    changing shape, for the
boundary, we do not follow at present.                     It will    be   fully followed     up
 for the     case    in which the boundary of the liquid is spherical                          or
 ellipsoidal to begin with, and is constrained                     to be always exactly
 ellipsoidal.       It will     be   proved      that in      this    case    the   molecular
 rotation of the fluid remains always homogeneous.                           We shall     see in
 fact   that the                          "  strain
                                                     " is
                        geometrical                            essentially      homogeneous
 throughout       a liquid contained within           a changing      ellipsoidal boundary,
 provided that the motion of the fluid                   be either      wholly irrotational,
 or be at any          one instant homogeneously               irrotational.       The homo-
 geneousness of the geometrical                 strain being established,           it follows
 from Helmholtz's           fundamental principles of vortex motion, that                    the
 molecular      rotation must contiuue homogeneous                  ;  its magnitude,      when
  there is any stretching or contraction                in the axial direction, varying
  inversely    as the length       of  a  line of the substance in this direction,
  and the axial direction varying so as to keep always along the same
  substantial line.
     If there is the slightest         deviation     from exactness in the ellipsoidal
  figure,   the homogeneousness              of the     rotation of the liquid           is  not
  maintained,       and there is no         limit   to the amount of deviation from
  homogeneousness          which may supervene              in consequence         of motions
  which may be given to the boundary, whether in the way of                             change
  of shape, or of motion without                  change     of shape.         Confining     our
  attention for the present to motion of the boundary without                           change
  of shape,      we    find it interesting to remark that we may go                            on
  indefinitely increasing          or indefinitely diminishing the energy of                  the
  fluid motion by properly arranged                 action    in the way of moving            the
  containing vessel.           To continually increase the energy                I believe    the
  following rule may be correct, although                    I  do not yet see a perfect
  proof of it.        Suppose     the containing vessel to be given at rest, and
  the liquid within        it  to have perfectly homogeneous                  rotation within
  the not exactly ellipsoidal hollow, watch it for a little time — it may

begin to move or                 it may          not.      If it does       not begin to move of itself,
give     it    a very slight               motion of rotation round any axis.                          Generally
it will begin to move of itself, but it will not do                                        so   if   the interior
fluid motion            fulfils       a definite condition                of kinetic equilibrium, and
therefore           if you     do not see the containing case beginning to move of
itself you must set it in motion.                                  When you          see    it in    motion,       act
upon          it with           in any direction to
                          a couple                                                do some positive work
upon          it,   and then suddenly stop it.  Left                              to itself      now,     it      will
certainly begin                to move of itself.                  When you          see   it   moving again,
again do some work upon                           it   gradually, and stop its motion suddenly.
Go on incessantly acting according                                to this rule.        The positive work
done gradually                will     exceed the work undone                     suddenly each time, or
at   all events on the aggregate of                        a    large number of times of repetition
of the operation.                     Thus on the whole you will increase the energy
of   the fluid motion without continually giving kinetic energy to the
containing vessel,                    as    might be the           case     if   you continued always to
apply         a     couple in such               a    direction    as     to do positive work.                    Thus
 by    going on long enough                          operating in the manner described we can
 present the containing                          vessel at rest with             the liquid moving inside
it   with any amount of kinetic energy we please.
     A        simpler         rule suffices             for diminishing            the internal           energy.
 Simply place the containing vessel on flexible imperfectly elastic
 supports, and leave                       it   to itself, or leave          it   to itself immersed               in   a
 viscous fluid.                Watch            it   for   a   while till you        see   it   moving        ;   or    if

     This proves that         the orbit lies on the ellipsoid (20)                                    ;   and we con
clude that the orbit          is   the ellipse in which this ellipsoid                                      is   cut by
the plane   (18).
     Going back now to the explicit fully integrated                                            solution (15) and
(16), we see that         a   particle of the fluid describes, relatively to the
moving solid in which                   the fluid              is   contained,            the ellipse           specified
 by
      (18) and (20), according                     to the law of a single particle describing
an    ellipse    under the influence of                             a    force         towards a fixed centre
varying in simple proportion to distance from the centre.
      Now the period of revolution of the containing shell round its
axis of rotation (w, p,                <r)   is    2ir   /e

 one or any two of the quantities a,                   b, c  being     infinitely small,      a> is

 fraction of its retrograde          revolution during the time of one turn of
 the shell in the direction which we are calling forward.                               It  must
not from this be inferred that the fluid moves                            very nearly,      as   if
solid, with the shell.             On the contrary,             it   experiences      large dis
 tortion even in the first complete                   turn of the shell, and largely
 increasing to      a maximum in the course of the first quarter period of
 the   liquid relatively to       the shell.

    2.     The Sacral Index in Various Races of Mankind.                                    By
                      Professor Wm. Turner, M.B., F.RS.
    In     a paper    on     "The Index of           the    Pelvic Brim        as    a basis of
 Classification," which         I  read in September                at the meeting        of the
British       Association in Aberdeen, and published in the Journal of
Anatomy and Physiology, October 1885,                         I   briefly referred to varia
tions in the length and breadth of the sacrum in different                              races of
men, and pointed out that in some                     races the length exceeded the
breadth, and that in others an opposite relation prevailed.                                These
differences      may      be expressed       numerically           by computing         a sacral
index by the following formula                :
                                  sacral breadth x 100
                                      sacral length
When the sacral            index is above          100 the breadth of the bone                  is
greater      than the length, when the index is below 100 the                             sacrum

is longer        than broad.               The following descriptive terms may conve
niently express                 these differences       in the relative length and breadth
of the sacrum.                  As the Greek word Upov is the equivalent of the
Latin sacrum, the term dolichohieric would signify a sacrum in which
the length           exceeded the breadth,              whilst jrfatyhieric would signify                           a
sacrum      in which the breadth exceeded the length.
  In considering                  the modifications in the sacral index, as                              in the
index of the pelvic                   brim, it is important                 to   bear in mind                 that
sex modifies          the relative proportions,              and that in women the sacrum
as a    rule is broader in proportion to its length than in men.
  In working out                     the    results    at which        I    have    arrived,             I   have
measured         a number of aboriginal skeletons,                           a few of which were
brought home by                   H.M.S. "Challenger,"             but the greater number of
which are            in    the Anatomical             Museum of the University of Edin
burgh.          The detailed           measurements          of these skeletons are given in
the Tables           in Part ii. of          my Report on the Human Skeletons, now
in type for               the    Challenger Reports.              I    have      also    examined                 the
literature of the subject so far as                      I   have had access to               it,   and have
analysed        the observations on the length and breadth of the sacrum
recorded        by previous observers.
   Observations                 on   the     length and           breadth of            the     sacrum             in
 Europeans of both sexes by Verneau, Gortz, and Garson have shown
 that     in    them the breadth exceeded the length.                               The mean sacral
 index for European men was                      1
                                                 1     2-4, and for women               117, so that the
 sacrum        in them was platyhieric.
      In aboriginal Australians,                  on the other             hand, the measurements
 of    Keferstein, Barnard Davis, Spengel and                                myself on men have
 shown         that the length of the sacrum                 as   a   rule exceeded the breadth.
        mean         of thirteen adult males was 98-5, i.e., they were dolicho
 hieric.        In    women again the sacrum was relatively broader, and the
 mean      of nine adult females measured by B. Davis, Verneau, Garson,
 and    myself, was 102-5.
       Of the aborigines             of South Africa the mean sacral index of three
 Bushmen,            measured by G. Fritsch and myself, was 94                           ;      and of four
 Bushwomen, measured by Verneau, Gcirtz, and G. Fritsch, was 94-7.
  The      mean       sacral         index of three male              Hottentots,         measured                 by
  Wyman and Fritsch,                       was 83'9, and the index of one female                                  was
  85.      In six     male        Kaffirs, the mean sacral index was                      92-       8.       In   the
  Bush,    Hottentots, and Kaffirs the sacrum was dolichohieric.

    The mean          sacral   index     of twenty-nine         Negros, measured            by
 Verneau, SpengeL            B. Davis, and myself, was 106, i.e., they                  were
 platyhieric    ;  whilst the mean of ten Negresses, measured by Verneau,
 Fritsch, and myself, was only 98-8,                so  that they were dolichohieric.
 If  these specimens give a correct average for the Negro race,                   it would
 seem as    if the sacrum is not so broad in the women                  in proportion        to
 its length    as  in the men.
     In eight     male    Andamanese        measured by Flower, the mean sacral
 index was 94       ;   but in  a  single adult male measured by myself              it  was
 1 1 4, and in a young male 106.              In nine    females measured by Flower,
 the mean sacral index was 106              ;   in three adult females measured by
 me it was 111, and in a young female                  it  was 96'5.     The high index
 of my male Andamanese                is probably exceptional,         and the standard
 of the race is dolichohieric.
     Three male Tasmanians,             measured by Barnard Davis, had a mean
 sacral index 87, so that they were dolichohieric.                   In   a single female
 the index was 104.
     From measurements              of the sacrum          in  Pacific   Islanders,    both
 Polynesians and Melanesians,              or perhaps       a mixture of the two      races,
 made by Verneau, Barnard Davis, and myself, the mean sacral index
 was above 100, so that its proportions were platyhieric.
    The number of sacra belonging to the Guanche and Esquimaux
 races, which       have as      yet been measured,           is too few to frame         an
 average on     ;  but from a few specimens measured                   by Verneau       and
 myself,   it  is probable       that the mean proportions of this               bone    are
 platyhieric.       In     the   Hindoos       and    Sikhs    also  my measurements
 would point to a platyhieric bono.
    The information           regarding the proportions of the sacrum in                 the
 Chinese or other Mongolians               is too scanty to enable one definitely
 to classify this bone.           From measurements of the sacrum                  in  male
 Malays by B. Davis and myself, it is probable                        that the bone        is
 dolichohieric.
    From     the      observations      of von Franque,           Barnard     Davis,    and
 Verneau on the sacrum in North American Indians, and from                               the
measurements           of Verneau, Davis, and Garson on South                   American
aborigines,     it  saems probable        that the sacrum in them is platyhieric.
    Although       additional observations are needed on the sacrum in                      a
larger    number of individuals             of many of the races, yet from               the

     If  this table be compared with the one which                    I gave in my article
 on    the   Index of       the  Pelvic Brim in       the   Journal of Anatomy and
 Physiology, Oct. 1885,            it will  bo seen that a dolichopellic brim is in
 many races conjoined with a dolichohieric sacrum.                         This   is the case,
 for instance,        in  the    Australians,     Bushmen, Kaffirs,           Andamanese,
  Ainos, and Malays.              Again,   a  platypellic brim is conjoined with               a
  platyhieric sacrum           in Europeans, American            Indians, and         probably
  Guanches,       Esquimaux, and Hindoos.               The pelves, which          I  arranged
  in the mesatipellic or intermediate division, partly belong as regards
  the   proportions of the sacrum,           as in the Negros and Melanesians, to
  the   platyhieric group, and partly,           as in the Tasmanians, to that with
   dolichohieric proportions.            As the width of             the    pelvic     brim   is
   materially     influenced by the breadth            of the sacrum, it was only to
   be expected      that    a  platypellic pelvis would have             a  relatively wide
   sacrum,     and that a dolichopellic            pelvis would         have     a   relatively
   narrow sacrum.
       When in a human pelvis the conjugate diameter of the brim is in
   excess    of the      transverse    diameter,     i.e.,   has    dolichopellic       propor
    tions,  and when the proportions of the sacrum are dolichohieric, then
    in these characters         it  accords    with   the    proportions of the pelvis
    in the apes and other mammals               which possess five vertebra; in the
    sacrum.      It  is animalised or degraded in its characters,                as compared
     with a   pelvis which is both platypellic and platyhieric.

the apices        of an equilateral triangle.            The radius of the holes must
not be greater than half the distance                     between      the centres     of two
neighbouring holes, otherwise the sheet would                         be  cut into separate
pieces,      and must not be less than one-third of the said distance,
otherwise there would not be room                     for the neck between two holes
in one sheet to pass without crumpling through the chink caused by
the overlapping            of the holes in the other two sheets.               In   the figure
the    radius of the holes is about two-fifths of the distance                        between
the centres.
     The complex of three sheets is,               as  will  be seen by inspecting the
figure, a case        of what Professor Tait calls         locking.      No two     sheets are
linked together          ;   if any one sheet be abolished the other two come
 apart.       Each      sheet     lies  wholly above one of the other two, and
 wholly below the other.
     The analogy of this complex              to what we may call the Borromean               *
 rings    will be     seen at once.        In   the Borromean         rings figured     below
 (fig. 2), each       ring lies wholly above one of the other two, and wholly
 below the other, so               that while all are in
 extricably locked together, no two are linked,
 and     if any      one is abolished        the other two
 come apart.
     The      complex of sheets            may    be   applied
  to   other      surfaces      besides   the plane.       Two
  other     surfaces,      viz., the     cylinder     and the
  anchor-ring,       will   be considered     here.                          Fig.  2-
      To apply the complex to                 a   cylinder    or to clothe        a   cylinder
  with the interlaced sheets, we must cut the complex by two parallel
  lines,    and roll up the            strip thus cut out        so that the two         edges
  shall    join     and     form what may           be called the seam.            But    there
  must     not be any peculiarity             at   the seam;      the    pattern    must    run
  through        the seam without           any discontinuity       ;   therefore     the two
   parallel    lines must cut the complex in the same manner,                          so  that
   each    part of a hole divided by one line may find its exact con
   tinuation at the seam when the strip is rolled up.

   the  Italian family Borromco.

     There are, of course, an infinite number of ways in which such a
strip may be rolled up into                     a    cylinder.          But in whatever way the
cylinder is formed,               if    we cut      it along        a generating       line, and    unroll
it,   we may take the parallel edges of the flat strip as the                                 two lines
defining, on the plane complex,                        the particular cylinder.                We may
move these two parallel lines, parallel to themselves,                                  retaining     their
distance      from one another, in any way, and they will still represent
the same cylinder, because we may form                                  this flat strip bycutting
the cylinder through any generating                             line.     Two parallel lines will
therefore        represent        a     cylinder     if     the points in which they                 inter
sect   a    line at right angles to them are always similarly situated in
reference to the complex.
      The number of cylinders                  is    obviously infinite, but they may all
be grouped under two genera.                          For   a   part of      a   hole, cut off by one of
the parallel lines, may, at the seam, find its continuation                                    in   a part
of    a    hole, either first, in the same sheet, or second, in one of the
other sheets.
      In   the   first     case    we have three               distinct sheets locked together.
In    the second we have only one sheet wound three times round the
cylinder,        and knotted.                When we have three independent sheets
we can colour or shade                      them     independently, each having its own
colour or shading, but when there                              is    only one sheet this            is   not
possible.         In this        case      the only way of distinguishing                  the layers     is
by varying the colour, or shading,                        continuously            as   we go round the
cylinder,        so   that after three turns we come back to the colour                                   or
shading with which                 we started.          This has been done in the models
exhibited.
      We     have      assumed             that the complex             is   flexible, we shall now
assume that           it   is   also extensible,       so      that we can draw          it   out in     any
particular direction, and make the circular holes into ellipses.                                         We
shall assume that any deformation may be produced                                        without affect
ing the character of the complex                          as   long     as the     topological relation
of the layers         is   preserved.          This extension            is      not of any use     if    we
confine       ourselves          to cylinders,         for there        is   no     topological     change
produced         by twisting           a   cylinder.        The meaning of the extension will
bo seen when we come to apply the complex to an anchor-ring.
      An anchor-ring              can be made out of             a    cylinder in two ways.              We
may cut the cylinder by two planes                             at right angles to the axis, and

                                  oj Edinburgh, Session 1885-86.                                                     385
   bend the part thus cut out round so that its axis becomes the core
   of the anchor-ring;               or we may cut the cylinder, and then widen out
   the two ends,              and bend them over                   so   that they may unite and form
   a seam            not about the core,           as    in       the last mentioned case, but about
   the axis        of the anchor-ring. An anchor-ring has thus two seams — ¦
   one a         circle with its centre in the axis, and one a circle with its
   centre        in the core — and it can be reduced to a cylinder, either by
   cutting the first,             and,    if    we may coin the word, "unflyping,"                              or by
   cutting the second,               and unbending.
            We   see     then that just           as a        cylinder can be represented                    by two
   parallel lines, so an anchor-ring can be represented                                        by   a    parallelo
   gram.              The condition         here        is,   that the parallel sides of the paral
       lelogram cut            the   complex in precisely the                          same    way.          Such         a
       parallelogram          will in     general represent                two anchor-rings          ;      we must
       therefore indicate which of the two pairs                               of parallel lines        represents
       the seam         about the axis,          and which the seam about the core.                                   To
       transfer from this plane                  plan to an actual anchor-ring — that                               is,   to
       make      a    model such        as those        shown to the Society — we have only
       to remember            that the four corners                     of the parallelogram represent
       the single        point in which the two seams intersect                         ;   that the one pair
       of   parallel sides        represent        the one seam, the other                     the other        ;    and
       that lines parallel to these pairs                      of sides are to be measured on the
       anchor-ring,          in   the one case                along     the circumference of                a    circle
       about the         axis, in the other         case          along the circumference of                 a   circle
       about the core.
            As there are two genera of cylinders, one knotted and one locked,
       so    there       are four genera            of anchor-rings.               1st, locked          about         the
^=t»   axis      and locked          about        the core         ;    2nd,    locked       about       the        axis
       and       knotted       about     the core       ;      3rd, knotted            about the         axis and
       locked about the core                ;    4th, knotted about the axis and knotted
       about the core.            Of    these only the first, which                    is   not knotted at all,
       consists        of three distinct sheets               ;   the second      is   reduced to        a      locked
       cylinder         by cutting                             seam about the axis, to                       knotted
                                        it it
                                                along    a                                              a
        cylinder        by cutting              along    a        seam about the core          ;    in      the third
        these     relations are reversed; in whichever way the                                   fourth          is       re
        duced      to   a   cylinder,   a   knotted cylinder               is   produced.
            It   is   worthy of notice that anchor-rings of                         the fourth          kind        have
            vol.      nil                                                                               2   n

the  third) kind, with two holes altogether ; MALN the smallest

only one hole altogether.
     We     have          hitherto considered              the complex                   as    composed       of per
forated sheets locked together, or of a perforated sheet knotted, but
there is another way in which it may be imagined.
     AVo saw that the smallest                      circular hole had                    a    radius of one-third
of the distance               between          the centres         of two neighbouring holes in
the same sheet;                  but we can make the hole smaller                                    if,   instead    of
making          it   circular, we make              it   hexagonal.              There          is   then no    waste
space;      every          part of the complex               is       composed                of two layers,         one
over the other.              Now we may suppose this hexagonal boundary to                                           be,
not the edge of              a   hole, but      a    line of intersection, where the surface,
instead of ceasing, disappears                       between the two other sheets.
     The knitted model exhibited illustrates this form of complex.

real evidence             for the result, without                 the imposing array of symbols
which       is   usually marshalled                 in papers on that Theory.

                            of Edinburgh, Session 1885-86.                                    387
     1.    Prop.    VI. of Clerk-Maxwell's well-known                 earliest investigation
of this subject          (Phil. Mag.       1860,   I.    25) deals with        two systems of
colliding spheres           (those in each system being equal to one another).
Their coefficient          of restitution     is unity, and they rebound without
loss      of energy from the walls of the containing vessel.                         His     state
ment  is that, after many collisions, the average kinetic energy of                               a
sphere is (ultimately) the same in each of the colliding systems.
  Particular stress must be laid on the words                         I   have put in italics,
because         they form the basis of the whole theory.                        Without colli
sions there         could be no law of any kind                 ;   the arrangement          would
be, and would            continue to be, an absolutely haphazard                     one     about
whose       character we could not possibly reason.                   And only after many
collisions, among great numbers of spheres, can there be any approach
to a      statistical finality of arrangement.
     The theorem is undoubtedly true, provided the number of spheres
in each system             be extremely large, while those of one system                         are
not       extremely numerous             in comparison          with those of the other              ;
but the proof given by Maxwell has more than one very objection
able feature.
     The chief of these is the assumption (for it is nowhere justified)
     2.
that the transference   of energy from system to system can be
calculated without             taking account of the mode of its distribution
among           the particles of either system.                 This assumption            enables
 Maxwell to reduce the question to the treatment                          of the consequences
 of a single impact between                   P
                                       and a Q (these letters represent the
                                          a
 mass      of a sphere of either system) ; each having the average energy
 of the system to which             it   belongs, and being thus regarded as typical
 of its system.            It is typical of all    the impacts        between a      P   and a Q
 (here         called   simultaneous)      which     take place in the average                time
 which elapses between              any two successive              impacts     of a particular
 P     on some      Q or   other.
       The elegance of the investigation is farther enhanced                        by the addi
 tional        assumption that, in obtaining the results of this typical impact,
 the      original directions of motion of the              P   and Q may be taken as at
 right angles to one another.
       The basis for this assumption               is,   apparently,      a   previous proposi
 tion,     which shows that the mean square relative velocity of                         a   P   and
 a   Q    is    the sum of the mean square                speeds of the        Ps   and the Qs.

This proposition             is true, under the conditions assumed, and can be
proved as below,* by a process much easier                                          for the beginner than
that of Maxwell
    But       if   this assumption were justifiable,                            a    farther application of
the same principle should bring out that                                    P   and Q (being treated                  as
typical particles after,                 as     well     as    before,          colliding)           also separate
after     impact with             motions in             directions at right                        angles    to one
another.           For,      in    the     cases       here       considered,                  an   instantaneous
reversal of each velocity would make the                                    whole system                retrace its
motion.f            Maxwell's           formulae,        however,           show that in general the
directions          of motion after the typical impact are not at right
angles to one another.                    It   is clear that this objection is fatal to the
method.
    But       there       is yet a farther objection.                       In interpreting the                result
obtained in virtue of the assumptions                                   already           described,         Maxwell
exaggerates the rate               of equalisation of the average energy in                                     each
system        by treating the question as                         if   every         P impinged on                  a Q
in the        " simultaneous         "
                                         sense above           spoken of              ;       and thus ignoring
the almost          incomparably more numerous particles of each system
which, during the very short period contemplated,                                                 were either free
from impacts or impinged on fellow particles.
    So that, finally, he arrives at the very startling conclusion                                                   that
the difference            of the average kinetic energies of                              a   particle from         each
system         is reduced         at every group of simultaneous impacts                                       in    the
ratio    (P    - Q)'2/ (P + Q)2.               Thus the equalisation of average kinetic
    *                             of the square of the distance of any point on a sphere
        The mean value,
from an internal or external            point A, is the sum of the squares of the radius of
the sphere and of the distance of A from the centre.   Divide the spherical
surface into pairs of elements by double cones, of very small angle, whose
vertices are at the centre. For each pair of these the theorem is obviously
true.     Hence if the speeds of two points be p and q, their mean square relative
speed    is   +     q1.
                     From this the above statement follows at once       provided                       ;
that all directions are equally likely for each amount of speed.
 t    Here we meet with       quasi-metaphysical difficulty, which must be men

tioned in passing.     For,    ma)' bo said, since there

                                                                                is
mere instantaneous     reversal of    state which

a  state whose tendency      to depart from finality, i.e., to get back to the exact
                                   is
reverse of its original condition.     True, and most important, but not fatal to
the conclusion     unless an infinite time has elapsed since the start.

  Sir W. Thomson has suggested that part of Clerk-Maxwell's                                         MSS.
must have been,          by mistake, omitted in sending to press.                                But I do
not    think that this idea is confirmed                         by a careful examination of
the text.
  Thus it appears that the objections to Maxwell's proof depend,
in the main, upon his having                        commenced           too soon to simplify by
means      of averages.          It    does not appear             that his method, when the
objectionable         assumptions are put aside, can be applied in any simple
manner (see Proc.           R.S.E., Dec.                 15, 1884).         But the investigation
may be      conducted very simply,                  as   follows, by        a   method       which shows
clearly, at every step, what assumptions are made and how they are
to be     justified.
      3. "When      two impinging spheres are of equal mass, their velocities
in the direction of the line              joining their            centres at impact are simply
interchanged.            Hence the impact of                 a    P   on a      P   alters (in general)
the    distribution of kinetic energy in the system, but does not alter
its average       value per particle.               These results are, of course, obvious                         ;
but they show how            it       comes about that one particle among a very
great     number of equal ones (which originally had equal speeds, lot
us say) may    attain any speed, however great ; while others may be
brought (for a brief period) to rest.                            This has always, in my expe
rience,     formed      a serious        difficulty         to    beginners.          But,     as    will    be
seen,     it is   a necessary characteristic of statistical uniformity.
      To take a simple       case,      this will occur whenever a special particle
always      impinges on others,            so       that its own direction of motion is
 perpendicular         to, and that of the other                   along,       the line of centres at
 each impact.           For it thus       gets at each impact the whole energy of
 the    two, and       it might go on doing so till it had reduced all the
 others    to rest.      No doubt the acquirement of large speeds is common
 enough,     but only for a few at              a   time even among                 a very     large group
 of particles.         It will    presently be shown that there is                               a   special
 distribution       of relative position and velocity among the particles                                      ;
 towards     which there         is,   on the whole, an approximation, though not
 necessarily      a   continuous one.           In this          special distribution,          all speeds
 occur,    but the number of particles which have either high or low
 speeds     (as compared with the mean square speed)      very small                  is   a

390                        Proceedings       of the Royal Society
fraction of the whole group.                 After    a very long period the final state
will     be one   of irregular fluctuation about this             " special" distribution,
a   fluctuation confined within              limits which are (relatively) narrower
as the     whole number           of particles is greater.           This special    distribu
tion, of course, is that of uniform number of particles, zero of average
velocity in every direction, and
                                 " error-law " distribution                          of equal
amounts          of kinetic energy, in every region of given volume large
enough         to contain a very great number of particles.                    Of this pro
position satisfactory proof has been given by Maxwell; but we may
obtain it very simply by the following considerations.
    4.    The tendency          is to levelling all round.           The only things to be
levelled are the distribution of the whole momentum                          in each direc
tion, and the distribution              of energy among the various velocities.
The first depends on direction cosines, the second on their squares.
From       a   point, lay off lines representing            the velocities   of the various
particles.        The ends of these lines of lengths r to r + dr must                          be
uniformly         spread       in tho volume 4-nr2dr.              This   secures    that the
momentum           is equally and similarly distributed                   in all directions.
The energy condition requires                 that,    if   there be a final state at all,
tho number of ends in unit of that volume shall be subject to the
" error-law,"       i.e., expressed     by Ae~r*'al.          This    law is the only one
which (when the momentum condition is secured) does not make
               number of " ends
                                "
the calculated                    in a given volume dependent
upon our choice            of rectangular     axes.         We have now to show how
the collisions tend to produce                 this result,       and also to prove       that
they tend to maintain it.
    Impacts on           the     containing vessel          do   not alter r,       and   thus
can shift        only the position of an          " end      "
                                                                 on the spherical surface
of which r is the radius.               And     the impact         of two equal particles
(as we saw above), does not alter the distribution  of velocity along
the line of centres, nor in any direction perpendicular to it.
    Hence impacts, in all of which the line of centres is parallel                             to
one common          line, produce no change in the arrangement of velocity-
components         along that line, nor along any line at right angles to                      it.
But      there   will   be,   in general, changes along every other line.                 It   is
these which lead gradually to the final result, in which the distribu
tion of velocity -components       the same for all directions.
                                        is

to alter     it.    For then     the uniformity of distribution of the spheres
in space, and the symmetry of distribution of velocity among them,
enable      us   (by the principle of averages) to dispense with the only
limitation above imposed, viz., the parallelism of the lines of centres
in the collisions         considered.
     5.   When a      P   impinges on     a Q, let u and v be       their velocity-com
ponents (measured towards               the same parts) in the line of centres at
impact.         Let    these   be   changed    by the impact to       u'  and v' respect
ively.       Then the ordinary text-book result is
                      P(«'-«)=
                                      ~|^(«-«)= -QC'-*).
     From this we deduce immediately
               " "2)  =  _                   " Qv2 " (P - Q)'"')     =   - Q(w'2 -
      P("*2
                            (prly-^"2
 This shows          the amount       of energy transferred        between     the  P  and
 the Q at one impact.
      6.  To obtain an average from this we begin by assuming                          that
  the    Ps and Qs are thoroughly mixed, and are separately in the
   "            "
     special condition of § 4.             Of course, this implies that there is a
  very large       number of particles of      each   kind.     We also assume, what
   will probably on consideration            be granted, that the mutual actions
  of the     Ps alone, and of the Qs alone, still tend to preserve in each
   system this
                    " special " state ; or to restore it if it should be disturbed
   by the      action of some Ps upon           Qs.    This   is based partly on the
   uniform mixing of the           Ps  and Qs, partly upon the small percentage
   of each system        which is involved in any "simultaneous"                collisions.
   If  this   be granted,     it is  clear that we may assume that for a great
   number      of simultaneous (§      2, above) impacts     of Ps on Qs, the average
   value of uv is at least      approximately zero.*         The reader must bear in
    mind    that « and       v are velocity-components         parallel to the line of
    centres,   which may have any direction.             But we also     see that we may
    now   look on the average value of        Yu- - Qu2     as being   two-thirds of the
      *
         There is no inconsistency     between the two expressions above, viz., "great
    number     of simultaneous impacts," and
                                                    " small percentage of each system
    which is involved in any simultaneous          collisions." For we must remember
    that the whole number of particles          is very great; and even a "small per
             "
                of a very great number may itself be
                                                          " a great number. "

Ps    lose energy            on the whole            if,     and only          if,   their average            energy
is   greaterthan that of the Qs they impinge on.     But such gaiu
or losses of energy distribute themselves 'through the systems of Ps
and Qs separately; so that, on the whole, there  transference                             is                         of
energy from the Ps to the Qs so long, and only so long, as                                                         the

made         in order that our results might be such as they are.
     And we see at once that the investigation,                                    from the point of view
taken, would                have     been     barren           of interpretable              result had it not

ratio,       of   the      number      of    Ps which impinged                       on Qs, to the whole
number          of   Ps.
     Now                    assumptions were themselves justified solely
                  these                                                                                         by the

own internal              actions     are     concerned, tends in the long run to that
special state.             We are not warranted       in concluding that either (a)
or    (b)    would hold true            unless the separate systems tended by their

have no internal
                 impacts.                          This would be the                      case    if     the Qs were
mere points;               i.e.    particles of diameters                     infinitely          small in        com

 Nothing above, so                 far at least as we have developed                               it,   warrants us
in
     concluding that the                Qs   will tend to              a   special state, and, therefore,
 acquire the same

subject of the corollary to Maxwell's Prop.                                  VI.
   We now pass to a different, but closely connected subject.
   9.   Boltzmann's generalisation of the corollary to Clerk-Maxwell's
Theorem, in which it is asserted that, after numerous                                       collisions, the
average energy is the same for each degree of freedom                                       of the similar
and equal       complex particles of a colliding system, has proved                                             a
stumbling-block in the way of the Kinetic Theory, by being appa
rently irreconcilable with one or other of two experimental facts,
(1) the value of the ratio of the                        specific heats of a gas, (2) the com
plexity of the spectrum                    of   a   self-luminous         gas.
   It   appears from the above                       that there           is     an immediate mode of
escape from this difficulty, provided                               the complex particles be                   so
constructed that there                     is not perfect           access for collision           between
every degree of freedom                    of one particle and every degree of freedom
of every other.             We      cannot further consider                      this here, but pass for
a moment        to another view of the subject.
   For, even        if Boltzmann's Theorem                         were true without this condi
tion, we must not at once conclude that                                 a gas cannot       consist of such
complex particles.                Every experiment shows that some, at least, of
the quicker vibrating parts of the particle must be constantly losing
energy by uncompensated                         radiation; and when the whole                    is,   in   spite
of this, kept at what we call constant                                   temperature,        the requisite
supply of energy comes in                       a   translational form by impacts on                         the
walls of the vessel.                We      may form an approximation, to what would
then happen, by the simple expedient of supposing the coefficient
of restitution        to     be less than unity                     for some of the degrees                    of
freedom.        In such         a   case the         equations of§             5   become, respectively,

§   9,   in       the most        general       form, would lead to details too complex
for      the ordinary              reader.        We will therefore                     take    another        speci»l
case,       in order        to point out how the results are modified by other
simple assumptions of the kind spoken of there.
      Let     there be three systems             of particles such that Ps and Qs are
as before,             but each       Q   has an R, which cannot impinge on anything
but its special                 Q.       Thus we may suppose each        in the forme:         Q
arrangement (§7) to be made hollow, and to have an                                                    R     (free) put
inside it
      We are not prepared,                       so     far as we have gone,                        to treat        this
question           if    the R's,         like the Ps and Qs, have unit coefficient                                      of
restitution.               For,   §   8   above, the R's do not impinge on one another.
                                                                                                                         bp
      But     if    wo suppose            the coefficient          of restitution of               Q   and   R     to
less than unity, and the interior                                of   a   Q     so nearly equal to the                   1!
inside, that between every two collisions of the                                         Q     with    an external
particle there             is   time for the            R    inside        it   to be reduced to relative
rest (or what may be treated                            as such) we may approximate to                                  the
ultimate state of things.
      The equations in               § 6   still hold        good for each impact of                   aP     on   s     Q.
But, immediately after the impact, the                                 Q   impinges on iis             R;    with       the

  To get a notion of the nature                          of this        result, suppose            as    before
» = p, v = v.        Also let Q          =    3R,   P   =    4R, then we find by the above
methods that ultimately x is                  nearly the double of y.
  If    we had unit coefficient                of restitution                 Q and K, and
                                                                        between
were to assume         Boltzmann's               result here,        we should have x to y as
1:2;      because     the Qs consist              of two separate parts, each                          of which
(having the same number                  of degrees of freedom) would ultimately
have the same energy           as a       P.
  12.     Without      more    formidable mathematical                         processes we cannot
well push these investigations                   further      :-— but    enough has been done to
show on what bases            Clerk-Maxwell's                 Theorem          really rests        ;    and,    at
the same time,        to show       that even were Boltzmann's                                extension of it
rigorously proved, it need               not prevent us from accepting                            the kinetic
theory, which has        furnished such simple and complete explanations
of many puzzling
                          phenomena.                    It    is not      at all likely                that    the
particles of any gas
                     (be            it    even mercury vapour)                    behave          as    if their
coefficient of restitution          were exactly               unity.      They would probably
require, in order      to do     so, a           steady supply of heat                    ;    perhaps        other
things of which we have                  as    yet no knowledge.                      Among these un

 and the walls of the

 and the mode         in which the                  energy thus received                       is distributed
 among the degrees         of freedom of a                       particle,        may           differ widely
 from those which
                  regulate                the impact of particle                     on particle.

      If   the        particles in the layer were all moving with                                    a common

      So far, all is             so   obvious      as   not to require               proof.        Now suppose
 v   to be the common speed of the impinging                                        spheres, and that they
 all move perpendicularly to the layer.                                Also suppose that all            spheres

     Th us the fraction of the impinging particles which traverses this

400                       proceeding's   of   the   Royal Society
path is to be found by multiplying the free path for each speed by
the probability of the particle's having that speed, and adding the
results.       This gives
                                                    X

It   is obvious, from what precedes, that               if the particles of   the medium
traversed          quiescent, the mean path through them (at any
               had been
speeds) would have been simply the first factor of this, viz.,
                                         J_
Hence the definite integral above, which                  is,   of coarse, a mere numeri
cal quantity, expresses the ratio in which the mean path                      is   shortened
in    consequence        of the motion of the particles of the medium tra
versed.       By     a   rough process of quadratures (at intervals                  of   0-*25
from    0   to 3),
                 I       find its value to be about
                                         0-677      +
but  I     hope soon      to evaluate   it   more exaotly.          To check this      result
I    traced by points the curve whose area              is   expressed   by the integral,
cut   it   out in stout tinfoil, and compared                its weight with that of         a
square unit.         The result was 0*682, but          I    had probably allowed          too
much for the infinitely extended part of the area, which                      it   was very
difficult to represent properly by            a   process of this nature.

                                                                                                        401
                                of Edinburgh, Session 1885-86.
       Clausius gave, from his                    point of view (equal speeds, equally dis
 tributed       in      all   directions), the factor
                                                       0-75.
This can           be   readily obtained from the above formulae be/ore                            the in
troduction           of   the    distribution          of     speed.       It    is   accurate from the
point     of    view taken            by    Clausius, but      it   is   inapplicable to the kinetic
theory.
     Clerk-Maxwell gave the value —= or, nearly,
                                                      0-707.
     But his process                  is,
                                       I         think, based       on     a   questionable    definition,
which has since been adopted                          by Meyer, Watson, and                   others, who
have written on the                   Kinetic Theory.                It    involves the assumption
that the mean free path                      is   expressed     by
                                  Average speed of              a   particle
            Average           number of collisions              per particle per second.
But,   in    order       to    find     either the numerator                   or the denominator of
this fraction,          recourse            is   had to the ordinary definition of                 a   mean,
that which we have used above.
  Those who              adopt        this deviation,           from the ordinary method of
finding     a   mean,          must face the question                  : — Why not adopt another
equally plausible              deviation, and define the mean free path as
       (Average         time of describing              a   free path)         x   (average speed)     1

        It   gives for the reducing factor the approximate value 0-647                                          ;
   which falls short of 0'677 nearly as much as that, in its turn, falls
   short of 0-707.
        From the point of view                  here taken, the process               usually adopted
   virtually amounts to assuming that the                           mean value of a number of
   fractions is to bo found by dividing the mean of the numerators by
   the mean of the denominators.                         The reason for the close approxi
   mation of the results obtained by these different methods is to be
   sought in the fact that the great majority                            of the particles have
   speeds differing but         little from the            mean square.
        It   is usual to express the result of this investigation                                   in the form

        It   may be worth          while to remark, in this connection,                               that the
   somewhat elaborate              process,         by which Meyer*             obtains the                  mean
   number of collisions undergone by a particle in unit of time,                                        can be
   very much simplified.              For, by what is said              above,        it       is   easy to see
   that      ev represents    the average number of collisions which                                    will   be
   undergone,      per second, by           a   particle whose speed            is,   and remains,                  r.
   Hence,      taking account of the distribution                    of speed among                    the im
   pinging particles, we have for the average number of collisions                                             per
  particle, per second, Meyer's expression

The value of               this (which Meyer obtains by expanding in                                      an infinite
series,      integrating, and summing) may be obtained by noting that
while the two parts must, from their meaning,                                               be equal, the second
part can be              integrated at once           as       it   stands.
   Or we may change the order of integration in the first, and find
that       it is transformed into               the second.
     Or we may obtain it by inspection,                                    if       we merely transform the
double integrals by the assumptions

is    done we            find that the mean number of collisions                                     is   2   v/2jt am".

      the     Autumn of 1885.     By   Y. Buchanan. (Plate XL).
                                                       J.
       In    the course     of the autumn of this year (1885)       have taken                       I
   several        occasions to determine the distribution of temperature in the
   water          of    Loch       Lomond.          The results of these observations are
     interesting, as         indicating the march of temperature                                     in the different
   layers         at   different    localities in the lake, and also the gain and loss
      of   heat    with the changing seasons.
           Loch    Lomond          is   divided naturally into three basins.                              If   the level

  404                       Proceedings of the Royal Society
  of    the water were reduced             by about       8 fathoms,    it would       form         three
  lakes,    — the upper and        largest extending from the head of the                     loch to
   Rowardennan,           the middle       one from Rowardennan                to the       chain of
  islands stretching          from        Luss     to     Balmaha,     and     the third,            and
  shallowest,        from    these       islands    to     Balloch.     The        ridges      which
  separate these basins are covered                 in    the present state of the lake by
  from      5 to 8   fathoms of water.              The    lowest,    or Balloch      basin, is of
  great extent and comparatively                    shallow, having a maximum                   depth
  of 13 fathoms.            The middle, or Luss basin, is also of                    considerable
  extent, and has a maximum                    depth       of 35 fathoms.          The      upper,    or
  Tarbet basin, is long and narrow,                        and very deep, the            maximum
  depth being 105 fathoms.                     At    the upper end of this               basin is a
  subsidiary one, which              I    call the Ardlui basin, with                a maximum
  depth of 34 fathoms, and separated from the main basin by a ridge
  with a probable maximum depth of 17 fathoms.
     The general direction of the lake is north and south, so that the

  into squalls, which blow sometimes up and sometimes                                     down the
  lake.  At Tarbet there      deep rift in the mountains
                                     is    a                                             separating
  Loch Lomond from Loch Long, which gives access to the westerly
  winds to this part of the lake. On the whole, the geographical posi
  tion of the lake tends to neutralise the effect of the prevailing                           wind?.
       Extended      temperature observations                 were made on the following
 days:— 18th August, 5th and 22nd September, 15th October, and
  14th November.    On the 18th August observations were made only
 in the Tarbet basin, and only down to a        of 30 fathoms. On

a    Kew corrected                  standard.           The    temperatures          given are all in
terpis of the               Kew standard.               As   a rule, the same thermometer                 has
been sent           to the same depth.                  Further, the same sounding line was
used on            all occasions.
     The results are collected                     in    tables, and      in    some cases         they are
represented            graphically by curves.
     If    we represent the distribution                      of temperature          graphically by a
curve,       having depths              measured along the horizontal line of abscissae
and temperatures along the ordinates,                              the winter distribution                will
be    represented by a straight line parallel to the line of                              abscissae,   such
as    A.       As the spring            advances and the meridian altitude of the sun
daily increases,              the temperature             of the surface rises rapidly.                   The
heat       received at the surface                is,   during this season, propagated down
wards, chiefly               by conduction, which, in water,                     is   a   comparatively
slow process,                hence      the temperature            of the surface,          and     of the
layers near           it,   rises    much more rapidly than that of those below                            it,
and consequently the curve                          representing       the vertical distribution
takes the            form      B,    which,       from the bottom to within about 15
fathoms            of the surface,            preserves       its parallelism to the               line    of
abscissae,           but then           bends      sharply upwards,             presenting         a   well-
marked convexity to the origin.                               This convexity of the curve                  is
the       distinctive feature            of   a   vernal distribution of temperature.                     As
the        summer           advances      the temperature           of the surface            no    longer
increases           at the same rate as before, indeed                    it    tends      always more
and more             to become constant.                  The heat of the surface layers                    is,
however, always being propagated                              downwards by conduction, and
    when      the temperature             of the surface layer has become nearly con
 stant,      it    follows that, at some depth                 a   little below the         surface, the
    temperature        will    be rising more quickly than                     in   the layers above,
 and this           produces        a   slight bulge in the curve               C,   representing         the
    distribution.    This part of the curve presents concavity to the           a
    origin    which, combined with the pronounced convexity below and
    the     less    marked convexity above,                    produces        the typical         summer
    distribution.     When the autumn has set in, and the surface tempera
    ture    falls from day to day, heat still being propagated downwards
                                                        is
     by   conduction and convection,                    the curve takes the typical autumnal

distribution varies at the different stations, there is little difference
in the mean temperature of the 30 fathoms,                   it is higher      at Row-
creeshie       than farther north.        From the surface to 10 fathoms the
highest temperatures are at the lower end                of the basin, from 15 to
30 they are        nearer the upper end.          At  15 fathoms the temperature
at C ulness      is lower than either north or south of it.

for   experimenting, except perhaps              at Culness, when it threatened
for a few       minutes to blow and rain.          Otherwise it was almost quite
calm,     with overcast sky, so that there was no overheating by the
sun or     cooling by the wind.

      Owing to the overcast state of the sky, there is            little variation in
  the   temperature       of the surface.      Below the surface there is again
  considerable        variation,  but    the maximum          range,    2°'25    at    15
  fathoms, is less      than was observed on 18th August.              The character
   of the    distribution is distinctly       autumnal.     On 18th August the
  observations       were confined to the Tarbet basin and were limited
   to   30    fathoms; to-day      they extend to the three deep basins of
   the   loch.    The Ardlui and the Luss basins resemble each other in
   that   their maximum depth is about the same — 34 fathoms                 ;  but the
   Ardlui      basin   is separated    from     the  Tarbet     one   by a ridge of
   probably      17  fathoms, while the ridge shutting off the Luss basin
   has a   maximum       depth of only     8   fathoms, cold deep water is thus
    enabled    to penetrate   from the Tarbet basin into the Ardlui basin,
    but not into     the Luss basin.       Further, the Ardlui basin           receives,
    for its size, a  much greater supply of the affluent waters              from the

•110                  Proceedings     of the Royal Society
land, so that its waters in winter are probably colder than those of
the lake lower down.
    In  accordance     with the autumnal character of the distribution,
the temperature of the first 10 fathoms approaches                     uniformity   at
all the stations.       It   is highest at Ardlui, being 56°-2, and lowest
at    Rowardennan,        being    55°-l.       The    steepest   gradients   are all
between      10  and    20 fathoms.          They are steeper in the         shallow
basins   than    in the     deep   ones ;    in the Ardlui basin the         averaga
gradient is l°-53 per fathom between 10 and 15 fathoms.
    On  7 th  September the Inversnaid             station was revisited, and     the
temperatures      on the gradients          accurately ascertained        by sending
thermometers       to every fathom, from 13 to 17 inclusive, with                  the
following result :—

     The mean gradient in these              four fathoms of water is 1°-19        per
 fathom, the maximum is 1°*55 between 16 and 17 fathoms.                             It
 is therefore probable that the actual maximum gradient in the Ard
 lui basin may     be as much as 2° per fathom.
    Owing to a mistake, 105 fathoms of line were paid out at Cul-
 ness and Inversnaid        instead of    1 00,  which accounts for the irregular
 intervals between        the thermometers        at the deeper depths.         From
 30 to 70 fathoms the temperature              of the water is slightly higher       at
 Stuckgowan than at Inversnaid.                From     70 fathoms to the bottom
 the water at the three deep stations is sensibly uniform, namely,
 41°-8.    On 7th September the three thermometers,                     Noe. 47,   79,
 and 80, were sent down together to 60 fathoms at Inversnaid,                     and
 their corrected     temperatures     were 41°-9, 41°-9, and 41"'85.            There
 is,Uherefore, a fall of 01° between               60 and    100    fathoms at this
  season  of the    year.     The   same thermometers were also            sent to  30
 fathoms in the Luss basin, and their corrected                readings were    47""0,
  47*0, and 47°0.

     '22ml September         1885.   — The     weather was very stormy, and had
been so        for a fortnight, with much rain, so that the level of the
lake     was     very    high.       Wind fresh from           the    south-west.         The
 weather was so           squally that it was difficult to keep station.                   At
 the Ross       Mill station I kept        the launch head to       wind with       a couple
 of   oars out,      but it was not very successful.                  At the other two
 stations     I  kept her stern to wind, with a steer-oar out over the how
 aad occasionally        driving the engine astern.            At Inversnaid       the wind
 was so
            strong that     I was     able to keep the engine           going continually
 dead slow       astern, and kept station well.

  constant temperature          is now about 15 fathoms thick at all the
  stations,     and the steepest         gradients are found between                 15   and

 easterly wind.          For three days a strong northerly wind had been
 blowing with dry weather, and for a fortnight before there had been
 a succession of cyclonic gales, with much rain, so that at                      the begin

this date may be         mentioned the rapid cooling which has taken place
in the interval since 22nd September,             the mean temperature         of the
first 30 fathoms        having fallen about      3°  F. at Eoss   Mill   and   Inver-
snaid.       It will  be seen that    in the Luss basin the distribution          has
become nearly         quite uniform from surface to bottom, and at Ardlui
the water is      rapidly approaching      the same condition.        The tempera-
tore     of the water from the surface             to 20   fathoms    is practically
uniform.        At Eoss Mill, in       the Luss basin,      and at Eowardennan
and     Stuckgowan, in the Tarbet basin, it is much alike, namely,
49°-12, 49°-04,        and 49°.    At Inversnaid it     has fallen to 48°-24, and
                 i'lG. 3. — Curves ot Temperature,   15th October  1885.
  at  Ardlui it is as low at 460,58.        The depth of water at Eoss           Mill
  and at    Ardlui is nearly identical (34 fathoms), but the Luss basin
  is  large, broad, and situated near the outflow of the lake ; while the
  Ardlui basin is small and confined, and situated close to the head of
   the  loch, so that     it might  almost   be taken as forming         part of the
   embouchure       of the river Falloch.      On the 5th September          the tem
   perature    of the water down to 15 fathoms was nearly alike in the
   two basins,     but below 15 fathoms it was much colder at Ardlui than
   at  Eoss   Mill,  the difference   being l°-75 at 30 fathoms.
       In  the  following table the mean temperature           of the water found
    between the surface       and 20 fathoms, the surface         and    30 fathoms,

   A   comparison     of these data brings out very clearly the difference in
conditions obtaining in the two basins notwithstanding their likeness
in depth.     At Ardlui the predominating influenco is that of the                  import
ant tributary, the Falloch, which influences the temperature of                            the
lake water in its neighbourhood most, while its temperature is lower
than that of the lake.        On   1 6th October the temperature               of the water
of  the Douglas was 44°      "6 F., while that of the       surface     of the lake in      its
neighbourhood was 49°-0.             On 13th November the temperature of
the stream at Inversnaid was 40", and that                 of  the lake surface 46'.
From its rise and course the Falloch is more likely to be colder thin
warmer than these streams, so that even                 in October it           must    hire
begun to spread its cooling influence over the lower waters of                             the
Ardlui basin.       When the water of the stream                 is warmer than          that
of the lake surface, it passes away with the drainage, and imparts                           as
much of its heat to the atmosphere              above   it   as to the water below.
When its     temperature      is lower than that       of   the lake surface, and in
all probability it is so for more than half the year, it sinks into                        the
body of the lake, and imparts its cold entirely                  to its; deeper waters
It  is obvious then that during the time that it is colder than                            the
lake, the water of the Falloch must produce                     a much greater effect
on   it than during the         opposite     season ; hence       the position of the
Ardlui station, with       respect    to the principal        tributary of the          lake,
renders    it natural to      expect     that its waters would be colder                than
they are found to be in the Luss basin, which, from its size                              an<i
position,    is comparatively         exempt from the direct                  influence      of
tributary waters.
   Both in September         and in October the temperature of all                     these
bodies    of water  is lower at     Ardlui than at Luss, but             the contrast is
much greater in the colder than in the hotter month.

                         of Edinburgh,       Session 1885-86.                        415
    In   the Tarbet basin a salient feature             is the greater mixture of
waters at      Iavcrsnaid     than at either Rowardennan or Stuckgowan,
the curves at      the latter localities being much steeper than at Inver-
snaid.     The same phenomenon was observed                    on the      18th  August
But, perhaps,       the principal feature in the Tarbet basin is that both
at  Inversnaid     and at Stuckgowan the water at and near the bottom
has   risen in temperature by 0o-2 F., or from 41°-8 to 42°-0 since the
22nd September.            As the    temperature     of the bottom water at these
localities   was 41°-8 on the 5th September,              it is probable that it      had
been so    during the summer, and it is only by the end of September
or  beginning of October that the summer                 heat begins       to have any
effect   on the water near the bottom.              The steepest gradients         are at
Rowardennan and Stuckgowan between                     20 and 30 fathoms.           With
a  view of further investigating            this body of water,          I  returned on
 16th October         to the Eowardennan          and   Stuckgowan stations, and
 took the temperature         at 20, 22A, 25,      27i,  and 30 fathoms,        using, at
 20  and 30 fathoms, the same thermometers                   as  had    been used the
 dav before.       As the    temperatures      at 20 and 30 fathoms were found
 very different      from those observed the day before, the observations
 in the   Eowardennan         locality were repeated close to the east side of
 the  loch, the usual station being nearer the west                side.     The follow
 ing table gives       the temperatures      observed on 16th        October and also
 the   corresponding      ones of 15th October.

      These results go to accentuate          the fact borne out by all the obser

416                       Proceedings           of the Royal        Society
vations quoted in this paper, and by all the observations which                                       I
have    been able to make                   in other   lakes,      namely, that at any one
date, especially during                the warm        half of the         year,        the isothermal
surfaces, even at depths where there is no rapid change of tempera
ture,   are not planes,             but have many curvatures and unevennesses.
These    unevennesses              are particularly         accentuated          in the region of
most rapid change of temperatures or on the steepest gradient of the
temperature       curve.           Here the movements of the thermometer a few
yards in a horizontal               direction may place            it in water of very dif
ferent temperature.                On both days a fresh breeze was blowing, and,
though    it    was possible           to    keep     station very satisfactorily from                a
nautical point of view, the station kept was an average one —that                                    is,
instead of being         a    point,   it   was an area, and an area perhaps 20 to
30 yards long by 10 to                  20 yards wide.              The investigation of the
body of water having the steepest                         temperature gradient                is   very
interesting, but         it   should be attempted only under the most favour
able circumstances — either the weather should be perfectly calm, or
the boat should be anchored.                     In    future work the minute delinea
tion of the steepest part of the temperature                           gradient should have
an important place.

     Hth         November.     — It    had been raining all night, but cleared when
I   arrived at Balloch.               1 was accompanied                by   Mr Morrison, from          the
Scottish Marine                Station at Granton, who brought with him three
overturning thermometers.                      A     very heavy snow squall occurred                    on
the way up             the loch, but      it   cleared off before we arrived at                    Inver
snaid.           While at Inversnaid                the weather was very favourable, and
we had           no     difficulty in getting this               series of observations.              The
temperatures at                65, 85,    and 100 fathoms were taken with my
thermometers, the others were taken                            with     the overturning         thermo
meters      of the Negretti type.                   In the afternoon          a series of tempera-
tares was             taken with the overturning thermometers                          in the Luss
basin west            of the Ross Islands.
     The salient feature at both stations is the great cooling which has
taken place            since 15th October.                The whole body of water in the
Luss       basin has been cooled                2J°.       The temperature            of   the bottom
water at         Inversnaid         has risen 0°"1, and           it    has probably reached           its
maximum.
     Having described and discussed                            the observations made at the
different stations at the same date,                      it will      be useful to consider some
of the stations            with     respect    to the variation in the distribution of
temperature             with changing          season, and for this purpose                 it will    be
convenient to take two typical stations,                          namely, that at Ross             Mill in
the Luss basin,             which     represents a shallow lake, and that at Inver
snaid,      representing a deep one.
     The    Luss Basin.         — Observations            were made          in this basin on 5th
September,             22nd September,              15th October,           and 14th November.
Already on the                 5th September              the    curve      has     almost lost its
summer            feature,     and     is becoming             pronouncedly         autumnal.         On
15th October              it   has assumed          the winter          form, and between*Hhat
•late      and 14th November                  the    nearly uniform           temperature          of the
water has              fallen about 2°'6            F.     The surface            temperature        falls
from 55°-2 on             5th September to 53°-6 on 22nd September,                            to 49°-4
on 15th October,                and 46°-6 on 14th November.                          The    autumnal
zone       of nearly uniform           temperature          in   the surface layer extends             on
    6th September          to 15 fathoms, and on 15th October to the bottom.
    Therefore,        until some date between               the 22nd September              and 15th
    October the upper              stratum of water is being cooled on both sides —
    that   is,   it   loses heat    by radiation         and     convection upwards            into the

    Taking the depth at the Ross               Mill station    as 35      fathoms, we have
the   following values for the mean temperature                     of the whole of the
water    :—
     Date,          .      .      5th Sept      22nd Sept      15th   Oct       14th Nov.

    The    mean       temperatures on the 5th              and 22nd September are
identical,     hence the epoch of maximum heat in the water must                               fall
between these         two dates, and        as  cooling goes on more             rapidly than
heating,     it will fall      nearer the     22nd than the         5th, and may with
safety he said        to occur in the third week of September.                     The curves
of the 5th         and    22nd       September       intersect at a depth              of     13- 5
 fathoms, hence         the temperature          at 13-5 fathoms was the same on
both these        dates.      But   on the earlier one        the     temperature         of the
 water at    that depth was rising, whereas at the later one it is falling,
 therefore     it must have attained             a maximum        some        time between
 these    dates,   and no doubt in           the third week of September.                     The
 curves     of    22nd September          and 15th October intersect at 19-5
 fathoms;        here the temperature           of the water at both dates was
 49* "0.    The maximum temperature                   in this layer must           have      been
 attained towards         the end of the first week of October.                     Similarly,
 from the       intersection of the curves              of 5th September            and 15th
 October,     we should infer that             the maximum          temperature            at    16
  fathoms occurs       in the last     days of September.            It    is probable that
  temperature      at the bottom (35 fathoms) was about its maximum on
  15th October.

   The points of intersection of the curves indicate depths where the
 temperature of the water was found to be the same on both days.
 Although the temperature of the water at this depth has risen and
fallen in the interval,                      it      has returned to the same thermal state                                                         at
 the end of the interval as at the beginning.                                                             In Table IX. the dis

cated     for the different pairs of dates.            For   convenience'     sake, heat
units are expressed          in fathom-degrees.*
    From the table we see that between the 5th and 22nd September
the water as a         whole has lost    as much heat       as it has gained, so that
all the heat      that the layer above the intersection at               1 3 -5    fathoms
has lost appears         in the deeper water below the intersection.                  On an
average over         the   whole period, no heat has been dissipated to the
atmosphere.           This, of course, is only true on an average               ;   for dur
ing the      first portion of the period the water has been receiving
heat,    and during the second portion           it  has been dissipating         it  at the
surface.      During        this interval   the heat passed downwards to the
deeper layers has been at            the rate of    1 -94 fathom-degrees           per day.
Between       the     22nd     September and        15th October the amount of
heat    transmitted        downwards      has been       14 per cent,     of      the total
loss   above the intersection.            The heat dissipated per day to the
atmosphere        is 2 -61     units, and that passed downwards 0'61                    unit
The curve       of 14th November does not cut that of 15th October,
and the      loss of       heat   is at the rate of       3-2 units per day,           all of
which has gone out into the atmosphere.                    On the 23rd November
1876       I found       the    water of the Luss basin to have               a    uniform
temperature        47°-8 from surface to bottom.            In  the year 1876, there
fore,   the water had a temperature            l°-5 higher on the 23rd Novem
ber than     it  has in 1885 on 14th November,                 or nine days earlier.
For the same date the water is this year at least 20-5 colder than                          it
 was    in   1876,      and    with this rapid   and severe autumnal cooling                it
 will require no very hard or long-continued                    frost to     freeze       the
great    shallow      Balloch basin of the loch.           In  fact,  it will     be found
 that   in years when Loch Lomond has been frozen there has always
 been an     exceptionally cold autumn.             The prolonged action of the
 low temperature          of a cold autumn prepares the water for any severe
 frost which may          occur in the long nights about Christmas.                   Under
 its influence      the water rapidly freezes.            When     the   Balloch basin
 was frozen     in the winter of 1878-79,           I  took the temperature            of the
  water beneath         the ice in several places, the deepest water being
  11   fathoms.         The     temperature   of    the whole of        the water was
    *
       The fathom-degree is one fathom heated 1° F.                If the   fathom      has a
  sectional  area such that the volume of water weighs              one pound,       then the
  fathom-degree     is the same as the ordinary heat unit.

at the     bottom.        In the long           clear nights                 of    a severe             winter      the
temperature        of the atmosphere                may       often         be 30°           below        that          of
the surface of the water, so that both by radiation and                                                 convection
cooling goes on with great rapidity,                         notwithstanding                   the fact            that
water     expands        in being cooled below 39° F.                              ;    and    it is     remarked
by people         dwelling by the side of the lake that the moment                                                   ice
begins     to freeze      it    spreads       with great rapidity, so that the                                 whole
basin     is usually frozen over in                 a      night, and             as soon          as    a skin of
ice has been formed             it   very rapidly becomes thick enough to bear.
   Epochs of Maximum Temperature. — From the curves and their
intersections we see that the maximum temperature of the surface
water     occurred        before       the     5th September.                          At    13-5 fathoms it
occurred        some time between the 5th and                           22nd           September,             and       as
cooling goes on faster than heating,                        the date          of maximum                  tempera
ture at this depth          will      be nearer the 22nd than the 5th September,
probably         about    the        15th.      Similarly              at     16        fathoms          it    occurs
between the 5th September                     and 15th October,                    and       probably          about
30th September.                At     19'5     fathoms                the    maximum                temperature
occurs about 6th October,                and in the              second           week        of October                (in
1885)      all    water from           20     fathoms            to    the        bottom attained                   and
passed     its maximum temperature.                          The maximum temperature                                    of
the     surface     occurs      about        the middle of August,                           and that          of   the
bottom in 35 fathoms                 about the middle of October.
      Inversnaid        Station.— The observations                          at     this station               at     the
 different dates have, in many respects, greater interest                                               than       those
 made in the Luss basin.                 The depth here                 is    100 fathoms,               and       is   so
 great that for      a   thickness of 40 or 50 fathoms above the bottom                                              the
 change of temperature               during the course of the season amounts                                        only
 to   a   fraction of     a     degree,       and    is     so    slight         as to       elude       detection,
 except     by     using very delicate                     thermometers.                     The    observations
 made      at     Inversnaid         are collected           in        Table           X.,    and       the    results
 are expressed   graphically in the curves (fig. 5). On 18th August
 no observations   were made exactly on the Inversnaid station, but
 observations        were      made at two              neighbouring                   stations,        Rob        Koy's
 Cave, about        a    mile north, and Culness,                       about          a    mile    south          of   it
 The      curve    has been drawn              from the means of the                                temperatures
 observed at these two stations.

over the period             under consideration.                         Between the 18th August and
the 5th September,                    an interval of 18 days,                     during which the tem
perature      of the layer immediately at the surface had begun                                                     to fall,
five times as         much heat was conveyed downwards                                         as was        dissipated
from the surface.                     Between the dates                     5th September                    and 22nd
September the two quantities                             almost          exactly balance              one        another,
.between 22nd              September                 and 15th October the amount transmitted
downwards            is    only half what leaves the surface                               ;    and between the
 15th October              and        14th November the amount transmitted down
wards        is     quite    insignificant              — not       more than             4    per cent, of what
escapes to           the    air.            The activity            in the heat exchange has been
 greatest between            22nd September                      and 15th October when                              it   has
been        dissipated           at     the          surface       at     the     rate         of     3-74       fathom-
 degrees,     and conveyed                       downwards at the rate of                      2     fathom-degrees
 per day.           The crest of the heat wave                           passes from surface to bottom
 in    about three         months, the height of                    it      decreasing              very rapidly          as
 the    depth increases.

    As the autumn of 1885 has been a cold one, the above mean
•dates    may be taken as the earliest dates of maximum temperature                    at
the depths indicated.
    If   we compare the mean temperature              of the whole column of 100
fathoms of water at Inversnaid on the 5th and the 22nd September,
we have       on the 5th the mean temperature              44°-54    F.,    and  on the
22nd September           44°'52, the difference      being   0°-02    F.     Remember
ing that heat is lost more quickly               in autumn than it is gained in
spring, and considering that these temperatures                 are nearly identical,
we shall       not be far wrong         if   we put     the    epoch     of   maximum
heat     in the water of the deepest part of the lake             as   occurring some
time in the third week of September.                  This brings it very       near the
¦date    of the equinox, and it seems natural to expect                    the heat    to
 accumulate       in the water so long as the day is longer than the night,
 and to decrease so soon         as  the conditions are reversed.              This  con
 clusion     is supported by the observations              of Fischer, Forster, and
 Brunner, who made a most interesting series of observations on the
 distribution      of temperature      in   the   Lake of Thun, in Switzerland,
 during the years 1848 and 1849.                 They found hardly any increase
 of heat between        3rd February and 28th March, but after the latter
 date the     influx of   heat was very rapid.           It  is probable,      therefore,
 that the       temperature     of the bottom water in our deepest lakes
 depends      chiefly on the temperature         of the air between          the preced
 ing autumnal and vernal equinoxes.                 Two   causes combine,        namely,
 the greater      meridian altitude of the sun and the greater                 length of
  the day      in the    summer     than in the winter half year.              The latter
 cause     has the effect      that the water is exposed             to heating for a
 greater    portion of the twenty-four hours than it is to cooling, while
  the   former cause ensures a greater supply of heat per minute during
  the day    in summer than in winter.

     Further, the rate of loss of heat, due to radiation alone, must be
 very much greater during a winter night than during a summer one.
     The rise of temperature                 in the bottom water and deeper layers is
 made     more      apparent          by considering             the actual        readings of the

  as   real.    It    is probable          that between           these dates and            during     the
  whole     of the summer               the     temperature         had     been     quite constant.
  Between       22nd September                and     14th      November the whole rise of
  temperature       at the bottom             is only 0o,25, and it may be confidently
  affirmed      that        at   a   depth       of    100 fathoms           the whole range               of
  temperature        during         a single     season does           not exceed 0°"3 F.                By
  season is meant             the summer          and     winter half of the year, or                    the
   period between the date when heating begins in the spring, and that
  at which the summer heat has been almost                                wholly lost, and            when
  the water begins              again to assume a sensibly uniform                         temperature
  from top to bottom.                  At    85 fathoms the             temperature          had     begun
  distinctly to rise on 5th September,                       and    by 14th November it                 had
  evidently reached about                  its maximum.               At this       depth, therefore,
   the summer         range       is at least 0°"4          F.     At    65     fathoms       the     water
  had begun to cool between                    16th October and             14th     November.             In
  order to determine             the range at this depth,                 it will    be    necessary to
  have observations             earlier than 5th September.

     The bottom temperature                 has been determined in the deepest part
of Loch Lomond                 by several         observers         in different years, and the
results     show that          it   varies     from year             to year.               James          Jardine
found     it to       be 41°-1      F. on    the      8th September                    1812.          Sir Robert
Christison           found it 42°-0 F. in 1871.                     I       found it to be 40°-2 in
April     1872, and 41°-4            F. on 23rd            September              1876.         About these
figures     there      is   always some           uncertainty, from the want of com
parison between             the thermometers.                The best evidence of the varia
tion of the temperature               of the deep water of our lakes, from year
to year,    is furnished by my observations
                                    in Lochs Lochy (80 fathoms)
and Ness (120 fathoms) in five consecutive years in the second
week of August. These were all made with the same thermometers,
and are to be relied on to one-tenth of a degree.                                      They are —

     The mean winter temperature                     of the air is the mean temperature
of the months of           October to March (inclusive) preceding                                     the     dates
of observation          in the lakes.  The place of observation                                       is Corran
lighthouse,          on Loch Linnhe.                 It     is too          remote          from the          lochs
themselves           to give more          than an indication of the climate at the
surface of the lakes.                Still    the bottom temperature                          of Loch Ness
does     follow       very closely         the mean winter                   temperature              at Corran.
In the          two     severe      winters,         1878-79         and          1880-81,            the mean
winter      temperatures            fell     below         39°,     and          as    might have been
expected the temperature                    of the deep water of the lake was slow
to     follow    it,   owing to the change in the properties                                   of      water        at
this temperature.              Hence the higher the mean temperature                                         of the
cold months           of the year is, the more closely                      is   it   reproduced            in the
deep water            of the lake.           Forty        years ago Amie showed that the
temperature            which       he observed             in the abyssmal                  regions         of the
 Western Mediterranean agreed sensibly                            with       the       mean       winter tem
 perature       of the air at its surface.                  The later view, which ascribed
 the    temperature          of the        deep      water in the Mediteranean to the
 Atlantic water flowing over the ridge at Tarifa, which has the same
 temperature as the Mediterranean water within                                        the    ridge,        left out

428                    Proceedings       of the Royal Society
of account the fact that there is on the whole an outflow of pure
Mediterranean water at the bottom which affects the temperature
and density of the        Atlantic water       outside.     In  sea water, owing to
its saltness,    convection currents are set up more actively by cooling
than is found to be the          case   in fresh water.         In    lakes,    however,
and     especially in     those    situated in mountainous districts, the pro
duction of convection currents is powerfully assisted by local dif
ferences of climate.         These are due to differences            of exposure,          to
radiation, and to prevailing winds.              Such local differences of climate
produce local differences         of temperature, and consequently of density
in the     superficial layers.       If   we   compare,    for instance,       the obser
vations made at Ardlui and at Inversnaid on                  1 5th October,       we find
 that the mean temperature           of the first 20 fathoms is 48°- 24 at Inver
snaid, and      only 46°'58 F. at Ardlui.            The stations are only            three
 miles apart, and yet there          is a difference      of l°-66 F. in the          mean
 temperature     of the first 20 fathoms.          Another cause affects the dis
 tribution of temperature         in a lake, namely,        the  drainage,       but this
 more     particularly    affects shallow lakes         or basins.       It  is probable
 that the     most    powerful       means    of supply and removal of heat is
 direct radiation.       The most powerful mixing agency is the wind.
     I  hope,  with Mr Morrison's         assistance, to secure monthly observa
 tions during      the   coming winter and spring, the results of which
 cannot fail to be interesting.

      The " Dacia " left Cadiz on the afternoon of the 4th October.
The     entrance       to the        Straits      of Gibraltar             was       reached      the   next
morning,        and two            days   were         spent    in thoroughly sounding its
shallowest       part, which lies nearly on a straight line connecting Cape
Spartel       on the    African with             Cape Trafalgar on the European coast.
On existing published charts the bottom is seen to be very uneven.
From Cape Trafalgar south, for more than half the distance across,
the water does not exceed 100 fathoms                                in depth;          then it deepens
to 150       fathoms, suddenly shoals to 45 fathoms,                             then deepens again,
and remains deep             till   close to the African              shore.          In   order to assist
in fixing the positions of the soundings,                        a   buoy was anchored on the
mid-channel bank.                  It   remained        down for two days.                  When it      was
brought        on board again,             the     thick       wire mooring-rope was found
nearly chafed          through by the violent currents rubbing it on the
hard coral        bottom.           During       the two days              spent on this ground, a
large number of soundings were taken, the result of which was to
define and enlarge the mid-channel shoal from a patch                                       a    mile and   a
half        long and half           a mile broad to a bank                       7    miles long from
east        to west    by    2    miles    broad from north to south                        ;    further to
show that the deep water                    runs between this bank and the African
shore,       and that the greatest depth on this, the shallowest ridge, is
not less than 200 nor more than 210 fathoms.                                 Considerable interest
attaches to a knowledge of this depth.                                It   has been supposed             that
on     it    depends       the temperature              of the deep water of the Mediter
ranean, as on          it would         depend the temperature                   of the coldest water
which         could find entrance                into it from              the       Atlantic.      In    the
 Atlantic, however, outside the Straits, the temperature                                    of the water
 at   200 fathoms below the surface is decidedly lower than that of the
 deep water       of the Mediterranean.                    Moreover, it was proved by the
 observations of      Sir George Nares and Dr Carpenter, in Her Majesty's
 ship
            " Shearwater," that, though the currents in the Straits are
 affected      by the tides, there               is,   on the whole, an inflow of Atlantic
 water       at the surface          and an outflow of dense Mediterranean water
 at the bottom.              It   was also shown by M. Aime, in 1848, that the
 temperature of the deep water of this part of the Mediterranean
 agrees      with the      mean temperature               of   the coldest half of the year at
 its surface.         It   is    probable, therefore,           that the deep overflow of the
  Mediterranean            has more effect in raising the temperature                            and density

 that of the Mediterranean.         The observations      made on board the
  " Dacia  "
              quite bear out this view.
     The observations of bottom temperature       made by the "Challenger"
  in the north-eastern     part of the Atlantic, and by the "Dacia" in
 this restricted part, show     a higher temperature       and density of       the
  water at great depths than is found to exist       in any other part of the
 ocean.     Although other causes are at     work to produce this, it cannot
 be doubted that the warm and dense overflow of the Mediterranean
 has its share in its production, especially in its immediate neighbour
 hood
    From the Straits of Gibraltar        a  westerly course was steered         for
 about 150 miles, then       a south-easterly   one  until   the African     coast
 was sighted,     when the course was again altered         to a westerly     one.
 It  was the intention to have taken soundings and other observations
 along this line for a distance of 180 miles.         On continuing the line
 representing    the course on the chart,    it was found to cut the line of
 soundings taken by the steamship           "Seine"     between    Lisbon     and
 Madeira close to a point where         the bottom     seemed to rise from        a
 depth of 2400 fathoms to 1800 fathoms.
    This line of soundings was run previous to the laying of the            cable
 from Lisbon      to Madeira by the s.s.   "Seine."      The soundings       were
 taken at distances      of about 25 miles apart, and showed         a tolerably
level bottom with an average depth of rather over 2000 fathoms.
 Slight   unevennesses     had been observed,      such    as   two   successive
soundings differing by 300 fathoms,          but it never occurred        to any
one to suppose       that they indicated anything        that could interfere
with the laying of the cable or its security when laid           ; and    accord
ingly the cable was laid over the line sounded.           During the     process,
and when the ship was passing          over   one of the unevennesses        indi
cated, where      the depth seemed to fall from 2400 fathoms to 1967
fathoms,     and to increase again to 2332 fathoms,       the cable suddenly
parted  ;  and, on making a sounding, a depth of one hundred fathoms
was found in place of 2000 expected.            The sudden shoaling of         the
water had naturally snapped       the cable.    No  blame could be attached
to those     in charge of the work, because the soundings, on which
they based their calculations, were considered         sufficiently close,    and
were supposed to give quite sufficient guarantee of a suitable bottom.

     While the " Dacia " was running the second long line to seaward
it was found that, on prolonging                       it,
                                                         it      cut this Lisbon-Madeira line
of   soundings        at    a   point where           there was        a    shoaling from 2400 to
1800 fathoms.
     Before the discovery of the                 " Seine bank," with under                  100 fathoms
of water on           it,   there was       no    indication         of its existence           except     a
similar     shoaling from 2322                   to    1967       fathoms.         It   was     thought,
therefore, that another similar bank might exist, and the ship was
kept on the same course with the                               view of going             as   far as the
"         "
  Seine's   1885 fathoms sounding.                                At   the point where             it   had
been     intended to turn,         a    depth of 2400 fathoms was found                           ;   at the
next sounding, 50               miles farther west, bottom was struck in 485
fathoms.         This depth        was found at              4    a.m. on the 12th of October,
and the      sounding was immediately repeated, with the same result.
The whole          day was then devoted                      to the exploration of the bank
thus revealed.
                                                                            "
     The discovery of this bank or                    "Coral      patch         may fairly be claimed
as   a   success   in marine       diagnosis.            The shoalest             water found on          it
was 435 fathoms,              inlat.    34° 57'       N.,    long.     11° 57'     W., and the depth
ranged up        to 600 fathoms.             The shallow water extends for                    a   distance
of   6   miles   in    an east and west direction, and about                           J3   miles in one
from north to south.              On the western edge                  it   seemed to fall away pre
cipitously from 550              to about         850 fathoms,             when       the slope became
gentle,     and the bottom changed                     from hard coral to soft                 ooze.      In
one      sounding on this ledge the sinker distinctly struck bottom in
550      fathoms,      tumbled over and continued to sink, struck in 620
fathoms, again              tumbled over, and finally found                       a   resting place in
835       fathoms.          When       it   came up          it   had     a     large brownish-black
streak,     where      it    had evidently struck obliquely on manganese rock.
This was      a     very remarkable sounding, and quite undoubted.                                       All
the      conditions were the most                  favourable — no wind,                 the sea calm,
and the ship motionless.                    A    grapnel      with extemporised               dredge     and
hempen       swabs was put over in 530 fathoms,                             and on being brought
up the dredge was                found much torn, and on the swabs                                 a    large
quantity of beautiful white coral                       and many fragments of                  a   crinoid.
 The coral was examined by Professor Moseley, and determined as
 Lophohelia prolifera.                 It   was found to be growing luxuriantly,                         the
 living stalks being rooted                  on dead and decaying branches                            of the

   432                     Proceedings      of the Royal Society
   same species.        The dead branches were in many instances beginning
   to get    coloured     brown from deposited             manganese.          One of        the
   earliest and most interesting of the
                                                   " Challenger's "                    was in

   1500     fathoms,     about     200     miles   south-west      of   Teneriffe.          The
   dredge     came     up full      of    beautifully    branching        jet-black       coral
   attached     to   a   soft black rock.           Thickly     clustered      among the
   branches     were    large   siliceous sponges,       like masses of spun            glass.
   Both the rock and the enamel-like coating of the coral consisted                            of
   black oxide of manganese.              The same has been found on the                 ridge
   connecting Teneriffe and Grand Canary at a depth of 1000                        fathoms,
  and    after severe       storms     it is   sometimes     washed        ashore    on     the
  islands.
      It  is not unlikely        that    if the ground about the            " Challenger"
  station in 1500 fathoms were closely and carefully explored                         a very
  interesting shoal might be discovered.
      The fragments        of the crinoid obtained          were determined           by Dr
  Herbert Carpenter to be Actinometra pulchella, which is common                              in
  the Caribbean Sea.           One specimen of it had been previously                got by
  the   "Porcupine," in       477 fathoms,       near Gibraltar.
     The temperature         of the water was taken at different depths                  with
 the following results :—

     After exploring this          coral    bank,   so  far  as   time permitted,          the
 ship was directed         towards Mogador, on the Morocco coast.                      Inde
 pendently of the high land, which is visible for many miles                         at sea,
 the approach       to the coast is indicated by a rapid fall            in  the tempera
 ture of the water of the sea surface and a remarkable                      change in its
 colour.      Outside the temperature of the surface was very                   constantly
 69°    F.      After    sighting the       land    it fell   at    first slowly,       then
rapidly, and when            two miles from Mogador it was only                     61° F.
The presence of this body of cold water must have an important
effect in moderating the climate of places situated                  on this somewhat
desert coast.        In  the open sea, and away from shore influences,                     the
ocean water in all moderately warm latitudes has the same                              deep,
transparent,       ultramarine colour.          In colder latitudes this          becomes
greenish-blue and green, and the water loses its transparency.                           The

colour of the water off the Morocco coast is particularly                         remarkable,
for    it   becomes of a deep and, at the               same time, very transparent
olive-green           colour,   unusual in any but icy latitudes.                     Closer in
shore      it  loses its transparency.
     A similar         phenomenon       is observed     on the west      coast of South
America.             Close in shore all the way from Valparaiso                        to   Cape
Blanco, in lat.           4° 30' S., there     is a fringe of cold, green,            compara
tively fresh water            teeming     with life.      In   the  course     of a voyage
along that coast           in April   1885   I found    the temperature          of the water
identical in the harbours of Coquimbo                    in  lat. 30° S., and Payta in
lat. 5° S., namely,           63°-5   F.    This is an exceedingly low tempera
ture      even       for the more      southerly of the two stations, and is of
course        very much more remarkable for the more northerly                               one,
 Payta, which indeed               may    be said    to be almost on the equator.
Along this coast to the southward of Callao there                           is no        marked
 current or stream             setting in either direction.          In   order        to bring
 water       of 63° -5 F. by a surface current to so low                     a     latitude    as
 5° S.     would require a rapidity of transport which, under the circum
 stances, is        inconceivable.       Similarly on the African coast the set of
 the water along the shores               of Morocco is not towards              the equator,
 but towards the           north ; and it was observed by Sir George Nares, in
 H.M.S.         " Shearwater," that this cold, in-shore water actually pene
 trates past Cape           Spartel into the Mediterranean.
      In low latitudes          there is only one source of cold water,                 namely,
  the   climate of higher latitudes.              The water cooled          in these high
  latitudes       may make        its way towards the equator either              as a surface
  current or as a movement             of the deeper waters.          If   it    is conveyed
  as a     surface current,        it is  exposed    to the heating on the way in
  passing       through regions        of progressively warmer          climates,         and in
  order to keep           a low temperature        into anything like low latitudes
   it would       require to form a current of great volume                   and       velocity.
   In all latitudes we find almost                ice-cold    water at a few hundred
   fathoms       from the surface,         and in fact the nearer we come to the
   equator the nearer            does the cold water come to the surface.                      In
   the latitude         of Payta, and away from the coast, water of 60° F.
    would     naturally be found at a depth of 100 fathoms                     ;    at the sur
    face   and     in   the open     ocean    it would       not be found             at   a  less
    distance than 2000 miles.

    The western         coasts of the continents are the weather                          shores     of
 the   oceans.        Both        the    continents        mentioned         occupy positions
 which      extend       from      the northern trade-wind region through the
 equatorial      calms      to the      southern trade-wind              region.        The     trade
 winds blow from the north-east                    and the south-east,            and the      result
 of their mechanical              action is to drag away                the water from           their
 weather shores and drive               it  to leeward.         As     the wind       acts at the
 surface      it   removes        chiefly     surface      water,     and    it   is the surface
 water which          assumes          the temperature          due to the local climate.
 The water so removed must be supplied, and it is supplied from                                    the
 readiest      source.        As    the surface       water     is being removed             by the
  wind,    it    draws      on     the     deeper     layers    to supply        the deficiency.
 But in low latitudes               the deeper       water     in the ocean has always                 a
 very much lower temperature                    than that at the surface.                    Hence,
 at the weather           shores of the oceans we have                    a constant       removal
 of   surface       water to         leeward      and     replacement         of    it by     colder
 water    from greater depth.                The cold water found along the                      west
 coast of       South America             has always been considered                 evidence of
 the
       " Humboldt             current."       And      so   it   is.    But     the     Humboldt
 current,    or at least the current which brings the cold water there,
 is not a horizontal current from higher latitudes, but a vertical                                one
 from greater depths.
    From Mogador              a course      was shaped         for the Seine         bank     above
 referred      to.    It     is   indicated      on    the    chart by two soundings                of
 100 and 118 fathoms respectively,                      at a distance of 12 miles apart.
 The bank was struck on the position of the 118 fathom                                  sounding,
 and a day was devoted to                its exploration.            A   couple     of "    balloon
         "
 buoys      were anchored           in the noon position, namely, lat. 33°                   47' N.,
long.   14° 1'     W.,    the depth being 89 fathoms.                    Hempen swabs          were
 attached     to the end of the anchoring line.                        These     balloon      buoys
are made of india-rubber and canvas, and when not in                                   use occupy
 very little      space.        They are used         for floating the shore end                 of a
cable from the ship to the land, and they are then inflated with                                   air
by means          of  a    small pump.            They are much like                  footballs      3
feet in diameter.            The bank was crossed and recrossed                      in   different
directions,      and    found to occupy             less    surface      than was        expected.

¦water   over an area of about 15 square miles varies                    only from 86 to
100 fathoms.          When     the sounding work was done                  the buoys, with
their moorings, were got             on    board,     and the swabs,            which        had
been      brought     up without         dragging,        were     found to contain             a
rich    harvest    of large     crinoids of a delicate,             reddish colour.           Dr
Herbert      Carpenter has        determined         them      to be Antedon phalan-
gium     of the Mediterranean             and the         Atlantic     coasts      of   Spain.
It    was obtained by the           " Porcupine        "
                                                           as  far north     as the     Minch
and the Faerce       Banks.      Along with the crinoids pieces of broken
coral    and    shells came up,         all    stained      of    an intense       yellowish-
green    colour,    which was freely communicated                     to   the   spirit     into
which the shells were put for preservation.                        The colouring matter
so   extracted     was examined by Professor Hartley                      of Dublin,         and
found to be        chlorophyll.        Specimens        of spirit coloured by deep-
sea    animals    collected    on the      " Challenger       "
                                                                  expedition were           also
examined, in        consequence       of    this discovery,         and    they also were
found to have the spectroscopic              character of chlorophyll.
     The bottom       temperature       on the Seine          bank was 60°-2 F.               On
leaving     the    Seine bank, the           intention       was    to   have    reached       in
 towards the       African    coast, then       outwards to the small group                    of
 Salvage     and Piton, and then to make                  a  straight course to Grand
 Canary.       The day after leaving the Seine bank the value of marine
 diagnosis was again        vindicated.        When about            170 miles      south of
 the bank,      a sounding gave 1189 fathoms                 with hard      bottom,      where
 at least   1800 fathoms      were looked for.             Another       bank was imme
 diately suspected.         Three miles farther,            on the same course,           1386
 fathoms     were    found.      If   a bank existed           it  had,    therefore,      been
 passed     over.     The    course     was     immediately reversed,              and     after
 steaming      7   miles back a sounding gave                   810    fathoms;       3   miles
 farther    back    414    fathoms      were      found, and         2   miles    farther 66
 fathoms.        Half   a  mile beyond this sounding 230 fathoms                           were
 found.      The ship was again turned round and steered to the south
 ward for about a       mile and a half, when            a  buoy with lights was put
  over  in 175 fathoms,       and, as    it  was already past midnight, the ship
 lay by it    till daylight.     As this bank lay very             close to the proposed
  line of cable,     two days were devoted                to its exploration.           It   was
  found to be of an irregularly triangular shape, broader                      towards the
  north and tapering towards the                 south.      Its   greatest    length from

north to south              and hreadth from east to west were found                                          to be
equal,     and              miles         respectively, while the total area, with less
than      100     fathoms            of     water on           it,   was      50    square          miles.          A
boat     was anchored                in   the     noon position of the                      21st    October         —
namely, lat. 31°                9'   30"     K,       long.    13" 34'        30"— in         58 fathoms of
water.     This    is   near the centre of the bank, and                           a    little to the south
ward of the shoalest sounding, 49 fathoms                             ;    swabs had been attached
to the mooring rope of the buoy                         ;     they had also been attached to
the moorings of             a   couple of balloon buoys                   in rather shallower               water,
but during the two days that they were                                        down the ropes                got so
chafed     that they broke when being recovered.                                            Swabs had          been
attached     to the boat's cable, and they were recovered,                                     but, as they
had been only           a    very short time on the bottom, little was expected
and      little was found on thom.                          A   few broken and decayed shells
made up the harvest.
   Advantage was taken of the buoy being anchored in mid-ocean                                                      to
make      some         current observations.                    It   is    an almost universal                  ex
perience        of ships making                 a   passage from the north to the Canary
Islands to be set very considerably to the eastward of their                                                course,
and many disastrous                       shipwrecks have             been      the      consequence.               It
appears      from recently-collected observations that the general                                            set    of
the      current       is   about E.S.E., and its velocity averages                                     16 miles
per day.          Only       a   few weeks             previously         a   buoy belonging to                     the
United       States         Lighthouse            Department had been washed ashore                                 on
the north coast             of Teneriffe.             Knowing how             the tidal wave            is    trans
formed into            a    current on approaching the coast,                                it     seemed          not
 unlikely that the               occurrence           of    so extensive       a    shoal     as the
                                                                                                            " Paris
 bank,"      as   it     has     been        called according to recognised                           precedent,
 might produce              the same effect.                  Accordingly,          before the buoy was
 brought on board again,                    I       spent     some hours           in   a   boat riding to           it,
 and determined the direction and rate of the surface current at fre
 quent intervals, while the ship went on with the sounding                                                      at    a
 distance.         The result of these observations                            was,         shortly,     to    she
 that the south-easterly current in this part of the ocean                                             is   affected
 and      at times reversed                  by   a    tidal current.           Down           to   a   depth         of
 70 fathoms the              current was found to                    be   setting in nearly             the same
 direction        as    at the surface,               but with somewhat                     greater     strength

 fine    but stout muslin, about            3 feet   long and      1  foot diameter at the
 mouth, tapering to a cone               in    the bag.     The mouth was kept open
 by a stout iron         ring, which        was made        fast   to the     sounding lino
 which passed diametrically across it.                    The water was of          so   clear
and transparent a blue that                 it could     be distinctly seen down to a
depth of 19 fathoms           ;  and,  with     a  weight of    14   lb. at the end of the
line,   it set itself perfectly steadily and almost              rigidly in its direction.
    The results of the observations                 of the current at the surface on
 21st October 1883 were—
Hour p.m                             2.15             2.40             3.30           4.6

    It will    be seen   from these observations            that, in the two hours, the
 current      had   shifted      its direction       through       90°,   and had passed
 through a minimum velocity of 0'-26 per hour without there having
 been any period       of "slack water."             The observations are too few in
 number       to make     it worth while submitting               them     to analysis, but
 a   little    study of them will             show that they indicate             a   current
 which is the resultant of              a constant       current and        a  periodic one.
 A constant current running to S.E. by E., combined with                              a  tidal
 current      running    N.N.W.         and      S.S.E.,   the    maximum velocity of
 which, in either direction, is twice that of the permanent                          current,
 would give a resultant current agreeing                    fairly with that       observed.
  Under these circumstances,              the path of a particle, floating freely in
 the water and       moving with the water, would describe in twenty-four
 hours a path having the shape of the letter S, the larger axis of
 which has a        N.W. by W. and S.E. by E. direction. If the tidal
 current be      supposed to have motion in an elliptical orbit, instead of
 a  simple oscillation         in one direction, the path in the twenty-four
 hours would take          some such form as the figure 3.                  Without insist
 ing further on the numerical value of the results,                       the observations
 are    of importance         as    showing       decidedly the existence           of tidal
 currents in the open            ocean.      Amongst       the islands of the Canary
 group      these   currents       are   strongly      developed.         Between      Grand
  Canary and Teneriffe the channel is broad,                       and, at its shallowest
  part,   over 1000     fathoms deep         ;  yet the tidal current reaches to the
  very bottom,     and its scouring action is shown by the nature of the

438                     Proceedings      of the Royal Society
bottom.       To seaward, in 1800 or 2000 fathoms, the bottom is                a fine
Globigerina ooze, which gets coarser and sandier                as the water shoals
in  the channel, until, on the summit of the ridge, there is generally
no deposit at all, and the bottom is rock or coral often coated with
black oxide of manganese.
    An    essential    condition of the existence of coral, whether in               the
deep     sea  or  in    the   shallow water of the atolls of tropical             seas,
seems to be circulation          of the water.      This  serves the double pur
pose of bringing          food and     removing sediment.         In shallow     water
this circulation is produced by the breaking of ordinary storm                  waves
 on the shore or on shoals;          in deep water it is produced by the trans
formation of the tidal wave into             a current on meeting with obstruc
 tions such    as   ridges or banks, even though they may have a thou
 sand or more fathoms          of water on them.       In both     cases  the current
 is produced       in    the  same way,       namely,  by the annihilation         of  a
 wave.
    In Mr Murray's           theory of     the formation    of coral     islands,    the
 growth (in height) of a shoal, owing to the greater amount of sedi
 ment which reaches it from the surface compared with the amount
 which can reach an equal area of ground at                a greater     depth, is    an
 important      feature.      We    have seen,    however,    that it is probable
 that, wherever the          bottom rises in the path of the tidal wave,                a
 portion of the wave is transformed into                 current.      This    current
 would naturally keep the summit of the shoal clean swept of all
 freshly falling sediment, and would thus tend to limit the growth
 of such    a shoal.
    But this very agency must favour the existence of such animals
 as deep-sea corals on         the   areas kept clear of sediment.           It  seems
 reasonable, therefore, to expect that such areas would be occupied by
 deep-sea corals.         These    would     not  be  likely   to extend laterally
 beyond the cleared summit of the rising, but would grow upwards,
 the  living resting      on the debris of the dead.         The tendency       would
be to raise a massive         pillar with perpendicular sides up through             the
water, and     it would grow until the conditions, principally of tem
perature,    set a limit.      In the " Coral patch " we have undoubtedly
such a structure, the base of which rests on the crest of a                  hill   800
fathoms below the surface.                Its summit is now rather over             400
fathoms below the surface, and it is in full growth. Judging                      from

                        of Edinburgh, Session 1885-86.                                439
 what could be obtained from the surface of the Seine bank and the
Dacia bank, they            have   reached       limiting conditions.         Had they
risen to     their present level in equatorial regions, they would doubt
less have        been occupied      by reef-building       species, and would have
formed true coral islands.
    AVe     have    seen above      that, on the Coral patch,             the   lead   was
dropped by chance on the              face of a precipitous         cliff  at  least   200
fathoms high.          On the Dacia bank the mark buoy happened                      to be
let go  just on the edge of the bank in 175 fathoms.                  On trying to lift
the moorings        the buoy-rope      carried away, and       it  was found to have
been     chafed     through about        100 fathoms from the surface, or               75
fathoms above the ground.              The currents had evidently been rubbing
it against the edge of the cliff during the two days that                  it was down.
 From the mark buoy the            "Dacia"        steamed west for about 10 miles,
 taking up and down soundings every mile, and                     "flying soundings"
 with a pneumatic          sounding-machine which           I  constructed     on board.
 It  worked extremely well          with    the ship going 7 knots, and          in  water
 ranging from 50 to 100 fathoms in depth.                     About    8 miles    west of
 the buoy, the edge         of the bank was again struck.             After   an up and
 down sounding         of 86 fathoms,      a  flying sounding gave 110 fathoms.
 The engines were         immediately stopped and put astern, when an up
 and down        sounding gave 333 fathoms.              The distance between these
 soundings could not have been more than a quarter of a mile, which
 gives     an average      gradient between          the  soundings of nearly 45°.
 To the westward         of the 333 fathoms sounding, 619 fathoms were
 found at      1  mile, and 844 fathoms at            2 miles.     At this sounding       a
  l|-inch mud        tube was      used, and       it brought up a good        sample    of
  very coarse-grained        Globigerina ooze, with many pteropod              and other
  shells.
     In   the following table      will   be found the slopes on the Dacia and
  the Seine     banks,   as observed     between adjacent        soundings,    also those

   Bermuda        is a coral island,         crowning an eminence, which rises
abruptly out of the deepest water of the North Atlantic.                         Besides
the island of Bermuda, this eminence                  carries two shoals or banks      to

the south-west           of  the island.       These banks seem to exactly resemble
the      "Dacia" and "Seine"                banks.       The minimum depth on the
"                     " bank                             and on the " Argus " bank,
    Challenger                    is 24 fathoms,
which lies farthest to the southward, is 10 fathoms.                            The separat
ing channels            have a depth of 1000 and 600 fathoms respectively.
On       the    reef, which surrounds the island of Bermuda, the water
deepens          veiy slowly       to   25    fathoms.      As   soon    as   this depth is
passed,        the declivity becomes very steep, and is no doubt in many
places precipitous.              The mean angle of slope for depth-intervals
between 34 and 344 fathoms                    is 25°-3, between 29 and 239 fathoms
 it is 26°-4, and between 24 and 155 fathoms it is                     27°.     The western
 and northern            sides  have    a steeper average slope than the southern
 and eastern          ones.     On the western side we have, from 42 fathoms
  on the      reef to 1950 fathoms,         the enormous      average slope of 29°; and
  on the        north    side  of the "Challenger" bank, between                  the depths
  175      and    1250 fathoms, we have an angle of 40°.                   It  is difficult to
  believe that         these   average slopes are not made up of large portions
  which are really vertical,           with gentler      slopes at greater depths.        The
  closer soundings           on the    "Dacia" bank and Coral               patch    revealed
   such precipices.
        AVhile    the "Challenger" was at Tahiti, very careful soundings
   were made        to determine      the actual slope of the reef.            At  a distance
   of 125 fathoms from the edge of the reef, a depth of 30 to 35
   fathoms       is found; at 150 fathoms from the reef the depth is from
   90 to 100 fathoms.            In this interval       the slope attains its maximum
    angle    of from 60° to 70°.           "  It is believed to have been formed by
   huge      masses and heads of coral which have                   been torn away from
    the ledge       between     the edge of the          reef   and   35 fathoms during
    storms,     or by overhanging masses which have fallen by their own
    weight.        In this way     a  talus has been formed on which the corals,
     living down to 35 fathoms,              have   found a foundation on which to
     build farther seawards, for this seaward slope is the great growing
     surface    of the reef."*       If  the steepest part of the slope is a talus,          it
     is evident      that the solid rock face inside the talus must be still
      steeper,   and   a slope steeper than 70°        is  a precipice.

    The soundings off the west coast of Morocco which are given in                       the
 second    table were taken too far apart              to give anything more than
 rough averages        of the slope.      They indicate, however,           a feature      of
 continental slopes which calls for further and minute investigation.
 Roughly speaking,         the sea bottom slopes very gently from the coast
 line to a depth of 100 fathoms; between 100 and 500 fathoms                                 a
 steep descent     is met with.         From 500 to 700 or 800 fathoms                   the
 angle    of slope     is smaller,    and between         800 and 1200 fathoms              it
 again becomes steeper, and flattens between 1200 and 1500 fathoms,
 sometimes becoming          again steeper below 1500            fathoms.      From      the
 continental profiles which we have, the existence                     of these     terraces
 seems to be very probable.            It   is to be hoped      that, in future work,
 the soundings      will   be made so close to one another              that this    matter
 may be put out of doubt.

                       " Gettysburg " banks, lying nearly in the latitude of
the Straits      of Gibraltar, the former with 80 and the latter with 30
fathoms.        In the North Atlantic Directory*             a chapter   is devoted to
cataloguing the shoals and rocks which have been reported to have
been    found by different          navigators in the open ocean.             The great
majority of these are very doubtful, but there                 are one or two which
it would      be exceedingly         interesting to explore,       as  their existence
rests    on positive        evidence.       I  would    particularly     mention      the
Chaucer bank,         in lat.   42° 45'   N.,  long.   29°  W. It was discovered
by Captain        Robert Henderson of          the   ship
                                                           "  Chaucer," on a voyage
from     Mauritius to Glasgow, on 28th October 1850.                   Having noticed
  he  water discoloured, he sounded              and found hard bottom at 48
fathoms.        Two hours afterwards            he sounded      again in 50 fathoms,
and two      hours later he found bottom in 70 fathoms.                  These sound
ings put      the   existence of the " Chaucer           "
                                                           bank beyond         a   doubt.
 Similarly the       Sainthill bank, in lat.         42° 37'   N.,  long. 41° 45'     W.,
 on   which Captain           Sainthill,   R.X..   got a good sounding            in 100
 fathoms,     hard bottom;         and the Milne bank, in lat.             43° 35'    N.,
 long. 38° 50'      W.,    on which      Admiral Milne       got three soundings in
 92, 81, and       100 fathoms, with fine sand and ooze, obviously exist,
 though they may perhaps               form parts of one and the same shoal.
 The soundings          of   the   "Dacia" show that obtaining              one or two
 deep    soundings in the neighbourhood affords no evidence whatever
  of the   non-existence of       a reported   or suspected shoaL         AVhcn a ship
  is sent to   look for such a shoal she must be fitted with the necessary
  apparatus      for   taking     deep    soundings with         ease   and     rapidity.
  Arrived on the ground, she must              start sounding at close intervals,
  and always      follow   the lead of her own soundings, proceeding               in the
  direction in which          they get shallower until she either finds the
   shoal   or the water deepens           again.     This method       was used with
   great success,    and by it the Coral patch, and more particularly the
   "Dacia" bank, were discovered.

3.   On the Phytogeny of the Tunicata.                    By W. A. Herdman,
         D.Sc., F.LS., Professor of Natural History in University
         College, Liverpool.
                                     {Abstract.)
    This paper deals with the relationships between the different groups
of Tunicata, and the attempt          is made to trace their phylogeny, and
to construct a tree-like      figure, showing the course of evolution of the
group, and based upon           anatomical    and enbryological observations.
The following are the chief results which            are discussed     : —
    The Proto-Tunicata         were   derived    from the Proto-Chordata                by
 degeneration      and   modification, and they         are  represented       at the
 present time by the Appendiculariidoe.
    The Proto-Thaliacea and the Proto-Ascidiacea                  diverged     in     two
 different directions from the Proto-Tunicata, close to the                  ancestral
 Appendiculariidse.         The Doliolidae and the Salpida? form two diver
 gent lines from the Proto-Thaliacea.            Anchinia    is an offshoot        from
 the ancestral    Doliolidae.
    The Proto-Ascidiacea gave up their free-swimming pelagic                      mode
 of life and became fixed.          This ancestral     process is repeated at the
 present    day by the free-swimming larva of the               fixed Simple          and
 Compound Ascidians.             The    Proto-Ascidiacea       are   probably       most
 nearly represented       at the present day by the genus Clavdina.                They
 have    given rise, directly or indirectly, to the various                groups of
 Simple and Compound Ascidians.
     Two chief divergent lines arose from the ancestral Clavelinidae—
 one leading to the more typical Compound Ascidians, and the other
 to the Ascidiidae      and other     Simple Ascidians.        The first      of   these
 ancestral    lines gave rise to Diazona and the Distomidae,                and later
 on    to the    primitive    Didemnidae.       The Polyclinidae form            a side
 branch    from the base of the primitive Distomida\                 One   important
 new family, the Coelocormidae           (formed    for the reception        of   Calo-
 connus huxleyi,     obtained     off the east coast of South America,              from
 a  depth of 600 fathoms,            during the "Challenger" Expedition),
 was derived from the primitive Didemnidae,               and in its turn gave        rise
 to   the   Pyrosomidae,      thus connecting the          aberrant      and     highly
  modified    Pijrosoma with       the   Distomidae,     the  most    typical      Com

                          of Edinburgh,     Session 1885-8G.                     445
pound      Ascidians.       The Diplosomidae    were derived from the ancestral
Didemnidse.
     The    remaining two families of the            Compound      Ascidians,     the
Botryllidae and the Polystyelidce, were derived independently from
the ancestral        Simple Ascidians,     and  are therefore    not closely allied
to     the Polyclinidae        and the Distomidae.        Probably     the    Botryl-
lidse arose       from the primitive      Cynthiidae which were derived from
the      Ascidiidae.       The Polystyelidae,    on   the    other  hand,    form    a
modified offshoot from the Styelinae.             The new "Challenger" genus
Cliorizoeormut shows how the transition may have been effected from
 such a     Simple Ascidian       as  Polycarpa to such     a  Compound Ascidian
as     Goodsiria.
      The Proto-Ascidiacea         were probably colonial forms,       and gemma
 tion     was retained       by the Clavelinidae     and by the      typical    Com
 pound      Asciilians     (Distomidae,   &c.) derived from them.        The power
 of forming         colonies by budding was lost, however,           by the primi
 tive Ascidiidae        (Simple Ascidians),     and   must, therefore,   have been
 regained      independently by the ancestral forms of the Botryllidae and
  the Polystyelidae        derived from the Simple Ascidians.         In  the   Poly-
  Btyelidae    the differentiation of the colony has not gone           so  far  as in
  most other       groups of the Compound Ascidians, and the Ascidiozooids
  have not become arranged           in true systems.
       The ancestral       Cynthiidae split into two      lines of descent — one
   leading to the Styelinae       and the Polystyelidae,      and the other to the
  primitive Cynthinae.           This latter group  is represented most nearly at
   the present     day by the genus Cynthia, while the Bolteninae form               a
   side branch.        The Molgulidae were also derived from the primitive
    Cynthinae    ;  they have undergone      considerable    modification.
        In the paper     the details of the changes which the various families
    and genera have        probably undergone    during their evolution are dis
    cussed, and      the more important        hypothetical ancestral     forms are
    considered.       The two most striking conclusions which have been
     arrived   at are — (1)    the relationship   of Pyrosoma with the Disto-
     midas   through Coelocormus       ; and (2) that   the Compound Ascidians
     are a  polyphyletic group derived from the ancestral Simple Ascidians
     at three   distinct points.

     The    first point referred                 to in this      paper      is the source         of the
vapour that condenses                   to form dew.             A few       observations         of    the
                     of the ground near the surface and of the air over
                                                                                                          of it,
temperature
first raised doubts in the mind of the author                            as to the correctness
the now generally-received                       opinion that dew           is     formed of vapour
existing at the time in the air.                      These observations,               made at night,
showed         the    ground at         a       short distance        below the surface to               be
always hotter than the air over                     it;    and   it   was thought that so long
as   this excess         is   sufficient     to keep the temperature                of the surface of
the ground above the dew-point of the air,                            it   will,   if   moist, give off
vapour     ;   and    it      will   be this rising vapour that              will    condense on the
grass and form dew, and not the vapour that was previously present
in   the air.
     The first question to be determined                      was whether vapour does, or
does not, rise from the ground on dewy nights.                                     One method          tried
of testing this point was by placing over the grass, in an inverted
position, shallow trays made of thin metal                                  and painted.           These
trays      were      put over the ground to be tested,                             after sunset,        and
examined            at night, and also next morning.                       It   was expected           that,
if   vapour was rising from the ground during dewy nights,                                    it   would
be trapped           inside the trays.             The result in all the experiments                    was
that the inside was dewed every night, and the grass inside                                             was
wetter than that outside.                       On some nights there was no dew on                      the
outside     of the trays, and on all nights the inside deposit was                                heavier
than the outside one.
     Another         method          of testing this         point       was       employed,       which
consisted in weighing                  a     small area of the exposed surface                     of   the
ground,        as   it   was evident that           if    the soil gave off vapour during                 a
dowy night            it      must    lose      weight.     A    small turf about             6    inches
(152  mm.) square was cut out of the lawn and placed in   small                                a
shallow pan of about the same size. The pan with its turf, after
being carefully weighed, was put out on the lawn in the place where
the turf had been cut.                     It   was exposed      for some hours while                   dew
was forming, and on these occasions                           it   was always found to                  lose

weight       It    was thus evident           that      vapour       was rising            from the
ground     while dew was forming, and therefore                           the dew found on
the grass was       formed of part of the rising vapour, trapped or held
back by coming           into contact with the cold blades of grass.
  Another method employed for determining whether the conditions
found in nature          were favourable for dew rising from the ground on
dewy nights, was          by   observations        of the temperatures             indicated by
two thermometers,          one placed on the surface of the grass, and the
other under        the surface,     amongst        the stems, but on the top of the
soil     The difference        in the readings of these two thermometers                             on
dewy nights        was     found to be very considerable.                    Ten degrees was
frequently observed,             and occasionally it was             as     much      as    eighteen
degrees.      A minimum thermometer                    placed on, and another under,
the grass,        showed       that during       the      whole night          a considerable
difference was       always maintained.              As   a   result of this difference of
temperature        it is evident that vapour will              rise from the           hotter soil
underneath into the colder air above, and some of                           it will    be trapped
by coming         into contact with the cold grass.
   While the experiments were being conducted on grass land, parallel
observations were made on bare soil.                       Over soil the inverted trays
collected    more dew inside them than those over grass.                           A small         area
of soil was spread          over a shallow pan, and after being weighed was
exposed at the place where the               soil had been taken out, to                   see   if bare
soil as     well    as   grass lost weight during             dewy nights.             The result
was that on         all nights     on which        the tests were made the soil lost
weight,     and lost very nearly the same amount as the grass land.
      Another      method employed            of testing whether vapour is rising
from bare         soil, or is being condensed              upon       it,   consists       in placing
on the soil,        and in good contact                with    it,   small pieces of black
mirror,     or any substance        having     a   surface     that shows dewing easily.
In this way small areas of the surface of the earth are converted into
 hygroscopes,        and these          test-surfaces     tell us whether the ground
 where they are placed             is   cooled to the dew-point               or not.        So long
 as    they remain clear and undewed,                the surface of the soil                 is   hotter
 than the       dew-point, and vapour           is   being given off, while            if    they get
 dewed,      the soil     will    also be     condensing         vapour.        On all nights
 observed, these test-surfaces              kept undewed,            and showed            the soil to
 be    always giving off vapour.

448                    Proceedings     of tlie Royal Society
   All  these different methods         of testing point to the conclusion          that
during dewy nights, in this climate,                 vapour is constantly         being
given off from grass land, and almost always from bare soil; that                     the
tide of vapour almost always sets outwards from the earth, and                       but
rarely ebbs, save after being condensed                to cloud and rain, or           on
those rarer occasions on which, after the earth has got greatly cooled,
a warm     moist air blows over it.
    It seems probable        that when the radiation is strong, that                soil,
especially    if it  is loose and      not in good      heat-communication          with
the ground,      will  get cooled below the dew-point, and have vapour
condensed upon it.         On some occasions the soil certainly got wetter             on
the surface during the night, but the question               still remains, Whence
the vapour     ?   Came   it from  the air, or from the soil underneath         ?    The
latter seems the more probable source            : the vapour rising from the hot
soil underneath will be trapped by the cold surface-soil,                in the    same
way    as it is trapped     by grass over grass land.         During    frost, oppor
tunities are afforded of studying this point in             a satisfactory    manner,
as the trapped      vapour keeps its place where it is condensed.            On    these
occasions the under sides of the clods, at the surface of the soil,                    are
found to be       thickly   covered with     hoar-frost,   while there is little       on
 their upper or     exposed   surfaces, showing that the vapour condensed
 on the surface-soil     has come from below.
    The next division of the subject is on dew on roads.                   It is  gene
rally said that dew forms copiously on grass, while none is                 deposited
 on roads,     because grass is a good          radiator and cools quicker,          and
cools more, than the surface of a road.               It is shown that the        above
statement      is wrong,    and that dew really does form abundantly                   on
roads, and that the reason          it  has not been observed         is that it      has
not been sought for at the correct            place.    If  a road is examined on
a  dewy night, and the gravel turned up, the under sides of the                  stones
are found to be dripping wet.
    For studying      the formation of dew on roads, slates were found                  to
be useful.       One slate was placed over a gravelly part of the                  road,
and another over a hard dry part.               Examined on dewy nights               the
under sides of these slates were always found to be dripping                        wet,
while their upper surfaces, and the ground all round, were quite                    dry.
   The importance        of the heat communicated           from the ground         may
be illustrated by a simple experiment with two slates or two iron

weights, one            of them being placed                 on the ground, either on grass
or on bare soil,              and the other elevated                  a few inches           above       the
surface.          The exposed            surface         of the one resting on the ground,

and     in heat-communication                     with    is     found always to keep dry on
dewy nights, whereas                    the elevated one gets dewed all over.
      The effect of          wind in preventing              the formation of dew            is   referred
to.     It   is   shown that, in addition to the other ways already known,
wind hinders the                  formation of dew by preventing an accumulation
of    moist air near           the surface of the ground.
      From an examination of the different forms of vegetation                                 made on
dewy nights             it   was soon evident that something else than radiation
and     condensation              was    at work to produce             the varied appearances
then seen on             plants.        Some       kinds of plants were found to                  be wet,
while others            of   a    different kind, and growing close to them, were
dry, and even            on the same plant some branches                        were wet, whilst
others      were    dry.           The examination of the leaf of               a    broccoli plant
showed better                than any other              that the wetting was not what we
might expect            if   it    were dew.             The surface    of the leaf was not wet
all over, and the                 amount of deposit on any part had no relation to
its exposure            to radiation, or access to moist                  air; but    the moisture
was      collected in         little     drops, placed          at short distances apart, along
the      very edge           of     the leaf.         Further     examination showed that the
position of these                 drops had       a   close relation to the structure of the
leaf    ;   they were         all   placed at the points where the veins in the leaf
came to          the outer edge, at once suggesting                    that these veins were the
 channels         through which the liquid had been expelled.                            An    examina
 tion of grass revealed                 a    similar condition of matters        :    the moisture
 was     not equally distributed over the blade, but was in drops attached
 to    the tips     of some of the blades.                  It   therefore seemed probable              that
 these       drops, seen on vegetation                    on dewy nights, were not dew                     at
 all,    but were an effect of the                  vitality of    the plant.
      It    is   pointed out that the excretion of drops of liquid by plants
 is     no new discovery,               as   it   has been long well known,              and          the ex
 periments          of       Dr Moll         on this subject are referred           to   ;    but what
  seems strange              is   that the relation of           it   to dew does not seem to
 have been          recognised.
        Some experiments                were therefore        made on this subject in its rela
  tion to dew.            Leaves of plants that had been seen to                 be wet on             dewy

450                    Proceedings     of  the     Royal Society
nights were experimented on.             They      were connected    by means of an
india-rubber tube with a head of water of about               1  metre, and the leaf
surrounded with saturated air.             All      were found to exude a watery
liquid after being subjected to        pressure for some hours, and a broccoli
leaf got studded all along its edge with drops, and presented exactly
the same appearance         it did on dewy nights.            A  stem of grass was
also found to exude at the tips of one or two blades when pressure
was applied.
     The question     as to   whether these drops are really exuded by the
plant    by    internal     pressure,   as     in    the   above    experiments, or
are    produced in some other way,                 is then considered.      The    tip
of   a blade   of grass was     put under conditions in which it could not
 extract moisture from the surrounding air, and, as the drop grew as
 rapidly   under these        conditions    as     did  those   on the unprotected
 blades,  it is concluded that        these      drops are really exuded by the

 plant.
     On many nights no true dew is formed, and nothing but these
 exuded drops appear on the grass            ;    and on all nights when vegeta
 tion is active, these drops appear             before   the true dew, and     if the
 radiation is strong enough and the supply of vapour sufficient, true
 dew makes its appearance, and now the plants get equally wet all
 over, in the same manner as dead               matter.     The difference  between
 true dew on grass, and these exuded drops, can be detected                      at a
 glance.     The drops are always exuded at a point near the tip of
 the blade, and form a drop of some size, while true dew is distri
 buted all over the blade.        The exuded liquid forms a large diamond
 like  drop, while the dew coats the blade with a pearly lustre.
     Towards the end of the paper the radiating powers of different
 surfaces at night are considered           By means of the radiation-thermo
 meter,   described by the author in a previous paper, the radiating
 powers of different surfaces were compared.                 Black and white cloths
 were found to radiate equally well             :  soil and grass were also almost
 exactly equal to       each other.        Lamp-black       was equal to    whiting.
  Sulphur was about 2/3rds of black paint, and polished tin about
  1 /7th of black paint.       Snow in the shade on a bright day was at
  midday    7°   colder than the air, while a black surface at the same
  time was only      4° colder.    This   difference     diminished as the sun got
  lower, and at night both radiated almost equally welL                  In  the con
  cluding pages of the paper some less important subjects are considered.

5.    Observations          on the Structure of Lumbriais                    complanatus,
         Duges.         By Frank E.           Beddard,        M.A., F.R.S.E., F.Z.S.,
         Prosector to the Zoological Society of London.
    A very considerable number of earthworms have been referred to
the genus       Lumbricus,      and its immediate allies Dendrobama,                  Allolo-
bophora,     &c, which        have in reality no marked affinities with                  any
of these      genera.      Such are, for example, Lumbricus corethrurus                     of
Fritz Muller,       which Perrier      has shown to belong to a distinct generic
type described       by him under        the name of Urochceta, and Lumlrricus
mirrochmta        of Rapp, which is also the type of               a new genus,      widely
differing from Lumbricus            proper.      On the other hand,           a  very large
number      of species have been referred            to the latter genus, concerning
which there is         little  or no knowledge, so that              it is impossible      to
speak    with any certainty        as  to their exact systematic           position.
    No   less   than fifty-nine such species are enumerated by Vejdovsky,
in his     lately-published       System     und Morphologie            der   Oligochaten,
some      of which,       however,     are   evidently        members       of the genus
Lumbricus,         or its immediate        allies.      In   the memoir referred          to,
which is not merely a record of new observations,                      but a thoroughly
digested     summary of previous work upon the subject, Dr Vejdovsky
 only    allows    three    species   that can       be at present         unhesitatingly
assigned      to the genus Lumbricus           ; of    the other Lumbrici,         eighteen
 species   belong to Eisen's genera Tetrar/onurus,              AllolobopJiora, AUurus,
and Dendrohama          ; twenty-eight probably             belong to one of the four
 genera enumerated,         while thirty-two may or may not (in some cases,
 e.g.,  L.  microchceta certainly not) belong to any of these genera ;
 they are put       under the head of " species inquirenda?."                    It is with
 one   of these latter that the present paper deals.                 I do   not, however,
 wish    to   identify the      species    that    I  am     about to describe         with
 Lumhrkus        complanatus       of Duges        without      a   certain   reservation.
 Absolutely nothing          is known       about the structure            of by far the
  majority of     the species of Lumbricus ; and it is evidently therefore
  a matter     of impossibility     to determine         its systematic     position with
  any pretence     to accuracy.
     The following      observations     rest upon the examination of a single

452                   Proceedings of the Royal Society
specimen,     which    I  owe to the     kindness of Professor A. G. Bourne                   ;
the specimen        was    brought from Naples, and has been excellently
 preserved    by means of perchloride of mercury.
    One of the earliest writers on the structure of earthworms — Dugis—
 has left a valuable paper* on the anatomy and systematic characters
 of those species of Lumbricus which he was able to obtain in France.
 He distinguishes six separate species of Lumbricus as occurring in
 that country;       but it is at present quite impossible to state how                  far
 his systematic determinations are of value.              The whole subject         wants
 to be gone into afresh with the help of anatomy,                    and until that        is
 done    there   can be no real attempt          to classify the species of Lum
 bricus, as well as to decide         how far the generic         characters      adopted
 by Eisen are of value.
     Of the species described by Duges two appear, so far as                I can judge,
 to approach      very nearly the species described           in  the present paper.
 These are Lumbricus           gigas  and L. complanatus.           The structure         of
 both species is very closely similar to that of my own species,                        but
 the external characters          of the latter correspond       more with those of
 L.   complanatus.
    The anatomy        of L. gigas is described          in some detail, and            the
 descriptions are illustrated by          a  number of figures.          There     are, of
 course, numerous        statements     in the paper which require correction
in   the light of more recent knowledge           ;  tho spermathecas are spoken
of   as  testes, and the testes themselves,           or rather the vesiculse,           are
generally denominated           ovaries, and their ducts oviducts.            The    canal
 which Duges       figures as connecting the spermathecae has not, as far
 as  modern     investigations go, any existence.             Another      figure    illus
trates with sufficient accuracy the two vasa deferentia funnels, their
ducts uniting      into a common vas deferens           ;  the  "  testes
                                                                           " are shown
as   being in continuity with the margins of the funnels, so that                          it
is evident that in this species, as         in others of Lumbricus, the testicu
lar sacs are not the true testes, but merely a mass of spermatozoa in
various stages of development,           enclosed   in  a sac-like    structure which
is simply an outgrowth of the margins of the vas deferens                      funnel.
    The main point of interest in connection with these figures is                      the
presence    of four distinct vesiculae seminales, and no less than                  seven
copulutory pouches on each side of the body.

                        of Ediidmrgh,          Session 1885-86.                          453
    It  is well   known that in the          common       British Lumbricus       there are
only three       pairs   of   vesiculae      seminales,     and    two pairs of small
spherical copulatory pouches, which are found in the same segments.
The only exceptions            to this rule mentioned by Vejdovsky,                    apart
from the present          species,    are Alloloboplwra          cMorotiea, which has
three pairs      of copulatory        pouches (according to Duges), and                 Dm-
drokma, which has only                 one pair.        Duges mentions that seven
pairs of copulatory           pouches       are   not invariably        characteristic of
L. complanatus.           He  says  :—
                                          " Ces series n'ont pas toujours la meme
etendue,     puisque le nombre des vesicules                varie de deux a sept pour
chaque c6t6.         Ces differences        sont-elles   specifiques,   comme      le pense
M. Savigny       ?   Je   crois plutot qu'il faut les rapporter au temps ou
Ton    en   fait l'6tude    : en effet, a mesure que l'epoque               de l'accouple-
ment s'eloigne,      le volume de ces organes diminue;                les plus extremes,
aux deux bouts de la serie, s'atrophient les premiers,                    et il arrive   une
epoque     oil Ton n'apercoit qu'avec peine les rudiments de                    ces  parties
si saillantes    en  un   autre temps."*
    It   appears    to me that the latter supposition is the correct one,
and    that    the greater     number of copulatory pouches is in all proba
bility the typical number in fully-developed specimens.
    I  have recently       had the opportunity of confirming                  Duges' sup
 position in      a  species     of Pcrichceta         (probably      P. affinh).         My
friend Mr H. E. Barwell, of Manila, kindly                      forwarded      me a large
 number of earthworms from that locality at my request, and among
 them were numerous individuals                  of this Perichceta,       in which the
 copulatory pouches         varied in the most extraordinary way in num
 ber,   though not, as far as           I  could ascertain,       in  structure.      There
 were no      other differences       in structure      between      the different      indi
  viduals.
     On the other hand, no           individual of       the  British   species of Lum-
  brieus has, so    far as  I am   aware, ever been recorded             which possesses
  more than      two pairs of copulatory pouches.                The number of copu
  latory pouches      present    may serve as an indication of specific                rank,
  but  it is necessary to make use of this character with great caution.
  In   the   present    instance it may be taken for granted                   that seven
  separate   copulatory pouches           distinguish      L.  gigas from most         other
   species of the genus.

   A                                          * considerably augments the num
       subsequent     paper by Duges
ber of species.        In that        paper    (p.   23)     the    author states            that
L. complanatus       agrees with         L.  gigas   in   possessing         seven pairs of
copulatory pouches        and four pairs of vesiculae seminales.                       For this
reason   I  am inclined         for the present to regard               the species to be
described    in the present         note as identical with          L.    complanatus         ;   it
differs from    L. gigas     as    described    by Duges (1) in the distribution
of the setae, and (2) in the position of the clitellum.                           In L. gigas
the setae of the two pairs are closely approximated together, while
in L. complanatus they               are rather    more     widely separated.                 The
arrangement      of the   setae    in  L. complanatus is figured in the                  first of
the two memoirs         referred     to, and corresponds,          so far as      I  can make
 out,  exactly with the species studied by myself                     ;   the two       setae of
the ventral pairs are rather further apart                   than those of the            dorsal
pair.    The clitellum in my species extended from segments 28-38,
occupying therefore         10     segments.       Duges states that in L.                  com
planatus the clitellum extends from 29-39, which,                          as he counts the
buccal lobe as a distinct segment, is precisely the same;                     in L.   gigas, on
the other hand, the clitellum occupies 22 rings, ending with the 53rd.
    In Hoffmeister's Familien             der    Regenwurmer            three     species       are
mentioned in which the clitellum occupies about the same                              segments
as   in L. complanatus,          L. stagnalis (apparently identical with                         L.
planatus) is one species; the other two areX. agrkola                           (

vircscens, anatomicus)        ;   in all these, however, the             setae  of each       pair
are very closely approximated, and, moreover,                    except in       L.   agricola,
the segments contained in the clitellum are not more than nine                               ; so,
at any rate, does it appear from Duges' table of classification of the
species in the second of his two memoirs                referred       to.
   Duges does       not give an elaborate              account        of the generative
apparatus     in L.  complanatus,        merely remarking that there                   are four
seminal vesicles and seven pairs of copulatory pouches.
   In  the specimen     before me there are four seminal vesicles on each
side of the body, occupying apparently segments 8-11                          ;  they    are ap
proximately of equal size and rounded in shape, firmly attached                                  to
the   mesentery     dividing       these segments.         The copulatory              pouches
have an arrangement         rather different from that figured by Duges in

mesentery       into  the segment behind.        The series of sections confirm
these     statements, and also show that the duct of the copulatory
pouch      arises from about the junction          of its two halves, which are
only     separated from each other by             a   slight constriction       at the
mesentery       ; as  diverticula, in fact,    they are not well marked,            the
structure     being identical throughout.
    In every      case   the interior   of the spermatheca        was filled    with   a
mass     of spermatozoa.
    I   am able therefore, generally speaking,           to confirm the       accuracy
 of Duges' observations on the copulatory pouches of Lumhricus com-
planatus,      and such      a confirmation is evidently necessary, since it is
 often stated,     when dealing with the structure of Lumbricidce, that
 Lumhricus differs from other genera in the fact that the copulatory
 pouches are contained          in the   same segments       as the testes, and are
 only two or three          pairs in number.     The present species combines
 the characters      of most Lumbrici on the one hand, and such genera                as
 PontodriluB, Urocha&a,          &c, on    the other,   in  so far that the copula
 tory pouches        are present    both in the segments which contain the
 testes    and in certain of those which precede them.               The number of
 pairs also is larger than is met        with in any     other known earthworm.
     Another fact of interest is the presence of diverticula,                   which,
 characteristic      of many other genera, Perichceta, &c, have not to
  my    knowledge been described          in Lumhricus ; they        have apparently
  escaped the     attention of Duges, always supposing that his species is
  the same as     that described in the present       paper.      It   is rather diffi
  cult,  however, in the present         species to say which         part should be
  regarded    as the   copulatory pouch itself and which the diverticulum.
  In segment nine, for example,           the pouch   on the     right-hand side of
  the body was considerably larger than its " diverticulum," and on the
  left-hand side smaller.         In Perichceta there is never any such diffi
  culty, for the diverticula       have a very different appearance         ; they are
  usually different     in  shape from the copulatory pouch        ;  and in  a species
  of Acanthodrilus,       I  have   pointed out that there is also        a difference

458                   Proceedings      of the Royal Society
in minute structure * between             the two portions of the copulatory
pouch.      In Lumbricus complanatm            there is no difference       in   shape      ;
only a difference in size, and the structure is identical                This    matter
is a little more important than might appear at first sight, because                      if
we are to allow that the two large pouches in segment nine are each
the equivalent of a copulatory pouch, we shall have the apparent
anomaly of two pairs of copulatory pouches in the same segment
 It   is  generally    believed that the         segment       which    contains       the
gizzard    is in reality the      equivalent of two segments which have
 become     fused   through the abortion of the                intervening     septum,
 possibly of mechanical         advantage     to the gizzard,       as rendering        its
 movements       more free.      In Pericliceta     afflnis,    Perrer records     t   the
 presence   of two   pairs of copulatory pouches in the gizzard
                                                                          " segment,"
besides two rings of sete.           I have observed the same thing in other
species of this genus.         Is it   legitimate    to suppose      that in    L.   com-
planatus we have a record of the former presence of the gizzard in
the same region         of the body where         it now      occurs   in  Perichctta,
though not in any Lumbricus            1
    The supposition of an aborted mesentery and              a consequent     fusion of
 two segments       is not, however,      so trustworthy in this species            as  in
Pericliasta, because there is certainly only one nephridium and one                   row
 of  setus as  in all the adjacent      segments, and so, perhaps,         it is  better
to suppose that the copulatory pouch of segment 8 has a very large
diverticulum,     — larger than     the pouch itself, — a more normal arrange
ment being found on the left side of the body.                   A third   alternative
is possible,    viz., that more than a single pair of copulatory               pouches
may be present in the same segment.                As   an evident abnormality,          I
have observed a case of this kind in a specimen of Perichceia affinit—
the species which        has already been referred           to above    as affording
an instance      of variability     in  the number of the copulatory pouches
in different individuals of the same species             ; in one specimen of        this
worm there were three copulatory pouches in one segment                      placed in
a  row.    An inspection of       fig. 2 would appear at first sight to prove
that the second alternative mentioned above is the correct                   one.      In
every case     it will   be noticed that the duct of the pouch                   passes
backwards to open          on to the       exterior at      a   point   opposite     the

 segment behind that which contains the pouch.                          In   this way we
 must assume, for the sake of making all the pouches of the series to
correspond,       that the minute portion            of the pouch which lies in
segment 8 is the pouch itself, and not a diverticulum.                       On the other
hand, perhaps, the          fourth and fifth pouches             still retain   the char
acters   that are met with in most species of Lumbricus,*                       where the
pouch is situated near to the anterior region                of its   segment, and the
duct opens       on to the body-wall         in the groove between this segment
and the one        in front, with this difference, that a part of the pouch
has   grown through the wall and forms                a    kind of diverticulum        ;  if
the diverticulum         continues to grow at the expense of the pouch until
the latter vanishes         altogether,    we arrive at the        condition which is
characteristic      of certain other Lumbrici; in any           case, the   two pouches
of segments        8 and    9   appear    to be an indication          of a connection
between      the     unusual disposition        of the pouches           in the present
species    and their more usual arrangement                 in Lumbricus generally,
and   in other earthworms (i.e., situated in the anterior region of the
segment, and opening            in  the groove between         this segment and the
one   in front).
    I have,   therefore,    been able to show         in    the present paper that a
   *
      This is not,      however,    invariably   the case.     In  some individuals     the
spermatheca: are, as in the present species, placed near to the posterior wall of
the segment which contains           them ; in other individuals, possibly different
species,  the spermatheca,     as in the majority of earthworms,       is placed nearer to
the anterior   wall of the segment.       This may prove to be a difference of specific
importance.      I find that this variation exists in the figures of other observers.
Lankester (Quart. Jour. Micr. Sci., 1865) figures the two sperinatheea? as
lying by the anterior wall of their segments (9 and 10), and opening in the
groove between each of those segments and the one in front.                   On the other
hand, Hering (Zeitsch. f. Wiss. Zool., 1857) states that the spermatheca? are
situated in 9 and 10, and open between 9-10 and 10-11.                  D'Udekem (Mem.
Cour. d. I. Acad. roy. de Brux., 1856) figures and describes a disposition of the
spermatheca;    identical with that observed by Hering.
   A'ote added May 15, 1886. — A paper by Dr Rosa,                "I  lumbricidi del Pie-
monte," which 1 had overlooked in writing the above, has come into my hands
through the kindness of the author.         L. complanatus is described in this paper
under the name of Allolobophora complanata ; the author, however, does not
mention the diverticula of the spermatheca?, nor is there any indication of
 them in his figure ; if the presence of these should ultimately prove to be a
specific character,    I would propose to name my species Lumbricus (Alio-
lophora) rosa, after the Italian naturalist.         I notice also that in this paper
the position of the spermatheca? in the anterior or posterior region of the seg
ment is used as a specific character.          The specimen described in the present
 paper shows how the change        opposition of the spermatheca; is brought about.

            (Plates       XIII., XIV., XV.)
     In     connection       with the observations              carried         on by one of us on
the salinity            and temperature          of estuaries,*           it   seemed    desirable to
examine           the    condition       of the water near the mouth                       of a river
flowing directly into the                sea.     For this      purpose         it   was necessary to
select a stream            of considerable          volume and free from                    pollution.
As the Spey appeared                  to be the most suitable river, we spent the
month of August at Garmouth,                         a   small town close to the old               port
of Kingston, on the west side of the river mouth.                                        "We have to
express our thanks to              Mr Balmer, Commissioner                      at Fochabers to     the

work, and for affording us the use of the facilities presented by                                  the

area      of   1245 square miles.           It   flows in   a   northerly direction into           the

an    inlet of the      sea, and as    such possessed of the distinctive marine
characteristics.         As   a salmon river,        it ranks next    to the Tay and
the Tweed.           It   is particularly       noted for the suddenness          and  in
tensity of its floods, and for the variable nature of the channel, the
stream being frequently diverted                  in a new direction.        Twenty-five
years ago      a channel was cut to turn the river from the village of
Kingston, many of the houses of which had been undermined and
carried away.           One result was the destruction of the harbour,                  so
that now        a boat can enter or leave the river only                 in   the calmest
weather, and then at high                tide.      This  fact added   considerably to
the    difficulties     of work in the bay, and prevented it from being so
complete       as we desired.          The bay is very shallow near the shore,
and the depth is yearly diminishing                    on account of the stones and
silt brought down by the river.                  The beach on each side for several
miles is covered         with   fields of river-borne shingle massed         in wave-like
 ridges parallel to the coast line, and hardly touched                 by vegetation.*
     The town of Lossiemouth lies 7£ miles to the west of the Spey,
 and Buckie 5 miles to the east.                   Halfway to Buckie, 2£ miles east
 of  Tugnet, is the fishing village of Port Gordon, the nearest harbour
 to the    Spey available in ordinary weather.
     The river        near    the    mouth is confined to          a narrow       channel
 (250     feet wide        at high    water,     and about 150 at low tide), and
 partly on     this account        and partly because of the slope of its bed, it
 is very    rapid.       The depth varies from           3 to 6 feet   at low tide, and
  every flood effects some change              in  the position of the shingle banks
  and shoals.         The western       side     of the river near the mouth is           a
  shingle bank running into a line of low sandy islands                     ; on the east
  there are simple shingle heaps forming a breakwater about 30 yards
  wide which separates             the river from the sea.       Just   at the mouth a
  ridge of shingle,         entirely bare at low tide, runs in an east-north
  easterly direction, and sends             the river current out to sea           towards
     *
       Mr Balmer      informs us that the river was diverted in February 1860 to a
  straight   course,  in the expectation that by its action on the shingle banks it
  would gradually move back to its old westerly position.            Instead of doing so,
  it cut a new channel more to the east, and continued for several months to
   extend this until the mouth had advanced about quarter of a mile to the east
   ward. Then the normal action recommenced, and shingle has been steadily
   laid down on the east bank and cut off from the western ever since, so that the
   mouth is moving westward every month; and in a few years it is expected to
   come back to the     position it occupied prior to 1860.

    more    than      2 feet  of water     on it.     Since the bar and banks are con
    stantly shifting        in   size, shape, and position, all observations which
    depend      in any way         on the form of the river mouth must be con
    sidered as applicable only to the time when they were made.
        The salmon-fishing station of Tugnet stands                    on the east shore
    about one-third of a mile from the                     river mouth.       A   backwater
    separated, except          at high tide, from the main stream               by a sandy
    flat, runs up from near the river mouth to Tugnet.                         On the west
   side a narrow shallow channel, separated                     by   a low grassy island
   from the river, comes down past Garmouth, and at its termination                             a
   burn which trickles across the mud of Kingston                       Basin at low tide,
   enters    the river.         At high tide this burn           becomes a passage with
   considerable depth of water, leading to a broad expanse                         below the
   houses     at Kingston,         and separated from the sea by a             high   shingle
   bank.      The relative positions of these parts of the river may                         be
   understood from the accompanying                     sketch (fig. 1), which is drawn
   roughly from memory,              and is not to scale.
       Even when the river is small and the tide full the water is                      fresh
   on the surface.*             The rising    tide diminishes the velocity of              the
  current, both by damming back the fresh water and by widening                            the
  connection with the            sea, and so     letting it spread over a larger       area.
       The conditions of working              in   a  small coble in    a  rapid stream      of
 slight depth, in which considerable                   variations of salinity might         be
 expected,         necessitated      some    modifications of the usual modes               of
 obtaining and examining samples                     of water.     The slip water-bottle
 was useless as a collector,              because     it  enclosed a vertical column of
 water     a   foot high, and it soon became apparent that very consider
 able changes           of density took place in a distance             of   3 inches.      It
 was found best            in   the circumstances        to use an ordinary stoppered
 bottle (of about          1 '5  litre capacity) lashed to       a pole or   attached    to a

stopper    by  a cord when the desired depth was reached.          The pole
or line    was graduated     to feet.    By this means, the bottle being
lowered    full of air, water    was   let in from a plane that could be

  determined    to 1 inch in calm weather.        It was a little difficult to
  get a true bottom sample in this way ; but it was secured, when a

  464                     Proceedings      of  the  Royal Society
   sounding-line was used, by fixing a weight to the neck of the bottle
  and paying out line enough to let it lie flat.
      It was impracticable, on account of the time required, to use the
  delicate    hydrometer for determining the density of the hundreds of
  samples     taken in tracing the mixture of sea and river water ;                    and
  we were obliged to be content with               occasionally reserving a bottom,
  intermediate, and surface sample for careful                determination, while        a
  small directly-graduated hydrometer was made use of in the boat
  This hydrometer          was    marked to read         "specific   gravities"      from
   1 -000 to   1 -030 at 60°     F., but  since only an indication of the salinity
  was required the temperature,            which averaged about 58° and which
  often varied        1°   or even     2°   between     surface    and     bottom,     was
  neglected.
      Throughout       this paper the density of water when given to                   the
  third  or fourth decimal place (e.g., 1-026 or 1-0255) is only roughly
  approximate, and is not corrected for temperature                ; the observations
  were   made, as a rule, while          the water had a temperature of from
  12° to 16°     C.    When it is given to          five places (e.g., 1-02345) it is
  accurate to within       0- 00005,   and is calculated to 15°-56 C. whatever
  the   original temperature         of the sample was.          The observed        tem
  perature    of water and air is given in degrees Fahrenheit,                   in   con
  sistence with      the usage of meteorologists.            Instrumental errors       are
  not allowed for, as the same thermometers                were always used for air,
  surface- water, and deep-water         temperatures     respectively   ;  the absolute
  uncertainty, which is a constant               for each thermometer,         does not
            '
 exceed 0      2  in any    case.    Time is reckoned from 0 hours, midnight,
 to 24 hours.
                  Observations     on  Tidal Variations of Salinity.
      Numerous observations were made at a point about 100 yards
 inside the bar when tide was flowing, and some in the same position
while it was ebbing.            The mode of working was to anchor the               coble
in mid-stream,         and, beginning       at   the surface,    to take     samples at
every foot of depth, to observe              the density with the small hydro
meter, and where          there was a sudden rise          in density   between       any
two specimens,          to examine samples          from every     3  inches in that
foot.      By this means the vertical distribution of salinity was
traced.     After a few minutes the process was repeated, and so on

     until     the work had to be stopped                                           by the ebb current becoming too
     strong for the anchor.                              It   was sometimes                             found advisable to begin
     at the bottom and work upwards.

    In  the coloured diagrams (Plate             XIV.)     the shades represent roughly
 the quantity of dissolved salts at each depth as deduced                         by calcula
tion on the assumptions — which are accurate                           enough    for   the pur
 pose of diagrammatic representation                 — that       the   indications of        the
 rough hydrometer are correct,                  and    that brackish water            is   ocean
 water diluted with pure water.
    If in   a   river running directly into salt water the channel                        should
gradually deepen           as  it  enters    the sea, so that there            should      be no
 obstacle to the entrance          of salt water       as the    tide rose, and if        at the
 same time       it  were so narrow as not to be in any sense an inlet
 of the   sea, the   conditions in it would be truly comparable with                        those
 of  a  river gradually merging into                a   firth.     This is never        the case
so far as we have             been able       to ascertain,        as a bar exists at         the
 mouth of all rivers.             As   a   consequence,        the    sea water enters          by
first rising to the level of the top of the obstacle, and then                           pouring
 down on the other side through the fresh water, and                          so  produces       a
large volume        of brackish      or not    fully salt water inside the bar.
    The action       of the breakers          over the bar or in the shoal water
outside     serves    still   more    to effect mixture.             Were it not         for the
great    rapidity     and     volume of the Spey, the tide would                     probably
produce a uniform brackish mixture at the mouth of the river,                                and
a much     less marked        series of salinity strata farther up, than                   those
that were observed.

                        of Edinburgh, Session 1885-86.                                  469
    The    data already given represent             the actual manner in which the
salt or slightly freshened            sea   water fights its way up the bottom of
the river from the          sea,   while the fresh river water runs down above.
The    greatest   distance up the stream to which salt water penetrated
on    the    bottom       was      not    satisfactorily     determined,      but   it was
certainly less than half            a  mile.      At high tide    a very    thin layer of
salt water was found at the bottom in. a deep hole close to the
west bank of the river about                a quarter of a mile from          the mouth.
On    the   east side      the shallow backwater (fig.             1) was found        on a
calm still day to be filled with perceptibly brackish water at two
hours' ebb, the fresh upper water having evidently                         run off most
quickly.         On another           occasion,     when     there    was  a gale     blow
ing the fresh         surface       water into       the backwater, the         salt layer
flowed      out from        the     bottom      during    the   first half-hour     of ebb
(Plate     XIII.     fig.    4,    and Plate       XIV.   fig.  4).    In this    case the
pressure of the accumulated water at the upper end of the cul-de-
tac evidently set up a reaction current                     outwards, thus reversing
the ordinary mode of emptying.
    In the   open river the sea water appears                always to flow and ebb
under the fresh water            ;  but some shipmasters,        who know the Spey
well,   told us that at the ebb the river often                      "ran    salt" for     a
considerable       time,      the fresh upper water flowing away first                 ;  no
such phenomenon was presented,                      according to them,        on the flood
tide.     "VYe  looked specially for this effect, but did not observe it.
    On one occasion,          August        11, two hours before         high water, the
density from the bottom up to                  2 feet  from the surface      was that of
sea water (over         1 '024), and the river was brackish even at               G  inches
 from the surface.           A   strong wind was driving            the river    water out
to sea on this occasion, and so stripping off the usual layer of fresh
 water.       On another day, August                8, when the ebb was unusually
rapid, there was        a   depth of      6   feet of perfectly fresh water half-an-
 hour after high tide.
     The salinity at any depth during flood or ebb tide is influenced
 by   a number       of conditions,          such   as  the density of the sea water
 coming in, the rate              of the outgoing current, the height of the
 tide, the wind, and other variable factors.                       Supposing,      to   take
 the normal conditions, that just outside Spey bar, where the depth
  is about    1 fathom, the lower            f fathom    has   a density of 1-0250 at

470                  Proceedings     of   the     Royal Society
 60°   F., the time being that of low water on a calm day without
 wind.     The river is flowing out by a narrow channel about two
 feet deep over the bar.        The tide gradually rises, and opposes                      an
  increasing resistance to the outflowing current,               the  salt water        rises
 over the bar and creeps up the bottom of the channel, raising the
 level and so gradually widening the                   opening     by covering        sand
 banks.      At about quarter flood the             river begins     to rise     near the
 mouth from the damming back of the fresh water,                       then suddenly
 (see   observations   III.   on p. 466) a thin            wedge of brackish water
 is found inserting itself between           the bottom and the           fresh water        ;
 a  few    minutes later there is       a   layer of        salt water   a    foot     deep
 topped      by  an equal    stratum of          brackish, and as time           proceeds
 the salinity at the bottom remains               constant,     but   extends higher,
 and passes through a brackish zone into the river water, about                             a
 foot or eighteen inches of which remains hardly touched by salt,                          or
 even quite fresh, and flows out to             sea    slowly, tearing itself       across
 the layers of denser water flowing at             a  lower level more slowly hut
 rosistlessly upwards.        About    an     hour before full tide there               is a
 state of balance ;     the wedge of salt water has pushed                 its brackish
 edge to the highest point, and the enfeebled                 force of the     tide    only
 sufiicos   to hold back the       dammed          up water above.           This       con
 tinues for some time     ;  then there is       a  turn, the salt wedge is         forced
 slowly out, the dammed back water rushes down unchecked,                            keep
 ing up the level of the river near the mouth for some time,                         while
 the salt and finally brackish water withdraws along the bottom                       ; and
 by half ebb the river down to the bar is entirely fresh, and rapidly
 returning to its low-water level.
     The diagrams on Plate       XIV.   may be explained on the supposition
 that water containing less than 0'5 per cent, of salts in solution                    may
 be considered     fresh, while when the percentage                of salt is     greater,
 but does not exceed       2 per cent.,    it   is brackish,    and when more than
 2  per   cent, of salt is present    it   is thoroughly salt.          In   order to     be
truly representative,      the   shades     of colour in these figures             should
 have the margins      blended, but reference            to the curves   (Plate XIII.)
will show that if     the abrupt transitions did not take place at points
corresponding to 0'5 aud        2 per   cent       of salt respectively, they           did
take place very near those positions.                The diagrams show how with
tho rising tide the    layers of " fresh      "
                                                  and " brackish

of nearly equal depth, while the " salt water below increases from
a mere film on the bottom         until it fills  more than     half of the river
bed at the point of observation.           The interface between         the fresh
and salt water is much sharper at some times than at others.                    We
were anxious to find the direction of the plane of contact when
it  was clearly marked, and to see how             it varied at different    places,
but    to   make     an   attempt   of   this    kind   a number of       observers
working simultaneously would              be required, and these we           could
not command
   The theory to which our observations              have   given rise regarding
the mixture of salt and fresh water inside the bar is one which,
although not proved, seems to bo at least prubably true.                  It is that
the fresh water running down the inclined               bed of the river meets
the wedge of salt water pushing its way up and acting in virtue of
its superior density        as a sort of soft false        bottom sloping in the
the opposite       direction to the inclination        of the river bed.        The
lower    layers of the fresh water have        now to run along       a  level sur
face or even to force their way up-hill, but in doing so the friction
between the two tears off thin streams of salt water, and mixes it
with the       fresh  to  form the brackish layer.           This is   represented
diagrammatically in Plate XV. fig.          1.    The part that diffusion plays
in   causing mixture is probably a small one, but            it must  be increased
by the gouging action of        the rapid rush of fresh water on the slow
push of the salt wedge.*
                     Observations  on  Salinity in    Spey Bay.
    The work outside the river was seriously hampered                     in  conse
quence of Spey bar being impassable              during the least swell, and of
the dependent fact that there are no fishing boats at Garmouth or
Kingston.         Once we went out in a little open boat, and on two
occasions in a half-decked yawl from Port Gordon.                      The rest of
the time devoted         to outside work was spent on the shore              taking
samples of water in the surf, westward and eastward,                      from the

      Since writing the above our attention has been directed to a paper by
M.    Adolpbe Guerard, of Marseilles, read this summer (1885) and printed in
vol. lxxxii. of the Minutes of Proceedings Inst. C.E., pp. 305-336, in which he
employs     (p. $34) almost identical expressions        to describe the manner in
which a tidal river is affected by the sea.        His treatment of the subject is
entirely from the engineer's point of view.

river mouth at regular intervals for several                                     miles.         The results of
this method are made uncertain by the                                        fact — which            we in part
verified after it was reported to                          us  —   that much of the Spey water
reaches       the sea by filtering                  through the enormous                        shingle banks,
and so        trickling down                 almost      imperceptibly, but still exerting                             a
distinct freshening influence along the shore line.

 was made on 30th                    July, from about                1    hour before            high water          to
three quarters             of an hour after it.

     IXa. On            10th     August, when the river was very low,                                  a trip was
 made      from Port Gordon, and samples were collected on the                                                    out

 of   3 miles        radius, with the mouth of the river                             as a centre.             It  was
impossible            to get     the     compass        placed         high enough              to enable       us to
 take bearings              accurately,         so the      positions were only approximately
 determined.               The weather was on the whole bright, with                                   occasional
 showers.            There was a stiff breeze from the south-south-west,                                       which
 became very squally towards afternoon.                                  The five sets of observations
 made from 9h.30 to 12h.30, when it was high water, are as follows :—

          Xa. Another trip from Port Gordon                                     was made on 18th August,
     between           10h.50 and 16h.40.                   The river, which had come down in
     heavy       spate       on     the     13th,       was     still unusually full.                     The weather
     was      bright         and warm,            the      wind         very light, and                a considerable
     swell was coming in from the north-east.                                         The wind was dead on
     land, and too light                   for the boat          to     sail up to, consequently we had
     to keep         near the          shore,     about        half      a    mile out, while going west
      ward,     until      off the Spey.               The water was swarming with medusas
      of all sizes and colours.                    The following                 observations were made in
      the course of the day, the densities being determined on shore by
      the delicate hydrometer,                    and reduced by calculation to 15°-56                               C: —

           Xb.      When        we were in the neighbourhood of the mouth of the
       river, a great          many observations                   were made             with      the small hydro
       meter.          The high density of the sample of water taken home from
       near the        river mouth (1-02435 at the surface) must be explained by
        the   boat's drifting a little to the east of the fresh current before the
       sample       was bottled, for while coming straight in steering for the bar
        from the previous position,                        the readings              of the small hydrometer

            Returning from that position, and steering N. by W., in the direc
        tion of the           axis of the river, we found                               the     density      to vary as

       The temperature            steadily rose from 57 -3 until at the point                           where
  the density was             1 '021    it   was 57°"8;         it then fell gradually               to 57cl

      XI.    On August 26, at 8M5, by the kindness of Captain Link-
 later of the " St Clair," a sample of surface water was taken in                                           the
 centre      of the        Moray        Firth       between         Aberdeen           and Wick.           The
 weather        was bright, with an easterly swell.                          The temperature           of   the
 water was 52°-7, and the density, afterwards                               determined,         as 1-02612.

    Xllrt. On August                15 the       river, which had been in high flood                         on
the 13th and 14th, had subsided                           considerably,         but was still       flooded.

 47G                        Proceedings           of the Royal Society
    XV. On 20th August                     observations       made at Portessie, 6 miles
east from tho          Spey, showed at 9h.50 a density of T026, at                             llh.5       of
 1-026, and at 18h.15 of 1-027.
                                  The Salinity of Spey Bay.
    The mean density at                15° -56 C.     of the bottom water in Spey Bay
was found to be 1-02567.                     It   varied   in twelve     cases      from 1-02540
to 1-02598,         while the surface water varied in density from                             1   02000
to 1-02576.           The observations             made seem to warrant the conclusion
that the water             is,   as   a   whole,    of   a   density slightly         greater          than
1   -02550 in Spey Bay, and considerably greater                         in    the centre of the
 Moray Firth.             Whether the slight reduction in density                          is      due to
the action of the Spey water,                      or to the vicinity of the Cromarty
and Inverness Firths,                 can hardly be said, and            it   is   unimportant             in
connection          with the immediate             subject of which we treat.
    The Spey water runs rapidly out of its comparatively shallow
channel   :    at low tide,           partly on account of its shallowness, and                          at
high tide, partly on account of the bar,                     it   flows across the surface                 of
the sea water         in   a   thin stream, freshening to            a   marked extent only
the upper few feet, and spreading                     out laterally      in   the form of          a   fan.
The exact shape and direction of this expansion                                are dependent on
the volume of tho                river, on the state of the tide,                  on the confor
mation of the mouth, which                    is   subject to incessant            change, and on
the direction of the wind.                   The usual trend of the river current                        in
the bay appears to be north-easterly.
    The observations             VIII.     (p. 472) show that when the boat sailed
due north, the density at              J     mile from the river mouth was                     1-02557
on the surface, strong sea water;                    while those under             IXa., with           the
river in the same state               as regards      flood, show no clear indication                    of
the course of the stream on the circumference of                              a   circle   3   miles     in
radius described           from the mouth of the Spey.                        The pocket           hydro
meter    readings,        1X6., show that when               ^    mile off shore the               stream
was clearly defined,             its margin shading off gradually on the                        eastern
side    and    abruptly          on    the    western,       where     the        transition        from
brackish to salt water was very sharp.                         The stiff breeze which                  was
blowing from          the      S.S.W. would help              to carry the          stream         to the
N.N.E.,       and    it   might have been narrow enough                        to pass between
two of the observing points and so elude detection.

                          of Edinburgh, Session 1885-86.                                             477
     The observations Xa. show an entirely different set of conditions.
The river was partially flooded, and the wind had been easterly for
some days, thereby probably                keeping the freshened                   surface          water
from spreading to the eastward.                  The result was that, within a mile
of the shore        there was an area, the surface             density of which varied
from       to 1*024, the bottom water being scarcely below the
           1-012
normal (about l-0256).  The observations, X/;. and Xa, with the
small hydrometer, show how the density increased steadily in a
northerly direction from the river until the water was quite salt on
the surface,        and how, when the boat                 was       turned towards Port
Gordon, the salinity at first increased                 and     then diminished                 as    the
fresh      current sweeping to the eastward               against       the        flood    tide was
entered on.          The diagram,       Plate XV.       fig.   2,    gives    an idea of the
manner       in which       these, combined      with numerous          other observations
not recorded in detail, indicate the direction                  in which           the river runs
through the bay.             The colouring shows the difference                      between         the
salt and brackish            surface   water,    the former being represented                         by
the darker         shade.       Density by the small hydrometer is marked at
intervals along the course of the boat.
     It    is evident, from the numerous             observations of density made
along the beach             by means of the small hydrometer, that the shore
water is much fresher on the east than on the west side of the river,
and       that on going eastward from the river the observer finds the
density increase          to a certain point      (XIILx),          and then diminish,                 as
if    the current at first swept out to sea, and then curved                          back along
the shore.         This     is indicated in a general               manner     in the diagram
referred to above.              The series      XlVa.   and XIV£>. show the greater
freshness on the east side very clearly, although                            on the day when
those      observations were made the salinity on the west side was con
siderably        less than usual.        The generally-accepted                fact, which            we
in part verified, that much of the                 Spey water finds its way to the
sea       by percolating through the shingle, may account                            for the uni
formly low density along the shore.
      The phenomenon            of percolation is presented on the small scale by
 the  Tynet burn, near Port Gordon (Plate XV. fig.     It      small         2).           is   a
 stream flowing into   long, narrow deep pool without an outlet, one
                              a
 side      of which    is   a   shingle bank, sloping down to the sand.                               Its
 length     is   parallel to the shore lino, and nearly at right angles to the

 478                   Proceedings     of the Royal Society
 course   of the burn.         Although     there is no apparent outlet,       close
 examination shows that an immense number of trickling streamlets,
 varying in breadth from half an inch to about a foot, and in depth
 from that of      a mere  film to several inches, escape all along the lower
 margin of the bank, and meander               across  the sand   to the sea, the
 edge of which is perceptibly freshened            by this means.      The condi
 tion of outflow is represented          in the diagram,      Plate    XV.   fig. 4,
 fresh water by      a red, sea water    by a blue colour.
    The variation of salinity with depth throughout Spey Bay depends
 almost entirely on the amount of flood in the river, and on                     the
 direction in which it runs.           On August       10, when the river was
 low, and the boat in cruising about the bay did not encounter any
 freshened     surface water, there was, as a rule, a uniform           and slight
 increase   of density with depth         ;   while on August      18,   when    the
 river was flooded      and the surface water of a great         part of the    bay
 comparatively fresh, the bottom and half-depth               densities remained
 as before,   and the surface was greatly freshened, although to           a slight
 depth.     One or two     cases were    observed    where  the water from half
 the depth was denser than that from the bottom,              and one in which
 it was less dense than at the surface.           These differences    may  be due
 to irregular and incomplete mixing of river and sea water.
    The course of the fresh water stream             through the bay is     beauti
fully   seen during      a flood.    Fishermen told us that when          a heavy
 spate occurred      with   a  southerly gale they have seen the coloured
water running due north in          a  wide stream, but that      it usually   runs
towards the east.
    A  great spate occurred on the           night of August      12, the largest,
according to the ferryman at Garmouth, for over fifteen years.                  The
average state of the water during our stay had been lower than it
had almost ever been observed before.              On the morning of the       12th
the river was low, and the water very clear and perfectly colourless.
At   17h. 30    the water     had a clear     amber   colour, was very slightly
increased    in volume, and had the temperature          50° "0.   Next   morning
(August     1 3)  the river was a broad sheet of leaping yellow waves,
sweeping      from bank to bank, and carrying down planks,                 salmon
boxes, and potatoes, a field of which had been flooded and destroyed
some miles up the river.           As the current crashed round the shingle
heaps   with    tremendous     velocity great slices of the bank, from       a few

                          of Edinburgh, Session 1885-86.                                             479
inches to more than a foot thick, 8 to 10 feet high, and many yards
long, were        undermined, and rushed down into the stream                                  with    a
hoarse     rattle.       From the rate at which these banks were carried
away     it could      be easily understood how the sea in the neighbour
hood     of the mouth           is constantly shoaling.                  In   the forenoon,        with
the tide at half-flood, and a gale blowing from the north-west, the
whole bay was bordered by a broad band of surf                                  ;    the waves first
breaking more than             a    quarter of a mile from shore, re-formed                     in   the
foam to break and form again                         over and over before the final dash
upon the shingle.             As far      as   vision extended the            sea,    reflecting the
intense blue of the sky, was tasselled                         with feathery jets of            foam,
shooting up with constant                 change of form and position all over its
surface;        and across    it,   as   if   drawn by    a   brush dipped in brown paint,
lay the turbid           stream of the river, disappearing towards the north-
cast.      It   was seen      in    the afternoon quite distinguishable from the
rest of the water            at Portessie,       6    miles    away, where           it   hugged     the
shore, but not so closely as to prevent                        a    belt of clear water lying
within     it      Where the line of breakers crossed the river mouth, the
white colour of the waves gave place to yellow.                                As     the river shot
out the clear ripples of the sea waves ran up from the north-west,
struck the rapid-running stream of muddy fresh water, and seemed to
recoil as   if    from   a   solid obstacle      :   the whole stream was bent abruptly
towards the east, no discoloration                        of the water being perceptible
to the west          of the river mouth.        The diagram (Plate XV. fig. 3),
where the sea water            is    shown in blue and the river water in brown,
shows the manner               in which         the stream          curved,    and     hardly exag
gerates the       contrast of colour           it   presented.          The temperature        of the
river near the mouth was 48°-3,                       a   fall of 6°-9 from the              previous
afternoon;         that of the surf at the river mouth was                                51 -5, and   a
quarter of a mile west                   it    was 55°-0.          It   was matter of extreme
regret    that no observation could be make on the bay or on the east
side of the river, but no boat could face the weather.                                    The roar of
 wind and thunder of surf, the rattle of the pebbles                                along the shore,
and the periodical             crash      of the bank into the stream, were some
 times     almost      drowned by the sound of an impetuous hail-shower,
 which one moment was tearing up the sand and gravel, and the next
 sweeping over the country, followed by magnificent sunshine.

                                                 Alkalinity.
      Wo intended               to observe       the      alkalinity of numerous                 samples            of
 sea       and   river water,        and       for this purpose we had procured                                the
 necessary         standard solutions from                      Professor Dittmar.                   Practical
 difficulties prevented              the carrying out of this plan, and                           few deter
 minations          were        made.       It      is    advisable        to    mention        the     results
 obtained (Table III.), meagre though they be.  The only conclu
 sions we can draw from the consideration of them, and these we
 present with some diffidence,                      are   —
       The alkalinity (which is a measure of the potential carbonate
      1.
 of lime present) is less, for waters of the same density, than in the
 Firth of Forth.
      2.    In   water taken on different occasions                        from       the   same position
 the alkalinity           is not proportional to the density, but appears to                                    be
 liable to variation.
    3.     There are indications                    that the          alkalinity       of the water             in
 Spey Bay          is,   for the same density, greater to the east of the                                    river
 mouth — that            is,   in the direction of the fresh current.                        This      may be
 due to the carbonate               of lime carried              down in solution by the                 fresh
 water.
    4.     There are no             distinct        indications of          a        uniform     change         of
alkalinity with depth, although surface water                                   is   more alkaline than
 that at the bottom, even when the density of the former                                        is   less.
   In Table         III.       alkalinity      is   represented           by the number of milli
grammes           of carbonic       (C02) existing in normal carbonates
                                        acid
(R"COg)          in one litre of water.  Thus,     sample had alkalinity
                                                                     if a
50'00,      it   contained 50 milligrammes of carbonic acid in combina
tion with lime or with some other                             base,    equivalent to           113-7    milli
grammes of normal calcium                      carbonate (CaC03),
                                  Temperature             of   the    Water.
   The temperature               of the water in the bay was lower than                                in     the
river.       The water at the bottom was colder than at the surface,                                         the
difference being about 3°, where the depth was 10 fathoms.  Full
particulars of the observations are given under VIII., IXa., X.,
XL,    and of those along the shore under                            XII., XIII., XIV.
  The temperature                of the river was observed                      once     or twice daily

when it was possible          for this to       be  done.    Table     IV. shows        the
result of the observations,       which    are   unfortunately very fragmentary.
The rise of temperature          between       the hours 10 and          18 was found
                   s
to be about      2   as an average.        For     the month the        variation      may
be    described    as  a   gradual      fall    of temperature       with      a   sudden
depression     on the   1 3th — the    day of heavy spate already alluded to
— from which       there was a partial recovery.
                                     Conclusion.
    The importance       to engineers of a knowledge of the relationship
between     salt and fresh water at the mouths               of rivers is generally
allowed   ;  and much information            regarding the variations of salinity
in  estuaries with tide and depth doubtless               exists   in the note-books
of marine      surveyors,    but  so  far   as we     know, no definite investiga
tion of the matter has been published.                 Since our work was             done
 without knowing the volume and velocity of the fresh water                        stream,
there is a want of that quantitative element                 which gives precision
to an engineering survey.            The two objects         are,   in   fact,   distinct;
but so much can be done by each, that it would form a                             definite
advance     in our knowledge of the circulation of water in the world
if  a  conjoint study of the physical properties of              a series      of typical
 rivers and firths could be made simultaneously by a chemist                           and
 engineer,    somewhat      on the lines of         Mr B. W. Peregrine             Birch's
 work on the Thames,* but in                 a   more complete       and satisfactory
 manner.
    A   quantitative analysis of the soluble mineral constituents in                    the
 Spey river water      is at present      being carried out by one of us, with
 the view of ascertaining the influence of the river                     water on       the
 ratio to each other of the principal components                  of  the    salt in    the
 sea water near the estuary.
    Our work on the Spey corroborates the observations of                       engineers
on the water at the mouth of tidal rivers,               and shows more precisely
 than has to our knowledge previously been                  done,     in this country
at least,   how    sea  and river water         meet and mingle.           We     are also
able to divide river estuaries into at least three classes, the condi
tions of all these being perfectly distinct

     1. Rivers without           Firths, such              as    the Spey.         — In such rivers the
water inside the bar is entirely fresh during the greater part of ebb
tide, since        all the      sea     water which              forces           its way up the short
estuary during flood-tide runs out again                              along the bottom, and does
not at any time render the surface                                  layers braokish.           The fresh
water, running out at             all   states          of the tide, spreads over the surface
of the sea, and persists              in     a    thin layer or in                patches to a consider
able distance,       overlying water of uniformly high salinity.                                The con
ditions as to temperature                    are      not fully known, but except during
certain periods in spring and autumn, the river water is either much
warmer or much oolder than that of the                                sea.
     2. Rivers with narrow, shallow                       Firths,      such as the Tay. — The bar
lies out at sea, where                the water is always salt                        The tide exerts     a
great    influence throughout                     the     estuary, the sea water being only
partly       withdrawn       by the ebb; and the currents, setting up and
down with great              velocity,           effect    a tumultuous               though transitory
mixing of the water.                  During ebb-tide the water inside the bar is
comparatively fresh at the surface, and the ridgo it has to pass over
in reaching the sea directs                  it out over the                surface    of the salt water
in a brackish layer, like               a    river of the first class.                 The temperature
relations are not well known, but appear to bo similar to those of
estuaries of the third class. The range     however, greater, and           is,
variations more irregular.
     3. Rivers       with wide and deep Firths, such as the Forth.                                 — Hero
the sea water        is   never withdrawn from the estuary by the tide, and
the tidal currents are less rapid than in rivers of the second class.
The landward portion (the "river proper compartment" of engineers)
iscomparable to     river of the first class, but the conditions are
                            a
much less distinctly              defined.               Further       seaward         comes   a   division
         "   tidal compartment                     resembling an estuary                 of the second
(the                                         ")
class, without        a   bar, but exhibiting                   all its other characteristics in          a
modified degree.             Finally,        nearest          the    sea,    and comprising most of
the firth, there       is    the region specially characteristic of this                           kind of
river entrance.             The       difference           of density between surface                  and
bottom       is   slight, and    it     is   scarcely         affected        by the tides ;    the water
throughout its whole mass                        is   slightly freshened,             and so meets the
true sea water beyond                   as       a    great     wall        of only slightly       reduced
salinity.         The curve representing the salinity of the surface water                               is

484                     Proceedings          of the Royal Society
very nearly constant           ;  floods     affect  it slightly, but uniformly.               It
shows that in the "river proper" and                     "tidal"  compartments           there
is rapid increase of density per mile of length, and much influence
by tide  ;  while,     as the    firth is entered on, the increase of density                per
mile becomes less and less, and the tidal disturbance vanishes.
    The temperature         rises steadily from the river out to sea in winter,
and the bottom water                 is warmer than that at the              surface      ;   in
summer the temperature                 rises from the sea towards the river, and
 the surface water is warmer than that below.                     The annual       range of
temperature      in   the water is greater the further up the river observa
tions are made, but the mean temperature                      appears to be nearly the
same everywhere.
                                            Summary.
    The Spey, the most rapid river in Britain, is 120 miles long, and
drains 1245 square miles.                  It flows into the Moray Firth — a bight
 of the North Sea — at Garmouth                  ; the river entrance is shallow,            and
 subject to change of form and position by shifting banks.
    Observations on the effect of tide on the mixing of                   sea    and river
 water inside the bar are described.                 The exact vertical distribution
 of salinity was investigated by means of the hydrometer at intervals
 during the rise and fall of the tide, and the results are embodied in
 tables, diagrams,       and curves.          They show that the      sea water        slowly
 forces its way like a wedge between the river water and the bottom
 as the tide rises, and dams back the water further up stream                        ;  while
 the surface     water    always remains quite fresh, and              a brackish           zone
 separates the two strata.               When the ebb sets in the salt water                runs
 out very rapidily,         and before          half-ebb there     is only fresh        water
 inside the bar.
    The salinity of the water in Spey Bay was studied during                              short
 trips in fishing-boats from Garmouth                     and Port Gordon,           and by
 observations made along the shore.                   These are fully recorded.              The
 bottom water of the bay was found to be of the density                             1 -02567
 on an average      ;   the surface water varied much              in density    ;  and the
 river's course could        be traced as a stream          sweeping to the north-east.
 The western margin of this stream was sharply defined                     ;  on the         east
 no abrupt change          can be found, the river water             gradually merging
 into the   sea.    During         a spate      the  discoloration of the river          water

enables its progress               through the Firth to be traced                             as a dark band
to a     distance of more than                   6 miles.         The shore water appears to be
freshened          by water percolating through the shingle beaches from
the river.
     Alkalinity and temperature observations                                     are described         and dis
cussed.
     In conclusion,           a classification of river entrances                         into three groups
is put      forward tentatively.                     The Spey typifies             a large      river entering
a    tidal sea directly across               a   bar      ; the   Tay,    a large        river, entering by
a    short,     narrow, shallow, barred                      estuary     ;   and the Forth,             a   small
river, merging into a long, wide, deep, and open firth.
      7.    The Distribution and Significance of Micro-Organisms
                         in Water.                   By A. Wynter Blyth.
     The results         of more than                 a year's     study of the distribution                   of
micro-organisms,              that    is,   bacteria and fungi in water, are                     I    think of
sufficient interest to           justify         a   short communication.
     Methods.— The micro-organisms in Water being for the most part
in    the form of isolated            spores or seeds so small                     as    to be practically
invisible,         the first step           was       to make          them       visible       by
                                                                                                      " cultiva
tion."        This cultivation took place in nutrient gelatin, according to
principles too well known to require description.                                       I     will, therefore,
confine my remarks merely to the details                                 of certain special             modifi
cations of the ordinary process which                             I   adopt.
     The cultivation takes place on glass plates                             4   inches x       4    inches; on
to these plates are cemented                     glass rings      J    inch broad,       \     inch deep, and
3-8 inches         in diameter, thus forming large shallow cells.                                The method
of    cementing the rings on to the plates                         is    novel    ;     both are sterilised
at   a   high temperature            in     a   hot-air oven, and while still hot drops
of    the   nutrient gelatin are placed on the ground surface of the ring,
the ring      is   then applied to the plate, rotated, and put under                                   a    dust-
proof shade to cool and set.
     The water to be examined                        is   weighed in         a   special      form of drop-
bottle      (see fig.   1).    A     drop       is   then dropped on the plate by the aid of
the      pipette    stopper,       and the bottle reweighed                        so    as    to obtain by

difference         the weight          of    the drop.              The nutrient gelatin is                     melted
at a gentle heat in a                  Lister      flask, and sufficient poured                       into the cell
so as to mix with the drop of water and                                       to    form        a layer         of   one-
                                   tenth of an inch deep.                      The glass cell thus                    pre
                                   pared is placed                 in   a special     glass shade or cham
                                   ber,      the air of            which      is     kept        saturated           with
                                   moisture.               After from         three        to    five days,           the
                                   colonies        developed             are counted            by the aid of            a
                                  lens.          To facilitate the enumeration,                            the plates

        Sewage. —   I      found    it     practically impossible to make                         a    quantitative
determination of the micro-organisms in sewage unless                                                   the liquid
was very much diluted.                           A convenient dilution                is   1    c.c. of sewage          to
a   litre of sterilised water.                    Drops of this dilute sewage, weighing                              from
40 to 50 milligrams, and added to nutrient gelatin, yield, after                                                 a    few
days' cultivation, from 100                           to 200 colonies         — numbers               the counting
of which present                  no difficulty, and                a    simple calculation gives                     the

   It  is therefore evident that the sewage is considerably influenced
by   season,   containing   more   in the summer    than in the winter
season, but for the most always yielding colonies approaching to or

   488                     Proceedings       of the Royal Society
   above a million per gramme.               The colonies are of all kinds of fungi,
   more especially aspergilli, bacteria,            bacilli, and microccoci.
      Pond Water and          open   Wells. — A typical open pond which received
   no drainage,      and    was frequented         by ducks        and   geese,    contained
   water which yielded to cultivation                3534    colonies     to the gramme          ;
   465    of these were         bacilli    liquefying     the     gelatin, and 47         were
   bacteria,   agreeing in general characters           with Bacterium termo.
      An     open well in Devonshire                gave    the    following       analytical

  total solids, 32 -5.         The    ordinary      microscopical examination              de
  tected    epithelial    cells,   vegetable     debris,    and    moving animalcules          ;
  35 mgrs.       of   the   water    yielded to cultivation           330   centres,     4   of
  which      slowly liquefied the          gelatin.    This     is   equal   to 9428       per
  gramme.
      Canal Water. — The Regent's                Canal, in its course         through      the
  Metropolis, has been for years little better than                a stagnant ditch, and
  the composition of its waters approximates                  to that   of dilute    sewage.
  A   sample, taken a foot below the surface, gave                     colonies equal       to
  32,352 per gramme         ;  whilst, just above the mud, another sample                gave
  521,739 per gramme.
     River Water. — The water of a stream with an appreciable velocity
 shows the same general              fact, viz., more      micro-organisms          near the
 bottom than the surface; e.g., samples                  taken from the Thames              at
 Sunbury just opposite the intake of the water companies, yielded                           to
 cultivation the following figures :—
         Near the surface,                                          11,050 per grm.
         Close to the bottom                                        59,800      ,,
 In  the same locality a second sample, taken above some black mud,
yielded colonies equal in number to 6,430,000 per gramme.
    It  thus appears        that in canals         and   rivers the bacteria          slowly
subside,     probably by adhering to the mineral and organic substances
which are continually             sinking.      That the richness         of the bottom
layer in bacteria        is intimately connected           with the precipitation           of
particles,     is   evident     from    the     following      experiment     : —A      wide
upright glass vessel       2 feet 5 inches      in height was filled with sterilised

     Sea Water. — In           the    sea       water    around the         English    coast, the
water at or near the            surface          seems to be uniformly richer than at
deeper depths.
     A   sample of sea water, taken off the old Pier at Brighton in                               July,
gave      thea following         results        : — Surface,      50     mgrms.     yielded         843
centres — that         is,   16,860     per       gramme; while           a   sample    from        the
bottom only yielded 230 per gramme.
  A      sample of sea water, taken                 from the surface of the Yarmouth
coast      in September,         gave           14,887    per    gramme.        Dr Vacher of
Birkenhead kindly supplied me with samples of                                 sea   water,        taken
from the surface and at the depth                       of 20 fathoms off Holyhead, and
the number           of colonies       at the surface            gave   a   very    similar result
while     the deep sea sample           yielded comparatively few centres.*
      Cultivation     of   ordinary     Drinking           Water.     — For   some time past        I
have made cultivations of all waters analysed by me in my capacity
of   a   public analyst, and have now                    sufficient     experience to       justify   a
judgment        as    to the    utility         and limits      of the method.         A         public
water supply, derived from flowing rivers, or from any surface water,
varies as to      its composition           according       to season, the more especially
as the     water has     a    winter character due chiefly to winter rains, and
summer         character      due chiefly          to the summer            drought.        It    hence
follows that      a   standard       of purity, which does not take into account
natural     seasonal variations,          cannot bo correct.
      The water supplied to London by the West Middlesex and Grand
 Junction Companies            is    analysed       by me month by month, and since
 April have also been                submitted to cultivation.                  The    analytical
 results, and the        number of organisms                    per gramme, are detailed             in
                                regret entirely lost my notes of the numbers, but as
  *
      I   have to my great
 stated, the general facts      agreed with the experiments on the shallower waters
 nearer the coast.

cultivations were made daily from                                July         1884 to March 1885.                 The
mean of the numbers of colonies                                 raised        from unfiltered river water
(Stralauer Works) was 1435 per gramme, the maximun being in
October 3251, the minimum in February 685. Filtration altered the
¦water         very considerably, the mean of the filtered water being 107
(maximun 277, and minimun 21).
  Lake water (Tegcler Works) when unfiltered gave                                              a mean       for    the
nine months of 441, the maximum                                            890       falling   in March,           the
minimum in August.                                The mean number of colonies in the filtered
lake water was 51, and the extremes were 14 and 121.
        It    is therefore              clear    that the filtered Berlin river water                     is,   so far
as bacterial                   life    goes, purer than          the     filtered London             river water,
the mean                   number of colonies                   per     gramme         being for the West

        With          regard            to    other waters,     I       give in the following                   tables
examples                  of        good,     indifferent, and          polluted waters,             from       which
I   think            it        may       be     concluded       that,      irrespective        of the        special
kind of micro-organism                               in     a   water,         any    number         of     colonies
which           exceed                1000      per gramme       is    indicative of considerable                  im
purity.
        Summary. — To briefly sum up the facts already detailed —
  (1) Impure liquids, such as sewage, pond and canal waters contain
hundreds of thousands or even millions of micro-organisms per
gramme.
        (2)    In         canals and rivers the number of micro-organisms at or near
the bottom,                    is   greater than at or near the surface.
    (3)        In         sea       water the conditions                are    reversed,       the   number         of
organisms                 being greater at or near the surface.
    (4)
              A      good water should not contain more than 1000 colonies                                          of
micro-organisms                        in every gramme,         f

         My numbers                         have been hitherto in excess of the
one or two other              working at this subject.
                                      observers             always cultivate the       I
water twenty -four hours after collection, during which period of rest there may
be some considerable increase, especially in summer.

         South Foreland           Lighthouse by the Trinity House                       of
         London, on Lighthouse               Illuminants,        &c.     By Thomas
         Stevenson,       Pres. K.S.E., M.Inst.C.E.
   A   very important inquiry        — suggested by Mr Chamberlain when
President of the        Board of Trade — has just been concluded by the
Trinity House of London into            the relative merits of electricity, gas,
and oil, as lighthouse illuminants,            on which      I  think it  advisable to
make     a  few remarks,       as the general        results    of the   investigation
ought to possess a certain amount of interest                for this Society.
    Mr Wigham,        gas engineer,   Dublin,       has long taken a great interest
in the best means of increasing          the power of our sea lights by means
of gas and        large   burners.    So    far    back    as 1865 he proposed to
increase    the diameter      of gas burners to        7  inches;    and in   1868,  the
Scotch     Lighthouse        Board was asked by the              Board   of Trade      to
investigate      the   subject.     Certain       experiments were         accordingly
made at Granton            in that and    the      following     year.   In   1869   the
engineers    of the Northern Lighthouse Board reported                  in  the follow
ing terms, on the results of the experiments                  which had been       made
on the employment of large burners              : —
    " It  has   been found that the second             series of experiments      so far
corroborated       those    previously made       as   to leave   no room    for  doubt
that the gas light when used with an annular lens, notwithstanding
the   greater size of the flame, was not superior to the effect of                   the
smaller flame of the mechanical lamp, the explanation                       being that
the greater portion of the large-sized             7-inch gas flame, consisting        of
52 jets, is ex-focal,       and is therefore       lost, so that with the lens        no
advantage      is   gained    by increasing       the size     of the flame     beyond
certain limits, and these seem to be pretty nearly attained in                       the
ordinary     4 -wick     lamps.     So   apparent        was    this, that with Mr
Wigham's concurrence,          it was agreed to give up the idea of experi
menting on        the gas burner       in its     present    form as applicable        to

                            of Edinburgh, Session 1885-86.                                 495
revolving lights, and to confine the experiments to its use for fixed
lights, in which, owing to the light heing distributed equally over
the horizon by the cylindric                 refractor,    some advantage       is gained by
the employment of the larger flame                      of the gas."      And     the Report
concludes           as  follows : — " We       have     to point    out that the experi
ments made, have                been highly        valuable in showing the            limit  to
which the size of a radiant may with advantage                         be increased      when
used        in     the   focus of       the   apparatus       now employed          in   light-
              '"
 Louses.
      Mr Wigham, with             great perseverance,         nevertheless    continued his
 labours         in improving        his large burners,         and in producing           new
 burners         of still larger     sizes.    He also introduced several of these
 large-sized          burners into        the   same      lantern,   in connection with
 Fresnel's 1st order lenses, so             that from the same lantern he exhibited,
 under the name of biform, triform, and quadriform, two, three, and
 four burners, with a like number of Fresnol louses,                           arranged     one
 above       another.
      The employment of this multiple system of lights in the same
  lantern        was, on the recommendation                of  Mr Wigham,        adopted     by
  the    Irish Lighthouse Board,             at Galley Head, in the county of Cork,
  in 1878.           One     important advantage           of this multiple system was
  the power of lighting or extinguishing one or more of these burners,
  according          to   the   greater    or less     amount of haze         or fog in the
  atmosphere.
      The Trinity House erected three experimental towers placed along
   side each other at the           South Foreland Lighthouse, near Dover, and
   the   photometric experiments were carried out by Mr Harold Dixon,
   M.A., of Balliol College, Oxford, while the officials of the Northern
   Lighthouse and Irish Lighthouse                     Boards were kindly          invited to
   attend the         experiments from time to time,                as  well   as  Mr A.     G.
    Vernon Harcourt for the Board of Trade.
       The conclusions which the Trinity House have arrived at are the
    following,       and    I may state, that       in   so far as my opportunities           of
    observation have           enabled    me to form an opinion,          I  fully concur in
    their   judgment : —
        1.   "That the electric light            as  exhibited at South Foreland has
    proved to be the most powerful               light under all conditions of         weather,
     and to have the greatest           penetrative power in fog."

 496                     Proceedings of tlie Royal Society
     2.
          " That for all practical purposes the gas light,             as exemplified
 by Mr Wigham's multiform system, and the oil light,                    as exemplified
 by     the    Trinity    House       Douglass    6-wick   burners,      in multiform
 arrangement       up to triform when shown through revolving lenses                    are
 equal, light for light,        in all conditions of weather; but that           quadri-
 forni gas is     a little better than triform oiL"
     3.
          " That when shown through fixed lenses,                as   arranged in the
 experimental towers,            the superiority     of the super-posed       gas light
 is unquestionable.           The larger      diameter  of the gas flames, and          the
 lights being much nearer to each other in the gas lantern, give                        the
 beam a more compact and intense appearance than that issuing from
 the more widely separated oil burners."
     4.   "That for lighthouse illumination              with gas,      the   Douglass
 patent gas burners are much more efficient               and economical       than the
 Wigham gas burners."
     5.
          " That for     the ordinary necessities of lighthouse illumination,
 mineral oil is the most suitable and economical              illuminant, and         that
 for salient headlands,          important landfalls, and places where            a very
 powerful light is required, electricity offers the greatest advantages."
     There were employed           during these experiments        a  variety of   forms
 of   photometer,      but the most important was the Pentane                  standard
 photometer,        the    invention     of   Mr Vernon Harcourt, which                was
 recommended          to the Board of Trade, as giving            the most uniform
 standard of comparison,            by Professors Williamson         and Odling, and
 Mr Livesey of London              ;  while for outdoor observation, there            was
 used a     liquid  photometer,       consisting of   a water-tight telescope,      filled
 with    a partially opaque fluid, supplied to the telescope from a small
 cistern fixed above, so that           as  the eyepiece is moved out or in, the
length of the fluid through which the light has to pass increases                        or
diminishes, and the length of the fluid through which the light                          so
passes, is recorded          by an attached       graduated  scale.       This  form of
photometer was first proposed               by me in the Edinburgh          New Phil.
Journal in       1863, and has since been employed            in numerous        experi
ments on lighthouse apparatus              at Edinburgh.
    The South Foreland               experiments extended        over a period           of
twelve months, and many interesting observations                 were made, besides
those which related          to the questions which were the more immediate
cause of the investigations being instituted.

                            of Edinburgh, Session 1885-86.                             497
    Electric. Light. — The mean               candle power of the electric arc given
by one of De Meriten's machines,                     in  a lamp with 40 mm. carbons,
was found by Messrs              Dixon and Harcourt           to be 10,000 candles.      It
was found that            the core carbons        gave a better result than the solid
carbons ; also that two machines coupled do not give double the light
of one     ;   this result, according to the report of Professor Grylls Adams
of Cambridge,            was however due to the electric energy                 being ex
pended        in heating      some of the
                                                 " leads,"   which were of too small
size.      A     considerable      waste     was also due to the regulator of the
lamp.
    Gas       Burners.    — The       "Wigham      gas    burners experimented with
varied       from      108   jets    down     to   28   jets, and from 2300 to 250
candle     power     ;  while the Douglass Argand gas burners varied from
6 to     10 rings, and their powers               varied from 825 candle         power to
2500.
    Oil Burners.        — The 6-wick Douglass oil burner              was found to give
730     candle       power,      while     another of       similar   construction    with
9  wicks gave 1785 candle power.
   These        results    show how successfully the effectiveness               of light
house     burners has been lately increased                 through the efforts of Mr
Wigham and           Sir James Douglass.
    Variations in the Transparency of the Atmosphere. — Very remark
able variations in the transparency                 of the atmosphere were found to
occur    in   the course       of the observations,        without any haze or fog or
cloud    being visible to the           eye.    Sometimes       the experimental lights
suffered      a loss   of  \  to J   of their power, when inspected         at a distance
of a   mile and      a  quarter    ;  while the French lights on the othorsido of
the    Channel, 25 and 30 miles distant, continued to show with
 their usual steadiness          and brilliancy       without any variation.
    The lenses employed               in connection with          the burners, which     I
 have described         were    of two forms :—
    1.   The Mew Island lens, which                   is an ordinary Fresnel lens of
the   first order, 920 mm. focal distance.
    2.   The type employed at the New Eddystone Lighthouse, having
 the same      focal distance,        but with the addition of flint glass prisms
 above    and below the central lens, so as to intercept a larger number
 of rays   coming from the burner.
    So far as the        experiments at the South Foreland               dealt with the
    VOL    XIII.                                                              2 L

498                 Proceedings     of   the  Royal Society
optical instruments and burners submitted                for trial, they        may be
held   as conclusive and exhaustive.           But in     the experiments made
in Edinburgh in 1869, it was pointed out to Mr Wigham, as                       a result
of these experiments, that when his 52 gas jet burner (7 inches in
diameter),     was employed in combination with lenses suited for
utilising the light from a flame of the diameter                 adopted originally
 by Fresnel, the effectiveness         of this larger      flame     was to a great
 extent lost,  as  much of the light was ex-focal, thus escaping conden
 sation   by the Fresnel lens.        It  was not, however,         until  a compara
 tively   recent  date,   that the matter       of larger       burners again      came
 before    Messrs Stevenson,      as   a   question requiring          settlement      in
 practical lighthouse optics, when the Northern                  Lighthouse Board
 resolved   to increase the size of the burners in a first order light in
 the service.
     Provision had therefore to be made for utilising, as far             as possible,
 the light from this increased      size of burner, and in doing so              it   was
 decided,   on the suggestion      of   Mr Alan Brebner,           to test by actual
 trial whether Messrs Stevenson            had been right in reporting               that
 Fresnel's proportion insured the            best   results,    and should not         be
  violated.
     An experimental       lens  in that proportion,           suited   for   a 6-wick
  burner, was constructed      and   tried at the South Foreland, the               focal
  distance of the lens being increased,            while the holophotal          system
  which   I proposed    in 1850, with totally reflecting prisms              concentric
  with the refracting portion of the apparatus, was also adopted.
     The lens    as  designed    has a focal distance           of 1330     mm., and
  has two reflecting prisms above          and    below the refracting          portion,
  the whole subtending an angle of 60° horizontally                 and   of  70° verti
  cally.
     A   panel of this design renders unnecessary            the use of special flint
  glass refractors,  such as are employed          in  the New, Eddystone appa
  ratus, and also prevents      the loss of      light   due to the square form
  of the Fresnel lens.
      After the experiments on electricity, gas, and oil were                 concluded
  at the South Foreland, this lens,         before    being used in the Northern
  Lighthouse service, was kindly allowed to              be tested    by  comparative
  trials.   This  was done by     Sir James Douglas and Mr D.                 A  Steven
  son by comparing the depths of the shadows               thrown by the        different

    The following        conclusions from these photometrical trials seem
warranted : —
    1.   That  a single large      burner    shown in       a    complete      panel of a
revolving apparatus composed of the new lens, with totally reflecting
top and bottom prisms of corresponding size                     added, would          give a
more      intense light       than   burners      and    ordinary        Fresnel     lenses,
arranged as biform and equal to triform.
    2.   That the consumpt of oil or gas would be                a  i, J,   and  \   of that
of biform, triform, or quadriform arrangements                   respectively.
    3.   That the new lens apparatus          would avoid all the disadvantages
of superposed         lenses,   including    excessive     heat     in    the  lightroom,
difficulty of management           of the burners,     and obstruction of light by
the necessary       ventilating tubes.
    The practical result is obvious, that for lighthouse purposes,                        on
the    grounds of superior illuminating              power,    economy        and    ease  of
 management, the principle of increasing the diameter of the apparatus
 in proportion to the size        of the burner, is superior to that of super
 posing lenses      and burners ; in a word, that the new lens apparatus
 is superior to the biform, triform, and quadriform arrangements.
    The trials at the South Foreland               were   made      with     apparatus     in
 existence at the time when the experiments were                        instituted, and     I
  have since proposed        to take advantage      of the natural properties of the

500                           Proceedings          of the Royal Society
electric light, by adapting to it more fully the condensing system,
now largely employed on the Scottish coast, both for flashing and
fixed lights.             This    system     has been            employed for the new electric
group flashing light for the Isle of May, in connection also with                                                     a
mode which            I   proposed        of dipping the                 rays    below the horizon on
the occurrence              of haze or fog, so as at such times to increase                                     the
power of the light at short distances                                    from the lighthouse, where
alone     it   is   likely   to be seen       in   such states of the atmosphere.
     In   the apparatus             experimented        with at the South Foreland by the
Trinity House,              the condensing principle                      was also applied, but to a
very small extent, viz., the condensation of 30° into                                           5° or 6 times,
while in the Isle of May apparatus                               the light            proceeding from           45°
is condensed into              3° or 15 times,         and the emergent                     beam admits of
being dipped to any extent which may be found necessary during                                                 fogs.
     The peculiar property of this azimuthal condensing arrangement
is that, where              the  light is intermittent, the power is increased in
proportion to the             intervening periods of darkness.  Thus, neglecting
the loss of light by absorption                     &c,      the         power        is doubled when the
periods of light               and       darkness      are       equal,         trebled     when the dark
periods are made twice as long as the light, and so on                                          in   proportion,
while in every               case      the rays are spread                 uniformly over each illu
minated sector.

     Whether     specially mentioned or not, all the measurements                       were
 made by the stephanome.                 Up    to and including        that on July        3,
 1885, the sliding         rings  (lj-inch and 8-inch)           were used;      after that
the sliding bar with points on it.
    The measurements          made with the bar are considerably more accu
rate than those with the rings, the bar being more easily handled,
and    the points capable         of more accurate adjustment to the                 object
observed.

3.    On a Model of the "                   Half -Twist Surface."                        By Professor
                               Crura Brown.              (Plate      XVII.)
     The     " twist surfaces," of which this is                     a case, stand            in   the same
relation          to    the helicoid       surface       as the anchor-ring                   does to the
cylinder.              In the helicoid the generating line,                     at right           angles    to
the axis, rotates              about the axis as the point of intersection moves
along it.              In the twist       surfaces    the generating line is always at
right angles             to a fixed circle, and rotates about the tangent to the
circle at the point of intersection,                  as the    point of intersection moves
round the circle.              .   The species       of twist surface             is defined by the
ratio of the angular motion of the generating lino to that of the
point of intersection.                   In the particular            case      illustrated            by the
model, the generating line turns through two                            right         angles,      while the
point of intersection makes one whole revolution                                  ;    that     is,    the rate
of angular             motion of the generating line               is   one-half of that of the
point of intersection.
   The idea of making such     model was derived from the " one
                                              a

together          the ends of       a    strip of paper, after giving                   it    half     a   turn
about       its    axis.    Such     a   strip has only one side and only one edge,
or, perhaps more               accurately, its two sides are continuous, and its
two edges are continuous.                    If   such   a   strip    is   very narrow, and
                                                                                                           if
                                                                                                           it

as   a    portion of       a   " half-twist"      surface.        Without entering into any
detailed          mathematical          discussion       of the surface,               there       are some
points of interest which may be indicated.                            A      straight line passing
through the centre                 of the circle and at right angles to its plane,
obviously lies wholly in the surface, as every generating line cuts
it       We may call this line the axis of                      the     surface.           Every plane
through this axis contains two generating lines                               ;       the intersections
of   these pairs of generating lines lie                  in   a   straight line touching the

                                            ^
fore intersects itself in this straight line.             It is obvious that the
surface has

                                            " as for each sense in which the
point of intersection may rotate, there are two senses in which the
generating line may rotate.            This gives four forms, which obviously
coincide in pairs.

by unkissing        at   P,  we form another        plurifil knot of n       - 1   crossings.
This proves
    Theorem        K. — If    we   unite the bifilar knot K,+2 at its bifilar
2-gon     PK      to the unifilar       L„_, by its odd          2-gon   PK, we construct
an unifilar Mn of n crossings,                which yields by unkissing at              P   and
at R two plurifil knots           each of n     — 1
                                                     crossings.
    9.   It  is evident from the above reasoning that in the construction
of M. which         has a linear section       PR,    at which by unkissing two uni-
filars of n      -  1  crossings   can be got, we are          in every    case to use one
of the Theorems E, F, G, H, in articles                 3, 4, 5, 6 ; and that these are
both    necessary and sufficient rules.              By them         we can form all the
required unsolid knots M„ without omission or repetition.
    We have only            to lay    e  upon    n-e,     i.e.   K,+a   upon Ln_„ where
e +   2 > n - e,    beginning at e = 2.
    In   forming the unsolid knots (M12) which                     I  herewith present to
Professor Tait,         I  have begun with e = 4 ; i.e.,             I have laid   4 upon 8,
and     5  upon     7.     For not only is the number of figures for                e = 2 and
e = 3 enormous,          but  I am    sure that they would be of no service                    to
 Professor Tait, in his rapid handling of his twists.                      Nor    am  I at    all
 sanguine in the hope that these results for                   e = 4 and   e — 5   will   assist
 him    except by furnishing           a ready mode of verifying the most com
 plex work of his grouping of the                11    folds with which         I  have      had
 the honour to supply him.                I have    for myself never attempted this
 task of grouping the twisted knots of eight or more crossings, as this
 problem appears to me of less consequence than an accurate                             census
 of the knots with          a description of their symmetry.
    10.    I should      have remarked       in my      paper      "On the Twists, &c,"
 that a complementary pair of ra-fold unsolids will give only one
 couple     of convertible     (n
                                   —
                                      1) folds,    if  each of the pair has         P  and     R
 alike, which can be only when                a  zonal trace passes between P and
 R.     And     I  was    in error in saying that "         every 9-fold so got from           P
 and   R alike is      a 9-fold having       a  triangular section         at which      it  can
 be twisted into its reflected image."             The truth is that every n— 1-fold
 got from       P and R alike on the knot M„ whether M.                          has or has
 not a complementary,               is   a  knot which          has a triangular       section
 at which       it  can be twisted         either into itself or into its reflected
 image.
     I believe     that no M12 that        I   have drawn, which has no comple

  520                      Proceedings       of the Royal Society
  mentary about the section              PR,     has   P   and    R alike    ;  and that such
  drawn M„ will always give              a  pair of mutually convertibles.
      11. Every K,+2 imposed               on    L„_, in    the    (M.)   above     constructed
  is supposed         to be either a subsolid defined               in page 283 of         T rans.
  R.S.E., vol. xxxii. part 2; or                  such    a subsolid carrying a plural
  flap, of which neither          P nor R      is a crossing.
      In laying        4 on 8,  I   have    never     laid 2'2 on       8 ;  nor have      I  laid
  2-3 nor 3-2          on  6  (vide,   for this kind of operation,                 the   memoir
 above cited)       ;   and this for the reason given in art. 9.
      12. The number of unsolid knots (M12), a portion of U12 (see my
 paper    "On the Twists, &c"), which I herewith offer, is 577, of
 which     199 are bifilars and 378                unifilars.      They are few in com
 parison of the entire          U12.     As   they    will  be   useful,  if ever the 12-fold
 knots    are    wanted,       it  is  worth the while to give                 a  summary of
 them,    which will,         to a student working                on   this subject,       be of
 almost as much service as the 577 engraved figures.                           The references
 to 7A, &c.   ;    8A,    &c, are to knots nearly all engraved               in my plates in

        Every one  ?/!12  of these 577 knots gives by unkissing at                        P    and
R of its linear        section    PR    two unifilar 11-folds which,              if the knot
m12
      has no complementary about                PR,    can be twisted either one into
the other, and which,          if   ml2 has a complementary, are two knots                        in
 a  group     of mutually convertibles,           if   I  rightly conceive        the matter.
 But not every two in         a   group can be twisted each into the other by
 a  single twist.         When       mv, has       a   complementary,           two   pairs of
 unifilar 11-folds       are thereby given, each pair being two knots con
 vertible into each other by              a single      twist, and both pairs,          if   I  am
 not in this point mistaken, belonging to the same group.
    When mv, has a complementary about PR, it stands drawn next
 to  m12   among the 577 figures herewith presented.
    I  have had       no difficulty in the cases            1    and   2   of art. 1, because
 I  have    the bifilars of       8  and     9   crossings.        As    the bifilars     of ten
 crossings     are not before the student, he may find                     it useful to know
 how to lay        2   of the      unifilar    K„+2 on       the     bifilar L12.j, without
 drawing the bifilar         10-  folds, and by inspection only of the unifilar
 9-folds.      The rule is this: — Make every odd angle at the crossing
 P of    an unifilar      9-fold covertical with the figure                  Tab, abR      ;   i.e.,
 with two triangles collateral with the 2-gon                         ab and having          their
 third    angles   at    P and R in          the    constructed linear section                 PR.
 Every result of laying an even 2-gon on                     a   bifilar 2-gon of a 10-fold
 is thus obtained.          The proof of this is easy by my theorems                      A    and
 C given recently in these Proceedings,                     applied to the figure Tab
 ab\\ on the      12-fold completed            by it.       By similar       devices    the     use
 of bifilar bases and charges              can always be evaded in our construc
tions.

5.   Experiments         on the    Field of a Helmholtz Tangent Gal
         vanometer.         By R. Ellis, C.E.          ; R. D. Clarkson          ;  and
         H. Rainy, M.A.          (Plate      XVIII.)
    The object of the following experiments, which were suggested
by    Professor    Chrystal, was to determine the relative values of the
intensity of the horizontal        component of magnetic force, due to                  a
current    flowing in the coils of the Helmholtz galvanometer, for                   dif
ferent parts of its field.
    The experiments were conducted            as  follows  : —A    sheet of ground
glass was carefully ruled       into squares, whose sides were            1  cm. long,
and    it was    placed   horizontally    within the coils of the Helmholtz
galvanometer.         On it stood   a sensitive reflecting galvanometer,             the
horizontal plane of the centre of the mirror containing,                 as nearly as
possible,    the axis of the coils of the Helmholtz           galvanometer.         The
position of the sensitive galvanometer with reference                 to    the centre
of the    Helmholtz field could         be readily obtained by means              of the
graduated      glass plate.
    For the first experiment      the sensitive galvanometer was placed                in
 the centre of the field, when a current was split and the two parts
sent    in opposite directions through           the coils of the sensitive gal
 vanometer       and of the     Helmholtz       respectively   ;  resistances      being
 added to the former circuit       until no deflection of the needle took
 place.      The resistance    of the whole circuit of the sensitive                 gal
 vanometer was then determined            ;  after which     the experiment          was
 repeated to guard against any accidental error.                The sensitive gal
 vanometer     was then removed to the next point of the field which
 was    to be tested,     and the same process repeated            ;  when      the   in
 tensity at      that   point (that at the centre being taken as unity)
 was obtained by dividing the former by the latter resistance.
    The     error in placing     the sensitive galvanometer              was     within
  ± 1 mm. at      any part of the field    ; the error in the graduation of the
 glass plate was less than         1   per cent.      A  very slight alteration of
 the resistance     inserted in the circuit — less than -0001 of the total —
  produced a very considerable deflection.
     No perceptible error was introduced           if the axes of the two instru

merits were slightly inclined to each other, instead of being exactly
parallel          If    the axes of the instruments                              made      with each other
an angle     of tan"1 1/6               [i.e.,       tan~1l-6 = 9°              28'], scarcely any differ
ence was perceptible               in the readings from                        those taken       with    the axes
parallel;    a marked difference is visible                                   if the angle be          tan"1 1/3
[i.e., tan"1 -3 =           18° 26'].
   Experiments               repeated       with          a small galvanometer on the Helm-
holtz model instead of the sensitive galvanometer, proved that                                                 no
great     error    had          been     introduced                 by       any accidental         change      of
relative    position            between          the coils and needle                      of the       reflecting
galvanometer, such as might have                                    been       produced by a slight tilt
to the side.
   The dimensions,               &c, of the coils of                  the       Helmholtz        galvanometer
are as follows         :   —
   Each     coil       consists of 16 turns of wire, and is of rectangular
section.     The wire is wound on in                            4   layers, each of          4   turns.       The
mean radius of               both coils is 24-65± -02 cm., the distance between
their centres is 24 51 cms.                          The following                are the measurements
for each layer          :   —

position     of the centre                of     the          needle          is recorded    ;   y being      the
direction    along the             Helmholtz               axis,         and x the direction             perpen
dicular     to y in the horizontal                              plane;         the numbers         being      the
distances     in       cms. from the origin.                        The third column contains                 the
values     of the resistance                f    of       the      reflecting galvanometer circuit                  ;

     There       is    also    a    table giving two series of pairs of points, the value

value of       |.

     Fig.    1       represents          a   portion of the Helmholtz field, where                   O   is   the
centre, and               OY the axis.                  The two pairs of curved lines are of
equal values of                |,    being constructed from the data given in the last
table.         The scale in this figure                      is   5   divisions per cm.
     Figs.       2,       3,   4,    and       5    represent the values of               $     along     OM,
OX, MA, and                    NA        respectively         ;   the scale for the distance along
these lines being                   in   every case        5   small divisions        per cm.     along the
one       co-ordinate, while                    the values of            $     are   measured    along the
other.
     In     fig.      6    the values of               $     along     OA     are represented    ;   but,      as
it   is   inconvenient               to represent
the       actual distances                     of      the
points along the diagonal on
same scale, the distances from
the centre of their                      projections
on the axis are substituted.
     The         accompanying                   sketch

         F.RS.E,        F.C.S.   (Lond.      and     Paris),     Lecturer      on
         Chemistry, Technical College, Manchester, &c.
    My attention       has been   occupied of late with a chemical            and
microscopical      study on the action of various compounds on the
lower forms of plant-life.       I have already    presented    to the Chemical
Society of London        a  paper on the Action of a Solution of Ferrous
Sulphate on certain Parasitic Diseases which attack our Crops.              (This
paper will      be   published   presently.)    I  wish here to detail some
studies     on    the   action  of   salicylic   acid   (GrH603)      on certain
ferments      (organised    and unorganised).        A   solution    of salicylic
acid    was prepared containing 0-2 gram, of the acid            in 1000 c.c. of
water.
    A   drop of yeast      was placed   upon a slide under the microscope,
 and then a few drops of the above salicylic           acid solution was run
 in   between   the slide and cover-slip, when       I  found that it had no
 action on the true alcoholic ferment, for         I  was unable to stain the
 protoplasm of the cells with a solution of eosin, showing that the
 protoplasm was not dead.          But, when    I operated   in   a like manner
 on    certain other     organised ferments, namely,         Mycoderrna     aceti,
 Bacterium,      lactis, and the Butyric bacillus, it was very different.
  On running in the      same salicylic acid   solution upon slides contain
 ing   these   various ferments they were         quickly    destroyed.    "What
 was observed under the highest powers of the microscope                was that
  the salicylic acid acts chemically upon the cellulose, or the form of
  cellulose making the external walls of these lowly organisms.                 It
  was evident that the acid dissolved the cellulose wall, and in some
  cases  I could   see that the cellulose  wall had    been   perforated by the
  acid solution.

    Beyond these facts,                    I have       found that the above named aqueous
solution              of salicylic         acid also prevents the                          chemical          action      of
hydration by means of the soluble zymases.      If yeast is added to a
solution of cane sugar, and to this solution the salicylic acid solution
is added, no decomposition according to the following equation takes
 place   :   —

takes place.             I      allowed the above to stand for two or three days at
a   temperature                 most       suitable       to     engender             alcoholic        fermentation
                       then tested for glucose sugars by means of
 (about 80° F.), and
 Fehling's solution without any result.
 I    also tried the action of salicylic acid solution upon solution                                        a
 of starch              which       had        previously            been     inoculated              with    a     small
 quantity of saliva.                     After standing               several         days, I     could not find
 the smallest trace of glucose sugar.
  From this, salicylic acid acts upon the soluble ferment (ptyalin)
contained in saliva, preventing the hydrating action upon the
amyloses.
    Then              again, I      have       found that the above                        solution of salicylic
acid     acts           chemically           upon the           cellulose         walls of dead                   Tonda-,
destroying               them       in   a     similar    manner            to    the      organised ferments
already described                  at the commencement                        of this paper,             but       it   has
no action on the living Torula. This shows that chemical change                             a
must have taken place in the molecular structure of the cellulose
wall of the cell after the death of the organism.

can be     revivified by an aqueous            solution containing 0-25 gram, of
potassium       nitrate and 0-2 gram, of sodium phosphate                   in 2000 c.c. of
water.       In    fact, the     Torula appears       to decompose        a    much   larger
quantity of        sugar     (in wort) into alcohol in a given time after the
above     salts have been added to 2 titres of wort than when the wort
is not so     treated.       It appears that the Torula lives its life-history to
a certain     extent by extracting the potash and phosphoric acid from
the    compounds         containing them, which come into the wort from
the   barley and hops.            Mitscherlich long ago showed that the ash of
yeast     gave no less than 53 to              59    per   cent,    of phosphoric acid,
and from        28 to 39 per cent,         of potash.       Hence it may          be  that a
larger amount          of alcohol would be produced in beers by the addition
of small     quantities of the above substances to the wort.
   From the above investigations the following conclusions are to be
drawn :—
    1.   That    a  certain solution of salicylic acid has no action upon the
living Torula, but dissolves            it when     dead  ;  thus showing that some
chemical      change (post-mortem)           has taken place         in  the cellulose    of
the cell-wall.
   2.    That the solution of salicylic acid destroys                " disease ferments,"
by acting        upon the cell-walls        ;   showing that their cellulose            most
probably differs from the cellulose               of the Torula      cerevisice.
    3.   That     the solution        of salicylic acid prevents             the hydrating
action     of the various soluble zymases.
    4.   A solution of sodium                 phosphate       and     potassium      nitrate
revivifies exhausted           yeast, and even       increases     the yield of alcohol
in saccharine solutions.
    5.   Salicylic       acid acts     as  an    antiseptic    agent     of great     value,
because      it acts directly upon the

     Telegraphic communication between           Ben Nevis Observatory and
 Fort-William Post Office         is kept up by means of a line which con
 sists of an ordinary telegraph       wire from Fort William to Auchintee
 Farm at the base of the mountain, and              a cable   laid underground
 from thence     to the   summit.       At Fort-William     the wire is put to
 earth in the usual way, while at the Observatory the return wire is
 attached    to the iron-wire      sheath  of the cable.     Formerly the wire
 was worked by means           of Wheatstone's     ABC instruments, but       in
 April   last these were replaced      by single  needle   " sounders."    With
 both instruments the presence of earth-currents has been frequent! v

proper transmission of signals, and from the working of the needle

                      of Edinburgh, Session 1885-86.                          531
instrument especially,     I  was led to suppose that these currents were
always    present, and that they were subject to more or less regular
variations, both in direction and intensity.
   A detailed investigation would require           more   elaborate   electrical
apparatus    than can at present be obtained at the Observatory, and
would interfere with the ordinary use of the wire. The observations
which form the subject of this communication were made entirely
by means     of  a  Thomson mirror galvanometer, and were so arranged
as  not to affect in any way the transmission of signals in either
direction.
   A preliminary trial     was first made by putting     a   coil of copper wire
in circuit, and placing       in the    field an   ordinary    pocket-compass.
When      this   was  done no observable deflection could be obtained.
The mirror galvanometer was then put in, and after                 a few further
trials  the     arrangement shown        below was adopted,        and found to
give suitable deflections.

    A  coil R, consisting of 24 feet of iron wire, No. 17 B.W.G., was
 attached to 0 and N, along with the telegraphic instrument, and in
 multiple arc with this the galvanometer G was inserted.                 Contact
 was broken at M, except while readings of G were actually being
 taken, so that no part of the current was diverted               from the tele
 graph instrument.        As no means of accurately measuring resistance
 was at   hand, absolute measurements         of the current passing      at any
 time could not      be  obtained, but     a rough estimate      from tables     of
 resistances of iron wire gave    R   =  abaut 04 ohms     ;  and the resistance

532                   Proceedings     of (he Royal Society
of the telegraph instrument is not less than 200 ohms.                   The resist
ance of the galvanometer was given at 22-9 ohms, so                 that about
of the whole current may be taken as the fraction passing                    through
G.   The galvanometer was powerfully controlled by external magnets,
the time of vibration        of the mirror being extremely short.                  The
direction of the currents was determined directly by comparing the
deflections    due to them with those given by a           Daniell cell
    We   can by means of this arrangement            ascertain    at any time the
 direction of the currents passing through the line, and observe                   the
 variations in intensity from time to time.              These currents        I have
assumed to be due to a difference          of potential between the earth            at
 Fort-William      and   the   summit, and       I  think    we   are   justified    in
 treating the sheath of the cable as equivalent to an earth-plate at
the Observatory, but       it would   be advisable     in further investigations
to have an actual earth-plate similar to that at the other end.
    The observations extend from 20th September to 4th                       October
 1885, and are hourly, the readings         being taken just before the usual
 hourly meteorological       observations.       The curve       of hourly values
 obtained by taking the mean deflection for each hour during                       the
 successive days     shows    a well-marked daily variation.            During     the
 early part  of  the night we have a current passing            through the cable
 up the     hill, which    appears    to   reach    a  maximum        at 21    hours,
 and again     at 2 hours.       After   2  hours    a  rapid diminution takes
 place, and at 5 hours we have         the    current reversed.       Immediately
 after this the potential at the summit again              falls relatively to that
 at  Fort-William,     and we have a current coming up, increasing                  in
 strength to     a  well-marked     maximum        at 10 hours.        This is    suc
 ceeded   by another equalisation, and the current is again                 reversed
about    13  hours,   after which it passes down the line till about 18
 hours.    This part of the curve, however, is much more irregular,
the current being very unsteady.             After   18 hours the current again
sets   in an upward direction          through     the   line, increasing pretty
regularly till   the maximum at 21 hours.
    During     the  time over which          these    observations     extend,    the
summit of Ben Nevis            was  almost     continuously      enveloped    in fog
or mist, and a succession        of heavy storms       passed over the Observa
tory about the end of September.                The daily curve        shown     may
therefore   be  taken to hold only for conditions under which the air

is saturated, and further observations must be made before the actual
daily variation can be determined.                        A careful     comparison       of the obser
vations with the ordinary meteorological                           sheets of the         Observatory,
however, brings out some points of very great                                interest,      especially
when looked at         in    the    light of       the theory advanced             by Professor C.
Michie       Smith, in a paper                communicated              by him to the           Society
on 1st      June     1885        (Trans.     R.S.E., xxxii.            p. 583).     As     the result
of observations             on    atmospheric electricity, made on the summit
of Dodabetta,           the        highest         hill in       the    Neilgherries,       Professor
Smith finds that on the edge of a dissolving mist the potential is
lower than the normal,                  while it is higher on the edge of            a    condensing
mist.       A   study of the following                    table,    with the notes appended,
shows at once         that in nearly every                case where      the top of Ben Nevis
became       clear    for    a short time, a strong current was found coming
up the      line, while as soon as the summit was again enveloped,                                   the
current was reversed.                   The connection between the moisture of the
air and the          earth currents is still further shown by studying the
rainfall.       During      a    fall of rain or snow the current is almost always
found to pass down the cable                   ;   and,    in    the case of a sudden           shower,
the current sometimes               drove the mirror of the galvanometer violently
off the scale.        A cessation           of rain or snow will be seen in most                   cases
to have     exactly the opposite effect.
     If   we assume         that the summit of Ben Nevis takes the potential
of the masses    of vapour covering                        it,
                                         and consider the earth-plate
at   the base as the real " earth
                                  " or zero of potential,    at once                 it    is
obvious that these results agree                    with    those of Professor Smith, and
form important          additional evidence                  of the truth of his theory,              a
conclusive proof of which would be of the greatest value in investi
gations connected            with thunderstorms.
     Following out the above conclusions, we should expect the mean
daily curve for earth currents to be intimately connected                                  with that
for relative humidity,                  but as yet no observations                have    been taken
except     in saturated air.              Further study of          the curves shows that the
currents are probably                   affected    by other causes besides                those    con
nected      with cloud.            The approach            of cyclones seems to disturb the
electrical conditions              to   a   certain extent,            but the observations are
not   sufficiently numerous to allow of any definite inferences                                    being
drawn.          My object in writing this                   paper      has been chiefly to uraw

534                    Proceedings          of the Royal Society
attention to the great additions which a complete series                     of electrical
observations, made at Ben Nevis Observatory, would be likely to
make to our knowledge of these subjects, if the experimental
difficulties in the way could be surmounted.
    The figures given represent the deflection                 of the spot     of light of
the galvanometer,         in scale-divisions.
    The sign + prefixed to a figure indicates that the current passed
through the galvanometer               down the line-wire to      Fort-William.        The
opposite     direction is indicated by a              -  sign.   The sign ± indicates
that the current was variable in direction.                     + 0 indicates     that  the
current was extremely faint, the spot of light oscillating about the
zero-point.        The sign      oo   indicates    that the spot of light was driven
 off the scale altogether.             Where the current was very unsteady, the
figures are in old style type.

                                                     (Abstract.)
     The second, only, of two short papers which                                                 I   communicated to
the       Society a month ago, on points connected                                                   with the Kinetic
Theory of gases, took account of the greater probability                                                     of collision
between         two particles           as    their relative speed is larger.                                   I    propose
now to calculate the effect of this consideration on the results of my
first paper.
     The question resolves                    itself into finding the mean value of the
expression

of that paper, in terms of the mean square speeds in the two systems;
because, only when this is zero, does kinetic equilibrium                                                    set in.
     We     are here            concerned           only with collisions                             between        particles
belonging one to each system.
     In
      my Note on the Mean Free Path (ante, p. 397) it is shown that

Hence, in              a   given time, the number of such collisions                                           is    propor

     Let    V,   Vj        be the projections of                v,   vl   on the          unit       sphere,   C         that of
the line of centres at collision.                               Then       V     \1   =    (3.       Let    also     VC        = o,
CVT,       =    tj>.       Finally, let       n, nv represent                    the proportionate numbers
of particles in the separate systems which have speeds                                                         v    to   t;   + Sv,
vl   to     + 8»u respectively.                     Thus

    Here the limits of a ought to he restricted to a hemisphere                     of
which the direction of relative motion is the axis.                But, by extend
ing them to the whole sphere, we merely double each integral,                   while
we avoid some complex relations.              We may     compensate      for this by-
taking     from 0 to ir only.       [The same remark applies to the other
integrals of this kind with which we have presently to deal]                      The
above fraction then takes the value
Since
this becomes
 In further integrating this,     we must remember            that the limits of r
are   v- vl  and v + vv while     v >vlt but v1 -v and », + v while t>< Tj .
Thus    the denominator (being symmetrical) consists of two parts,
 which differ from one another only by the interchange of                    p and q.
The value of the numerator can be found from that of the denomi
nator by differentiation with regard to          p  and change of sign.         When
this is done we have for the mean value of              u2
                                     3p + 4q
This shows how the first and, by parity of                 reasoning,     the  second
terms of (1) are affected by the new consideration.                  We might have
 directly verified this for the second term by evaluating

            Slip        Water-Bottle.                 By Hugh                Robert              Mill,         D.Sc.,
            Scottish Marine Station.                           (Plate       XX.)
      The various forms              of    apparatus           employed for procuring samples
 of    water from beneath                the surface are either designed                             to take up as
a
      sample   a        mixture of the water in                  a     certain vertical range, or to
secure       their       entire charge           at one          definite position.                   The former
description of water-bottle has been used almost invariably in deep-
sea    work    ;    the latter      is   necessary only in shallow water.
      The    most        common          type,    on       the     principle        of the force-pump,
appears to have been                originated by Hooke* two hundred and twenty
 years      ago.        A   box provided with                  a   valve above and one below,
 both opening               upwards,      is     lowered by            a   weight      ;    the        water    runs

through      it easily, keeping the valves           open ; when      it is pulled up the
pressure of the water closes the valves, and if the upward motion is
uninterrupted keeps them shut. A specimen of water is thus secured
from nearly the greatest depth to which the apparatus has been sent.
     This form       has been worked out           in many modifications ; arrange
 ments have been added for locking the bottle when it is full, and also
 for closing it by other means than changing the direction of motion.
     In Marcet's machine for obtaining bottom samples,* the upper
 and lower valves were connected                   together,   and during the descent
 of the instrument they were kept open by                   a cord and weight, which,
 ceasing to act on touching the bottom, allowed a spring to                       close and
 lock the valves.            There was thus no risk of the contents changing
  during the upward journey.                 In  a  modification for obtaining inter
  mediate      samples     the   valves (in this case cones fitted on a rigid
  rod) were held up by a catch which could be withdrawn by a lever
  actuated by a weight slipped down the sounding line.                         The valves
  then closed, and were locked by               a catch,
      Wille'sf water-bottle and            Sigsbee's     \ water-cup are the most ap
  proved modern developments                  of Hooke's apparatus.           "Wille's ap
   paratus    raised    5  litres of water, Sigsbee's only          8 ounces.      Both   are
  locked by the action of the current in the ascent on small screw pro
   pellers,   which form part of the instrument.                  Tennant before 1819
   devised     a   water-bottle § which was closed by the action of the
   water on     " a small fly-wheel during its ascent."                  The arrangement
   consisted     of   a large    water-tight      snuff-box, the        lid of which was
   held open against           a powerful spring by a small wedge that was

arrangement.            Their inadequacy for the work led to           the construction
of entirely        novel forms for         the    "Challenger."*          The   stop-cock
water-bottle is a cylinder with a large stop-cock at each end, the
levers of which are connected by an outside bar carrying a plate so
arranged       that it becomes horizontal when the line is hauled in, closes
the stop-cocks         by its resistance, then falls and hangs freely.
     In the water-bottles already described water                    traverses    the ap
 paratus      while it is being lowered, and              as the openings     are smaller
 than the diameter of the cylinders, the water enclosed at any time is
 a  mixture derived from the few fathoms just passed through.                         This
 is no objection          in   deep-sea   work,    provided      an adequate      locking
 arrangement         is employed.       When    a  simple valved cylinder is used
 the results       are untrustworthy,        because any check on the line opens
 the valves and allows the water to get mixed.
      The oldest method           of getting water from a definite depth was
  by sinking       a corked bottle        full of    air.    It  was sent     down     100
  fathoms or so, and          when hauled up it was found still corked, but
  full of water.         This is   accounted     for by two theories        ;  the   water
  either filters through the           cork, or, at a certain depth, the pressure
  suffices    to drive the cork in, the bottle instantly             fills, and   as  it is
  drawn up, the contained water being relieved from pressure, expands
  and fixes the         cork firmly in its place.          This method      of collecting
  water     has been        employed by many chemists,             by Forchhammert
  and     Von BibraJ in particular ; but it is very unsatisfactory.
      Sir Humphry Davy invented, for Sir John Boss's Arctic voyage
  of 1818,       a water-bottle § which        was found to be uncertain in its
  working.||       It   was a strong pear-shaped           copper vessel, with a stop
  cock at the upper end, which was opened, and, after the bottle filled,
  closed     again by levers actuated          by  a  piston working in an air-tight
  side-tube, and capable of adjustment enabling                 it to act at any depth
   from 5 to 80 fathoms.             The arrangement was entirely automatic,
   and as the       pressure    at the   required depth opened and closed the
   bottle it was even unnecessary          to measure the line as       it was payed out.

     In very shallow water           a bottle provided          with   a glass    stopper may
 be sunk, and the          stopper     pulled out by a second line                when at the
 proper depth          Stevenson's      hydropliore (1813)* is an improvement
 on this.      It  is a metallic bottle closed by a plug,                     which may         be
 removed     and replaced         at any depth,        in    order   to  fill the vessel and
 to secure the sample unchanged.                 Stevenson's deep-sea hydrophore                  t
 resembles      one    of Marcet's forma                It   is a spindle-shaped          vessel,
 fitted with two conical valves             on a very heavy axis,             which projects
 beneath     the   apparatus        and keeps        it shut during           descent     by its
 weight.       When it strikes the bottom the valves                    are forced       up, the
 air escapes, and water enters.              On raising, the valves fall back into
 their places, and do not tend to open.

  1872,   a glass     cylinder       adequately       protected       and provided          with
 weighted valves which hang open during descent                            ;  at the  required
 depth it is inverted by             a second    line, and the weights pressing on
 the   valves    serve    to secure them.              The difficulty of employing a
 double line is so great, when the sea is rough or when currents are
 rapid, that apparatus requiring such fitting is very inconvenient.
     The Commission at Kiel, for the physical, chemical, and bio
 logical examination of the German                 seas, has      devised many methods
 of collecting water.§            When    the analysis         of  the dissolved gases         in
 the sample was contemplated,              an india-rubber bag containing a                little
 mercury and squeezed free from air, was sunk and opened                                 at the
 proper position.
     On   the    French       " Travailleur" expedition                of    1881, a     water-
 bottle combining           the    peculiarities      of the       stop-cock and valved
 forms was employed.           ||    On the "Talisman"               expeditions a strong
glass    globe was        exhausted       by an         air-pump,       and     its  capillary
opening sealed       ;   it  was fixed      to the line below the               Negretti-and-
Zambra thermometer,               which when reversed               broke the tip of the
capillary tube and water entered                the globe.          When the globe          was
received     on   deck the water sample                 was     permanently secured           by
sealing    off  the    broken capillary.            No other         process     of collecting
and preserving samples             of water is so perfect            theoretically as this,

  Rung has an ingenious water-bottle in the shape of a large
syringe * with a weighted handle (inside which there is a reversing
thermometer) ; it is sunk with the nozzle downwards, the handle
being looped up to a spring hook, which disengages                                            it when     a   weight
is    slipped down the line from the ship.                                          The syringe is then                  in
verted,              the heavy handle draws out the piston, and water enters
through the small hole of the nozzle.
      The water-bottles most usually employed during                                             the last fifteen
years are made on a principle altogether different from any of those
enumerated                 above.             Ekman's            apparatus was            used      for   work           in
shallow water by the Norwegian                                        North Atlantic Expedition.                          It
consisted              f of    a    framework like the stand for an hour-glass,                                      the
bottom                being   a    brass       plate with an india-rubber                      ring let into it.
A cylinder, open below and provided with                                           a flanged     opening above,
was            suspended by          a       catch    to the upper part of the frame, and                            the
whole was lowered over the side.                                      On striking the water the catch
fell back, but the rush of water kept the cylinder at the upper part
of the frame work                        ;    as soon as the line was checked the cylinder
fell, its base                rested         on the india-rubber ring, against which                          it     was
 pressed by a spring catch.

 North Sea Expedition of 1872, and bottles of identical character, at

  it  were ground to fit on the conical edges of the base                   plate and      the
  upper plate.        Strong metal guides fixed to the shank supporting
  the base plate ensured            that the cylinder should slip            fairly on its
  fittings.      On striking     the bottom the tumbler threw                off the slip,
  and the bottle closed.              The "Challenger" instrument               worked in
  the same way.            To slip the cylinder at intermediate                depths the
  "Challenger" investigators             used a plate      resembling that employed
  for closing the stop-cock bottle, and Meyer adopted a                     device better
  adapted      for working      in shallow         water.    He suspended          the slip-
  cylinder by a cord and two hooks to                  two horizontal pins fixed to
  the.  upper part of the apparatus.             A   split wedge attached       by rods to
  a   ring surrounding the sounding-line rode                  on each pin ;        when      a
  weight was let down the line from the ship it depressed                         the ring,
  which lowered the wedges and pushed                     the hooks     off  the    pins,  so
  closing the apparatus.
      The superiority of slip water-bottles lies in their being adapted to
 take water from a perfectly definite position.                  In   fact, a  slip water-
 bottle, when it acts properly, cuts out of the layer in which                     it  closes
 a   cylinder of water, the parts of which retain their relative positions
 until     the water-bottle is emptied.
      In Buchanan's small slip water-bottle *                the  cylinder is allowed
 to run down the line from the ship.                     Its defects are its aptness to
 indent the edge by striking on the brass hemisphere, and its being
 too     light to    press   sufficiently      on   the    rubber to     ensure    that its
 contents      are unmixed.          It  cannot,    of course, be used on the same
 line with thermometers.                This instrument       was at first used       in the
 work carried on by the Scottish Marine Station on the                           Firth of
 Forth, where water samples               have to be obtained at all depths            from
 2    fathoms     to   40, sometimes        in  a  strong current, sometimes            in a
rather rough        sea,  and sometimes         in  a narrow channel, where there
is considerable traffic,        and      where    the   instruments      cannot be left
down for many minutes.                It was not very well suited         for this work     ;
for which it was found desirable to have a water-bottle fulfilling
the following        conditions    : —
     1.   To be light enough to work by hand when necessary.
     2.   To contain     about 2 litres of water.
     3.   To be used on the same line with thermometers.

    When it         was decided to have               such an instrument made,                 I was
not acquainted          with      the description of Meyer's water-bottle, or any
other approximately                answering the requirements                ;   as   I    had not
then time to search out the scattered papers on the subject, and                                    as
no    list of    references         could be got, the water-bottle shown to the
meeting was devised, and by many experiments, with the advice of
Mr Buchanan,               and the assistance            of    Mr Frazer, who             made    the
instrument, it was brought to                 a   satisfactory condition.
    The water-bottle is             represented      in   figs.  1  to 3, Plate     XX.        Fig.  1
gives    its general        appearance when open and ready for use                      ;  fig. 2 is a
vertical section         ;   fig. 3 shows    it  closed ; fig. 4 is the plan of the base
 plate.     The       material of        the     whole       is
 brass,    with the exception of an india-
 rubber ring and washer.                   The axis ab
 (see   Plate XX.)           is a strong tube which
 supports all          the fittings,       and through
 which      the      sounding-line        passes.        The
 funnel-shaped end of the tube                      b   rests
 either     on     a   knot,      or on    a    short bar
 spliced into the rope.               The base-plate         C                 Fig.  4.
 is provided         with      a ring p, of peculiarly soft rubber, specially pre
  pared    for  the purpose.           It  is perforated by the stop-cock e, which
  opens by a key to run off the water when the bottle is full, and by
  the tube d, also terminating               in   a stop-cock,        and intended to let in
  air when the bottle i3 being emptied.                        Three light radial wings             ff
  serve as guides           to the slip cylinder.             The top plate g has           a saucer-
  shaped      india-rubber          washer    h fixed on          it by   a screw.          The slip
  cylinder has its lower edge nn lightly grooved,                           so   as   to grip the
  rubber ring, and a flange with a blunt knife-edge                             ii  projects from
   the upper part.             Three strong curved strips              rr terminate         above   in
   a tube q,    sliding very easily on the central rod.                    The upper part of
   q is widened, and is provided with an internal groove k, in which the
   bent extremities            of  three  springs      11   catch, and so support the slip.
   These    springs are bent outwards, and when the bottle is to be

closed, a weight slipped down the line strikes the wide tube m, and
drives it down over the springs                        11,   drawing them in and releasing the
slip.     The knife-edge             ii       strikes the rubber washer                        /(   at     the same
moment        as the      lower edge n strikes and indents the rubber ring p.
At the       same instant the three                     springs oo are forced over the base
plate,    and clasp           it   tightly,         clamping the two together before                              the
elasticity of the india-rubber has time to assert itself.                                           An extremely
tightly-fitting          joint     is   the result.           The spring          o   is   supplemented              by
an additional            spring         s,   the action of which                 enables            more     flexible
metal     to be used for the catches.                              It    requires      a      little practice      to
enable       one to set the water-bottle again, but this                               is     soon acquired.
     This water-bottle             is    believed to possess certain advantages over
other forms.             It    can       be     used    in conjunction with the reversing
thermometers           of Messrs Negretti and Zambra, when these are fitted
with     the Scottish frame,* and by                    a    very easy adjustment any number
of thermometers               and       water-bottles can be used simultaneously on
one line, thus enabling samples                          of water and temperature observa
tions to be obtained from several positions at once.                                           The impact          of
the messenger on the top of the water-bottle, and the locking of the
springs below, can be felt distinctly                               through nearly 100 fathoms
of line, and        so    the moment                when     it   shuts    is    known.              The locking
arrangement          is   very satisfactory, and                    so    simple that any accident,
such as the distortion                   of   a   spring, can be put right at once.                              The
same holds good of the detaching gear.
     The water-bottle shown has been in constant use for                                            a     year, both
on board the         " Medusa,"               where    it    is   worked by steam-power,                     and on
fishing-boats, where               it   was managed               by hand.

        its Development. By Thomas Muir, M.A., LLD.
             Part I. — Determinants in                               General (1693-1779).
      In October         1881      I published              in the Quarterly Journal of Mathe-
                                                         " List of
m'Uies       (xviii.    pp. 110-149)                a              "Writings on Determinants,"
which contained the titles of all the books, pamphlets, memoirs,
magazine         articles, &c, which were then known                                       to me to exist on
the       subject of the Theory of Determinants.                                    The list consisted of
489        entries arranged                in chronological                order,    the    first date being
1693,        and the last 1880.                         During the           three     years      which     have
elapsed since           it   was published,                   I   have been steadily making manu
                                  it it,
script additions             to        not merely in the way of continuation for the
purpose        of keeping                  up to date, but also                by the intercalation            of
 omitted        titles unearthed in the course                              of my own researches,              or
 brought to my notice by obliging correspondents.
      The continuation of the list from 1880 forwards                                       is   comparatively
 an easy       matter    :   it   is   not by any means easy to render equally com
 plete      that portion of the list which pertains to the eighteenth century.
 In the early history of                   a   scientific subject, before the nomenclature
 has become            fixed, the mere titles of writings are insufficient guides                               :
 the searcher's         work        is,    consequently, minute and laborious, and he
 never can        be     quite sure that his labours are at an end.                                       As far,
 however, as Determinants are concerned,                               I     am inclined now to             think
 that       the writings which                 are unknown              cannot be of much import
 ance,      and that the time has come for using the collected material in
 the       production of      a    detailed history of the subject.
          The plan proposed                to be followed             is   not to give one connected
 history of determinants                       as       a     whole, but       to give         separately     the
     history of each          of the sections                     into which        the subject      has been
 divided, viz., to deal                with determinants in                    general,        and thereafter
     in   order with the various special forms.                             This will not only         tend to

548                       Proceedings            of    the    Royal Society
smoothness  in the narrative by doing away with the necessity of
frequent harkings back, but it will also be of material importance
to investigators who may wish                          to find out what has already been
done in advancing any particular department of the subject.                                              To
ttris end, also, each new result as                      it    appears      will   be numbered in
Roman figures        ;    and       if   the same result be obtained                    in   a different
way, or be generalised,                  by a subsequent worker, it will be marked
among the contributions of the latter                         with    the same Roman figures,
followed by an Arabic                    numeral.       Thus the         theorem        regarding the
effect      of the transposition of two rows of a determinant will                                       be
found under Vandermonde, marked with the number xi., and the
information intended thus to be conveyed is that in the order of
discovery the said              theorem          was       the eleventh        noteworthy          result
obtained: while the mark XL 2, which occurs                                    under Laplace, is
meant to show that the theorem                         was not then heard of for the first
time,       but that Laplace contributed                       something additional              to our
knowledge of it.               In   this way any reader who will take the trouble
to look up the sequence XL, xi. 2, xi. 3,                           &c,      may be certain,        it is
hoped, of obtaining the                  full history of the         theorem       in question.
     The early foreshadowings of a new domain of science, and tenta
tive gropings at           a    theory of        it,   are so difficult       for the historian          to
represent       without either conveying too much or too little, that the
only satisfactory way of dealing with a subject in its earliest                                   stages
seems       to be to reproduce                 the exact words of the authors where
essential      parts of the theory are concerned.                           This
                                                                               I        have   resolved
to    do,    although to some               it   may have        the effect of          rendering    the
account at the commencement                       somewhat          dry and forbidding.
     No author,     so far as       I     am aware, has          preceded          me   in the    taskI
have      chosen.        Sketches of the history have appeared in                            a   number
of text-books of the subject, notably                            in Giinther's Lehrbuch              der
Determinanten-Theorie                    fur     Sludirende          (2te    Aufi.      xii. 209     pp.,
Erlangen, 1877), which contains                        a     considerable quantity of detail.
The early history has                     been   very carefully dealt with by F.                         J.
StudniSka, in       a     memoir published in the Abhandlungen der himigl.

Inilim.                               Folge, riii. 40 pp. (24th 6
March 1876), and entitled "A. L. Cauchy als formaler Begriinder

121    pp., Helsingfors,          1st March      1876), by E.     J.  Mellberg, which
treats    somewhat at length of the early authorities.                   The existence
of these two latter writings            has not, however, induced me to curtail
to any extent the corresponding part of my work.
                                   LEIBNITZ        (1693).
 [Leibnizen's mathematische Schriften,                herausg.     v. C.    I. Gerhardt.
              1  Abth. ii. pp. 229, 238-240, 245, Berlin, 1850.]
    In    the   fourth     letter of the published        correspondence         between
 Leibnitz and De L'HospitaL the former incidentally                       mentions that
 in his algebraical investigations he occasionally uses numbers instead
 of letters,     treating the numbers however              as  if   they were      letters.
 De L'Hospital,         in his reply,    refers to this, stating that he has some
 difficulty in believing that numbers can be as convenient or give                       as
 general     results as letters.        Thereupon Leibnitz, in his next letter
 (28th    April 1693), proceeds with an explanation : —
           " Puisque vous dites que vous avés de la peine                 à croire qu'il
        soit aussi general et aussi commode              de se servir des nombres
        que des lettres,      il faut que je      ne me sois pas bien expliqué.
        On ne sçauroit douter de la généralité en considérant qu'il est
       permis de se servir de 2, 3, etc., comme d' a ou de b, pour veu
        qu'on     considère      que ce ne sont pas de          nombres        véritables.
       Ainsi     2.3 ne signifie point 6 mais autant qu' ab.                Pour    ce  qui
       est de    la commodité,       il y  en a des très grandes,      ce   qui fait que
        je m'en sers souvent, sur tout dans les calculs longs et dif
       ficiles ou    il  est aisé de se tromper.       Car outre la commodité            de
       l'épreuve     par des nombres, et même par l'abjection du novenaire,
      j' y trouve un        très grand avantage même          pour l'avancement de
       l'Analyse.         Comme c'est une ouverture assez extraordinaire, je
       n'en     ay pas encor        parlé à d'autres, mais voicy          ce   que c'est.
       Lorsqu'on a besoin de beaucoup                de lettres, n'est      il  pas vray
       que ces lettres n'expriment              point les rapports qu'il y         a entre
       les grandeurs qu'elles signifient, au           lieu qu'en me servant des
       nombres       je puis exprimer          ce  rapport.    Par exemple          soyent
       proposées        trois   equations      simples   pour    deux      inconnues       à
       dessein d'oster ces deux inconnues, et cela par un canon general.

Leibnitz in        effect says that first of      all  he prefers      to write 10 for a,
1 1  for   b,   and so on     ; that, having done          this, he can all the more
readily take the next              step,    viz., forming every possible product
whose factors are one coefficient                 from each equation,* the result
being

and that, then, one being the number which is less by one than the

have only one factor              in common.
     The    contributions,           therefore,            which     Leibnitz             here        makes                to
algebra may be looked upon as three                           in number :—
     (1)   A    new    notation, numerical in character and appearance,                                                   for
individual       members          of an arranged group of magnitudes                                  ;       the two
numbers which               constitute       the notation being                      like       the       Cartesian
co-ordinates of             a   point in that they denote                         any one of the                        said
magnitudes by indicating its position in the group,                                         .    .        .        (i.)
     (2)   A    rule for forming the terms of the expression which equated
to   zero      is the result of eliminating                       the unknowns                  from          a   set of
simple equations,                                                                                                 (il.)
   (3)     A    rule for determining                  the signs of the terms in                           the           said
result                                                                                                         (in.)
     The last of these is manifestly the least satisfactory.                                         In the first
place, part of         it is awkwardly            stated.         Making           those terms                different
in sign which hare only as many factors alike as is indicated by the
number   which is less by one than the number of unknown quantities
is exactly the same as making those terms different in sign which
liave only two factors different.                      Secondly, in form it is very unprac
tical.      The       only methodical way of putting                              it in   use is to select a
term and make it positive                ;       then seek out a second term, having all
its factors except two the same                        as those      of the first term, and make
this second            term negative         ;   then seek out                a   third   term, having                    all
its factors except two the same                            as those      of the second                    term, and
make this         third term positive             ;   and so on.
     Although          there      is evidence              that    Leibnitz continued,                            in     his
analytical work, to use his new notation for the coefficients                                                      of an
equation        (see   Letters xL, xii., xiiL of the said correspondence), and
that he thought highly of it (see Letter viii. " chez moi c'est une
des meilleures ouvertures en Analyse        does not appear that by"),   it
using      it   in connection with sets of linear equations, or by any other
means, he went further on the way towards the subject                                                 with which
 we are concerned.                 Moreover,          it   must be remembered                   that the little
 he did effect         had no influence on succeeding workers.                                        So far as            is

Lejeune Diricblet being the first to note its historical importance.
It   is true that during his own lifetime, Leibnitz's use of numbers in
place of letters was made known           to the world in the Acta         Erudi-
torum of Leipzig for the year 1700 (Responsio ad Dn. Nic. Fatii
Duillerii imputationes, pp. 189-208) ; but the particular applica
tion of the new symbols which brings them into connection with
determinants was not there given.

     The third chapter of Cramer's famous treatise deals with the
 different orders (degrees) of curves, and one of the earliest theorems
 of the chapter is the well-known one that the equation of a curve
 of the nth degree is determinable when J»(n + 3) points of the curve
 are known.       In illustration of this theorem he deals (p. 59) with
 the   case of finding the equation of the curve of the second degree
 which     passes through five given points.         The equation is taken in
 the form
                      A + By + Cx + D yy + ~Exy + xx = 0 ;
 the five equations for the determination of A, B, C, D,                     E  are
 written down ; and it is pointed out that all that is necessary             is the
 solution of the     set  of five  equations,   and the substitution       of the
 values of A, B, C, D,      E   thus found.      " Le calcul ventablement        en
 seroit assez long," he says; but in a footnote there is the remark
 that it is to   algebra we must look      for the   means of shortening        the
 process, and we are directed to the appendix                 for a convenient
 general rule which       he had discovered for obtaining the solution of
 a set   of equations of this kind. The following is the           essential   part
 of the passage in which the rule occurs : —

      The problem which                     Cramer set himself                    at        this     point         in his
book was exactly that which Leibnitz had solved, viz., the elimination
of n quantities from a set of n +                         1    linear equations.                      The solution
which Cramer obtained, and which, be it remarked, was the solution
best adapted            for his      purpose,         was quite distinct in character from
that of          Leibnitz.         Leibnitz          gave a rule for                   writing out             the final
result       of the elimination;                 what         Cramer gives is a rule for writ
ing out the values of the n unknowns as determined from n of the
n + 1       equations, after which we have got to substitute these values
in the remaining (n +                l)th       equation.        The notable point in regard to
the        two solutions          is,    that Cramer's rule for writing                                the common
denominator           of the values of the n unknowns (an expression of the
!'th degree          in the coefficients)            is       exactly Leibnitz's rule for writing
the       final result, which           is   an expression of the                  (n+ l)th            degree.        Had
either discoverer been aware that the same rule sufficed for obtaining
both         of these      expressions,             he could not             have           failed, one would
think, to note the recurrent law of formation of them.                                                    The result

    is,    according     to       Leibnitz,         if    we      embody               his      rule      in    a     later
symbolism,
whereas,         according to Cramer,               it    is—
                                                                                                               "

coefficients     of the unknowns and the notation                  of Leibnitz should
be    noted,     and    in connection therewith the fact that when dealing
with the subject of elimination between two equations of the wtb
and nth degrees in x Cramer uses a notation closely resembling
that which Leibnitz employed, viz. [1»] [l3], &c.

     The object of Bézout's memoir is sufficiently                   apparent from the
 title  ;   we may therefore           at once    give those      portions of it which
 directly     concern our subject.            On p. 291 is the commencement                 of
 the following passage           : —

     Cette nouvelle forme a deux avantages                 :  le premier, de      rendre

   The latter part of this we are drawn to at once, as it enunciates
quite clearly the Recurrent Law of Formation                    to   which attention
has above been directed as a natural deduction                    from the work        of
Leibnitz and Cramer.

                               of Edinburgh, Session 1885-86.                                                         559
     The notable point in regard                          to       the    earlier portion                   is,   that
Bezout throws his rule of term-formation and his rule of signs into
one.        In    the case of finding the resultant of
                               a^e + bry      +   c,z =   0        (r=l,     2,   3)
his process consists                of four   steps, viz.      :—
                  (1) a.
                  (2)ab              -ba
                  (3) a    b   c    - acb+cab\ — bac+bca —cb a.

The first term of (2)   got from (1) by affixing
                                      is           and the second                 b,
isgot from the first by advancing the   one place and changing the
                                                                b
sign.   The first term of (3)    got from the first term of (2) by
                                                    is
affixing   the second term
             c,               got from the first by advancing
                                              is                                                                  c    a
place       and changing the sign, and the third                            is    got from the second
by      advancing         c    a     place    and changing               the sign   ;        the last three
are got                      term of (2) in the same way
                 from the second                                                                   as    the first
three are got from the first term of (2).
     It    will thus      be seen that while              Leibnitz and Cramer direct                             us    to
find the permutations                    in any way whatever, and thereafter to fix
the sign of each                    in accordance with   rule, Bezout requires the
                                                                   a
permutations to be found by                           a   particular        process,         and attention
given to the question of sign throughout                                  all this process,                 so    that
when        the    terms       have been found their signs have likewise been
determined.

  Taking this up in order, we observe first that Vandermonde                                                                         pro

poses    for  coefficients    a positional     notation      essentially the same as
that    of Leibnitz, writing       \ where     Leibnitz wrote       12 or   1.,.
    Then     he defines     a  certain class of functions           by means of their
recurrent law of formation —a law and                     class of functions        at once
seen    to be identical with those of Bezout.                A  special   symbolism       is
used    for  the first time to denote the functions;             thus, the expression
which occurs in Leibnitz's letter, Vandermonde would have denoted

     It  is next pointed out that permutation                  of the under row of
 indices    produces the same result           as  permutation of the upper row,
 that the number of terms is the same as the number of permutations
 of either row of indices, and that            half of   the terms are positive and
 half negative.
     The part which follows this is            a  little curious.      The proposition
 is brought forward that         if in   the symbolism for one of the functions
 a   transposition      of indices      takes   place    in either row,          the   same
 function is still denoted,         the only change         thereby possible       being   a
  change of sign.        The demonstration is affirmed to be dependent on
  two theorems,      neither of which is proved,            as the   proofs are said to
 be troublesome        to set forth.        Now it will      be seen that the second
  of these    theorems    is to the effect that the transposition of any two
  consecutive    indices causes a change of sign, and that consequently
  this alone is sufficient for the required demonstration.                   The first of
  the   auxiliary theorems,      in  fact, is an immediate deduction from the
  second,  the particular permutation which             it  concerns    being produced
  by  (n-m+ l)(m-          1) transpositions of pairs of consecutive indices.
     Passing over the illustrations         of these propositions, we come next
  to the theorem       that   if any two indices of either row             be equal the

function         vanishes identically,                                and we note particularly                                that    the
basis     of the proof is that the interchange of the two                                                                   indices    in
question             changes           the sign of the function,                                     and       yet          leaves the
function unaltered.
     Upon this                 theorem           the solution                 of a set of simultaneous                            linear
equations is then with much neatness                                                    made to depend.                In more

complementary minors.                                  His        case       is     that in which the given de

    In   addition  to this, we must view Vandermonde's           work as     a
whole, and note that he is the first to give a connected         exposition
of the theory, defining the functions        apart from their connections
with other matter, assigning them a notation, and thereafter logically
developing their properties.       After Vandermonde     there could be no
absolute necessity for a renovation or reconstruction on a new basis          :
his successors    had only to extend what he had done, and, it might
he,  to perfect certain points of detail.    Of  the mathematicians whose
work has thus far been passed in review, the only one fit to be viewed
as  the founder of the theory of determinants is Vandernionda
                             LAPLACE       (1772).

                         of Ediiiburgh, Session 1885-8G.                                    5G9
       renferment         le même           nombre de termes,           et  précisément les
       mêmes,       puisqu'elles renferment tous les termes                     qui    peuvent
       résulter     de     la combinaison           des   n lettres a,       b,  c,  d,  e, ifec,
       disposées entre elles de toutes les manières possibles ;                     il ne peut
       donc y avoir de différence entre deux résultantes, que dans les
       signes de chacun de leurs termes                     ;   or,  il est  visible     que la
       première résultante donne la seconde, si l'on change                            dans la
       première      b  en    c,  et réciproquement        e   en b; mais ce changement
       augmente ou diminue d'une unité le nombre des variations de
       chaque terme         ;  d'où    il suit que    dans    la seconde résultante, tous
       les termes dont le nombre des variations est impair, auront le
       signe    + ,    et    les    autres     le signe   -;      partant,   cette     seconde
       résultante n'est que la première,               prise négativement.
          "  Il  est visible pareillement que . . . . &c.
                                                                     "
   The proof is thus seen to consist in establishing (1) that the terms
of the one " resultant" must, apart from sign, be the same as those of
the  other; and (2) that the                terms of the one resultant are either all
affected with the same sign as the                 like terms of the other, or           are all
affected with the opposite sign, the comparison of sign being made
by comparing the number of variations.
   After this, the       theorem        that when two letters are alike the result
ant vanishes is established                in  a way different from Yandermonde's,
but not more          satisfactory, viz., by considering what Bézout's rule
would lead to in that             case.
   Application is then             made to the problem of elimination,                  and to
the solution of a set of linear simultaneous equations, the mode of
treatment     being again different from Yandermonde's, but this time
with better cause.            He    says —

                               of Edinburgh, Session 1885-86.                                                                    571
and requires special attention.                              It    is introduced as                        " a very simple
process for considerably abridging the calculation of the equation of
condition between a,                    b, c," &c.       — that is             to say, the calculation of a
resultant.       It      is,   however, something of much more value than this,
involving       as   it   does          a   widely general expansion-theorem to which
Laplace's name has been attached,                                     but of which we have already
seen special cases stated                         by Vandermonde.                           The theorem                   may be
described       as giving           an expansion of                   a       resultant in the form of an
aggregate of terms each of                        which        is

illustrated      is not       made      altogether       clear.      This     is  due       to     two
causes, — first, the linking of               one case to the case before                 it  ; and,

     Laplace                 appends           a   demonstration                    of the accuracy of this                    de
velopment                    of the resultant of the nth degree, the line taken being
that      if        the multiplications                       were        performed the terms found would
be    exactly the 1.2.3                             n terms of the resultant, and would bear
the    signs proper to them as such.
     He then goes on to deal with                                      a      rule for obtaining           a    like develop
ment            in which          as    many         as       possible of the factors of the terms are
resultants of the                  third           degree.
     To do               so    succinctly            he       is      obliged to introduce                     a   notation for
resultants.                   On this point his words are —

  We     can    but remark that here again he leaves little room for
improvement       :   his symbolism is essentially that which is still in

        dans lesquels g precede h, et ainsi du reste."
   The really important           point in all this is in regard to the manner
in which the letters are brought into combination.                        It will      be seen
that    the   set begun with       is ahc, consequently a precedes                  b,  and   b
precedes c throughout          : then d is combined in every possible                     way
with this     : e is   combined subject to the condition               that d precede        e ;
/ is combined subject to the condition that                 e    precede    /  :  g is com
bined in every way possible           :  h is combined subject to the condition
that g precede h          : and so on.      It would appear therefore that the
letters which are to be combined in every possible way are d and
entry    third   one afterwards, and that each of the other letters is con
ditioned to be preceded by the letter which immediately precedes it
in the original          arrangement abcdefghi.          .   .   .    Condensing these
directions after the manner of the former case, we should draft the
rule as follows       : —
   (a) Find every possible arrangement of abcdefghi . . . subject to
the conditions that in each arrangement we must have a, b, e in their
natural order       ; d, e,  f in their natural order      ; g, h,     i in  their natural
order    ;  and so on.
    (b)    Prefix to each arrangement its proper sign in accordance                       with
Cramer's rule.
    (c) Append         in order the indices      1, 2, 3 .     .   . .   to the letters of
each arrangement.
   (d) Change ambjr into (am.bn.cr),              d,ej, into {drerf,)         ,   &c

   576                     Proceedings    of  the  Royal Society
      Without saying anything            as to the verification        of the develop
   ments thus obtained, Laplace concludes as               follows : —
             " On       decomposeroit    de la meme        maniere     l'equation   E     en
          termes composes de facteurs          de 4, de 5,    &c, dimensions."
      To show how this could be effected would have been a tedious
   matter,    if  the method of exposition used          in   the previous cases       had
   been followed, viz., multiplying           instances    with   wearisome     iteration
  of language until the laws for the combination of the letters                     could
   with tolerable certainty be guessed.           On the other hand, had         Laplace
  condensed       his directions in the way we have indicated, the               rule for
  the case in which as many as possible of the factors are of                    the 4 th
  degree could have been stated as simply as that for either of                  the two
  cases he has dealt with.            The only changes necessary, in fact,             are
  in   parts    (1) and (4), and      merely amount to         writing the letters       in
  consecutive       sets of four instead of two or three.
     Further, when the rule is condensed             in this way, the problem of
  finding the number of terms in any one of the new developments—
  a  problem which Laplace solves in one case by considering                         how
  many terms of the final development each such term gives rise                     to —
 is transformed into finding            the number       of possible arrangements
 referred      to in part (1) of the rule.         Where       the highest degree       of
 the factors       of each term     is 2 and    the resultant which we wish             to
 develop is of the 2nd degree (which is the case Laplace takes), the
 number of such arrangements                 is evidently (1.2.3. ... n) / (1.2)* ,
 s being the highest integer in n/2 ; if the highest degree of the
 factors is 3, the number of arrangements             is
                                       1.2.3          n
                                                         '
                                       (1.2.3)' (1.2)'
 where     s is the highest integer        in n/3  and    t the    highest integer     in
 (n
     - 3s)/2 ;     and so on.
     The facts in reduction of the claim which Laplace has to the
expansion-theorem now bearing his name are thus seen to be (1)

     The position of Lagrange in regard                    to the advancement of the
subject     is quite different from that of any of the preceding mathe
maticians.          All   of those were explicitly dealing with the problem of
elimination,         and therefore directly            with the functions               afterwards
known      as determinants.           Lagrange's work, on the other hand, consists
of   a number of incidentally             obtained algebraical identities which we
now-a-days with more or less readiness recognise as relations between
functions of the kind referred to, but which unfortunately Lagrange
himself did not view in this light, and consequently left behind him
as isolated instances.              With him       x, y, z and     x',   y',   z'   and x", y", z"
occur primarily as co-ordinates of points in space, and not                                 as coeffi
cients in      a   triad of linear equations       ;   so that
                     (xy'z"   +   yz'x" + zx'y"   - xz'y" - yx'z" - zy'x")          ,
when      it   does make its appearance,               comes as representing six times
the bulk of         a   triangular pyramid and not as the result of an elimi
nation.        In   days when space of four dimensions was less attempted
to   be thought           about than at present, this circumstance might pos-

   In     his extensive treatise                    on algebraical equations liezout                              was
bound,     as   a   matter of course, to take up the question of elimination                                          ;
and, as he had dealt with the subject in                             a    separate memoir in 1764,
one      might       not unreasonably expect                      to      find       the treatise            giving
merely     a       reproduction          of the contents of the memoir in                                  a     form
suited to       a    didactic work.                 Such, however,             is    far from being the
case.     He merely mentions the necessary references to the work of
Cramer,     himself, Vandermonde, and Laplace                              ;     and then adds —

     His main objection                     to the said methods is that when one has to
deal   with       a set       of equations of no great generality, with coefficients,
it   may be, expressed                    in figures    —

     Bozout nowhere gives any reason for his rule                      ;   it   is   used through
out     as   a   pure    rule-of-thumb       :    its effectiveness        being manifest,                  he
leaves on the reader the                full burden of its arbitrariness.                   The unreal
product xyzt at the very outset                       must have been           a     sore puzzle to
students,        and none the less so because of the certainty which many
of them must have felt that                 a    real entity underlay it.
     To throw light upon the process, let us compare the above solu
tion of      a   set of three          linear equations with the following                       solution,
which from one point of view may be looked upon as an improve
ment on the ordinary determinantal modes of solution as presented

Thus     the problem of solving the set of equations                                             is   transformed into
finding           the development of this determinant.                                           In doing        so let us
use     [xyz] to stand for the determinant of which x, y,                                                  z    is   the last
row, and whose                       other rows are the two rows immediately above
x, y,        in   A similarly let [zt] stand for the determinant of which
      is z
                  :
z,
 t           the last row, and its other row the row c", d" immediately
above        z,   t    in   A;       and so on in all possible cases, including                                            even
[j-yz/], which of course                     is   A    itself.
     Then clearly we have
                   [xyzt] = a[yzt]            -tfxzi]         +   c[xyt\   - d[xyz]              ....       (1)
Developing in the same way the four determinants here on the right

                                             (Abstract.)
     The    majority of recent               investigations           have    concluded that the
thickening        of the rim of the blastoderm,                      and the new layer which
is derived from                      brought about by                                                  of the
                           it,
                           is                                       a    true invagination
segmented blastoderm.                  On the other hand, Klein and Kupffer hold
that     the newly formed layer                     is   not derived from the segmented
blastoderm       (archiblast), but           is   mainly produced from an unseynwnteiJ
portion      of the blastoderm (parablast), which                              is   intermediate           in
position between            the archiblast and the yolk.
     A   little over      a    year    ago I        was      led to conclude,        from          a   study
of the development of Trachinus, that the so-called                                      " invaginated
layer," the primitive                hypoblast, was in great part,                  if   not entirely,
built up from the margin inwards of cells budded off from the
parablast.  More recently   have studied the question in other
                                           I
forms, particularly the herring, and am now enabled                                      to bring        for
ward more important evidence                           as to the origin and morphological
significance of the parablast,                    and also of the part which this layer
plays in the economy of the embryo.

                             of Edinburgh, Session 1885-86.                                            591
     The first       two    furrows in the herring are vertical in direction, and
at    right    angles       to one another.          They     are not pushed down to the
base  of the germinal mound, but                      cease    some distance before reach
ing the yolk.   Four segmentation                      spheres     are thus formed, which
are    imperfectly          separated     from the lower pole of the ovum.                             The
third furrow           takes    an equatorial         direction,     and simply completes
the bases of the first four segmentation spheres.                              The upper portion
goes        on segmenting,         and constitutes the archiblast.                   The lower pole
consists of a central                mass      of yolk, around which is a layer of
protoplasm, which constitutes the parablast.                         With       the formation of
the    first equatorial furrow              we have a division                 of the ovum into
an animal and a vegetative pole, as in the amphibian ovum.
     The archiblast          represents     the animal pole, and the parablast,                       with
its enclosed yolk, the vegetative.                    The segmentation cavity appears
between them.                  The   primitive        hypoblast      is       formed         from       the
vegetative          pole by    a   budding off of cells from the margin of the
parablast,         as has    already been described.              Cell formation            takes place
in the parablast of the herring ovum earlier than                         I   have observed            it in
other forms, and two batches of cells are added to the animal pole by
this means before the pseudo-invagination                          begins.           In    the herring
the        archiblast,      together with the cells which                     have    been       derived
from         the    parablast prior       to       the formation      of the segmentation
cavity, gives rise to the ectoderm.                       The primitive hypoblast, which
is almost entirely derived from the vegetative                        pole, gives rise to the
mesoderm            and notochord, and the true entoderm remains as                              a   single
 row of cells in connection with the parablast.
      If    this account should prove to be correct,                          several       interesting
 relations will be             established         between Teleostei and other forms.
 The       primitive       hypoblast, as       I   have    here   described          it,   is   precisely
 homologous with that of Amphioxus,                           and both give rise to meso
 derm, notochord, and entoderm.
      Again the derivatives of the animal and vegetative                                    pole in the
 herring are          practically the same as in the frog.                           In    Teleosteans,
 however, the vegetative                pole consists         at first of one cell instead                of
 four, this arrangement being brought about by the greater                                      bulk   and
 different         arrangement of the yolk.
      Quite recently Dr Euckert, who has investigated the question
 in   Elasmobranchs, has come to very similar conclusions.

3.   Account of a Preliminary Experiment                      on the     Thermal
       Conductivity      of Ice.     By A. Crichton Mitchell.                 Com
       municated by Professor Tait. (Plate XXI.)
   The following      paper  is an account of        a  preliminary experiment
performed in      the Edinburgh      University Physical Laboratory,             with
the view of determining the thermal conductivity               of ice.
   The method employed was that of Angstrom, which consists                         in
heating and cooling alternately, to a definite amount and for definite
periods of time, one end of       a   block or bar of the substance whose
conductivity    is required.     The thermal changes            produced    in this
manner are transmitted throughout              the substance      in a species of
wave.     Taking two points in the        substance     in  a line  perpendicular
to the surface which      is being heated       and cooled, these changes are
produced    until   the  temperature      indications     at the two successive
points have become periodic.          The conductivity can then be calcu
lated from the ratio of the amplitudes of the temperature indications
per unit length along the line       joining the two points, and from the
interval in time between the maximum temperatures                 per unit length.
   Obviously, the ranges of temperature           we must work        with in the
case  of ice lie below 0° cent.    ;  and accordingly, the periodic cooling
and   heating were effected by successive           applications of a freezing
mixture and exposure to the surrounding air, which was throughout
the   experiment never      above 1° cent         To carry this out,      a  tinned
iron box, with open top, had two thermo-electric junctions of iron-
German silver — inserted through             india-rubber      corks, fitted    into
circular holes, in opposite    sides of the box;       one hole being so much
above the other as to separate       the junctions       by  a  distance of     l-27
centimetres   from each other, in a line perpendicular             to the bottom
of the box.     The cube was then filled with water, previously boiled
to expel dissolved air, and placed on the roof of the College                     for
forty -eight hours during frost. The ice formed in this manner, with
the thermo-electric junctions in its interior, was free from cracks and
air particles, and was evidently quite homogeneous.
   It was at first attempted to cool and heat the surface of the ice
by simply laying      on it  a freezing mixture        of snow and salt for         a
definite period of time, and subsequently flooding the surface of the

ice with ice-cold water for the same time.          But the first of  these
two operations was found to        melt the ice on its surface;      while
during the second,     the ice-cold water froze on the surface      of the
previously cooled ice.     To obviate this difficulty,   a thin   sheet    of
tinfoil  was placed on the suface of the ice  ;  on this was laid for five
minutes the freezing mixture of pounded ice and salt; and during
the next five minutes the surface of the ice was simply exposed            to
the air.   This alternation of cooling and heating    was  then regularly
carried on until the thermal changes at the thermo-electric junctions
                                     \j
were observed    to be periodic ; after which     readings were taken at
equal intervals of time, viz., 20 seconds.
   The metal-box, containing     the cube of ice, was placed in a bath
of ice and   water, which   provided a steady temperature for one of
the junctions in each of the two thermo-electric circuits.      By   means
of a commutator, one     junction (in the ice) at a time was placed       in
circuit with    a Thomson's    dead-beat  galvanometer (resistance       1 -5
ohms at 9°-4 cent.) ;    the circuit was so changed as to include the
two junctions alternately.     In  this manner it was found possible to
take readings every ten seconds.
   It was found difficult to attain a strictly periodic change      in the
temperature at each of the junctions.       This may    be due partly to
the fact that freezing mixtures themselves      undergo sudden changes
of temperature, and partly    to the circumstance that the completeness

   Detailed above         are a set of readings taken during               one period —
one    of the few in          which    the   changes       were    practically periodic.
The junctions         are numbered        in  order,     beginuing with that nearer
the surface.       The interval between two readings of the same junction
is 20 seconds,       and they were taken alternately.
   Plotting     these readings     (which     express differences of temperature)
against time,      a  curve is obtained, the equation to which is
          /(0) = AO + A1cos0         +  A2cos2      0 +   A3cos30+       ....

where 0 is an angle which             increases      in proportion to the time, and
where     A0,    Av Aj, By       B2, . . .  &c,    are unknown        coefficients.     By
taking six values         of /(0) we may determine the coefficients A^,                 A,,
Ap    A3, Bj, B.,, B3.       Subtracting from each value of                /  (0), A0, the
mean value of the function,            we get
                 = Aj cos   0 +.

This experiment        was performed on Saturday,            January    9, 1886, and
the   period    for which readings        have    been given, and from which
the   determination       k = -005    has   been    obtained, occurred         between
11   a.m.   and mid-day of that date.             It  was attempted       again in the
evening, beginning at 5.30           p.m.     Shortly after 6 p.m. the galvano
meter was seen to give irregular deflections,            even when not included
in one of the thermo-electric circuits.              These    deflections   continued
to increase      to such an extent that the directing magnet had to                    be
shifted    to   keep    the light-spot    on the      scale.     These phenomena
were found to be due to the disturbed state of the earth's magnetism
at the    time,    for from 7.30 p.m.        till 8.30   p.m.    on that evening         a
brilliant auroral display took             place.      Some     readings taken          at
8.20    p.m.   showed     a deflection    of the needle through 2°            15' — this
even when the disturbance was passing off.
    The ratio of the intensity of the magnetic field due to the earth
alone, to that due to the earth and magnet has since been tested,
and found to be       y^JJ,    the arrangement       being such that, superposed
on the field due to the earth alone was another, almost double but
opposite.
    In all probability       the readings,      taken immediately before              this
disturbance was noticed, were affected by it                  ; for, on taking the
readings     from the last two periods in the evening's work (about
 6.15 p.m.), and calculating the conductivity therefrom,                  I  find it to
be -011 and "010 respectively.
    As already       stated,   the   period    from which        the   determination
 k = -005    was    obtained occurred about mid-day, and                  there    is   no
 reason to believe that the readings           during that period were vitiated
 by the cause which rendered            those    taken in the evening untrust
 worthy.

     The mature Ovum of Myxine. — The earliest description of the
mature ovum is that given by Allen Thomson, in the article '• Ovum "
in     Todd's    Cyclopaedia      of Anatomy              and     Physiology,      vol.  v.,
published in the year 1859.             He says       : — "I     have found that     in the
Myxine glutinosa         the globular       yolk    is enclosed       in  a  horny capsule
of similar consistence      and structure (to that of Elasmobranchs), but
of a simple elongated         ellipsoidal       shape     ;   and in place of four ter
 minal     angular    tubes   there      are      a     number      of     trumpet-shaped
tubular processes projecting from the middle of the two ends, which
 probably serve the same purpose                as the differently shaped append
 ages   of the ova of the shark and skate."                 He gives    a figure  in wood
 cut of the ovum, and of one of the threads                    magnified.       The figures
 are correct   with this exception       :   in the representation            of the entire
 ovum     the yolk is represented       in outline       as   though seen through the
 envelope, and     is globular, like the yolk of Elasmobranchs.                     In  the
 Myxine ovum the yolk fills the cavity of the ellipsoidal envelope.                       It
 is not true that the terminal processes are tubular.                    I have  examined
 them, and found them solid, and, as                    far as can be seen with            a
 low power, homogeneous.            I   have      not been able to ascertain from
 what specimen       or specimens      the description of Thomson is taken,
 but    there  is a single specimen            of   the      ripe ovum in Professor
 Turner's    museum     which     may      have     been      examined by Thomson.
 This specimen was brought to the museum in the time of Professor
 Goodsir,    but it is not possible now to ascertain                      whether   it  was
 dredged from the sea-bottom          or taken from a pregnant female.

description of some ripe ova found in             a female    Myxine sent to the
Copenhagen Museum in the month of September 1862.                             He also
compares      the envelope of the ovum with its polar threads to the
capsule of the deposited ovum in Elasmobranchs.                    The ova were
lying    at the edge of the ovary, to which they were only connected
by the entangling of the threads.              In  the woodcut to Steenstrup's
paper one of the eggs         has the polar portion of the capsule              at one
end detached       like an operculum.
    I  have recently, by cutting sections         of very large ovarian eggs of
Myxine,      ascertained    that the     envelope     of the    deposited egg         is
developed      entirely within the follicle.         It is usual    to   distinguish
primary egg membranes           as chorion or vitelline membrane,          according
as   they are developed      by secretion    from the follicular epithelium,         or
from the ovum.           I am inclined      to  think that in this         sense   the
envelope     of the Myxine egg is         a   chorion, but   I  have not yet com
pletely examined the question of the development of the membrane
in all   details.     The important point is that the envelope is          a  primary
egg membrane,         and that the threads     are solid processes from        it   In
sections of the polar region of ovarian eggs about 19 mm. in length,
the ovum is surrounded by three distinct layers, corresponding                       to
 those    universally found in vertebrate ovaries.            The most external
 is the connective tissue         layer, which is of considerable thickness,
 and is continuous with the thin mesoarium.                   Next    to this is the
 follicular    epithelium, composed of several layers of elongated cells,
 arranged     with their long axes perpendicular           to the surface of the
 ovum.       Next is the egg-membrane, which              is   homogeneous,        and
  forms the sole envelope          of the deposited     ovum.      At    one pole is
  found    a cellular process projecting from the follicular              epithelium,
  and   penetrating through the chorion.             Thus   a canal     is formed in
  the latter, constituting      the micropyle.       But this    aperture    is not  at
  this stage open internally; the micropyle penetrates nearly, but not
  quite, to the inner surface of the chorion.
     In  the vitellus, close beneath       the inner end of the micropyle, is
  seen the germinal vesicle,       which is globular, large, and distinct.          In
  my preparations        nucleoli    could not be made out,           but from      its
  appearance     the vesicle did not seem to have undergone much change
  from its original condition.

of the polar threads may be seen. In sections of the polar region of
such eggs, the plane of the sections being parallel to the longer
axis       of the egg, deep pits are seen in the follicular                                  epithelium.
These pits are expanded at the bottom, and reach nearly to the con
nective tissue layer of the follicle, only a thin layer of epithelium
separating the cavity of the pit from the inner surface of the con
nective      tissue.       Corresponding to these pits are seen processes from
the chorion;            there     can be no doubt that in the fresh                      living condi
tion the       processes          entirely fill up the pits.                     The chorion itself is
much thicker than in                    the stage previously described, the processes
are directly            continuous with              it,   and like        it   are, at least    as seen
with ordinary magnifying                      powers,       homogeneous.            The processes are
quite solid, and           the inner surface               of    the chorion turned towards the
vitellus     is    as    even     as    in   the earlier stage.               The micropyle      is   seen
again at one pole of the egg, but its condition                                   is
                                                                                  a    little different.
It    is   open    externally, but closed                       by   a   thin portion of the chorion
internally.            It still    contains         a   cellular thread,           but this thread         is
shrunken          in    size, and has now no connection with                            the follicular
epithelium, the surface of which                           is   unbroken above the micropyle.
     Without further              evidence,       I     concluded that the further develop
ment of the egg consisted in the thickening of the chorion and the
elongation of the threads, these processes being due apparently to
the secretory activity of the follicular epithelium.                                  The probability
of this being the           case       is   shown by the fact that both epithelium and
chorion are much thicker at the poles than at the equatorial region
of the ovarian            eggs.    I         had no doubt that the follicle burst and
allowed       the escape of the egg enclosed                               in its chorion with        the
threads at the poles.                       ButI      was unable from the above                  facts to
ascertain exactly how the follicle opened.                                I   had seen bodies in the
ovary of some specimens of Myxine which looked like aborted                                         eggs,
and had surmised that these were                            corpora lutea, but they were too
degenerate        to afford any evidence                   of the        exact manner in which the
ovum had escaped.                      But in December and January                       I      found   a
female specimen of Myxine in the ovary of which were no large eggs,
but    a   number of collapsed                    follicles,     from which the ripe ova had
evidently escaped quite recently                      ;     examining these follicles         I   found
that each possessed               a     slit-like      aperture          at one end,    and     thus the
question of the escape of the ovum with its threads                                     is   elucidated.

coo                   Proceedings         of the  Royal Society
I  have also recently obtained a female specimen                of Myxine in       which
all the large eggs in the ovary had a slight projection at each end,
and in these knobs the ends              of the threads could be seen through
the connective tissue.          In    these    eggs the polar threads were           half
way or more towards their complete                development.
    In January     I obtained      two or three other specimens            in which   the
eggs were nearly as ripe, the projections formed by the development
of the      threads being        visible,    but   not quite so prominent.              In
sections     of the ripest       eggs     above described      it is seen that the
follicular    epithelium     at the poles        of the egg has become greatly
thickened, while the connective tissue                 layer has become thinner.
The     threads   are contained        in  deep cylindrical      sacs formed      by the
epithelium     ; the distal      ends    of these sacs project deeply           into  the
connective tissue layer, which is very thin over their terminations.
The epithelium is thick all round these               sacs, and   it  is quite   evident
that the threads and the layer from which they project are formed
by the epithelium.          The micropyle in these ripest eggs is in the
same     condition    as   before,     and is still closed       by a thin layer        of
chorion at its inner end.           I have     not yet found the germinal vesicle
in   the eggs at this stage.           The question whether          a  vitelline   mem
brane exists internal to the chorion             I have   not yet decided.
    Development     of  the  Ova. — The ovary of Myxine differs from that
of other vertebrata,        or craniata,      in consisting of an extremely thin
fold instead     of a somewhat          solid mass.      It  is impossible to define
the     boundary     between        ovary    and    mesoarium.        The     mesoarium
extends the whole length of the body on the right side only (in two
specimens I have found it developed on the left side only), and is
attached      at the angle      between      the mesentery and intestine.            The
eggs originate at the free edge of the ovary, which                     is only slightly
thickened, and        as  they grow large pass inwards, the largest                  eggs
being always nearest           to   the attached       border    of the mesoarium.
There is no transition in thickness between the membranous meso
arium and the thick connective-tissue layer of the follicle, but the
former passes abruptly into the latter.                 The line of attachment of
 the mesoarium passes round the longest circumference of the ellip
 soidal follicle.     When        the   eggs are large      they stretch the nieso-
 arium and hang down               beyond the edge of the ovary,                 but   the
 relations pointed out are never altered,                  not even when the egg

escapes.      The very young eggs are transparent and spherical, and
show a distinct germinal vesicle                 in    the    fresh condition.                As    the
eggs elongate the germinal vesicle passes to one end, but the                                      yolk
soon develops and conceals that structure from view.
  Male Elements of Reproduction. — Professor Steenstrup, in                                         the
paper above mentioned, says that no one seems to have seen a male
Myxine.        This is not quite      correct,       for Johannes Muller, in the last
volume of his Verglerichen.de              Anatmnie der Myrinaiden,                      published
in 1845, describes the testis of Myxine in                    a   somewhat vague manner,
but in such     a    way that, from my own experience,                       I   have no doubt
that he really had a young male specimen                           under his hands.                 The
males are very rare;          out of all the specimens which                 I have      examined
only ten have been males, and these are all immature.                            It    is extremely
difficult to distinguish between            a male and a           very immature female                   ;
in most cases       I have    only been able to do so by microscopic examina
tion   of the       generative    organ.      The       testis      is similar          in    general
structure to the ovary, but the free border is slightly more thick
ened     than in the latter organ,           and      has the gelatinous appearance
characteristic of testicular          tissue.         When         examined            with    a    low
power the thickened            edge is seen to contain a number of more or
less spherical capsules, and these on compression                      are seen to be filled
with rounded polygonal cells.               When the capsule is burst the cells
escape, and are then seen to be spherical, extremely transparent, and
provided with a large nucleus.                  It    is easy to conclude that these
cells give rise to spermatozoa.             The spermatozoa of Myxine hitherto
have never been seen or described.
  Hermaphrodite              Specimens.    — After          identifying          the     immature
males,   I   found that in nearly every specimen in which the eggs were
very immature the posterior end                  of the sexual          organ          was similar
in structure to the testis.          The testicular portion is usually much
smaller than the ovarian, and occupies                       about    2 inches         of the pos
terior end, but sometimes           extends further               forward.        These herma
phrodites are almost          as common      as the females.              The most curious
fact about the hermaphrodite               forms      is,   that in two of them              I     have
found the early stages of the development of spermatozoa,                                 although
in the males   I     never     found anything but the spherical cells above
described.     In   one of these two specimens          I     found spermatozoa               within
the testicular capsules,         but these spermatozoa                were few          in number

602                   Proceedings      of the Boyal Society
and not     in motion.      I   have    not yet been able to work out com
pletely the process of spermatogenesis,              but it seems that the cells of
the testicular capsules       send   off processes,      each of which becomes a
spermatozoon.        Only two or three          of these processes are formed at
a time,   and the spermatoblast seems to develop                  a number of sper
matozoa     in  succession,  instead     of, as  in nearly all other      cases,  simul
taneously.       The spermatozoa         have   a pear-shaped       head, and a      long
tail, which is attached to the obtuse end of the head.
     I venture to suggest the hypothesis in explanation of the above
facts, that the males       are nothing        more    than supplementary males,
 and   that the Myxine in its young state is nearly always,                       if not
 always, hermaphrodite.           It is evident that, as the          spermatozoa      are
 developing in the hermaphrodites while the                eggs are    still very small,
 self-fertilisation is impossible      ;  but it seems extremely probable            that
 the hermaphrodites while young act as males, and that most eggs
 are fertilised by them.        The females with large        eggs are never      herma
 phrodite, and it may be inferred that              as the eggs    develop the testi
 cular portion of the reproductive organ disappears.                     There may be
 some females       which never possess          a  testicular portion, as there are
 perfect males, but of this        I cannot be certain.           If  the above     hypo
 thesis be correct,    it would     account     for the extreme rarity of perfect
 males.      Another fact, which is partially accounted                 for by my      in
 vestigations, is the extreme            rarity of female       specimens      with ripe
 eggs.     The eggs are certainly deposited in winter, and eggs approach
 ing maturity are not to be found in the summer months.                        But even
 now the specimens with eggs nearly ripe bear                  a   very small propor
  tion to the      total number obtained, and it is probable that the
  animals, when just preparing to shed their sexual products,                    cease to
  feed, and therefore     cannot be allured by bait to either hook or trap,
  which are the only known methods                 of capturing them.         One thing
  deserves    to be mentioned      with     reference    to the male elements.          In

  the total size of the testicular portion of the generative                  organ was

  takes   place at the last moment,             must be extremely small.              This
  fact seems to indicate that fertilisation            does not take place         in the
  open water, and it is possible that the eggs and milt are shed                    in the
   mud in which the animal lives.

                                Origin of Inquiry.
    The following       investigations were undertaken with the view of
ascertaining      the    nature and cause of opacity in vaccine lymph.
According to the authorities on the subject,              clear fresh lymph is a
perfect material for vaccination, while               opaque    lymph,     fresh  or
stored,    is an imperfect material, but hitherto             the   nature    of the
difference    between     them has not been explained satisfactorily.              It
has been maintained by many that opaque lymph is a satisfactory
material for the purpose           of vaccination, but this view is not en
dorsed     by the      National     Vaccine    Establishment.      In April, last
year, Professor Chiene suggested to me that the cause of opacity                  in
                                        "
lymph was to be found in             a    germ," and he cordially assented        to
my request for assistance           in making    the necessary     cultivations   in
order to determine        its nature.     The cultivations detailed were made
by his assistant Mr Hare, whose intimate acquaintance                 with modern
methods of bacteriological research has saved much time and labour.
The     responsibility      of   the   observations recorded      rests   upon me
entirely.
    A preliminary microsopic examination of            clear and opaque vaccine
lymph led to no definite result, as the appearances                observed    could
not be explained,          It  was therefore   decided to examine —

604                     Proceedings    of the  Royal Society
         L Examination of         Empty Commercial         Vaccine Tubes.
    The      problem     to be solved     was    •whether    such tubes contain
germinal matter.           To determine this, two         series  of experiments
were undertaken.
    1.   Sealed      commercial tubes were introduced with aseptic              pre
cautions into beakers containing sterile nutrient fluid.                 Continued
sterility of the fluid was proved by subsequent incubation at 35°                 C.
The      tubes were      then broken with aseptic          precautions.      Subse
quent incubation          showed that more than half of the beakers con
taining broken tubes became cloudy.
    Where the sealed tubes were left unbroken, but where the fluid
had merely been stirred          with  a sterile glass rod, one out of six     only
became cloudy.
    2.    Commercial and sterilised         vaccine   tubes were charged       with
sterile and non-sterilo fluid, with and without spray, in imitation of
the     conditions under which vaccine lymph might be stored.                   The
result showed that sterility of the tube and of the fluid and the use
 of the spray were necessary          to prevent the occurrence          of opacity.
 Where these conditions were absent opacity occurred in every tube.
    The fact that a large proportion of the beakers containing broken
 tubes     showed     no change in the fluid, led to the conclusion that the
 amount of germinal matter in commercial tubes                    was   very small.
 Besides,      the amount of opacity      in the fluid in the      second series  of
 experiments was           very  much less than that observed            in vaccine
 lymph.         It  was therefore concluded, that the contents of the tubes
 had     very little to do with       the production       of opacity in vaccine
 lymph.          This conclusion    is concurred      in by Mr Farn, of          the
 National Vaccine Establishment.
            II. Examination of Cultivations of Vaccine Ltmpii.
     All     the cultivations    were   made   by Mr Hare with aseptic          pre
 cautions.         The material was transferred directly from the vesicles
 to    the cultivating      medium.     All   the successful cultivations      were
 got from clear lymph.            None were got from opaque           lymph.    The
  appearances        were   noted in    each    cultivation    on   three   separate
  occasions.

             An analysis of        the preceding table shows that in primary cultiva
        tions the colour of the growth, with scarcely                            any exception, was
        white on the fourth                  day.     Primary cultivations          in Koch's jelly
        were      invariably white in the form of "cocoons."                          On the eighth
        day yellow and orange colour appeared in a certain proportion, but
        the prevailing           colour       was    still white.          After this the principal
        colours were white and yellow, only one cultivation                               being of an
        orange colour.            We had thus three distinct growths, white, yellow

600                      Proceedings     of the   Royal Society
and orange,       as described by other observers.            Secondary cultivations
were made from certain of the tubes                  which     had been opened for
microscopic examination.              In  only one      case   out of six were       the
same colours reproduced.             Change     of colour in the growth was thus
observed to take         place both    in primary and        secondary    cultivations.
It is difficult to explain how this can take place on the                   supposition
that we have three different organisms to deal with.
   2.   Histological      Examination      of Vaccine Cult i cations.
   A. Orange cultivation              showed swarms of minute                  spherical
" micrococci " without definite arrangement
   B. White         cultivations    showed single, double, and triple             micro
cocci, and      in  one case a sarcina form.          The micrococci were larger
in cultivations which had been incubated.
   C.    Yellow cultivations           showed      dumb-bell      and    sarcina   form
micrococci.         Here    also  the incubated       cultivations      showed larger
torula-form micrococci.
   We could not explain            these different appearances.            It  was  sup
posed     that we had three different organisms,                  any one of      which
might be the immediate            cause of vaccinia.          Other preparations of
vaccine lymph, clear and opaque, were now made.
   In    clear    lymph     certain minute badly stained spherical bodies
were recognised         similar to those of the orange vaccine             cultivation,
but   I am indebted to         Dr Francis Troup for        the first clear demonstra
tion of them in vaccine lymph.                I  then saw that the       " micrococci   "
in clear lymph            and orange      "  vaccine
                                                       "
                                                           are   identical       Opaque
lymph after being kept some time showed large spherical trans
parent     bodies     like   oil  drops,    but their      nature was       a   mystery.
Even after examining vaccine               cultivations,     we    were as far off as
ever from being able to explain the nature and cause of opacity                       in
lymph.        I  therefore    suggested that we should cultivate variola.
     III.   Examination of Cultivations of Variolous Lymph.
   As   there were no cases of         smallpox in Edinburgh suitable for our
purpose,     it  became necessary to visit the Hospital Ships at Purfleet,
on the Thames,         to obtain variolous cultivations.            I have   to acknow
ledge the readiness         with which     Dr Birdwood         placed the material at
his disposal at our service, and also               the   able   assistance    given by
Messrs Bott and Clatworthy,             the resident physicians.

                       of Edinburgh, Session 1885-86.                        607
    The variolous cultivations may be conveniently divided into three
classes    : —
        1.   Where no reaction or growth occurred.
        2.   Where growth occurred without liquefaction.
        3.    Where growth was accompanied by liquefaction.
    1.   The first class is of value as showing the care with which con
tamination       of the media was prevented.             The  third  class   was
excluded from present comparison with vaccine cultivations, by the
occurrence       of liquefaction   of the media.        The second   class   may
fairly    be compared     with vaccine cultivations.       But  we had found
that the most definite and easily recognised           form of growth was the
"cocoon" in Koch's jelly.             Our    series  is therefore reduced to
cultivations of variola, showing this distinct mode of growth.              Nos.
                                                                "
 11, 12, and 39 only showed a large definite "cocoon              growth with
out     liquefaction.     These were     selected   as parallel, and probably
identical, with vaccine cultivations          of the same appearance.        The
questions to be decided were, as to their histological appearances,
physiological action, and contagiousness.
     2.  Histological   Investigation of Variolous Cultivations.
     A. White " variola " showed single, double, and triple micro
 cocci, identical with white "vaccine."
     B. Clear variolous lymph showed minute spherical bodies, similar
 if   not identical     with those of clear vaccine lymph           and orange
 *'
    vaccine."
     C. Opaque variolous lymph showed large torula-looking               " micro
 cocci," as well as smaller forms.

     On comparing clear and opaque           variolous lymph     with  clear and
  opaque vaccine lymph, the micro-organisms            in  each appeared    iden
 tical        My observations   are thus in accordance     with the description
 given by Cohn, quoted by Burdon Sanderson in his Eeport on the
  Intimate Pathology of Contagion.           Cohn was unable to say whether
  there was any connection between the bodies in clear and opaque
  lymph      ; but Zopf, in his work Die Spaltpilze, 1885, states that the
  opacity "consists in cell rows and masses resulting from the continuous
 division of the cocci."      Ho  recognises   no other modes of development.

    An analysis of this table shows that orange "vaccine" produces
a  local scab in a guinea pig, and that clear vaccine lymph produces
typical vaccination in monkeys.                 Vaccine cultivations         and opaque
variolous lymph produce an eruptive fever in calves, when inoculated.
No local result is      produced.        White variolous cultivation produces
a  mild variolous eruption in             a  monkey, which does not appear to
be contagious       to another monkey.              No local result     is produced at
the points of inoculation.            Protection is afforded from the poison of
variola by previous variolation and vaccination with " vaccine

result.    The experiments appear                to  show that     different vaccine
materials possess different degrees of potency.
                    Classification of Micro-organisms.
    In attempting         to    trace   the    life-history   of   the     vaccine    and
variolous organisms          from the       preceding observations we are con
fronted by      a  preliminary        difficulty.     At  present    the    fission-fungi
are undergoing the most             minute investigation,        and    the result lias
been    attempts     to improve        upon the classifications of Cohn               and
Naegeli.      Naegeli held that the bacteria were allied to yeasts, and
should therefore be included in the class of fungi.                      The difficulty
in accepting     this view arose from the fact that fungi were supposed
to be destitute of colouring matter.                  Owing   to this, Cohn        placed
them    among      alga-,    but the tendency now is to amalgamate                    the
colourless   fungi (bacteria) and the colour-producing alga; (bacteria)
into one group, the thallophytes (Sachs).                 The latest classifications
of Fliigge, 1883, and Zopf, 1885, appear to me to be unsatisfactory,
and   I prefer to follow the          classification of Cohn        into four tribes,
including six genera.           He   believes     that the form or shape charac
teristic of each tribe is adhered to throughout the life of the organism.
Thus,    a  micrococcus        cannot     be transformed      into    a   bacterium or
bacillus, but retains        its spherical shape.         We    have     only to do at
present    with Cohn's first group, the Sphasrobacteria,               comprising one
genus, the micrococci.            While, however, Cohn         has settled the main
lines upon which           the classification        of Schizomycetes should           be
based, he admits       that his classification of the genera into species is
defective.     This   is due to deficient knowledge of their physiological

                     of Edinburgh, Session 1885-86.                              611
action   and modes of reproduction.            Thus,    micrococci having         the
same    appearance     may    have    different   effects.   Cohn      divides    his
genus,   Micrococcus, into three physiological species — (1) Chromo-
genic, (2) Zymogenic, (3) Pathogenic.             He places the Micrococcus
Vaccinae   among    the pathogenic micrococci, hut the              record    of the
cultivations just detailed shows that the vaccine              organism is also
chromogenic, so that it might equally well be classed among these
coloured micrococci.       At   the same time, he admits that differences
in arrangement     and size are unreliable data upon which to found
the classification of species.        A   necessity,  therefore,    arises   for the
acceptance    to some extent of the theory of pleomorphism (Tulasne),
i.e., that the same plant can occur under two or more forms,                 as  well
with   respect to the organs of vegetation        as to those    of reproduction.
Applying this theory        to the bacteria,     we find that a single species
may show various forms in the course of its life-cycle.                    This   has
been shown by the researches          of De Bary, Zopf, Dallinger, Douglas
Cunningham, Ewart and Geddes, and others.
    The propagation of fungi takes place asexually in throe ways —
1    By free cell formation (asci, thecaj, spore-pouches).             2.  Constric
tion (basidians).      3. By cell-fission or gemmation.            Spores     are the
chief means of the spread of fungi (Wagner).
    Surrounding media modify the form and mode of fructification of
fungi, some increasing and others            diminishing    spore-formation, or
we may      have   the fungus dividing into yeast forms.                  Schwann,
Pasteur, and others consider the yeast fungi as organisms sui generis,
arising in fermentable liquids from their own specific germs.
    Hallier, Hoffmann,     and    others consider that they are only condi
tions, especially of mould fungi occurring in fermentable liquids,
particularly    the spore forms, which fructify in the atmosphere                   in
other forms.      They originate likewise from spores or from yeast cells
themselves when they reach           a  liquid.    Hoffmann thinks          that the
genera of Schizomycetes,       described    by Khrenberg, Pasteur,         &c,   pass
into one another, peculiarities which are to be held             as  characteristic
of   the  species,  and   which change        in the course of development
according to the change in the external conditions of life (Wagner).
 As   we  have   seen,   Cohn maintains that such           genera      are distinct
 throughout life.     Species may show various sizes and different pig
 ments besides differing in their effects.         Zopf is  a warm supporter of

 G12                   Proceedings       of the  Royal Society
 the theory of pleomorphism.             Crookshank (Bacteriology, 18S6), who
 adopts ZopPs classification, says that in classifying species of bacteria,
 we must take into account — 1. Microscopical appearances in various
 nutrient media.        2. Character of their colonies under          a  low power, in
 plate cultivations.        3.  Microscopical     appearances     of the organisms
 themselves.      4.   Their physiological action.           These desiderata, how
 ever, scarcely satisfy the requirements of the case, and               I  beg leave to
 add,   5.  The study of their modes of development and reproduction
 in  each species.
    In this way    we may be able to make out the life-history                       of   an
 organism.     Recent       observations     by    Lister,    Neelsen,       Zopf,     Van
 Tieghem, Klein, and Hauser, are said (Crookshank) to show that the
orders of Cohn pass into one another.              It is due to Lister to say, how
ever, that he retracted         his first opinion with regard to the bacillus
of black milk, and expressed           a  doubt  as to  whether he had not got              a
mixture of organisms.           If  this were true, of course,        Cohn's classifi
cation of genera would fall to the ground.                  Cohn's strong point            is
that he opposes change of shape in genera.                   He admits differences
in size and arrangement          and colour, as well       as  physiological       action,
in the different species of each genus.             The truth appears to be, that
while the various genera retain their globular, oval, rod-shaped                          or
spiral form throughout life, the different species described as cocci,
rods, threads,   and spirals may be merely stages of growth                   of  a single
organism.      At    the   same time these        various     forms     may       produce
                                          We find so-called      "           "
different physiological effects.                                    cocci       described
as  growing into torulae or rods,            liut  we find that rods are spore-
bearing, so that it appears           rather   a misnomer to call such              spores
cocci.     Should    they not be called spores of bacilli           ?     It   is evident
that   a gap has to be     filled up between the higher torula-form and                 the
spore.     The researches of Dr Douglas Cunningham                   upon the micro
organisms     found in the intestinal canal             show that they have              an
active and a resting stage.              In suitable     media,    the "zoospores"
multiply till   the material for their growth            is exhausted,         when     the
medium is acid, and the micro-organisms cannot develop further.
"When transferred to an alkaline medium they at once become active.
    The mode      of reproduction of bacterium termo                 has      been    well
described    by the Rev. W.            II.  Dalliuger,     in  a remarkable          paper
communicated to the Royal Society of London in 1878 by Frofessor

                        of Edinburgh, Session 1885-86.                                    613
Huxley.         He finds that      the bacterium grows to an ovoid body, of
very delicate nature,         which bursts and gradually collapses, scattering
very minute spores.            By continuous observation,               he has seen the
spore grow again into the             ovoid     body, which was seen to                 burst
again    as    before.    Mr Dallinger        worked     with       very high         powers,
 x    3000.      Similar observations with regard             to      the life-history of
bacteria have been made by Professor Cossar Ewart, but he does
not emphasise the resting stage.              Mr P. Geddes points out that this
occurs in many instances in the cycle of cell-life.

                 Life History of the Vaccine                Organism.
    In tracing this     I shall   follow the method        recommended       above    by
Crookshank, as my observations fall naturally under his headings.
    1.  Macroscopical         Appearance/        of   Vaccine    Cultivations.   — "We
found that the best medium for making observations was Koch's
jelly.    Here    we obtained         three    definite coloured growths.           The
colours on the surface of the jelly were white, yellow, and orange.
Below the surface         they were white and yellow.             No   orange    colour
appeared below the surface.               The shape      of the colonies was oval
or   like  a cocoon.       Sometimes       these    were aggregated together,        and
irregular    on the      surface.     They grow from inoculations of               clear
lymph only.
        The " colonies have been well described
                            "
    2.                                                          by Cohn, in 1872,
in preserved      lymph.        He   saw    the minute spherical corpuscle of
                                               "
fresh clear lymph          succeeded      by     simple corpuscles, double cor
puscles,   rows and heaps          or   masses of      corpuscles."      He    saw   the
corpuscles    become larger       until   at last the lymph      contained separate
large   globular homogeneous            transparent bodies        like oil-drops.       I
can confirm these         observations as correct,         and  I   agree with     Zopf
(1885) in thinking that they can only proceed from continuous
division and growth of the organisms in clear lymph.                        Opacity of
lymph is produced in this way.               I  observed,    however,   that the large
torula-looking      bodies     disappeared      from fresh preparations          within
 twelve hours, and next day both stained and unstained preparations
 showed    large   masses, which        had    apparently grown from them             by
 budding.      I think that this       appearance     is produced by the      bursting
 of the globules, but       I have not seen this take place.             I  think that
 these large    cells   contain spores, and that they are developed                from
 the organisms        in clear lymph.            If  these    bodies originated       in
 accidental contamination of the lymph, it is difficult to               see why they
 should be of constant occurrence in stored lymph, and not only so,
 but also in opaque lymph within the vesicles.                   Then they did not
 appear   in  the other nutrient fluid used to imitate vaccine lymph                  in
 the tube experiments.           The stages of growth between the embryonic
 and the mature form have been accurately traced by Cohn, both                        in
 vaccine and variolous lymph.              The larger forms are never found in
 fresh clear lymph.

    With     regard to the colonies      in solid media, the first appearance is
 white, even when the growth is of some size.               The change of colour
 takes place     gradually, and it remains yellow.           Spore formation,     as
 shown by the bright orange colour, is seldom seen in solid media.
I  am unable to explain this, except that the environment is unfavour
able to     the production        of spores,      while it is favourable    to   the
ordinary       vegetative    growth.      Then, when secondary        cultivations
were made, the same colour was only once reproduced.                     If change
occurred,     it was in the direction       of more distinctness in the colour,
apparently showing that the change of medium was more favourable
for    spore   production.      It  would     be interesting   to know     whether
coloured growths of vaccine lymph are alkaline or acid in reaction.
If  the orange growth is composed             of spores, it should correspond to
the alkaline clear lymph.           At the     same time, the white and yellow
should show an acid reaction similar to that given by opaque lymph.
We may        suppose the yellow colour to be produced by a mixture of
vegetative and spore growth, i.e., white and orange.
    3.   Microscopic     Appearances of the Organisms. — My observations
show that the size of the organisms increases with the age of the
cultivations.       Incubation has also some effect, and one medium may
be more suitable than another for its growth.               Thus in Koch's jelly
the micrococci were smaller than those in agar after incubation.                  As
 the material was the same, this             could only be explained by more
rapid growth.         Thus we find that the same organism            derived from
the same source,         presents    different appearances      according to the
environment and other favourable circumstances.                It does not follow,
however, that the same forms will produce the same effects.                     Nor
does    it follow that different-sized organisms will not         produce similar
physiological       effects.   The    truth     seems   to  be   that  the   larger
organism is the more powerful.               The embryonic form is milder in
action.
    4.   Physiological     Action. — The results of experiments, although
 few in number, appear to show that the embryonic form is milder
 in action than the more            mature      form of organism.      Thus    clear
 vaccine lymph and orange vaccine, both containing minute organisms,
 produced only a local result.            Opaque variolous lymph and white
 and yellow       vaccine    cultivations     and   white variolous cultivations,
 containing larger organisms not found in cle^r lymph, produce an

616                    Proceedings        of the  Royal Society
eruptive fever.        They appear to be more powerful in action.                 If the
organisms      do not grow         from the minute spheres           in clear lymph,
where      do they come        from   ?    Are there    several    kinds    of minute
spheres in clear lymph         1   Even if so, according to the opposite view,
they could not change their size and arrangement                by cultivation only.
     5.  Mode,    of Development and Re2>rodnction. — My observations
appear to confirm Cohn's opinion that genera of bacteria retain their
shape throughout their life-history.               Micrococci    remain micrococci,
but they may present            variations in size, arrangement,           and colour,
and their physiological action may become more powerful.                       Definite
production       of bright      colours appears      to be associated      with spore-
formation.       The large       transparent delicate       torula found       in fluid
media,     represents    the    organism in its resting stage,        as  described by
Dallinger      and   Douglas Cunningham.              The active stage commences
when this mature          organism is transplanted to           a  suitable medium.
Then spore production immediately becomes complete,                        and   a fresh
cycle of growth commences.                I cannot say where these spore-bearing
cells originate, but        it   is possible     that they come from yeasts or
moulds.
                                Summary      of Results.
     The following conclusions appear to be warranted by the results
of the inquiry just detailed.              Bacteriologists  are still  at variance as
to whether bacteria         spring from higher forms, and grow into them
 again.      So far  as the    globular or sphajro-bacteria        are concerned,     the
 only mode of reproduction at present               recognised    is fission occurring
 in   one or more directions.           Different morphological appearances and
 colours are held to be distinctive of different species of micrococci,
 but it appears probable that           a careful study of the physiological action
 and mode of reproduction is required before a satisfactory classifica
  tion can be obtained.            Continuous      observation of each organism
  from its embryonic to its mature form is necessary.                   Cultivation     of
  the organisms,     in both solid        and fluid media, also appears to be im
  perative.     It is also necessary to distinguish between local and con
  stitutional results of experimental inoculation with cultivations.
      We conclude,      then,
      1.  That commercial vaccine tubes contain germinal matter, but in
  small amount, and that it assists in the production of opacity in lymph.
      2. Clear    vaccine lymph, clear variolous lymph, and orange

                         of Edinburgh, Session 1885-86.                            617
 "vaccine"       contain      probably,   not micrococci, but the spores             of
micrococci.        Inoculation with these materials produces local irrita
tion by the growth of the " spore " into a more mature form of
organism.
     3. Opaque vaccine         lymph    and   opaque      variolous lymph contain
larger, more       refractive bodies of various sizes, which are probably
developed from the spores in clear lymph.                    They increase     in  size
and number in proportion to the length of time the lymph has been
kept.       After   a  few months large torula!        crowd the field in micro
scopic preparations.           Such lymph has an acid reaction,             and when
inoculated      it   produces    either violent local action, i.e., accelerated
vaccination, or we may have no local action, but secondary                   eruption
in     some other part of the body.             This    is probably     due  to rapid
spore-production         by the torulre.     The spores are probably absorbed
into    the blood, and rapidly grow there,         until they     are arrested in the
capillaries, where they continue to grow and set up irritation ending
in the production of           vesicles  or pustules.       From these secondary
foci may again be produced.              This would        account   for the appear
ance of periodic secondary           eruptions after vaccination.         The growth
from the spore to the torula explains the occurrence                    of opacity in
lymph.        Drying     the lymph prevents this growth, and also deteriora
 tion of the true vaccine material.
     4.  White, yellow, and dull ochre or orange cultivation of vaccine
 lymph in solid media, appear to represent stages of growth between
 the spore and the torula.             They correspond       to the refractive cor
 puscles    and    cells described by Cohn          in    vaccine lymph.        When
inoculated,      they produce in calves          eruptive fever.        They do not
 produce a local result.
     5.  White variolous cultivations in solid           media appear to represent
stages     of growth between the spore in clear variolous lymph and
the torula in opaque variolous material.                 When inoculated,      a  mild
eruptive fever was produced in           a  monkey.        This  was not contagious
to another       monkey.        The organisms      correspond to the refractive
corpuscles     of Cohn.       Cultivations    of variola and vaccinia in solid
 media appear to produce mild eruptive fever.                 They do not produce
a   local result.
     6.  Inoculation      with   vaccine   and   variolous cultivations       protects
 from    a subsequent      attack  of variola in calves.

618                       Proceedings        of  the  Royal Society
   7.   The best or perfect material for vaccination appears to be that
which      contains spores only.              This is probably         due   to  the small
quantity of the virus, and to its slower rate of increase.
   8.   Inferior or imperfect materials for vaccination are more power
ful in their action.           Thus     opaque vaccine and variolous            lymph not
unfrequently          produced eruptions, with a modified imperfect local
effect.     Cultivation        of   clear lymph in solid media             appears    to in
crease its potency, as shown by its production of an eruptive                          fever
in  a  calf.      Cultivation of vesicular variolous lymph in solid media
does not appear to differ              in potency from vaccine cultivations, as
shown by the effect of inoculation on a monkey.                         The action of the
material containing spores is probably milder.
   9.   Vaccination         probably protects from small- pox, by producing
a  mild form        of fermentation in the blood.                  The process     probably
takes place slowly, as the ferment is growing                     in unsuitable soil.
   10.     When      the spores      or mature forms are inhaled they probably
grow in the air-passages with extreme rapidity, and thus get into the
blood, where they multiply during the incubative period.
   11.     My observations          appear to show that what is called
                                                                                  " attenua
                        "
tion of     a  virus      may be explained by spore-production.                     Are not
the perfect vaccine materials for infective diseases to be found in
the spores of the micro-organisms which are their exciting causes                        1

are scattered over a wide tract of country on the eastern side of the

the name of the region they inhabit — a designation which includes
the Jivaros, Pastazas, Mendes, Tumbas, and more than twenty other
tribes.   Early brought into      contact   with   the first Spanish invaders,

them in the recent literature of South American travel.                 At present
I   limit my remarks mainly          to   the   specimens        of " shrunk

reduced heads now before us.          They are from several points of view
remarkable, and raise several questions of great ethnological interest,
but trustworthy references to them are comparatively few.                  Indeed,
the only sources of information worth mentioning are a communica
tion by   Mr William Bollaert, F.E.G.S.,          to the Ethnological       Society
of London,      1860,   and another,       by Sir John          Lubbock,    to the
Anthropological    Institute of Great Britain in 1873.               The former is
entitled   "On the Idol Human Head of                   the   Jivaro Indians      in
Ecuador;"     the  latter, "Note       on   the    Macas Indians."          In Mr
Bollaert's paper special attention is given to         a specimen      obtained by
M. Josd Felix Barriero, of      the Secretariat of the       Provincial Govern
ment, Quito, and sent by him to            Don R.      do Silva     Ferro, Chilian
Consul, London.       This   specimen    was placed       in the Ecuador Court
of the International Exhibition, 1862.             Sir John Lubbock's         paper
is devoted chiefly to    a general  description of the Macas Indians.
    The red specimen of shrunk head now exhibited was sent to my
friend Dr H. Gunning         of Palmeiros, Rio de Janeiro, a Fellow of

622                      Proceedings      of the Royal Society
this Society, by the Manager of the Amazon Steamboat Company,
whom it had reached from the upper waters of that great river.                              It
is styled by the sender             a   Cabeza     reduzida — reduced        head.        Dr
Alfred Pullar, owner of            the black specimen,          has   kindly permitted
me to show         it  to the Society.         The former was obtained from the
Pastaza tribe of Macas Indians, the latter from the Jivaro tribe.                          In
a note      accompanying the          head,    Dr Pullar says: — "Through the
kindness of a friend in South America,                   I   have lately received         the
curious war trophy of the Jivaros, who inhabit                     a remote    district on
the eastern       side   of Ecuador.         It  would appear that very few of
these    objects have been            brought      to   Europe,     their   rarity being
explained by the fact that their preparation is                  a  religious custom of
these    Indians.         Dr Duns, therefore,           suggested     to me that this
trophy would be interesting to the Fellows of the Society in rela
tion to      a  somewhat similar specimen               which forms the subject of
his paper.        This curious preparation            is a human head,          which by
some process,         known     only    to   the Indians,       has    been    dried and
reduced in bulk to its present condition.                   It  consists of the entire
scalp and face-skin, the features             being perfectly preserved,           the eyes
closed, and eyebrows          remaining intact.          There is an aperture at the
base of       the head,     through which the bones and other structures
have    been     removed,     leaving only the dried and shrunken integu
ments.        The hair is of a deep black colour, very thick,                      soft  and
glossy, and about 20 inches              in length.       The    measurements         of the
head    are as    follows :— From         roots   of hair or forehead         to nose,     1
                                                                                             \

 inches;     length of ear,     If inches.       The lips are sewn together, and
a   number of strings hang from                  them,    the   use of which          is not
apparent."
    There is considerable difference              between      the red    specimen       and
 that thus described by Dr Pullar, both in measurement                           and other
 respects.      I  have    brought them        together    for comparison,        with the
 view of indicating features of which we have no record in the papers
 referred     to above.      While, of      course,    the accuracy      of craniometric
 characterisations is        not attainable and           not sought here, yet the
 leading lines of skull measurement                may be followed        with    regard to
 the integument, which still retains much of the shape it had before
 the bones were         removed.       In view of this explanation,            I   give the

      In   the Pastaza specimen the septum of the nose and the eyebrows
are awanting — the former evidently by injury after the head                                       was
 prepared.         In the Jivaro           specimen      the integument, at a point
answering          to   about the middle of the coronal suture,                            has been
 squeezed together           as   if  between      the forefinger and thumb, thereby
 increasing the height of the forehead.                   In the other          the compression
 is in the skin which covered                  the spot where         the coronal and tem
 poral sutures meet, thereby giving an aspect of greater                                 breadth to
 the brow.          The ears of the Pastaza specimen                are smaller than those
  of the Jivaro, and in the ear lobes of both are holes, which show
 that large ear ornaments had been worn.                             The        hair of both is
 thick,      strong,   tending to lanky, and of            a glossy,       deep black colour.
  Both       have   an exaggerated          prognathous appearance.                 Does the dif
 ference of colour point to             a  tribal difference    1
       Artificial deformation           of the      head   has     long been            noticed by
 ethnologists.          It  is   widespread.         Anciently it was not unknown
  in Europe, and it            can now be         traced in Polynesia, Asia, Africa,
  and both Americas.                It was the expression of conventional ideas
  of beauty,        as  among      the    ancient Peruvians,           and also among               the
  still extant tribe of Flat-heads in North America                       ;    while,     as regards
  the cutis, it is also met with among the Maories of New Zealand.
   It  is practised on the dead             as a mark of devotion to the                     memory
   of relatives among            the   Andaman        Islanders;         and,      as   a   proof of
  success       in war      among      the    Dyaks of Borneo,                 the    Jivaros and
   Pastaza's of Ecuador, and the Mundurucus                     of the Upper Amazon —
   facts which raise questions of much importance to ethnology,                                      as
  bearing on the geographical distribution                     of tribes, and the import
   of    the    existence      of identical      customs      and superstitions                among
  nations far remote            from each other.           It  is also worthy              of notice

 624                   Proceedings      of  the  Boyal Society
 that the Munduruciis        should differ widely from their comparatively
 near neighbours, the        Macas tribes, in the preparation of the head,
 and yet agree with the Bornean families.                      The      Mundurucu           dots
 not attempt to remove          the bones, or to reduce                the natural size        of
 the head.       His  effort  is to preserve        the natural likeness and the
 usual ornamentation.          This is shown in the photograph on the
 table.
     As  regards    the   Ecuador specimens,            it   is   impossible as yet to
 account for the fact, that we have so little information                        as to     their
 meaning and the modes of preparing them, while so much has been
 recorded   touching the several habits and industrial art of the tribes
 among whom they occur.             In the    reference       to the Macas          head,     by
 Sir John Lubbock,        the following passage occurs              : — " The     process      of
 preparation, according to the account given me by Mr Buckley,
 is very simple.         The head is removed,               and,     after being boiled
 for   some    time with an        infusion      of herbs,         the bones,        &c, are
 removed     through the neck.          Heated stones are then put into the
 hollow, and as they cool are continually                   replaced       by others     ;  the
heat thus applied dries and contracts             the skin.          It will   be seen     that
 Mr Buckley's account confirms that of M. Barriero.                             A string is
 then run through the head, which is suspended                           in the hut, and
 solemnly abused        by the     owner, who          is    answered        by the priest
speaking for the head, after which the mouth is sewn up to prevent
any chance        of reply."      But Sir John             leaves      out an important
sentence    in M.     Barriero's    account, who           says   :—
                                                                        " This is how I
understood the matter ; however,              I  may not have well understood
the   process."      This theory of desiccation by                  the     application       of
heated stones is not satisfactory.            It   is more likely the explanation
will   be  found in connection with "             the boiling for some time               with
a n  infusion    of herbs."      Rapid     shrinkage might, perhaps,                 be thus
obtained equal       all over, and without           folding, especially          if   accom
panied by quick drying.           And     I  may     put a question in this con
nection which, however,         I feel  wholly unqualified to answer.                    Does
what we know of the drying powers of the acid in certain vegetable
oils, and of the action of tannic acid on skin, warrant a guess that
there    may    be properties    in   the   herbs     used      in    these   preparations
which, being set free by boiling, might produce the result                            ?    The
linger and thumb marks already referred                 to might be accounted                for

by   the hypothesis that the heads were held over heated           stones after
being taken from the infusion of herbs.            There is room enough to
speculate.      I think,   however, the speculation is warranted by (may
it not be said) the attainments of some of the Upper Amazon tribes
in organic chemistry ! How otherwise can we account for their
skill to separate, by a complex process, the starch in the tubers of
the manioc plant (Janipha manihet) from the strong narcotic poison
they contain, and to give to the people the former as a nutritious
bread — farinha or cassava — the "Bread of Brazil?"                  Or, even,
how      otherwise   could     they prepare    from  other plants the arrow
poison, or woorare       1    It   would not   be  a great  surprise to learn
that, having gouged         the   bones  from scalp and face-skin, their skill
as herbalists, aided by a       little careful manipulation, enabled them to
realise these    shrunk heads.         As regards their meaning, it seems to
me we have information            enough on this point to warrant the in
ference that they were used by the native priests as oracles, and
that the strings, with their blood-red marks, were connected              with
this  use.

        Sums of the Volumes of the Constituents.                          By J. Holms
        Pollok,         Chemical         Laboratory,          Glasgow       University.
         Communicated by Sir William Thomson.                           (Plate    XXII.)
   My attention          was   first drawn to the change             of volume      which
takes place when a salt is dissolved                in different quantities of water,
by an   experiment shown by Sir William Thomson in his class at the
Glasgow University.               He     took a wide glass         tube,   about 3     feet
long, sealed at one end, and having a narrow tube attached to the
other end.        The lower half of this tube he filled with a saturated
solution of common salt, and on the top of that he placed                       a layer of
water, which        just   reached     a    mark about the middle of the small
tube.     He then corked the open end, and mixed up the water and
brine by inverting          the tube two or three times, when it was seen
that the solution had contracted.
   After   seeing this experiment,              I determined     to find the amount       of
contraction that takes            place    ;   but, instead of taking        a  saturated
solution,   I  took      1 gramme       of the anhydrous salt, and ascertained
the amount of contraction that takes place on dissolving it in any
quantity of water from            1 gramme        to 20.
   These results        I calculated      from the tables of specific gravities of
solutions     of    salts,   given     in Storer's Dictionary of Solubilities.
Those for the curves at              15° were obtained by Gerlach, with the
exception of those for alcohol, which were taken by Fownes                           ;  the
specific   gravities for the others were obtained by Schiff, with the
exception of those for lead nitrate, which were by Hassinfratz.                        The
contractions were found by means of the formula
                               i,_
                                _ A           B     A+B

where     C is the contraction in cubic centimetres,                  A  the   number of
grammes of the substance             taken, B the number of grammes of water
added, and       a,  b,  and   r the     specific    gravities of the substance,        the

grammes of water which gives                           a saturated        solution, the contraction
¦which takes place amounts to -255                           c.c, on adding sufficient water
to   make this        3 grammes         the contraction increased                      to "256    c.c, and
on adding another                gramme          it    increased        to -278         cc,    and       so on
until 20 grammes                 of water were                   added,       when      the contraction
amounted         to    '350 cc.              These results                I    have represented             by
curves,   the ordinates giving the contractions                               in cubic     centims.,      and
the    abscissas      the number of grammes                           of water added to produce
those contractions           ;   the curves start at the point of saturation of the
solutions,      and the height of this point above the line of abscissas
represents the amount of contraction                                   that    takes      place   when       1
gramme        of the substance               is dissolved in as small a quantity                            of
water    as possible.            It will     be noticed that there                     is contraction in
every    case   with        the exception of ammonium chloride, which                                    gives
an expansion on dissolving, but                         as water is added                 the amount of
this expansion diminishes — that                       is,
                                                         a       solution when diluted contracts.
In    order to bring the curves for ammonium chloride into the diagram,
I    have added        -1   c.c. to each of them, which must therefore                               be sub
tracted in order to obtain the true change of volume.
     From the         appearance        of the curves and by trial,                   I   find that they
are portions of equilateral hyperbolas having asymptotes parallel to
x and y, and          may be represented                by the general equation
                                         ij=b
                                                        a        x
                                                                  ,

 where    y   is    the     contraction in cubic centims., x the number                                     of
grammes of water added, a the distance from                                     y     of the asymptote
 parallel to y, and          b   the distance from x of the                          asymptote       parallel
 to x, and    C    the constant         (a   +   x)(b

              for      MgS04 a =               -429          = -374 and              = -500,
                                                                               C C

              for      CaCL,        a   = 1-857         b= -240 and            C=      -391,
              for      K2C03        a=     1-644        6= -374 and            C     = -501.
     Although       the curves        of contractions for all salts appear                               to be
 portions of equilateral hyperbolas, other substances                                     give very dif
 ferent curves.           Thus alcohol contracts until you have added                                3   parts
 of water, and then the amount of contraction begins to                                        diminish;

628                           Proceedings           of the Royal Society
therefore,        if    we take        a mixture            of    3    parts of water and                1   part of
alcohol and add water to                   it,   we get an expansion.                       In   cases where
I    have       drawn the curves for two different temperatures,                                     the effect
of increase of temperature                 is    to diminish the amount of contraction.
     On the right hand side of the diagram the volume of                                             1   gramme
of the salt in cubic centims                   is   placed at the extremity of each of the
curves,      and      if it   be desired to obtain the increase                           of volume of                  a
given weight of water on adding to                               it   1   gramme of      a   salt,   it      is   only
necessary to subtract the contraction from this number, and you get
the increase of volume.                  From this           it    will       be observed     that Dalton's
theorem         — that     the volume of water was not increased                             by dissolving
in   it   an anhydrous salt capable            of taking up water of crystallisation
— does not hold                 good    in any of the cases taken, except that of
sodium carbonate              ;   and there      it   only holds good provided the salt be
dissolved in not less than twenty times its own weight of water.
     P.S. — Since writing                the     above      I          find    that in 1846          a        paper
was published              by     John Joseph Griffin, on                        the    " Constitution              of
Aqueous Solutions of Acids and Alkalies," in which he points out
that the volume occupied by                    a    substance             in solution     varies     with the
quantity         of water in which                  it      is    dissolved,           thus controverting
Dalton's theorem.                 In this      paper he gives contractions of the com
mon acids              and alkalies, and also of K2C03,                                 Na.2C03,         NH4C1,

  5.   On the Increase of Electrolytic                                    Polarisation with Time.
                                       By Mr W. Peddie.
     The law of variation of the electromotive force of polarisation
with current-density               has been very thoroughly investigated.                                     It    is
found that        it    may be represented               by an equation of the form
                                          F    =    a   -   bfex,
where       x    is    the current-density, and a,                        b,
                                                                          c     are constants.               So for
very feeble           direct currents the reverse polarisation current                                       is   pro
portional to the current-density                     ;      but for strong currents                  it      cannot
be expressed by an algebraical formula as                                 a    function of the current

density in a finite series of terms.    The above formula gives the
maximum    value   of the  polarisation current. So far as I know,
no observations             have          been     made            regarding its variation with time
from       its    commencement                   until        the     maximum         is     reached.       This
question is of interest chiefly from                           a    theoretical point of view.               The
object of this note              is to describe                    the result of some experiments
made on this subject.                     Platinum            electrodes,       heated to redness before
each experiment, were used.                                  The electrolyte was a              5   per cent,

these      experiments are shown graphically by the subjoined curves.
The ordinates             are   proportional                  to    the current-strength,           and         the
abscissae        represent         time.            These            curves      closely      resemble          the
logarithmic         curve in form.                      To    test how close the correspondence
is,   we may assume the equation
to be true, when          j     is        the    polarisation           current,    t   is   the time, and

The position of this curve                          is   shown in the figure by means                         of the

current-density was different.                           Here the point (-37,                 0)    is      taken as
origin.     The       equation            to    this         curve calculated from                    the points
corresponding to            t    -   5,
                                     t     =    7,   ....     on the assumption that                         it   is   a
logarithmic curve,            is
                                          i=-116--101«--218'.
It   'will be seen that this curve coincides with that obtained by
experiment except near the origin.                             I       find that the observed points
lie very accurately on                a   curve whose equation                   is   of the form

       6.  On Thermometer Screens.                  By John Aitken, Esq.
                                  (Plate     XXIII.)
                                      Part III.
    In my previous communications to the Society on this subject *
some different forms of thermometer screens               are described, and the
results are given of a number of trials made with them during trying
conditions of weather.         The result of these tests showed that all the
screens gave readings a       little too high when       there   was much radia
tion, and that the thermometer in the fan apparatus                  also indicated
too high a temperature,         the readings of a fine-bulbed thermometer
in  a  polished silver case being taken as our standard of temperature
in  these trials.     The reasons are given for the thermometer in the
draught screens indicating too high temperature,               and  the ineffectual
attempts made at the time to check these errors are described.
    Confining our attention for          a  moment to the draught screen, fig.
 3, and the fan apparatus,         figs.   5  and 6, of previous papers.        The
reasons for the thermometer           in   screen fig. 3 reading too high are     —
 1st, the outside     of the   case being heated        by the sun, part of this
 heat   is conveyed inwards           to the thermometer,        being conducted
 through     the concentric tubes,           and radiated from tube to tube,
 the air passing over the surface of the tubes not being able complete
 ly  to check this transference          of   heat ; 2nd, the too high      readings
 given by this screen are also in                part due to    the heat    radiated
 and reflected    from the ground, and entering the lower end of the
 tube.    The introduction        of small screens into the tube below the
 thermometer to check the entrance of radiant heat, while admitting
 a free passage    of the air, was not found to improve the correctness
 of the readings given by this screen.              The entering air seemed to be
 heated as much by the screens as the bulb was by direct radiation.

                        of Edinburgh, Session 1885-86.                           633
 A third reason of the too high readings is that some of the air heated
 on the outside of the case is driven by air currents past the annular
 openings    and enters the central tube.             The too high readings given
by the fan apparatus         would be principally        due to the heat conducted
through the walls of the air passage and radiated to the thermometer,
and very little       of it to heat radiated by outside objects entering by
the air passage.
   In the attempts         to devise arrangements          to correct   these errors,
I  have been         guided very much by two                conclusions arrived at
in  a previous part of this investigation.                The one conclusion was,
that   if  we    wish a body to acquire              the temperature of the        air
it must     be infinitely     small, and in practice it should be            as small
as   possible; the smaller it is the nearer                will its  temperature   be
to that of the air.            The other conclusion was,            that all radiant
heat must be prevented from falling on the bulb of the thermometer,
because the radiant heat            is absorbed,      not only at the surface, but
also internally, by the glass walls of the bulb, and the passing                   air
carries away heat only from the outside of the bulb, which explains
the reason why, in practice, it was not found possible to check the
heating effect of      a very small amount of radiation by any velocity of
air current that could       be made to pass over the bulb.
   This investigation         thus naturally       divides itself into two parts.
The first, how best to check the heat absorbed by the outside of the
case,  and prevent       it getting     to the thermometer        ; the second, how
best to check the entrance           of radiant heat at the opening by which
the air enters.
   Taking     these two points        in their    order, we shall confine for the
present     our attention to the question               how best to prevent       the
thermometer being heated by the hot                case  by which it is surrounded.
In the    screen shown      in  fig. 3 of the previous paper, the transference
of heat was checked by the non-conducting                     concentric tubes and
air passages.        The    cooling     effect   of the air in this arrangement
cannot, however, be perfect,           on account of the length of the surface
over which      it flows in an     even stream     ;   only the lower edges, where
the air first touches      these tubes,     will  be cooled    to near the tempera
ture   of the air, the upper parts             being warmer and         warmer the
further they are away from the entrance.
   Guided by the principle already referred to, it appeared that the

634                    Proceedings      of the Royal Society
best method of causing the walls of the tube to acquire                           the   tem
perature    of the air, and at the same time prevent heat passing                      from
the outer case to the thermometer, would                   be to surround        the   bulb
with   a tube    of some open or porous material, such as cloth, through
which the air could be made to pass, and to cause the air                          to enter
one end of this tube, and to pass radially through its walls in                           the
manner shown in Plate              XXIII.     fig.  1,  where a is the outside case
heated by radiation, t the thermometer,                and c a tube    of   some     porous
material surrounding the thermometer and placed inside the draught
tube as shown.        The arrows in the figure show the direction of the                   air
currents in the draught tube under these conditions,                        from which
it will  be seen that the air currents are made                to flow in     a   direction
the opposite of that in which the heat tends to move                      ;  and it was
expected     that the outward-moving              air currents would          check       the
inward movement of the heat, and prevent it arriving at the thermo
meter ;    also   that the passing        air would       cause    the  inside surface
of the tube rapidly to acquire            the temperature of the air,               and to
follow its changes quickly.
    The trials with this arrangement were quite successful.                              The
advance     of heat     was    so   perfectly    held in check by            it that the
thermometer kept at the temperature                    of the air, even when the
surrounding       tube   was    highly   heated.        As  these experiments may
have    some interest,     I  shall give somewhat in detail the results of
some experiments made            with   some different materials used for                this
purpose.       As it was winter, and no experiments of this kind were
possible   in   the open air, a draught screen was prepared for making
the   trials in the laboratory.           This     apparatus     is shown       in fig. 2    :
a is the   case   surrounding the thermometer t              ; c is the  draught tube,
 heated   by   a gas   jet  d,    for promoting a circulation           of air     ; e   is a
 screen placed      below the gas flame to prevent heat being radiated
 downwards to the thermometer             case.      The air enters the lower end
 of the  case,   and is drawn upwards by means of the column of heated
 air in the draught tube        c.   As it   was necessary       to put this method
 of protecting the thermometer to as severe a trial as possible,                          the
 outer case a, surrounding            the thermometer,         was jacketed         by the
 case  /, which could        be kept     hot with steam.            The thermometer
 could be thus exposed to radiation from a surface all round it having
 a temperature      of 100° C.

       In experimenting                on this method of protecting the thermometer,
different materials                were          used       for making the                  porous        tube   ;   the
results will             be   here given of the trials                    with muslin, wire-cloth,                   and
cotton wool                   The material under trial was rolled up in the shape
of     a tube and placed inside the case of the draught tube, as shown
at g, and the piotecting                        power       of   one, and          of   a    number of thick
nesses of the different materials was measured.
       As     the question to be determined                           was, how much                  the thermo
meter         surrounded by the hot                      case was heated                above       the tempera
ture of the air when protected                               in this manner                   by the different
materials,          it   was necessary that the temperature                                 of the air should
be very accurately                determined.               In   conducting the investigation, it
soon         became        evident that a thermometer hung up in the room
could not be relied upon for this purpose,                                           as     it     was    too much
affected by radiation, from the fire, from gas flames, and                                                 from the
body of the observer                   ;   for the amount of difference                          required to be
measured            was       not degrees, but fractions                        of      a    degree.       Another
draught screen was therefore                             prepared,        and      a thermometer               placed
in     it.        The thermometer                 in this         screen        was         well    protected        by
concentric           tubes ;       a gas flame              placed         close     to the         case    had no
effect        on     it,   and all radiation                 from         below was easily checked.
The draught was kept up in this screen, as in the other, by means
of   a   jet of     gas    in   the upper part of the tube.                             The temperature               of
the air as given by this screen could be relied upon to                                                    a     small
fraction of          a     degree.         In    the trials, the two draught screens were
placed as near                each other as convenient, generally about one-third
of   a   metre apart.
     The thermometers                  used      in    these trials were graduated                         to Centi
grade degrees.                The scale of both of them was very wide, and each
degree         was       divided       into      tenths — the             scale      of the         one showing
the temperature                 of the air            was    4   "2   mm.       to the degree, and the
other        5
             -5     mm.         to the      degree.         The thermometers                       were    carefully
compared            with        each       other in water,                and corrections                 made       for
difference.
     In experimenting with this                           arrangement             of apparatus,            the       gas
was lighted in both draught tubes to produce                                         a      circulation of the
air.         In   the screen under trial                 a   No.      1   jet   was used turned down
to one            quarter of full               flame,      and kept as constant as possible

636                         Proceedings            of    the    Royal Society
during the trials.            The first trials were made with the thermometer
case    as   it      came from the work, but                        without         polishing         the   inside
surface that radiated heat to the thermometer.                                       A   number of trials
were made            with it in this condition, of which it                              is unnecessary          to
give the detailed results.                   It   may, however, be mentioned, that                            with
the usual draught and with no protection between                                         the thermometer
and the      walls of the case — that                   is,   with the bulb            exposed           all round
to radiation           from bright tin at              100° — the           thermometer           rose to 18°,
the temperature            of the air being 12°; that                       is,
                                                                              it    was heated 6° above
the temperature            of the air.            When         one thickness of wire-cloth and
two thicknesses of muslin                         were        placed    between          the bulb and the
case, the radiation            was almost entirely                     cheeked,          and the thermo
meter rose only about 0°-2 above the temperature                                       of the air.
   As   it   could not be expected that the inside of the case would keep
bright after being long in use,                    it    was thought advisable to make the
tests under the             most    disadvantageous conditions                               possible.         The
inside of the case was therefore painted black.                                          When             this was
done,   a    great increase        in the heating                effect on the thermometer was
produced,          as was to be expected.
   In   the following          tables are given the results of some experiments
made with            the   inside of the case blackened, and with fine cloth as
the     protecting         material.           The        protection              effected      by        different
numbers of thicknesses was tried, and the results are given.                                                  The
cloth used in these trials was book-muslin, about 56 meshes to the

duced by the warm            case ;  and in column 4 the protection placed
between      the thermometer and the hot           case.
    It will    be observed      that when there was no protection between
the thermometer          and the case, the thermometer got heated 18°-2
above      the temperature of          the air, or three      times more than it
was     before the radiating surface           was    painted black.     It will    be
noticed that a Ringle thickness of muslin placed between the ther
 mometer      and    the  case  greatly checked the radiation         ; that as the
number of thicknesses was increased,                  the heating effect rapidly
diminished      ; and    when twelve folds or thicknesses were between
the two,       not the slightest        effect   could be    detected.     This   test
has been repeated a number of times with the same result                           To
check the results,         readings were      taken with the steam off and the
case cold.       Steam was then turned on, the case heated, and readings
taken.       Steam    then cut off, and cold water circulated through the
jacket, but not the slightest difference            could be detected under the
two conditions, showing that the thermometer was thoroughly pro
tected      by twelve thicknesses of muslin.               The protection was of
course      perfect only under the condition of the experiment.                 If the
 draught was reduced by shutting off the gas, and the air heated only
 by the small amount it got in its passage through the case, then the
 thermometer       rose a very   little  above the temperature       of the air.
     No comparative trials        were     made    with black   and white muslin,
 as   it  was not possible to get two muslins similar               in every  respect
 except colour; but       as we are here     dealing with dark heat,      it does not
 seem    likely that this would       have any effect.
     The next two tables          give the results of tests made with two
 different kinds       of wire-cloth      as the protecting      material.    In the
 first table are given the results obtained with wire-cloth made with
 No. 35 iron wire and 36 meshes to the inch; in the second                       table
 the results obtained with No. 38 brass wire and 70 meshes to the
 inch.
     The contents      of the different columns in these two tables                 are
 arranged as in the last one.              It will   be observed    that the results
 with wire-cloth       are not so good        as  with the muslin; this will         be
 due partly to the conducting power of the wire, and also probably

 These tables show very little difference in the protecting powers               of
 the two wire-cloths.        The tables must not, however, be compared
 too  closely,    as the conditions    do not admit of very exact results.

fairly well    at the two ends, they do not agree at intermediate points.
This  disagreement      at the intermediate points will probably be the

the greater or less degree of contact between tho folds of the cloth.

    The   above     table   shows the result with cotton wool.                   The kind
known as medium quality was used, the sheets of which are not so
thick   as   those of a finer kind.          For supporting the cotton wool in
its place      inside the     case,   a wire-cloth        cage was       used,   its inside
being    lined     with    one   thickness       of    the wool        from    which     the
shin had been previously removed.                   This extremely feeble-looking
protection, as       will   be seen     from     the table, acted perfectly;             the
thermometer when protected by               it  was quite unaffected           by the hot
case.    A    number of readings were taken when the                     case was heated
to 100°, and when cooled with water, but not the slightest difference
could    be detected.        Without any          gas to assist       the draught, the
temperature      rose 0o-2 above the temperature of the air.
    It will    be noticed that a very          thin covering of cotton wool or
muslin,     when employed in the manner here                        described,      is quite
sufficient to stop the advance of all heat from the warm walls of the
case surrounding the thermometer; and further,                       it is interesting    to
notice that the amount of muslin and cotton wool that stops all heat
is far from being        able   to stop all     light        A  good    deal of   light  can
 come through a sheet of cotton wool, or twelve thicknesses of muslin.
This peculiar action reminds             us of the somewhat similar action of
glass and other substances,            which pass the rays of one end of the
spectrum, while they stop those of the other.
    When we consider the action of muslin                        used    in this manner
to    check     radiation, we     see   it is    one     that    has    been    long    well
known.         Gardeners are       well acquainted with the fact that any
cloth, however thin, spread over plants, is                 a great  protection to them
on frosty nights.           The action of the cloth on these occasions is
exactly the same as in the thermometer                   case ; the    thin cloth checks
radiation, and prevents the heat from passing into space.                        The cloth
itself is but little cooled by radiation,         as  it is constantly receiving        heat

 from the air passing through its meshes, the air on these occasions
 being always hotter than the exposed surfaces of bodies.                                    The   plant
 therefore       makes       its heat-exchanges              with a surface         but little cooled
 by radiation instead of with the cold of space, as tempered by our
 atmosphere.           We      see    from this that the protection                     afforded     by
 these      cloths on frosty nights is efficient only on what are called
 radiation frosts; the cloth has no power to heat the air.                              Further, we
 see    that the efficiency of the cloth will be                 a good.deal         affected by    the
 amount of wind; the better the air circulation the warmer the cloth
 will     be — that    is,   the less    it   will   be cooled by radiation.            It   may also
 bo observed          that an open             cloth may be under certain conditions a
 better protection than              a   close covering.         From the experiments with
 muslin in the draught tube                    it    was seen that one             thickness of this
 material reduced the radiation effect to less than half.                              From experi
 ments made at night with                     one radiation thermometer,               protected by
a    piece of muslin stretched                  horizontally at         a   little distance above
 it,   while another was freely exposed                       to the sky,    I      found that one
thickness of the same muslin reduced the cooling effect of radiation
to almost exactly one half, the less circulation of the air at the                                 time
accounting for the difference.
     It   is   now long since            Dr Joule first laid down certain imaginary
conditions under which                   it   might be possible to get the true tem
perature       of the air.         The method proposed by him was to place the
thermometer in           a    long vertical tube, open at both ends, but with                         a
cap by which           the lower end could be closed.                       This     tube was to be
surrounded with          a    jacket by means of which               it   could be heated to any
desired temperature.                 The temperature of this tube was to be care
fully adjusted,        so that the air inside of                it   tended neither to ascend
nor to descend when the cap was taken                            off.       When this condition
of matters was arrived at, the air inside the tube would evidently
have the same temperature                     as the   air outside of        it,   and the thermo
meter would          be at the true temperature of the air, as the radiating
surfaces       all round      it   would have           the same temperature             as the    air.
It   is   needless     to say        these      conditions      could not be carried into
practice,      for taking observations except where the temperature                                was
nearly constant,         and       the air free         from currents        ;     in the open air,
winds and the constant changes of temperature                                there    taking place
would make        it   quite impracticable.

     By the method             here described we do seem                to have a practical way
of surrounding            the       thermometer with the air to be tested, and of
causing the surrounding                   tube to take up and follow the changes in
the temperature of the air.                  By    means of muslin, cotton wool, or wire-
cloth, through which the air is made to circulate,                            it   does seem possible
to surround the thermometer with a tube at the temperature                                                of the
                  it from all radiation from surrounding objects.
air, and to protect
Under the conditions existing in the open air, where the case is
never very highly heated, the error, when the thermometer is pro
tected      in this manner,           need never amount to more than 0°'01, or less
than a readable amount on all thermometers                              in general           use.
     But though          we can by the above means surround the thermometer
with air at the correct temperature,                       and with a tube at the tempera
ture of the air, yet our difficulties are far from being at an end.                                          We
unfortunately cannot get the air into and out of the tube without
openings,         and these openings either allow radiant heat to fall on the
thermometer,             or    if   we place       screens    to check the               radiation, then
these       screens      heat the air in its passage over them                      ;    the air and the
inside walls of the tube get thereby heated, and the thermometer
gives too high a reading.
     The investigation has, therefore,                     been continued in this direction,
and some preliminary                    experiments made on different methods of
checking the entrance of radiant heat                         ;   it   is unnecessary,                however,
to give here more than a brief outline                            of the results.               For making
experiments on this radiation                       effect, the lower end of the draught
tube      was placed           horizontally        with its opening in front of                           a large
gas flame,           which was          allowed       to     radiate     freely         to      the    thermo
meter, the upper part of the draught tube being,                                   as before,         vertical,
to produce the required draught.                           With the draught produced                         by a
small jet of gas, the error due to heating by radiation from the flame
was      0°-45.         Screens       were   then placed          inside the            case,    like louvre
boards, to prevent the radiation                           falling     on    the bulb,            but       their
presence          was    found to increase            the error.            The effect of             a   strong
draught of air produced by                     a   fan was then tried, the screens being
removed and the flame allowed to radiate direct to the bulb, but the
effect of the           powerful blast was only to reduce the error from 00-45
to 0*-35      ;    that       is,   the strong draught only gave               a   reduction of ^gth

of   a strong draught of air to check the effects of radiation has been
noticed in a previous part of this investigation.            With   the screens
replaced     in the tube in front of     the thermometer and fan        draught
the error was 0°-3.
     As  the introduction   of screens between the source of the radiation
and the thermometer bulb produced very              little improvement even
with    a  strong draught, probably because the entering air got as        much
heat on the warmed screens as the bulb did by direct radiation,               an
arrangement       was   devised in which      all air that had touched the
screens,     or sides of the case, was drawn through side passages,
and only the central core of the entering air allowed to pass to the
thermometer.         When this    arrangement    of apparatus   was tried,   the
error with     gas draught was reduced       to 0o,15, and   with fan draught
to only about 0°05.

men contains of high importance.           For while   to most patients a dose
of five or six grains of pure, or nearly pure, nitrite of sodium is as
large a quantity as they can conveniently bear, we read* of twenty
and thirty grains of so-called nitrite of sodium having been adminis
tered without dangerous       or very unpleasant results.         In  such  cases
we cannot but conclude the drug was impure, and MacEwan                    t  has
shown that samples of nitrite of sodium were met with in commerce
containing but a decimal percentage            of the salt.      Many papers     J
have recently appeared      on the estimation of nitrite of ethyl in the
spirit of nitrous ether, but in this contribution         I desire   only to con
sider those methods suitable for the estimation of nitrous acid in its
inorganic compounds.         While many      methods     are employed for this
purpose,   that chiefly followed in pharmaceutical chemistry is one or
other of the modifications of the permanganate               process, a process
first applied to the volumetric         estimation of inorganic nitrites by
Feldhaus.§      He presumably obtained the           idea from Forchhammer
of  Copenhagen,     who in 1850 described        a process   for the estimation
of organic matter in potable waters by permanganate                of potassium.
The   process, as applied to nitrites, depends upon the power of per
manganate     of potassium,    especially in the presence of free acid (pre
ferably sulphuric), to oxidise nitrous to nitric acid, as may thus be
expressed    in the case of nitrite of sodium     : —
         4H2S04 + 2KMn04+ 5NaN02 = 2MnS04 + 2KHS04
                              +  5NaN03 + 3H20.
    Taking the same example,        it is obvious that     to estimate the per
 centage   of actual nitrite in commercial nitrite of sodium, all we
require is to ascertain    the amount of permanganate           (representing a
certain quantity of oxygen) which a given quantity of the commer
cial nitrite can decolorise,      and compare it with the quantity which
would be decolorised by an absolutely pure nitrite.                   This latter
quantity is readily enough ascertained          from the atomic weights of
the elements.       The simplest method of estimating the amount of

permanganate,          and therefore    of oxygen required, is to follow such            a
process     as Feldhaus        describes    in  a  later paper   * than that     I   have
referred to.         He    recommends       the nitrite   to   be dissolved     in very
slightly     acidulated water,         and permanganate         of potassium to be
 added     until   the oxidation of the nitrous acid is nearly completed,
 when the solution          is to be made        strongly acid, and permanganate
run in until         a  permanent light red coloration is obtained.                 Now,
as   Fresenius t points out, and           as  very little experience teaches          us,
nitrous acid, owing to its great tendency to decompose                       in watery
solution with the formation of nitric acid and nitric oxide, requires
in such an estimation           as that we are considering to be present           in the
amount of not more than              1  in 5000 of      water, and even      with this,
and     a  much greater degree of dilution, decomposition slowly pro
ceeds.      Furthermore,         we   must remember        anhydrous     nitrous     acid
(N203)
           — we cannot       speak of the hydrated        acid  (HN02),     as it is not
known in the pure state — has             a  boiling point of about      - 10° C, J so
that the risk is incurred of the estimation being vitiated not only
by decomposition, but by decomposition and volatilisation combined.
After     numerous      experiments with this method of Feldhaus,                I  have
not obtained satisfactory results.              The slowness of oxidation which
occurs when the feebly acidulated solution                 contains but little per
manganate,       gives time for those evils — volatilisation          and decomposi
tion — of which         I  have  just  spoken, to occur.       Moreover, since there
is some      difficulty in knowing when the reaction is almost, and even
more when         it  is quite, completed,        I  have  been led to look for a
modification of the permanganate               process —  a modification which will
allow very rapid oxidation of the nitrous to nitric acid.                       To add
some excess of permanganate,              and estimate that excess by a reducing
agent, has been frequently described,               but I obtain    the most satisfac
tory results by using          a large   excess of permanganate,         and   titrating
back with some suitable reducing agent.                    Such an agent may be
found in oxalic acid,           as  suggested     by Kinnicult and Nef,§ or in
ammonio-ferrous sulphate,            as  employed by Feldhausen          and    Kubel.||

Or we may, as Tidy * recommends                         in   a process for the estimation of
organic matter in potable waters,                          add iodide              of potassium, and
estimate         the liberated iodine with hyposulphite                                (thiosulphate)          of
sodium, adding starch solution to indicate the exact point at which
to stop.   Muter t uses a very similar method for the estimation of
the nitrite in spirit of nitrous ether.                      I
                                        have carefully compared all
these methods,              and unhesitatingly          give preference                to that      in which
ammonio-ferrous sulphate is the reagent used, as                                      it,   while quite as
accurate,        is   more        easily employed than either of the other two
Assuming         a    temperature         of 60° F. to be taken as granted, the pro

nient strengths of which have been fixed after repeated                                           trials with
solutions containing varying amounts                       : —
      1.   Solution of Permanganate                of Potassium — one graminthe litre. —
This solution, although reerystallised                       permanganate               is   usually almost
pure, must have its exact strength calculated by titration in one or
other of the ordinary ways, — preferably,                        I        think,        against      metallic
iron or     a   ferrous      salt, although oxalic acid has                      a    powerful advocate
in BerthelotJ
      2.   Solution     of Ammonio-ferrous Sulphate. — It                          is   most convenient
that this solution be of such                  a   strength that      1     c.c.   will     be peroxidised
by, and        will therefore decolorise               1   c.c of       the permanganate                    solu
tion.       To   do this we require roughly 12-5 grammes of the iron salt
in the litre (12-4339 precisely).                       The mere watery solution soon
decomposes,           but
                        I       find the addition of             1   c.c. of pure sulphuric acid
for   each gramme of the salt employed (that                          is,
                                                                      I          add 12      '5   c.c. of acid
for    each litre of the solution)              keeps      the solution well, and also fur
nishes acid to assist the acid already added in decomposing the per
manganate,         and in converting the ferrous into the ferric salt.                                  Each
day the solution             is   used    it   must,    however, be titrated against the
permanganate,           a   process which occupies only                   a   few minutes.
      3.   Diluted Sulphuric Acid. — That of the British Pharmacopoeia
does       quite well, —     almost
                                it    in 12, but
                                     is            1am in the habit ofI
using      a   10 per cent,          solution of pure acid.                 It   is   very necessary to
be certain that the solution                   will not itself decolorise                    some perman
ganate, as impure sulphuric acid so generally does.

   4.  A  one per mille Solution        of   the Nitrite    to be investigated. —
In the   case of such nitrites as nitrite of silver, where the metal has a
high atomic weight (Ag=108),              it  is advisahle to use 2 per      mille.
But   as usually nitrite of sodium or potassium is the nitrite            in ques
tion,  1 in  1000 is the most suitable strength             Now,   as we are  deal
ing with the action of reducing agents on permanganate               of potassium,
a  question first started, so far     as   I   know, by Jones,* comes under
consideration.       He states that the action of oxalic acid, of ferrous
sulphate,   and of some other substances             with which he has experi
mented on permanganate          of potassium, in strong or in dilute solu
tion, and with or without the presence             of sulphuric acid, is accom
panied by the evolution of oxygen, and,                as   he mentions, such     a
statement    has an important bearing on the use of permanganate                 in
volumetric analysis.        I have  repeated some of Jones's experiments,
and while agreeing       with him that in strong solution such           an evolu
tion of oxygen does occur,       I am     quite unable to find any evidence
of the evolution of this gas with the dilute solutions                I have  men
tioned.     Moreover, the check experiments             I shall shortly allude to
confirm me in my opinion that no such fallacy can arise in this
modification of the permanganate process.             But if   no oxygen be given
off during the reduction of the permanganate,             is none given off when
 one adds the sulphuric acid to the potassium salt (the permanganate)              '?
 I have estimated      the amount of oxidising power possessed by a mix
 ture of the permanganate       and sulphuric acid solutions after standing
 for periods varying from      a few    seconds to 30 minutes, the reducing
 agent being a solution of ammonio-ferrous sulphate, and have found
 no diminution      in strength.     After boiling for        some time a mixed
 solution of permanganate        and sulphuric        acid,   and then estimating
 the oxidising    power, there is certainly        a marked but not very great
 diminution :— to      200 c.c. of distilled water, 50 c.c. of permanganate
 solution   (1 per 1000) and 10 c.c. diluted sulphuric acid (1 in 10)
 were added, and the mixed solutions at once titrated against ferrous-
 ammonium sulphate solution, of which 53-25 c.c. were                     used.   A
 similar mixture was gently boiled in a glass flask for three hours,
  when only 50"34 c.c. of the reducing agent were required to effect
 complete     decoloration.     Repetitions      of the experiment gave very
 similar results.     Further, in connection with the possibility of oxygen

                        of Edinburgh, Session 1885-86.                              647
 being given off during oxidation of the substance used to reduce the
 permanganate,      the solutions of permanganate              and of ferrous-ammo
 nium sulphate were separately            poured into long glass tubes, which
 having     been completely tilled         and closed       with the thumb,        were
 opened under water.          The liquids gradually mixed by diffusion, but
 no evolution      of gas could be detected.              Oxygen, however, being
 somewhat soluble in water            (roughly    3   volumes in 100 volumes of
 water), it may     be questioned whether,           in this last experiment       espe
 cially, oxygen might not be given off, and be dissolved by the water.
 The permanganate          and arumonio-ferrous solutions were separately
shaken up with pure air, and after standing for some little time were
 mixed     as before,   and as before gave negative results.
    The next point        I  wish to discuss is in what order should the
 various solutions be added         1    In all my experiments in          reference   to
 this question    I have employed sufficient           distilled water to dilute the
 the nitrous acid      in the nitrite,    to the extent of at least          1 in 5000,
and in all the same bulk of water and the same solution of the
nitrite  — nitrite of sodium — were employed.
    In this series, therefore — (1) I have added                the nitrite first, then
the acid, and immediately followed this by the permanganate; or
(2)   I  have run in permanganate              before the acid, and added this
latter (a) slowly and (b) rapidly ; and (3) finally,               I have added the
nitrite last, both (a) rapidly and (b) slowly.                    All these methods
give fairly approximate results, but all (with one exception) allow
some slight decomposition of the nitrous acid, evidenced by the
odour of nitric peroxide, and by the amount of permanganate                           de
colorised;     this    decomposition, judging           from the      odour and the
results of the analysis, being especially marked where the sulphuric
acid preceded the permanganate,             the nitrite     of sodium having been
added first.      The one exception was where the nitrite was slowly
added,    in a way   I shall afterwards mention, to the previously             acidified
permanganate       (3, a).
    Again, as anhydrous nitrous acid decomposes ammonia into nitro
gen and water according to the well-known                  equation,
                               +             =           +    3H20,

results with this permanganate            process   ?   Two    beakers, each contain

ing 50 c.c. of the permanganate                         and 10 c.c. of the sulphuric acid
solutions, were taken — to one a considerable amount of sulphate
of ammonium was added (as, of course, any ammonia or ammonium
salt present        would assume this form), and then to both an equal
amount of nitrite of sodium solution.                            In   each case precisely                     the
same amount of ferrous ammonium sulphate was reduced.                                                More
over, solutions of nitrite of ammonium gave concordant results,                                               and
results       which       indicated        that    no         secondary decomposition                     had
occurred.         Besides any nitrogen given off would almost certainly
have been manifested by bubbles of gas.
    These questions having been considered, we may now look to the
details of the method.                 A   tentative experiment, by the simple addi

original way,* is done to roughly ascertain how much permanganate
solution is required to oxidise the nitrous acid in 50 c.c.                                         of the
nitrite solution under examination, or the amount which                                        would          be
required, were the nitrite pure, is calculated, which                               is the simpler
plan, and one proceeds as follows : — Into a beaker of not less than
500 cc. capacity, 200 c.c. or so of distilled water is poured.                                           The
required number of c.c. of permanganate                           for 50 c.c. nitrite solution
being approximately known,                    twice or thereabouts that number is
run into the beaker, and then 10 c.c. of the 10 per cent sulphuric
acid (or 12 c.c. of the pharmacopceial diluted acid) is mixed with
this.  Now slowly add 50 c.c. of the nitrite solution, the addition
extending         over about one minute, and the nozzle of the pipette
being passed well below the surface of the liquid, and moved round
so as to agitate           the contents of the beaker.                  The nozzle             is drawn
above the surface               when almost empty, and a little distilled water
run over its exterior to wash off any adhering fluid from the beaker.
After waiting two or                 three minutes (less time is really sufficient, as
I   find after one minute no trace of nitrite, but it                         is,   as   a     matter of
precaution, well to wait about three minutes) titrate back with the
ammonio-ferrous solution to ascertain the amount of unchanged per
manganate.            The exact point of decolorisation                  is   best obtained                    by
zig-zag       titration,       a   method of obtaining             the end-point used with

 lent in c.c. of permanganate,       and in the ordinary way calculate the
 percentage    of nitrite the sample contains.
     To test the method, nitrite           of silver was precipitated from       a
 moderately strong solution          of nitrite     of potassium by nitrate of
 silver, and two grammes          of the recrystallised nitrite dissolved in
 lukewarm water were made up to one litre.                 As this nitrite  is not
 very stable,     the amount of silver was estimated            by chloride of
 sodium, and calculating from this basis           it was computed that every
 50 c.c. of the solution contained '02465 gram of anhydrous nitrous
 acid.    The following six consecutive estimations show the quantities
 actually found     : —

 The more commonly employed inorganic nitrites being that of those
 alkalies,  I   may here note that          I find    commercial specimens      of
 nitrite of sodium, either in rods or crystals, usually contain nitrous
 acid equal to 94-95         per cent,    of nitrite  ; specimens   of nitrite of
potassium an amount equal              to from 86-88      per cent, of the salt ;
whilst nitrite of ammonium, being very deliquescent, is consequently
sold in solution which generally contains, when not old, about 1 2
per cent, of actual nitrite.
    In this  paper, therefore,    I have    endeavoured to show —
    1.  That the permanganate        process as ordinarily    employed    for the
estimation of inorganic nitrites, viz., by gradually adding perman
ganate to the acidified solution of the nitrite, is unsatisfactory.
    2. That   it is desirable to use a large excess of permanganate,          and
titrate back with a reducing agent.
    3.  That very     accurate results are obtained by using comparatively
weak solutions of permanganate            and of the reducing agent.
    4.  That the most suitable reducing         agent is ammonio-ferrous sul
phate, and that both       it and  the permanganate      must not be in strong
solution.

by evolution       of oxygen, or by secondary            decomposition between
ammonia or ammonium compounds and nitrous acid.
2.   The   Absolute         Determination         of   the    Strength     of    an
        Electric     Current     by means of the Balance.                By Pro
        fessor James        Blyth, M.A.
    The object of this paper        is to describe     a method   of determining
the strength of an electric current in absolute measure by measuring,
in  grammes weight, the repulsion between two circuits each               carrying
the same current.
    For  convenience       of calculation, the circuits are made circles          of
equal radius,    and are placed     with their planes horizontal
    The construction of the instrument is as follows :— A delicate
chemical balance        is provided, with       the scale pans replaced     by two
suspended     coils of wire.      Each of these coils is made of          a  single
turn of moderately fine copper wire bent round a disc of glass of the
requisite diameter.         The ends of the wire, after being firmly tied
together for     a  considerable length with a thin layer of insulating
 material between, are bent so          as to  lie radially along the upper sur
face of the disc.         This disc   is cemented     concentrically to  a  similar
disc of slightly larger radius, so that the wire is firmly fixed             in the
step formed by the two discs.              The double disc has       a round hole
through its centre, by means of which it is attached to the end of a
wooden     cylinder.       At opposite    sides of this cylinder are fixed two
vertical rods of brass of equal length, and terminating at the top in
small platinum        cups   for holding      mercury or dilute acid.       To the
lower ends of these rods, one to each, are soldered              the ends of the
 copper wires which pass radially across the disc.              The whole is sus
pended    by   a  suitable hook from one end of the balance beam, and
 is so adjusted that the cups          are   in line with the knife edge at the
end of the beam, and have            their upper edges just a little above its
level.    A precisely similar coil        is suspended     from the other end of
 the beam, and the lengths and weights of both are so adjusted that,

when the index of the balance is at zero, the coils hang with their
planes       exactly in the same horizontal                 plane.         In order that    the
weighing may he at all exact it is necessary that the electrical con
nections,       by means of which the current is led through the sus
pended coils, be so made as to interfere as little as possible with
the sensibility          of the balance.       This is          in the following
                                                             affected
manner : — An insulated             copper    wire, having its ends tipped with
short lengths of platinum wire, is run along the lower edge of the
beam, being firmly lashed             to it by well-rosined silk thread.                    The
ends of this wire, bent twice at right angles, are so placed that their
platinum        tips dip vertically into one of each pair of the platinum
cups    which are attached to the vertical rods of the suspended coils.
From     the     other cup of each            pair proceed           two similarly     tipped
copper wires which run along the upper edge of the beam, and are
also firmly tied to it.         These wires only proceed as far as the middle
of the beam, where they are bent first outwards, one on each side of
the beam at right angles to             it,   and then downwards, so that the
platinum tips are vertical            These latter dip into             a   pair of platinum
cups attached to two vertical rods which spring from the base board
of the balance.           These rods are placed at equal distances on each
side of the beam, and are of such length that the platinum cups are
in line with the central knife               edge of the beam,               and with their
edges    just   a   little higher than its       level.          There are thus in all six
cups and six dipping wires.             Three of these are in line on one side
of   the beam and three             on the    other.        Also     the    line joining the
points of each pair of dipping wires                   is   made to coincide         with   the
corresponding knife edge; and further, the edges of all the cups are
in the same plane when the balance               is    in equilibrium.
     The fixed coils are made precisely in the same way as the sus
pended ones,        with this   exception,     that the wooden cylinder with its
vertical rods       is   removed.     One of these           is    placed      below one of
the suspended       coils (the right hand one usually), and the other,
having   a    large central opening for the reception of the supporting
cylinder and rods of the suspended coil,                    is   placed      above the other.
Each    is   supported from the base board of the balance                           by three
levelling screws, which also serve for adjusting the vertical distance
between       the   fixed and suspended          coils.          This   is   done   by means
of   three    distance     pieces of brass carefully worked so as to have the

652                   Proceedings       of  the   Royal Society
required length      as   determined by         a screw    gauge.    To enable the
respective    pairs of coils to be placed concentric with               each  other,
circles of equal radius are scratched on each glass disc, and the adjust
ment is made by looking from above downwards upon both discs from
holes in the top of the balance case.                  The ends of the wires pro
ceeding    from   the   fixed    coils   dip   into  mercury pools formed in the
base board of the balance,           which also serve for making connections
with the battery and the vertical rods which                   convey the current
into the suspended        coils.     The connections are so arranged that the
current circulates       in opposite directions in each fixed and corre
sponding suspended coil.           In this way repulsion       is always produced,
 no matter how the current enters and leaves the entire               circuit   The
 repulsion is measured by the number of grammes required to restore
 the balance to exact equilibrium.
    From the above description it will be obvious that any motion of
 the beam    in the  act of weighing causes only a very slight motion            of
 the platinum wires which dip into the fluid contained in the cups.
 In this way    the resistance       due   to the viscosity of the fluid is    very
 small, even   in  the case    of mercury, and much smaller when dilute
 acid is used.     In point of      fact, the diminution      of sensibility due to
 this cause is less than in the       case   of determining the specific gravities
 of solids by weighing in water in the ordinary way.                  With mercury
 it is quite easy to weigh accurately to a milligramme.
    The repulsion between          each pair of coils can be calculated from
 the formula given by Neuman               for the action between two current
 elements.
          Let  a = radius of each coil.
               a;=the distance between their planes.
               6 = the angle      between     the directions of an element ds of
                        the one circuit, and        in  element ds of the other,
                    the distance between          these elements.
  Then, if   M  denote the potential energy           due to the mutual action of
  the two circuits when each carries unit current, we have

3.  On some Variations in the Structure of Wool and               other1

   The structure of all animal hairs is very complicated,      and  pre
sents many difficulties, both to the scientific observer  and to those
who require to manipulate these fibres in the various processes of
textile and other manufactures.

 658                   Proceedings       of  the  Royal Society
    As    appendages     of the skin they are liable, like all the epidermal
growths, to great variation in structure, which is seen in its extreme
form in the feathers of birds, and in the horns, hoofs, nails,                      and
claws of the higher mammals.
    Apart however from          these great variations, there        are a   number of
smaller modifications, which, while they do not present                       the same
structural interest,      are of considerable value, as indicating differences
in   the breed of varieties of the same species, and are often                 of great
industrial importance.
    Many of      these smaller variations having come prominently                 under
my notice, especially in the case of wool, in a series of researches
extending over many years, in regard to the industrial classification
and use of these fibres,          I   thought it might be of interest to the
Fellows of the Royal Society,            if  I  communicated a short record           of
the more important variations which                I have noticed.
    Notwithstanding        the many researches which have been made                   in
this country, and especially in Germany, on the structure of animal
fibres,    they have hitherto          been    mainly directed to the variation
existing between fibres and hairs in general rather than in particular                  ;
that is to say, to the variation            in structure occurring between the
hairs and wools of different species of animals, rather than those
differences     which are found to obtain between               hairs on animals of
the same species and on the same individual.
    It  is to these specific     differences    in  the individual     hairs and wool
fibres    of sheep and other allied animals that                I  wish to call your
attention.
    The observations have for the most part been made on the fibres of
wool which have        a  commercial value, and were undertaken originally
for technical      purposes,   but they have also a special          scientific signifi
cance, as indicating        the constant tendency          in nature     to a reversion
to a more primitive type, and in exhibiting that wide variation which
is produced by environment and artificial selection in breeding.
    The    difference  in structure existing         between   wool and hair is one
which is exceedingly difficult            to define    scientifically, and although
in industrial practice amongst           experts    the distinction is well known,
it  depends upon such         slight    modifications that it is very difficult       to
determine where the characteristics of true hair                  cease,   and those of
wool commence, and vice versd.

                         of Edinburgh, Session 1885-86.                              G59
     The    difference    between wool and hair is rather one of           degree   than
of kind,      and all the wool-bearing animals have the tendency when
their cultivation is neglected to produce hair rather than wool, in
the same way that cultivated cotton when neglected reverts to the
original type of wild        cotton, and the fibres lose their spiral character,
which is of such value in the           process   of spinning.        This tendency
also always manifests itself whenever                the   conditions of soil and
climate are unfavourable to the fullest development of the animal,
and many sheep and other allied animals therefore produce both
wool and hair ; the fine hair in many animals being very like wool,
 and the coarse wool in others closely resembling hair.
     The true     difference  does not consist, as is generally supposed,        in  the
 fact, that wool possesses       a waved or curled structure in the fibre which
 is absent in     the case of many hairs, but     in   the method of attachment
 of  the epidermal scales which form the external covering of the fibre.
     The curled locks of the negro consist of true hair and not wool,
 and there are many cases in the lower animals where the structure of
 the fibre is that of      a true wool, while the straightness and want of
 curl usually associated with the hair is still retained.
     The general structural peculiarities which distinguish                them    from
  other epidermal growths, are however the same both in wool and
  hair, and the method of generation is the same in both                cases,  so  that
  a description       of the one   will  also  serve for the other, with such
  variation as will be pointed out later on.
     Hairs    are true appendages      of the skin, being outgrowths of the
  epidermis.       When attached     to the animal each hair is implanted in
  a cutaneous      depression,  which is an involution of the skin, forming
  the hair follicle.       In structure   the walls of this follicle        consist of
  layers, derived from the epidermis and from the cutis vera.                       The
  hair is fixed into this follicle and attached         to the bottom by a dila
  tion called the knob or bulb of the hair which              encloses the papilla,
  or pulp, and is      in living connection with        the fibrous sheath of the
  follicle.    The papilla or pulp belongs to the follicle rather than the
  hair, and corresponds to         a papilla   of the skin.        It is rounded or
  oval   in  shape, consisting of distinctly       fibrous areolar      tissue,   with
  nuclei and fat granules, but without           any cellular structure, and is
  attached to the fibrous coat of the base of the follicle by a cylindrical
   portion or stalk.

660                      Proceedings    of the  Royal Society
    That part of the hair which is contained within the follicle, and
thus imbedded in the skin, forms the root of the hair.                      The hair
decreases     in diameter towards the mouth of the follicle.                The    free
portion of the hair, or that which projects beyond the mouth                   of   the
follicle and outside the skin, is termed the shaft or stem, and forms
the true hair.           The    shaft is usually     round    or oval, in section
becoming       smaller in diameter towards the unattached extremity,
where      it terminates when           uncut   in   a  point   of   more     or   less
fineness.
     Occasionally there are two or more points.              The hairs vary very
much both in length and diameter in different parts of the body
both of man and the lower animals.               The whole surface of the hair
is covered over with a cuticle or coating of fine imbricated scales,
the free margins of which are always towards the point of the hair,
and these upwardly projecting edges give rise to a series of waved
 or serrated transverse        lines, which can be distinctly seen under the
microscope,      especially after reagents have been used.             The form of
these     scales   is very      diverse, and the distinctions        very marked
 between     different classes of animals and even between those of the
 same class.        Within this scaly covering            is a  fibrous    substance
 termed the cortical         portion of the hair, and which in many hairs
 forms nearly the whole of the stem, but which in others is replaced,
 so   far as the central     portion of the hair is concerned,      by a substance
 of a more distinctly cellular structure which forms            a  medulla or pith.
 Upon the cortical portion            of the hair, its firmness,      strength, and
 elasticity depends.          In coloured hairs the    cortex presents     numerous
 longitudinal     striae  or interrupted dark lines and dots, but in colourless
 hairs these are not easily detected, and are only visible               as areas    of
 unequal transparency.            This portion of the hair when broken              up
 by the use of suitable reagents,             reveals   elongated   spindle-shaped
 cells with uneven surfaces, and            a  flattened and irregular angular
 section,    often curved from their mutual              pressure   resulting    from
 aggregation     within the shaft of      the hair.    These ultimate cells vary
 in every dimension very much in                every   kind of hair, and       often
 present distinct        nuclei and irregular cavities which are filled with
  air.    The medulla or pith when         it exists in any hair, is    also formed
  of clusters of cells     ;  but in place of being spindle-shaped like those
 in the     cortex,     they are usually more        rounded in form, although

                          of Edinburgh, Session 1885-86.                          661
frequently angular in            shape, and relatively of a larger size than the
cells forming the cortical           substance.     The medulla always occupies
the centre of the shaft, but the diameter of this portion relative to
that of the hair varies very much in different hairs. The medulla
seldom exists continuously throughout the whole length of the
hair, being unusually absent at the point and interrupted at parts for
a greater or less extent             In the latter case, the axis of the stem at
the interruptions may be fibrous, like the surrounding cortical part,
 or these intervals may be occupied by a granular or a clear colour
 less matter.       In some cases the medulla presents the appearance of
  a canal running along the axis, and filled with             a more  or less trans
 parent     homogeneous        substance   or a coloured or white opaque granular
  matter.      In  both cases there are frequently considerable air cavities.
      Variations    in the structure of the hair may occur in any of the
  parts of which       it is  composed,     and those who know how very wide
  this variation     is  in  the different hairs found in the animal kingdom,
  will   not be surprised at its extensive occurrence within the narrower
  limits of any of the         species.
      The hair or wool of the            sheep [Oois aries) has a distinct     indivi
   duality of its own, when in its highest           state of development,    but the
   the tendency to run into varieties, which is so marked in this class
   of animals, is also true of the fibrous covering.           Purity of  breed and
   cultivation    tend to check variation           in every direction,     and the
   greatest   uniformity in the likeness of individual fibres is always
   found in the most cultivated sheep, such as the merinos (Ovis
   Hispaniam), where          the departure from the structure of true hair, as
   distinguished     from true wool, is most marked.             A classification of
   wool may indeed be based upon the variation from the structure of
  hair, which     will    embrace     all the varieties of wool which     are found
   either in wild or domestic sheep.               To understand this      classifica
   tion, we must notice the difference          in structure    between  the widest
   extremes    of hair and wool.
      In  hair the scales of its cuticle are firmly attached to the cortical
   substance     throughout       the   greater  part of their length, and only
   reveal   themselves when examined              under the microscope       as    fine
   irregular transverse      and anastomosing lines on the surface and by a
   slight denticulation        at the edge of the hair when viewed by trans
   mitted light.      A   typical illustration of this surface structure may bo

662                           Proceedings                 of the Royal Society
seen      in Plate XXIV.               fig. 1, which                represents            the appearance             of    a
coarse hair taken from the fleece of a Cheviot sheep.
     Along with this external structure                                there        is,   in true hair, usually
associated an internal arrangement                             of the cells composing                   the cortical
substance        in which there               is
                                              a          tolerably distinct medullary axis with
large     and well-formed nucleated cells.                                    Such        a   structure    is    repre
sented      in Plate         XXIV.         fig.     2,    which      is   a   longitudinal          section      of the
same hair given in fig.                 1.
     Sometimes,           however, the medullary axis has                                 a   different structure
even where the external likeness                               is   very similar.              This structure             is
is   seen   in Plate         XXIV.           fig.    3,   and was drawn from                        a   section of        a
coarse hair          taken from               the fleece             of   a     Pacpathian              sheep.            In
this fibre the cells are much smaller and more numerous,                                                        and in
some      parts      having       a    distinct granular pigmented appearance                                        and
non-nucleated.
     In   most      cases the cells composing the cortical substance                                          of hair
are distinctly            nucleated,          but they vary very much in this respect.
The shaft of the hair                 is     usually firm and straight, and the epidermal
scales are horny and dense.
     In wool the epidermal                    scales are attached                to the cortical substance
much less firmly than in the case of hair, and their free margin                                                          is
more prominent, so that the edges of the scales are much more dis
tinctly     seen and the denticulation                              at the edge of the fibre                       more
marked.             The      contour of the free margin of the                                      scales   is is   also
generally less rounded than in those of the hair, and in the finest
classes of wool              is   frequently              serrated        in   a    more        or less irregular
manner.             The scales are also less horny and dense than those                                                   of
hair, and possess             a   transparent or translucent appearance                                    like wax
or gelatine.             A   typical illustration of                  a   wool fibre           is   given in Plate
XXIV.        fig.   4,   which represents                 a   fibre taken from             a   fine merino sheep.
In this      fibre the looseness of the attachment of the scales and the
well-marked              serration of their free                       margins are distinctly                      seen.
The       looseness          of   the attachment of                           the     epidermal           scales      are
in     some classes           of wool             even        more    marked              than in the merino
fibre.       Plate       XXIV.        fig.   5      represents       a    fibre taken from the Chinese
sheep (Morvant               de   la Chine).               In this fibre            the scales are large and
well defined, with                a     horny structure more approaching to that of
true      hair, but with such                a      small attachment to the stem of the fibre

 that they assume         a form resembling a series of cups            or crowns
 inserted one within the other.          Each scale is continuous round the
 whole circumference of the fibre.
    The internal structure' of the wool fibre is usually much less easily
 distinguished than in the case of hair, because the cells forming the
 cortical substance      are much smaller and more transparent               They
 seldom exhibit any traces of neuclei, and            it is only in special fibres
that any medullary axis is visible, and in most cases where this is
revealed there are external indications of reversion to the character
of hair.      Plate   XXIV.   fig. 6 represents   the longitudinal section of a
coarse    fibre of Lincoln wool, which may be compared                   with the
similar section of Cheviot hair given in fig. 2, when the distinction
will   be easily seen.      In   the Lincoln wool      the   medullary cells are
larger, but less distinctly marked,        and they exhibit hardly any trace
of neuclei
    In   examining the variations from this typical structure of wool,
we cannot do better than commence with the surface configuration
of this fibre of Lincoln wool, the section of which is given in Plate
 XXIV. fig. 6, and the external appearance in fig. 7. The scales are
large and distinct, with well-defined and denticulated margins, and
standing out from the general surface of the fibre, so as to present a
strongly serrated edge when seen against a dark background.
    This fibre    was taken from the coarsest         part of the fleece, on the
flanks of the sheep, and treated           with   caustic   alkali after washing
 with   a mixture of alcohol and water.          Even when     a fibre was drawn
from the shoulder of this sheep, where the best wool is always found,
 the same characteristics were exhibited, although in a less marked
degree, but there was no trace of any medulla.               This fibre from the
shoulder is figured in Plate       XXIV.   fig. 8, so that the relative fineness
in diameter of      the two fibres can readily be determined.
    These    fibres may be taken as representatives          of those which are
found     on all the long-woolled breeds           of English sheep, such as
those   of Leicester, Yorkshire, and Nottingham.               They are all dis
tinguished for the brightness and high lustre of the cuticular scales,
which are always large and distinct.
    Closely allied to these bright-haired wools are the fibres derived
from the alpaca goat (Auchenia Paco) and the Angora goat (Capra
Angora), which is known commercially as mohair.                        The fibre

664                  Proceedings      of  the  Royal Society
from the alpaca goat is very closely allied to true hair, and exhibits
many of its characteristics.           It  is most like hair in its external
structure, while it resembles wool in the arrangement               of its cortical
cells.   Mohair,     although usually called hair, is far more like wool
than alpaca, but it never possesses the same curl and suppleness
in the fibre which is exhibited by true wool.
    When the fibres of         alpaca are examined under the microscope
their close relationship to true hair is easily seen, and this relation
ship extends      to   the   internal    as well   as  the external       structure.
 Many    of the fibres       show a distinct       medullary    axis with       large
nucleated cells, which         frequently     contain large quantities of pig
ment.      In   some    cases,   where this is not distinctly           manifested,
there is an enlargement of the cells             in the central axis, although
 they do   not differ in any other respect from the remainder of the
cortical part.      Plate    XXIV.    fig. 9 is taken from a coarse fibre           of
 Chala alpaca.      The epidermal scales are well marked with rounded
edges, and,    like all  alpaca fibres, possess a very high lustre.            Some
of the fibres, when perfectly clean and seen by reflected light, have
 the appearance      of burnished silver.        Plate  XXIV.   fig. 10 gives the
same fibre when viewed           with transmitted light, in which the large
 medullary cells are distinctly seen, while the cortical part has a fine
 granular appearance, without any cellular structure being visible.
    The fibres from the Angora goat have                a close  resemblance        to
 those of alpaca, but there        is always in them a greater        looseness     of
 the cuticular scales     ; and while they retain the high surface            lustre,
 there  is  a greater     tendency to the dispersion of light when seen
 with  reflected  light.     The scales are also more transparent, and of            a
 less horny    nature.      The distinguishing       feature,  however, is that
 the free margins of the scales are not         so  smooth and rounded at the
 edges, but show signs of the same denticulation which is so promi
 nent  a feature   in  true wool ; so much so that many of the fibres               in
 the better qualities of mohair can only with difficulty                 be distin
 guished from the bright-haired            English wools, such      as  Lincoln or
 Leicester, except that the scales are rather smaller and more regular,
 and that there is less tendency to curl.          Plate  XXIV.    fig. 1 1 is taken
from    a fibre of mohair,        and may be compared           with the      alpaca
 fibre given in fig.    9,  and the finer fibre of Lincoln wool given in fig.
8, when the distinction        already noticed will be easily seen.

                       of Edinburgh, Session 1885-86.                              G65
    Closely allied to alpaca and mohair in their structure are the
wools which         are    derived from      all    the   semi- wild  sheep    of the
mountainous regions of Central Asia and the plains of Tartary and
Siberia, but the fleeces of these sheep are generally more defaced by
the prevalence      of long coarse hairs than is the case with alpaca or
mohair.      In   some      of these wools, such as grey Vicaneer, dark
Bagdad, and yellow Pacpathian, we have several distinct classes of
fibres side by side in the same fleece.                The fleeces of these sheep
indeed exhibit       a greater      variation    in   the  structure of individual
fibres than any others which have come under observation.                       These
fibres may    in  the same fleece, and often in the same lock of wool,
be roughly divided into three different classes —
       (a) Those which have all the characteristics of true hair in
                their most marked degree.
       (b) Those which resemble alpaca and mohair fibres.
        (c) Those which are true wool.
    In   the first of these divisions            (a) there are several distinct
 variations in the form of the hair structure. We have already seen
in Plate XXIV.          fig. 3, the internal structure       of one of these fibres
taken from a Pacpathian               sheep,   and its resemblance         to a hair.
 The external appearance of many of these fibres is remarkable for
 the very great regularity in the arrangement               of the external scales,
 and by their pointed extremities, which                   gives them almost the
appearance     of the stem of a palm tree.              Plate XXIV.    fig. 12 gives
 an illustration of one of these fibres, which was taken from a lock                  of
 Bagdad wool.        Occasionally this great regularity in the epidermal
 scales   is found     in   the hairs of more        cultivated sheep, as may be
noticed in Plate      XXIV.      fig. 13,  which is sketched from the          surface
of   a coarse hair taken from the fleece of a Cheviot                sheep.     Some
times the construction of the cuticular layer of these coarse hairs
tends to the production              of larger scales      than those     which     are
 usually found on other associated             fibres.    These scales present       an
appearance     as  though the larger scales had been formed within the
follicle by the coalescence          of several smaller scales into one, and it
is specially noticed          that in    cases    where this occurs       there   is a
tendency in the free edge or margin of the large scale to follow the
same     contour as the smaller ones.                Sometimes     there    are slight

666                    Proceedings          of the Royal Society
surface markings or depressions                 on the larger scales, which seem to
indicate the margins of the smaller ones out of which they were
formed.       The union        is,                      impossible,
                                     however, so complete                that      it   is
except in      very few instances, to separate the larger into the
               a
smaller scales, even by the use of reagents.  Plate XXIV. fig.    is                               14
sketched from       coarse hair of Pacpathian wool, in which, the
                      a
surface markings of many of the large scales show the                                   configuration
of the smaller scales out of which they were formed.
  Occasionally         the whole epidermal tissue                                     hairs
                                                                        of these coarse
assumes       an entirely different appearance,                    in which the usual scaly
structure     is   replaced by of interrupted longitudinal channels,
                                   a   series
which give the fibre the appearance of      vegetable rather than an
                                                               a
animal structure. One of these fibres, taken from        lock of  ora               a        J
wool,   is   given in Plate     XXIV.         fig. 15,   in which the cuticular envelope
resembles     a    fluted column, and where any transverse lines are present
to mark the free margins of the scales, they not inaptly supply                                        the
semblance       of joints in the masonry.                 In   all cases where this peculiar
structure     is   visible in the cuticular layer, there                      is   associated      along
with    it   an equally distinctive              cortical      and medullary formation.
The cortex exhibits           a      coarse     texture of spindle-shaped cells                    with
longitudinal        stri», while        the     medulla        is   composed            of large    and
distinct rounded cells with well-marked nuclei.                               The whole arrange
ment    is   indicative of     a   loose formation,         with considerable air               spaces
existing both in the medulla and cortex.                           Plate      XXIV.      fig. 16 repre
sents the internal        structure of the fibre, whose external surface is
given in fig. 15.         Probably this extreme                    variation from the normal
type may have arisen from the shrinking                             up of the loosely-packed
cells   in the cortical       part, which by their attachment to the epidermal
layer, which         seems     to be        thinner      than      is   usual in hairs of this
diameter,      have drawn them              inwards, and thus formed corrugations
at the intervals between successive bundles of the elongated cells.
   The second      of fibres (6) have
                      class            very close resemblance to
                                                           a
those of alpaca and mohair, but they are usually softer and more
pliant, with less lustre and                a   greater     tendency to variation in the
formation of individual scales in the cuticular layer.                                   One of these
fibres, taken from        a   lock of Pacpathian wool,                  is   given in Plate     XXIV.
 fig. 17, and cannot be distinguished from                     a   fibre of alpaca, such as that
 given in Plate       XXIV.     fig.   9,   except by its association              with other fibres

                        of Edinburgh, Session 1885-86.                              667
which never occur in the fleece of the alpaca goat.                    Other fibres,
however, approach very closely to the appearance of true wool, hut
with    a greater variation       in  the   regularity of the individual          scales
than is usual in the more cultivated sheep.                Plate   XXIV.    fig.   18  is
an illustration of one of these fibres, taken also from a Pacpathian
fleece, which may be compared             with the merino fibre given in Plate
XXrV.     fig. 4.    Amongst these fibres we also notice the first indication
of  a surface formation, which          is a very common variation from the
typical form in the more cultivated wools.                This   consists  in    a ten
dency to form rings of scales, in which we have the single scale
continuous round the whole circumference of the fibre, similar to
those characteristic of Chinese wool given in Plate                   XXrV.      fig. 5,
except that the free margin of the scales are not so marked or the
scales so solid and horny, while             the attachment of the epidermal
scales to the cortical part is more continuous.              Such   a fibre is given
in Plate XXTV.         fig. 19, taken from a Pacpathian fleece.
    The third     class of fibres (c) are those of true wool, and possess all
its highest characteristics.         They    are always much shorter than the
others,   and form an undergrowth              of fine  fibres which fill in the
spaces between the coarser hairs, and             in many     cases are as fine and
delicate in structure, with         as  great  a tendency to curl, as the most
beautiful fibres taken from the fleeces of the most cultivated sheep.
    Plate   XXIV.     fig. 20 is taken from a fibre drawn from the fleece of
an Afghan sheep (Ovis cagia).             The specimen of wool from this sheep
was a most extraordinary mixture of the very coarsest hair and fibre
with the very finest wool,         so much so that      it almost    seemed impos
sible that such diverse fibres could grow at any rate on the same
portion of the skin.         Most of the coarse hairs resembled fig. 12 and
fig. 15, were      deeply coloured by dark black, brown, and yellow
pigment, and possessed            a hard horny       structure.     The fine fibres
were perfectly colourless         and transparent, and closely resembled             the
wool of the English Southdown or the Australian merino.                       Except
that there was a larger variation in the structure of the scales in
many of the individual fibres than is usually noticed in the most
cultivated wools, they could not be distinguished from them.                     When
we come to look at the wool            of  the more    cultivated races of sheep,
such as the common domestic sheep (Oris                  rusticus),  we find much
less variation     in the individual      fibres than is usual in the less culti

668                      Proceedings         of  the   Royal Society
vatcd races, but the difference in structure between one fibre                            and
another is nevertheless frequently very marked.
    If we    examine      a number of fibres           from a Lincoln sheep, there is
in   the finer fibres a close resemblance                 to those which       are  found in
all   the   long-woolled         breed,     but along with these there are              fibres
which      are distinctive          of the Lincoln breed alone.               In the latter
there occur more or less rounded scales along                      with the usual serrated
ones, as though there was a tendency to revert to the more                            distinct
form of scales which we have seen on some of the coarser                                hairs,
such    as  given in Plate         XXIV. fig.       13, from a Cheviot         sheep, or   the
alpaca     fibre given      in Plate XXIV.          fig. 9.     A   fibre of Lincoln wool,
drawn from the fleece of a Lincoln wether, which exhibits                                 this
peculiar formation is given in Plate                  XXIV.      fig. 21.    Many parts of
this fibre bear     a distinct resemblance to the Lincoln fibre already given
in Plate XXIV.           fig. 7, except       that the scales are not so distinctly
marked nor so freely imbricated at the margins, and at irregular
intervals      this    imbrication         entirely     ceases,    and   we have      smooth
rounded edges taking their place.                   When looking at the second class
of fibres found in the coarse Asiatic wools, we noticed a formation
represented      in Plate     XXIV.      fig. 19, where the scales lose their foliated
characted      and tend to form continuous rings.                       This peculiarity in
the formation         and     attachment of the            cuticular scales is also fre
quently found amongst the fibres of the more cultivated wools.
    It  is indeed of very frequent occurrence                       in most of the long-
woolled breeds, such           as the   Lincoln, and may          be seen in Plate XXIV.
fig.   22, which        represents        the appearance          of a fine fibre, taken
from a fine Lincoln wether fleece.                     Where this formation obtains,
the scales are always more horny                   in their     substance    than those of
the fibres possessing              the normal        structure which         are   associated
with them.          In many         cases these      fibres are associated in clusters
in the lock of wool,            as   though a special area of the skin possessed
the power of producing them, but they are also frequently found
separately,       and sometimes             only parts,      even      of the same      fibre,
exhibit      this peculiarity.         They     are also usually confined to certain
parts of the animal, and occur specially at those parts where the
wool tails off into short hair, as at the junction of wool and hair
on the face and limbs.
    In Plate XXIV.           fig. 23 we have a fibre which               displays both the

                     of Edinburgh, Session 1885-86.                              669
characteristic scales      of  the   true wool and the larger and more
ring-like   formations.      This   was sketched from a fibre taken from
a Leicester sheep.         In this fibre it will         be noticed that one       of
the ring-like    scales   is of great     length when         compared     with the
diameter of the fibre, or the relative length of the other scales
above and below.        When this fibre       was examined       with transmitted
light, so as to render its internal structure visible, a peculiarity-
was noticed which is of very great importance from an industrial
or technical point of view.            At that part of the fibre where the
surface was covered by the large smooth scale, the internal structure
exhibits    no sign of any definite cells,          either in the medullary or
cortical parts.     Up to the extremity of the imbricated and wool
like   scales, indications     of cell structure are visible,          both in the
cortical and medullary parts, but beyond that point they cease to
exist in either, and the whole fibre assumes an ivory-like density.
This    change  in structure      does not occur     all   at once, but seems to
 commence     in the central part of the fibre, and gradually to extend
 outwards until it constitutes the formation of the whole fibre.
 This will   be seen   in Plate    XXIV.    fig. 24, which exhibits        a section
 of the same fibre as Plate          XXTV.     fig. 23.     Beyond the point to
 which the ring-like       scale extends,     this solid structure again         tails
 off, and the fibro assumes its usual appearance.                 This peculiarity
 is not of very great importance when the area              over which it extends
 is small, but when     it  becomes the general        characteristic of the fibre
 it introduces    serious   difficulties in the way of the manufacturer,
 because    the solid    portion of the fibre ceases to be elastic and
 pliable, and easily breaks when subjected to flexure.                  In  addition
 to this all these fibres resist, or are incapable of that felting action
 which is so important           a  feature in the true wool, and              which
 depends    upon the facility with which the scales of the one fibre
 interlock into those of others         when in juxtaposition.          These solid
 fibres also resist the entrance of all dyeing or colouring matter into
 their interior, and    will only     receive    a surface     colouring, which is
 readily removed by either chemical or mechanical means.                    In  some
 cases the outer continuity of the scales is not accompanied             by a change
 of internal structure,      and when examined by transmitted light the
 cortical and even medullary cells are distinctly visible.               Such fibres
  are usually known      as flat kemps, because         they generally possess an

C70                   Proceedings    of  the  Royal Society
oval section in which the major axis is very large in comparison
to the minor axis.         In this   case the     fibres   will receive the dye,
but they     will not felt.
    Kcmpy fibres      are always most numerous            in the   fleeces  of wild
and uncultivated       sheep, but they also occur         in  those   of  the most
cultivated races.      In   the former case they are        generally distributed
throughout      the whole of the        fleece, but     in   the  latter   they     are
usually confined to certain localities         as  already mentioned,       and are
almost certain indications of want of trueness in the breed of
the sheep.        These kempy fibres are in most cases larger in
diameter and shorter in length than the wool fibres with which
they are associated.        Plate XXIV. fig. 25, represents a section of a
coarse kemp taken from a         Highland     sheep.
    In the fibres taken from the      fleeces of middle-classed wools,          such
as  the Southdown and half-bred sheep, we have considerable                      uni
formity in the general        structure of the fibres and the surface con
figuration of the scales, but with frequent indications                in many of
the fibres of a return or reversion          to the    typical structure     of the
fibres of the original     stocks out of which these artificial races have
been produced.         Plato   XXIV.    figs. 26 and 27 are        illustrations of
two fibres taken from the same lock of wool drawn from a Leicester-
Botany fleece.       The first exhibits all the characteristic features of
the fibres found       in a  pure Leicester sheep, and the latter closely
resembles the pure Australian       merino fibres.       These two fibres must,
from their position in the lock of wool from which they were taken,
have been generated         within follicles which      were   imbedded side by
side   in  the  skin.   They may be compared           with Plate      XXIV.    figs.
4  and   8.
    In  the   perfectly pure races of sheep, such as the best English
Southdowns, or the Spanish, German, and Australian                     merinos, in
which we find       the greatest   perfection of the fleece and fibre in all
the most desirable characteristics of wool, and where every care and
attention has been paid to the health and comfort of the sheep, we
also find the least tendency to any variation          in the individual     fibres.
Even here, however, we find differences             in the structure of fibres
which have grown in close continuity with each other.                  This differ
ence can only be explained by considering some of the arrangements
of the epidermal scales       as undoubted cases of reversion to the type

                          of Edinburgh, Session 1885-86.                                671
of fibre characteristic of the original stock from which                   these varieties
were obtained in the remote past.                  Several of these more important
variations are given in Plate           XXIV.     figs. 28, 29, and 30.       These fibres
are all sketched from pure Australian meriao fibres.                       In   fig. 28 the
arrangement of the epidermal scales in the upper and lower part of
the fibre closely resembles that exhibited in the Cheviot fibres given
in Plate XXIV.         fig. 13, while the central portion is covered           with scales
¦which are      similar to those on the Pacpathian               fibre, given       in Plate
XXIV.       fig. 13.        The fibre given in       fig. 29 closely resembles         Plate
XXTV.       fig. 22,  taken from a Lincoln           sheep   in which the      same ring
like   scales appear at intervals.          Fig.   30 shows a kempy development,
which, however, in the finest merino wool, is very rare, with short
intervals in which            the true wool appears.          As   a rule, when kemps
occur in the merinos, the whole fibre partakes of this character, and
the fibres are flat ovals in section, with              a clear transparent structure.
In    some of these kempy fibres the usual curled or waved character
 of the true wool is replaced by             a twisting of the whole fibre round
its axis, so as to give the fibre the appearance of a corkscrew, with
a comparatively wide pitch, or like the twist in                   a fibre of cotton.
     These variations         from the normal structure of wool and other
 allied    fibres  might       be very much         increased     if  we    include those
 which     are evidently the result of malformations                   arising     from the
 various diseases to which sheep are subject, or to the existence                          of
 more than one fibre within the same follicle, which frequently pro
 duces fibres of singular configuration ; but those which have already
 been     named     and figured show the principal                variations which are
 presented      in the    fibres under ordinary conditions.
     It is singular    that most of these variations, indeed all of them, are
 formed in the fibres from the same sheep in the various races which
 inhabit Central Asia           ;  while in most of the sheep inhabiting other
 parts of the world, the usual variations from the normal types are
 less   distinctive       in their     character,    and confined within narrower
 limits.      This   seems to point to the mountainous regions of Central
 Asia    as   the district       from which the present            domestic sheep has
 spread over the other countries of the world.                    If the   study of these
 variations will throw any light on the cause which produces                           them,
 and thus enable those who are engaged                    in the culture of the        sheep
 to secure still greater           uniformity in the character           of the fleece,     it

672                     Proceedings      of   the  Royal Society
will undoubtedly render            great   service      to those who require to            use
wool for the higher branches of textile manufacture.

        E.P. By Frank E. Beddard, M.A., F.Z.S., Prosector to
        the Zoological Society of London.                     (Plate XXV.)
     Among the many interesting genera of earthworms described by
M. Perrier, the most interesting and remarkable in many ways is
 Eudrilus.       This   genus    is unique among            earthworms, by reason of
the peculiar structure of its generative organs.                   In all earthworms
at present      known, with this exception,* the ovaries are situated in
a   distinct segment of their own, into which opens the funnel                      of   the
oviduct, which is quite independent of the ovary                       ;    the oviducts
generally pass through the mesentery                  which bounds posteriorly the
segment       (usually the 13th) containing the ovaries, and open on
to the exterior of the body in the ventral surface of the following
segment.
     M. Perrier has described         these organs        in Eudrilus in the follow
ing words (Nouv. Arch. d. Mus.,               t. viii.,  1872, p. 74)    : — "L'appareil
femelle n'est pas moins étrange.                  Il  est situé dans le quatorzième
anneau       et son   orifice extérieure n'est pas autre chose que l'orifice
porté par cet anneau           en avant de la paire supérieure de soies.                On
voit partir de cet orifice un tube qui             se recourbe    plusieurs fois, en      se
dirigeant en arrière,        se   renfle  finalement en une poche allongée                 à
parois plus ou moins distendues et dont l'extrémité en cul-de-sac                        se
dirige en avant.          Greffés    sur  ce   tube avant sa dilatation en poche
on voit d'abord un tube plus petit entortillé de façons diverses, et
juste en face de lui une sphère assez peu volumineuse, quelquefois
deux,     qui   présentent alors un aspect un peu différent.                      Je   n'ai
pu examiner         ce   dernier corps       que    sur deux individus conservés
dans      l'alcohol,                mais     cette     examen       ne     peut    laisser
aucun doute       ;  ce   sont là des ovaires            dans lesquels      il est encore
    * Monilirjaster            to  be somewhat     abnormal in the size and position of
                     appears

                              of Edinburgh, Session 1885-8G.                                                     67a

tiques."           I presume         from this account, and from the figure (loc.cit.,
pi. ii. fig. 26, o) which illustrates that M. Perrier means to imply
                                                      it,
that in this earthworm the ovary          not only fixed on to the
                                                                is
spermatheca,              but that     it    actually communicates with the exterior
through its lumen             ;   that the spermatheca,                   in fact,       serves not merely
as   a       receptacle     for the semen, but also as an oviduct.                                This      is   not
stated in so many words by Perrier, and writers of text-books have
not quoted this fact in describing                         the       female          generative       organs of
the Annelida.               I   find, however, that M. Perrier's statements are in
a    way correct,           and   as       the matter      is   one of importance,                    from the
general point of view of the morphology of                                      the generative              organs
and their ducts              in Annelids,       I   think       it    worth while to enter more
fully into the            subject.
         The opportunity to do so has been afforded                                   by the kindness of
Mr E. L. Layard, H.B.M. Consul                          at Noumea.                   Among       a   number of
earthworms sent to me from New Caledonia, were several specimens
of       a   species of     Eudrilus, which          appears to be not far removed                           from
Perrier's E. peregrinns.                    As this       species         and one other are natives
of the West               Indies, while the third species                       is    from Rio Janeiro,
the genus              being thus      a   New World         genus,       I     am inclined            to    think
that the New Caledonian                         species     has      been        imported, and              is   not
indigenous to that island.*

able         to make out the relations of the different parts of the                                        female
generative          apparatus.         Plate     XXV.       fig.     1,   illustrates these organs as
seen under          a   lens previous to any dissection                    ;    in    fig.   2   the different
parts are separated from each other, and are seen to consist — (1) of
a    thick-walled           muscular vagina (r), which                    is   continuous above with
(2),      a    somewhat pear-shaped               thin-walled             pouch, the spermatheca                  ;
at the        junction of the spermatheca                 with the vagina                 open     two ducts,

     The ovary is                a   rounded gland, somewhat flattened from above
downwards              ;   in    transverse          sections         it   has a reniform            outline         illus
trated in figs. 3, 4; from the lower surface of the organ (fig. 3) arises
the oviduct, which is at first (d) thin-walled with a wide lumen, and
afterwards             (c)   acquires         a   thicker muscular coating                  ;       the oviduct           is
everywhere lined with                         a   single layer of columnar epithelial                                cells.
In     the        figures        referred to (figs.              3,    4)   it   will     be        seen    that       the
oviduct       is      completely          continuous           with the ovary           ;   its lumen passes
into the interior of that organ, and its muscular walls pass                                                without
a    break into the muscular tunic of the ovary.
     In    fig.   4I       have sketched            a    highly magnified section of the ovary,
in order          to display its structure as                    fully      as possible.
   As already mentioned, M. Perrer has briefly described and figured
the ovaries of Eudrilus, and has called attention to the fact that
these structures cannot be interpreted                                     in any other         way, since           they
contain most unmistakable ova entirely like those of other                                                           Lum-
bricidre.
     In    fig.    5   is    represented            an ovum with its germinal vesicle and
germinal spot.                   The ovum               is   bounded externally                 by    a    very con
spicuous and                 comparatively               thick      membrane,             which       in my pre
parations has been rendered                              more       distinct by deep                staining with
borax carmine;                   the protoplasm of the ovum                          is   uniformly granular,
though occasionally                  I        have       observed          cavities free from granules.
The germinal vesicle                     is   large, and distinctly              limited by         a   membrane        ;
it   lies usually eccentrically, and                           is   oval or more irregularly curved
in form;            the germinal vesicle appears to contain                                 a   fluid substance,
and       has       usually          a   single,        spherical, highly refracting,                       germinal
spot   ;  I       have noted as many                    as three       of these in some ova.                     In the
figure which                 illustrates          the    ovum (fig. 5), the membrane                             which
bounds        it    externally           is   represented        as    being homogeneous,                  it   appears
from my sections that there                             is   only this vitelline membrane                       and no
other.            The protoplasm of the ovum forms                               a   somewhat denser layer
just      beneath the membrane,                         which    is    better shown            in   fig.   5,   a.
     Tlie mature ova were in every                              case       surrounded       by      a very distinct
columnar follicidar epithelium, and the rest of the compartment was
filled up with mass of small rounded cells (fig. 4), some of which
                             a
were larger than others, and appeared to be ova in course of develop

ovary, can readily be distinguished                in    transverse     sections        by its
wider lumen and thinner walls               ;   this part is lettered d in fig. 3,
the proximal section of the oviduct is lettered                 c   in the   same figure;
b   is the vagina.   I have traced by means              of sections the whole course
of the oviduct from the aperture into the vagina up to its disappear
ance      in the interior of the ovary, but          I have not       thought       it worth
while to figure a large series of sections                 in order     to display          the
whole course of the oviduct.               The oviduct is lined by a columnar
epithelium, which, at any rate in certain regions, is ciliated.                        At    the
point where the oviduct           opens into the vagina, but on the opposite
side of the latter, is     a   small, spherical, yellowish-coloured, glandular
body, which       can readily be distinguished               from the ovary by its
yellowish     colour (the ovary is white and translucent) and smaller
size ;    an examination of its minute structure showed also that this
body is not a second ovary, for it contained no traces of ova.                              The
interior is divided up, however, like the ovary into numerous com
partments by trabecuhe, and the walls of these compartments are
everywhere lined by an epithelium.                  It    appears     to be a glandular
organ, and      it communicates          (fig. 5) by a short, narrow duct                with
the vagina.       This structure is possibly             analogous     to an albumini-
parous gland.        I could     observe    no traces of spermatozoa               either in
this glandular diverticulum or in the spermathcca,                    but    it   appears to
be exceedingly probable, from the structure of these parts, that the
ova are fertilised       in the duct of the         spermatheca         which       I    have
termed the vagina (fig. 2,         v).
     At   the commencement        of this paper  I      have given M. Perrier credit
for having been the first to recognise the fact that the ovary opens
into the duct of the spermatheca,               and that its contents reach the
exterior by this duct.           M. Perrier's circumstantial account                and the
figure which he gives seems to favour such an interpretation                       ;I       find
that     Mr Benham, in    a    recently published memoir on earthworms, has

676                   Proceedings       of tlw Royal Society
arrived at    a similar conclusion as to M. Perrier's results.*               The facts,
however, which        I  have   detailed above         seem to me to indicate that
M. Perrier did not really absolutely prove any such connection
between     the ovary and the spermathecal duct ;                at the same time,       I
make these remarks with considerable hesitation, having had                        in the
course   of my own investigations             into the structure of this group
abundant evidence of the accuracy                  of M. Perrier's       drawings     and
description.       The     species    of   Eudrilus         which    I    have    myself
studied    does    not    appear     to   me      to differ    markedly,      either in
external     characters     or   in anatomical          structures,    from    Eiulrilus
peregrinus ; and       I have already expressed           doubts as to whether, for
this reason, the species can bo really indigenous to New Caledonia,
whence    it  was sent to me.        Whether or not tho species is identical
with Eudrilus peregrinus,          there is   little  reason    to suppose     that the
female generative organs would show any such differences                        in indi
viduals, or closely allied forms, as would appear to be the case from
a  comparison of Perrier's with my own description                    ;   and  I  should
mention that the facts brought forward in the present paper depend
upon the examination of four ovaries and their ducts, two of which
have been studied by simple dissection, and two by continuous series
of transverse     sections ; these latter are complete series, not a single
section   having been lost, and          I   have     naturally   retained them for
reference.      M. Perrier distinctly         speaks     of the ovary in Eudrilus
peregrinus as being sessile upon the spermatheca;                        in E. Lacazii
there is   a  small spherical body        in the     same position, as also         in E.
decipiens    ; in neither of        these    latter     species,  however, does        M.
Perrier appear to have made out ova in the supposed ovaries, which
 may   therefore be presumed with equal reason                      to represent the
accessory glandular body of           E. peregrinus.         The figure illustrating
the female generative        apparatus is from E. decipiens; the most care
 ful examination of my         sections   has revealed       no structure which       can
 possibly    correspond     to   the diverticulum          (petit tube entortille) of
 the spermatheca, except the oviduct            ;  nevertheless, the ovary appears,
 on a superficial view, to be sessile upon the duct of the spermatheca.
 This  appearance       may have misled M. Perrier, although the figure
 cited from his work appears to indicate that he made a dissection,
 and did not merely figure the various structures as they appear

 when the body of the worm is opened.               I  am bound to conclude,
therefore,     that M. Perrier's remarks on the structure of the female
generative       apparatus in Eudrilus       represent    a  lucky   guess     partly
expressing the truth; in this case          I  may claim for myself the dis
covery of the true relations of the ovary to the oviduct in Eudrilus,
    Another fact, which shows plainly that the structure which                I have
described as an oviduct is really so, and not a diverticulum                   of the
spermatheca,       is its ciliation;  I cannot state positively that the ovi
duct is ciliated throughout, but in its distal portion nearest to the
ovary the cilia were here and there extremely conspicuous                ; a  few of
these cells are drawn on fig. 7 of the Plate.               I am   not acquainted
with any earthworm in which either the              spermatheca     or its diverti
cula are ciliated      ; and, indeed, the presence of cilia would be useless
in  a pouch      which    serves for the storage of the spermatozoa.
    In   fig. 76 of plate iv. of his memoir,         M. Perrier     has figured a
portion of the ovary of Eudrilus.            The figure illustrates the trabe-
culae   of muscular      or connective tissue which bound the several com
partments of which the organ is composed; the ova are represented
as being surrounded by a granular mass,                which     entirely fills up
the space separating the ovum or ova from the trabeculae                  ;  this, as
I  have already stated, is not a homogeneous             mass, but is evidently
composed        of small closely packed cells, some of which are young
ova, while others form a definite single layered            follicular epithelium
immediately surrounding the ovum.
   The female genital apparatus          of Eudrilus differs, therefore, from
that of other Oligochaeta,       —
    (1)   In  the connection of the oviduct      with   the spermatheca;
    (2)   In  the continuity of the ovary and its duct ;
    (3)   In  the complicated structure of the ovaries ; and,
    (4)   In  the presence      of a definite columnar follicular epithelium
surrounding the mature ovum.
   A   discussion of these several points naturally follows           : —
    (1) The connection of the oviduct with the spermatheca is a
novelty in the group ; but, at the same time, it must be remembered
that the structure which           I  have identified with the spermatheca,
following Perrier, may not really be the morphological equivalent
of the     spermatheca       of Lumbricus    or Perichceta.       The position of

678                     Proceedings      of the Moyal Society
these organs behind the testes are against such an                  identification; at
the same time,         in Microchmta, Mr Benham*              and myself    f  have de
scribed a number of small pouches,                which may correspond to the
spermatheca,        and are in    a similar position as far as the testes are
concerned.        Furthermore, the position of the conjoined oviduct and
spermathecal         apertures   by the outer pair of         setae,  while the male
genital pores are placed on a level with the lowermost pair of setae,
suggests     a practical      difficulty   in assigning      to  these   pouches the
function     of seminal reservoirs.           I have   not succeeded       in finding
any trace of spermatozoa within the supposed                spermatheca      ; but this
failure does not count for much, considering the condition                       of the
specimens.         In  my opinion, the nature of these so-called sperma
theca must be left undecided for the present;                    they appear to be
possibly     new structures developed on the oviduct,                  but probably
serve as spermatheca3.
    (2) The absolute continuity between the ovary and its duct is not
merely new to the Oligochceta terricula, but to the whole of the
 Chajtopoda.         In this group the      generative   ducts are more generally
regarded    J  as   the slightly metamorphosed equivalent of nephridia                  ;
 and, without insisting upon their homology                with nephridia, it is at
 any rate clear that they are quite independent of the generative
 glands,   both    as regards    origin and adult structure; in other groups
 of the invertebrata there is some dispute                as   to the nature     of the
 genital ducts.        Lang§ speaks       of the sexual products in the Platy-
 helminthes and Hirudinero being carried off by special ducts, which
 are prolongations of the genital ducts themselves.               Balfour || considers
 this view doubtful          in the case of the Hirudinese             and Platyhel-
 minthes, but is in favour             of regarding     the    genital ducts of the
 Nematodes        as   being of this kind.        In all   these instances,     as well
 as  in the Crustacea and in           some Mollusca       (and, according to the
 Hertwigs,H in Bryozoaand            Rotifera), the genital products are carried
 out of the body by ducts which, whether they are or are not modi-

tion with the generative                      glands   ;    the anatomical difference                     between
the generative               ducts in the Leeches and Platyhelminthes                                         on the
one hand, and the Oligoclueta on the other, is a fact worthy of note,
even       if it   does not express a profound morphological difference.                                            In
Eudrihm            the      materials at my disposal do not enable me to make
any statements respecting the morphology of the oviducts                                            ;    but their
continuity with the ovary, whether merely secondary or fundamental,
is an important                   fact in their anatomy, and is comparable to the
structure of the oviduct                        in Hirudo* or in                 the Platyhelminthes.
Indeed, the whole arrangement                              of the female generative apparatus,
with the stout muscular vagina, the spermathecal pouch, and                                                        the
accessory          gland opening into the vagina, is by no means unlike the
conditions          met      with in certain Gastropoda.                          Without wishing to
push this latter comparison too far,                          I may      insist upon the undoubted
resemblance            to the       Hirudinea       and Platyhelminthes,                   particularly to
the former group.
      The tendency of recent research has been rather against regarding
the    Hirudinea            as    Annelida,       and their numerous points of affinity
with the Platyhelminthes                       have been pointed out by Lang, Bourne,
and others ;           it   is,   therefore,     important to observe                  that,   as       far   as   the
female generative organs                       are concerned,            there
                                                                                  is
                                                                                  a       decided             resem
blance between              Eudrilus and Hirudo,                   and       this fact keeps to bridge
over the gap which separates                       the Leeches               from tho Chietopoda.                   It
also follows that the structure of the genital glands and their ducts
is   not constant in the Oligochncta,                        as   it    is   generally believed to be               ;
and on this account                 it   is   not permissible to lay too great stress upon
the relations between                    the genital glands and their ducts in classifi
cation (as also in the               case      of the Ganoid and Teleostean                    fish).
     In every       respect, with the exception of the ovaries and their ducts.
Eudrilns conforms very closely to                                 the    structure of other earth
worms      ;   and in view of these striking resemblances                               of structure, the
condition of the ovaries and oviducts can hardly be regarded                                             as   being
of such importance                  as   to separate         Eudrilus from other               Oligochoeta.

structure, which is a prolongation of the delicate cellular covering of
the ovary, was erroneously regarded by d'Udekem                   oviduct ;                 as the
it   may       possibly represent morphologically the oviduct in Eudrilus,
and be the last remnant of an oviduct continuous with the                                                      ovary,
such as exists              (?)   in the   unsegmented             worms from which the                 Annelida
must have originated.
   (3) The minute structure of the ovary in Eudrilus    evidently                                is
different from that of other Oligochaeta   in Lumbricus     these           ;                           \
glands are little more than                       a   specially thickened region of the peri
toneal epithelium,                     enclosed       in   a     thin    capsule      formed by the peri
pheral layer of cells.                        In Eudrilus               the glands show         a       very con
siderable advance                      in structure        ;    the details given above, although
unfortunately               very imperfect, seem to indicate that the ovaries                                       may
have        originated, not from the epithelium lining the general body
cavity, but that they may more nearly resemble                               the ovaries of the
Platyhelminthes                   and Leeches,             which belong to the " tubular " type.
This question               can,       of course,          only be settled by              a   study of their
development.                 In        the case of the Leeches,                  Balfour       supposes,            that
"    if,   as seems probable, the true affinities of the Leeches are                                            with
the Chaetopoda, the investment of the ovaries must be of                                         a      secondary
nature."             Very possibly this               is    also the case         with Eudrilus, but in
the meantime the structural resemblance                                   to the Leech         is   a   fact to be
noted      ;    in both       cases the ovary               is   enclosed    in      a   muscular coat                It
might be objected to what                     I   have already said, that                  in the ovaries and
oviducts of Eudrilus there                        is   a       similarity to the testes and vesicular
seminales             of earthworms.                  These organs,              as we      know        from        the
researches            of Hering,J             confirmed by Bourne,§ have the following
structure: — There                     are two pairs of minute                    testes    about the same
size as, and occupying                     a   similar position to, the ovaries.                         The con
tents       of the         testes are transferred, when                     in   a   more or less complete
condition, to pouch-like                       structures,         developed at the expense of the
proximal ends of the vasa deferentia, or according to Bergh (Zool.

                            of Edinburgh, Session 1885-86.                             681
not      mere hollow cavities filled with developing spermatozoa, but, as
Bloomfield has shown, are divided up in a reticulate fashion by
septa of          connective tissue.        There are therefore some reasons            for
supposing, that in Eudrilus the female generative apparatus is similar
to the male generative apparatus; that the structures which I have
described as ovaries correspond to the receptaculum ovorum described
by      Hering, Horst, and recently by Bergh (Zool. Anzeig., Bd. ix.
p. 232) in Lumbricus, and that, therefore, the true ovaries remain to
be discovered.             Such a similarity would be interesting, more espe
 cially     because     it would      be a further development of the conditions
 met with in other Lumbricida;                ;  but  I am inclined    to  think that it
 does not occur in this                genus ; the   fact that the supposed ovaries
 contain not merely mature and immature ova, but that they consist
 of numerous tubules, evidently lined with a germinal epithelium,
 from which the ova               arise, and the fact that these tubules         converge
 and open into          the oviduct, appears to me to show that they are the
 real ovaries.
      (4) The formation of a columnar follicular epithelium surrounding
  the ova has not, to my knowledge, been observed in any earthworm.
  In    the summary of observations on the ova in different groups,
  given      in the first volume of Balfour's             Comparative Embryology,
  there is no statement concerning the presence of                 a  follicular epithe
  lium, which, however, is known to occur in Sipunculus and in the
  Leeches.         In   the latter group it has been           described by several
  writers, including         Jijima*      and Schneider,   t but appears      to form     a
  continuous        protoplasmic        mass investing    the ovum, and containing
  nuclei.        In Sipunculus and the Echinodermata, and in Lumbricidae
  there     is a   follicular epithelium which is formed of flattened cells.
  The follicle of Eudrilus appears, in fact, to resemble that of certain
  lower vertebrata more than any segmented worm                  ;  but in the absence
   of more       extended information           than we possess at present,      I do  not
  wish to be understood to insist upon this similarity.
      The ovum, with its surrounding follicular epithelium, is displayed
  in fig.    5 ;  the cells,   as  will  be seen from that figure,      are very small,
  and    I was     unable to detect a nucleus.          The appearances       illustrated

in that    figure seem to me, however, unquestionably                 to indicate     the
presence of a definite         follicular epithelium      ;  I can hardly have      con
founded       it with  a zona   radiata, for this latter membrane when               pre

1.    On    a   new form     of   Portable     Spring    Balance   for  the
       Measurement       of     Terrestrial     Gravity.      By Sir     W.
       Thomson.
    The design and construction of the instrument now to be described
was undertaken on the        suggestion    of General Walker, of the East
Indian Trigonometrical Survey. At the Aberdeen Meeting of the
British Association in 1885, General Walker obtained the appoint
ment of     a committee   to examine into the whole question of the
present methods and instruments          for the measurement     of gravita
tional force, and to promote investigation, having for its object the
 production of gravitation measuring instruments of a more reliable
 and accurate character    than those now in use.
    The secretary of this committee,      Professor Poynting,   has already
 issued a circular note to the members         of the committee (of whom
 the author is one), stating the conditions which must be fulfilled by
 any gravimeter     laid before the      committee    for examination and
 report.

684                       Proceedings               of   the   Royal Society
     An instrument, constructed according                               to the following       description,
promises to       fulfil all the conditions mentioned in Professor Poynting's
circular.        Its sensibility        is amply up to the specified                    degree.           It   is,
of necessity,      largely influenced by temperature,                            and it isnot certain
that the allowance for temperature,                                 or the means       which may be
worked out for bringing the instrument always to one temperature,
may prove         satisfactory.            It       is almost certain, although                  not quite
certain,    that the constancy of the latent zero of the spring                                     will       be
sufficient, after the instrument has been kept for several                                       weeks or
months under the approximately                             constant stress under which                    it   is
to act     in regular     use.
                   Front elevation, with one-half of Tube                       removed.   ;
     The instrument consists of                 a   thin flat plate of springy German silver
of the kind known as "doctor," used for scraping the colour off the
copper rollers       in   calico printing.                The piece used was 75 centimetres
long, and was cut to             a    breadth of about              2   centimetres.    A brass     weight
of about 200 grammes was securely soldered                                     to one end of        it,   and
the spring was bent like the spring of                                  a   hanging bell, to such              a
shape      that when           held        firmly        by one          end   the spring stood out
approximately in           a      straight line, having the weight at the other
end.        If   the spring had no weight the curvature, when free from
stress, must be       in simple proportion                     to the distance along the curve
from the end at which                   the weight             is   attached,     in order that when
held by one end           it   may be straightened by the weight fixed at the
other end.
     The weight      is   about        2    per cent,          heavier than that which would
keep the spring straight when horizontal                                ;   and the fixed end of           it
is   so   held that the spring stands, not horizontal, but inclined                                   at       a
slope of about        1   in     5,   with the weighted end above                      the level of the

fixed       end.      In this position the equilibrium is very nearly unstable,
A.        definite       sighted position                       has    been     chosen     for        the weight,
relatively to            a   mark rigidly connected to the fixed end of the spring,
fulfilling        the condition that in this position the equilibrium                                      is stable
at     all the temperatures for which                                   it    has    hitherto     been      tested     ;
while        the position of                     unstable equilibrium                  is only a few milli
metres        abov6          it for     the      highest temperature                  for which the instru
ment has           been tested, which is about 16° C.
   The fixed end is rigidly attached to one end of a brass tube,
 about 8 centimetres diameter, surrounding the spring and weight,
 and closed by a glass plate at the upper end of the incline, through
 which the weight is viewed.     The tube is fixed to the hypotenuse
 of   a    right-angled triangle of sheet brass, of which one leg, inclined
 to it at an angle of about                        I   radian, is approximately horizontal, and
 is supported by               a transverse             trunnion resting on fixed V-s under the
 lower end of the tube, and                                 a    micrometer screw under the short,
 approximately vertical, leg of the triangle.
      The observation consists in finding the number of turns and parts
 of    a   turn of the micrometer                      screw, required to bring                 the    instrument
 from the position at which the bubble of the spirit-level is between
 its proper marks, to the position which equilibrates the spring-borne
 weight, with a mark upon                             it exactly in line with            a chosen         divisional
 line on      a    little     scale of 20 half-millimetres,                         fixed in this tube in the
 vertical plane perpendicular to its length.
      The instrument                  is,   as   is    to   be expected,            exceedingly sensitive to
  changes         of temperature.                      An elevation of                temperature         of    1°   C.
  diminishes          the      Young's            modulus of the German silver so much,
  that about         a   turn and           a    half of the micrometer screw (lowering the
  upper end of the tube at the rate of 2/3 millimetre per turn) pro
  duced the requisite change of adjustment for the balanced position
  of the movable weight.                          About           1£   turn of the screw corresponds                 to
 a  difference of 1/5000 in the force of gravity, and the sensibility of
  the instrument     amply valid for 1/40 of this amount
                              is                              that    to                              ;         is
  say, for 1/200,000  difference in the force of gravity. Hence      not                                   it   is
  want of sensibility in the instrument that can prevent its measuring
  differences        of gravity to the 1/100,000                         ;    but to attain this degree of
  minuteness          it     will      be necessary               to   know the         temperature of the
     spring to within 1/20° C.                    I         do not      see   that there can be any great

  difficulty   in achieving the thermal adjustment               by the     aid of  a
 water jacket and        a delicate  thermometer.       To facilitate the requisite
 thermal adjustment,         I  propose,     in  a new instrument       of  which   I
 shall immediately commence the construction, to substitute                  for the
 brass    tube    a long double girder of          copper (because     of  the  high
 thermal conductivity          of copper), by which sufficient        uniformity of
 temperature along the spring throughout                the mainly effective    por
 tion of its length and up to near the sighted end, shall be secured.
 The water jacket       will  secure   a  slight    enough variation of tempera
 ture to allow the absolute temperature to be indicated by the                 ther
 mometer      with,   I believe, the required accuracy.

    The electric conductivity         of metals has been observed to change
very greatly at their         melting    point, the resistance      being in many
cases nearly       doubled when the metal is fused.              The experiments
recorded     in the following       communication originated in an attempt
to investigate more        fully into this     fact.   The metals chosen for the
first observations were tin and lead, both of which have their melt
ing points at temperatures that can be readily obtained.
    At first    we endeavoured to take the resistance,             at various tem
peratures,    of  a column of metal       having     a definite cross section and
length, by means of a Wheatstone's bridge.                For this purpose glass
tubes    were    employed, which were placed            horizontally in a hot-air
bath, where they could be raised to a temperature considerably above

5 cm. terminated in small cups, into which the wires connecting                                           the
column of metal with the Wheatstone's bridge dipped.
      When the tube had                   been    raised to a temperature above                      that at
which      the metal melted, the latter was poured into it from                                 a   crucible
 in   which it had         been       fused, and the resistance              was          observed     from
 time to time          as the   whole gradually cooled down.                         The results thus
 obtained    were, however, unsatisfactory, and varied from one experi
 ment     to another.           It   was     found to be very difficult to keep a tube
 of   the length        employed heated                equally at all points when the tem
 perature was high, and in addition to this, the tubes could seldom
 be    used for a second             experiment, as they almost invariably cracked
  when     an attempt was made                    to    remelt the metal.                 After various
  modifications         had been unsuccessfully tried, this form of apparatus
  was abandoned, and a new method was adopted,                                        which has been
  employed in all the            rest of the experiments.
      A   small trough of highly baked stoneware,                            10 cm.          long,    1   cm.
  broad, and       1   cm. deep, was placed on a sheet of thin iron plate and
  heated by        a    powerful          gas flame.        In   this trough              the metal was
  melted, and then wires were                      dipped into           — one
                                                                       it,                 at each        end.
  These wires were connected                  with      a Leclanche'    cell, and thus the cir
  cuit was completed through                     the melted metal.           A       shunt circuit was
  formed by    a       wire whose          ends    dipped into the metal in the trough,
  so that the current was                  divided
                                  part passing through the metal,
                                                       ;
  and part through the shunt circuit, in which  reflecting galvano           a
  meter was placed.                  In    the battery circuit      a   resistance          of about 2-5
  ohms was inserted, so that the melted metal formed                                        a   very small
  portion of the total resistance                  of this circuit.          Hence the intensity
   of the current passing was practically the same whether the metal in
   the trough were melted or solid.                      The resistance of the shunt circuit,
   including   the galvanometer, was somewhat more than 11 ohms                                       ;    any
   change, therefore, of the resistance                     of this circuit, due to heating of
   the wires where they entered                   the trough, might be neglected                     as com
   pared    with   the total resistance                of the galvanometer circuit.
       Under   these conditions the resistance                     of the metal in the trough
   was proportional         to the current             in   the shunt circuit.

    The observations were made in the following manner                  : — A key
 was introduced       into the battery circuit,     and as the melted          metal
 gradually cooled      down, this key was depressed         at regular    intervals
 of thirty   seconds, and the deflection of the galvanometer          noted.        In
 most of the experiments          the temperature was taken at the              same
 time by means of a copper-iron thermo-electric junction               which had
 been previously tested, and of which one          junction was inserted into
 the melted metal, while the other was kept at a constant tempera
 ture.
    The results of experiments conducted in this manner on                 tin and
lead    are given in a table at        the end of this communication, and
indicate a very sudden and considerable alteration in the conduc
tivity of    these metals at their melting points.       It  may be    mentioned
that the tin employed in the experiments was commercial grain                   tin  ;
the lead was in the form of assay foil.
    Soon after commencing these experiments              it occurred to us to
employ Rose's fusible metal, in consequence            of the  ease   with which
it  can be melted.       The result which we obtained was, to us, quite
unexpected      ; for the resistance, instead of becoming suddenly about
half its former amount       as the metal solidified, descended to its       lower
value by three       successive    falls.   The experiment      when repeated
gave the same result.
    ¦\Ve  therefore resolved to investigate further into the matter, and
proceeded     to form alloys of lead and tin.       To  make sure that,      if  the
same     appearance    should present itself in these alloys, it might be
referred to some property of the alloy, the conductivity of specimens
of the lead and tin used in making them up was tested            ;  in every case
the resistance      altered by a single change        from its one value to
the other.
    The alloys were made by melting the proper amounts of lead and
tin in    a ladle or in a crucible, sometimes       a flux  was added,      and a
considerable number of specimens            of each alloy was made, that the
results given by any one specimen             might be checked by those ob
tained from the others.          In the two alloys of tin and lead which
were employed, the metals were fused together             in quantities which
were     simple multiples     of their atomic weights;        but this is not
necessarily the only manner in which the metals may be mixed in
order to form an alloy.           This is well brought out in         a paper    by

                        of Edinburgh, Session 1885-8G.                                  689
Professor F. Guthrie on Eutexia,* which appears to have important
relations to the phenomena             recorded      in this communication.
    The first alloy tested was SnPby                    The change in resistance           in
this     case   took place      by two distinct           falls with a space between
them where         the resistance      changed       very much less rapidly.            This
experiment was repeated              several     times,    and   the    same result      was
always obtained.
    The next alloy         tested   was Sn3Pb.           In this    case  the change of
resistance was effected            by a single, fall, as in the case of a simple
metal     ; repeated      experiments        failed    to show any break in the
sudden alteration of conductivity.
     The authors were led to employ these two alloys in consequence
of    some observations made by             Eudberg,f who          states that the alloy
SngPb has one solidifying                 point, but that the others              exhibit    a
higher one also, which in the               case     of SnPb3 is very far above the
lower one.         The temperatures           given by him do not exactly corre
spond with those at which the dips appear in the conductivity curves,
but these temperatures           do not profess to any great accuracy, for the
object was       in this   case   rather to determine          the change of tempera
ture from observation to observation, than                       to give the        absolute
 temperature       of the alloy at any observation.
     One alloy of zinc and              lead    (ZnPb)      has also been       tried.      It
gives evidence         of   a  break in the alteration of conductivity,                  but
a sufficient number of observations has not been made                           upon it to
justify any       great dependence         on this result.
     The      conclusion     which       these     facts   would      seem   to    indicate,
although       it is  premature      as   yet to adopt       it as established,      is that
there      is   a  definite    alloy,     corresponding to          Professor     Guthrie's
 " Eutectic Alloy," from which the other constituents                        separate    out
and solidify, giving rise to the first fall in resistance                   as   the metal
cools, and that afterwards, when the eutectic                      alloy itself solidifies,
the second fall occurs.            A  point of great importance in this connec
tion is brought out by a comparison                       of figs.   4   and   5.    In   the
 alloy     SnPb3     the second        fall   in    resistance    occurs    at the same
 temperature       as the whole       fall in the       (eutectic)   alloy Sn3Pb.        The

G90                     Proceedings        of  the  Royal Society
first fall would then be naturally                  explained by the           solidification
of the excess of lead            contained in this alloy over that required
to form the eutectic            alloy.      This solidification of the            lead    takes
place     at   a temperature        lower than its ordinary melting                   point,    a
result doubtless in some way connected                      with its being mixed with
the alloy.        If  three    constituents are         present, as in fusible metal,
the whole of one and part of the remaining two may                               combine to
form a tri-eutectic alloy, then all that remains of one of the two
still free may form an eutectic alloy with part of the other metal ;
and lastly, there would be a residue                    of the final metal        which     was
not wholly used up in these combinations.                           This would lead to         a
curve    with    three successive        falls, which is exactly what we              find in
fusible metal.          But,   as we     have already said,          it is still premature
to form a judgment             upon the merits of this theory, especially                    as
we hope,       at no      distant time,       to be able        to  bring forward many
additional facts,         which may materially aid in the formation of                        a
conclusion for or against the suggestions                   offered above.
    It   should, perhaps,          be    mentioned that           Dr Matthiessen        made
experiments          on    fusible    metal       about      twenty       years   ago,*   but
apparently        failed    to   observe       the    nature      of    the   alteration    of
resistance.        This   may have been due              to the fact that the        form of
apparatus       he    employed was            not    so    suitable     for  detecting    the
character     of the alteration.
   The authors, in concluding this account, desire to express                           their
thanks to       Mr D. Callander for his kind                   assistance    in taking    the
temperature        observations.
   A   few words may be added in explanation of the accompanying
tables and diagrams.
    In  tables    I. and II.    are recorded       the observations on lead and tin.
Table    III.   gives observations on fusible metal, table                 IV.  on the alloy
SnPb3, and table          V. on Sn3Pb.
    In the experiments on              lead     and    fusible     metal the deflections
and times alone          are given,     as   the thermo-electric apparatus           was not
adjusted for reading temperatures                 so high and so low, respectively,
as those at      which these metals melt.                 In   the other tables the first
column       records     the time at which              each    observation was        made,
reckoned      in    seconds    from the commencement                   of the experiment;

the next column gives the temperature             of the alloy at that instant       ;
and the last column gives the deflection               reading on the scale of
the galvanometer;        which, as the angle was always very small, is
approximately      enough proportional to the current in the galvano
meter circuit, and therefore to the resistance of the alloy.
   At first the alloy     was always somewhat above its melting point,
and the observations were continued for a short time after the alloy
appeared   to be perfectly solid.
   Fig.  1 is a  diagram to illustrate the arrangement of the circuit
in the experiments with the trough. B represents the Leclanche
cell, Rj the resistance inserted in the battery circuit, K the key in
the same, T the trough, G the galvanometer inserted in the shunt
circuit taken from two points in the trough, and R2 the resistance
inserted in this circuit.
   Fig.  2 represents    the relation between the resistance and temper
ature of tin as      it solidifies.  The resistances        are  measured     along
OE, and the      temperatures     along OT     ;   these become    lower as they
recede from the point       0.
   Fig.  3 shows the same for fusible metal,            except that    in this  case
time, not temperature,      is measured along OT.
   Fig.  4 gives   the curve for the alloy SnPb3, and fig.           5  for Sn3Pb,
resistance  being measured along OR, and temperature along OT.
   The points on these curves at which observations were taken are
marked by small crosses.            As   these     observations were made          at
regular intervals of 30 seconds, the projection of these points on
the temperature        axis in figs.    2,  4,    and 5, indicate      the rate at
which the temperature          of the cooling alloy       changed.       The more
closely these projections are crowded together the more slowly doe*
the temperature      change ; and    it will     be observed    that   it is at the
very points where the falls in resistance                occur that this takes
place.    This   gives   additional corroboration to the accuracy of the
observations.
   These experiments have been performed in the Physical Labora
tory of the Edinburgh University, through the kindness of Professor
Tait, to whom, and to Professor Chrystal, at whose                suggestion     the
subject was originally untertaken, the authors are deeply indebted
for valuable   advice.

6.  Examples upon the Reading of the Circle or Circles of a
   Knot.      By the Rev. Thomas P. Kirkman, M.A., F.R.S.
   How this reading is to be done is well known            ;  but it may be
useful to have    more examples.      Consider the two following circles
of two unifilars each of fourteen   crossings —
                 oFbdcAdbeGfEgcAfEDCaDBEgJeGC,
                 a/iDcAJGeC/fyEAFBrfCaD^EcFBCe,
which are the simplest possible      that have their janal symmetries.
I wish  to show that the knots are completely given by their circles,
as are also their symmetries.

     In the circle of          an unifilar                every crossing is twice read, once in
an odd and once in an even place, the thread passing alternately
over and under itself at successive crossings.                                                The only duads that
occur twice are edges of 2-gons.                                     The first knot has six 2-gons,
bd,    BD, cA, Ca,       eG, Eg.               At the               2-gon          bd the thread Ebdc passes
over and under ebdA                     ;    and        . .   Ybdc      . .        and    . .   ebdA     . .   are meshes
collateral with the 2-gon bd.                           We take           . .      ebdA    . .    for   a hase     on which
to project the first knot, observing that                                     as   Fe and         ~Fb   are edges, F6e is
a     triangle collateral with our base                                 . .   ebdA       ...          At the 2-gon eG,
beGf passes over and under FeGC, and . . beGf . . is a mesh collateral
with eG. As be cannot be in three meshes, our base is . . AdbeGf. . ,
and since        /A
                is an edge, this base is the 6-gon AdbeGf. The first
circle is unaltered by exchanging throughout capital and small
letters. There is then another 6-gon aDBE^F in the knot.   Draw
this within the base, a remote from A, D from d, &c, so that the
meshesAdbeGf and aDBE^F are read in the same direction round ;
and make the 2-gons db, DB, ~Eg, eG. There are two other 2-gons
to construct.           From            c near          A      and C near a, between the 6-gons,
draw 2-gons Ac and aC.                              Our fourteen summits are properly pro
jected, and we complete                        the projection by drawing the edges Tb,
/B, Fe, /E, CG,              eg,    CD,       cd.
   It is evident             that on this first knot in space every feature, edge,
 crossing or mesh,                 is       diametrically               opposite to a similar                        feature.
 There is no zonal trace, at every point of which the configurations
 on the        right and left               reflect           each other ; nor is there                            a diameter
 about which in revolution                          a    configuration is repeated; that                               is,   two
    opposite    eyes    in    every diameter read round exactly the same asym
    metric sequence      ;     but this only when one reads with, and the other
    against, his watch.             The opposite configurations are in every diameter
    asymmetric and contrajanal, and the knot                                             is   a   contrajanal anaxine
    knot, on which           a     zonal       trace          is    impossible.                  About         a   janal axis
    proper,    zoned    or zoneless, opposite                           observers             read      round       like con
    figurations when each reads with his watch.                                                   This first knot            is   a
    contrajanal anaxine subsolid, i.e., one admitting section through no
    two points        only, but through the crossings of                                          a   2-gon.        There are
    contrajanal        anaxine              unsolids,           i.e.,         admitting            linear      section       not
    through the two crossings of                        a     2-gon, which have 12 or 10 crossings
    only.

       The       second           knot         has   four 2-gons, fb,           FB,       Ge,    gE.         At fb
. .    afbD       . . ,    . .   Cfbg    . .    are meshes collateral          with it; and            as   hT>   and

choose for our base. The 2-gon jrE is collateral with . . bgY,a . . and

    . . bgEa      . .,    and our base is            . .   CfbgEa   ...    As DC          and    Da    are edges,
    this       base is the 7-gon                DCfbgEa.          Inside this, with d remote from
    D,     c   from C, &c, we have to draw the heptagon dcYBGeA, and wo
    complete         the projection by the edges af,                       AF,      UD,     V><1, bg,       BG,   <'E,
    Ce, cA, Ca, and by making                              the 2-gons Gc, r/E,      //;, FB.           There is      a
    zonal       trace across the epizonal edges bg and                         BG,        and the mid-points
     of    the identical zoneless                    polar edges ac and AC, are the poles of                         a
     zoneless 2-ple contrajanal axis, about which in revolution there is                                             a
      2-ple repetition.              We         have constructed          a 2-ple    monaxine monozone
      subsolid      knot.          There are 2-ple monaxine monozone unsolid knots
      that have 12, 10, and 8 crossings only.

      complexity, and              is    the simplest knot of that symmetry that can be

/3e/3',   and      as/8' opposite to     y3sa'.    The crossing n occurs           in    circles      1

Tlie   angles c3np (1) and npb3 are              in the mesh       . . c3npb3 . .   =  L, which

     To construct       the knot G.          Cut away      the summits     of the hexarch
axine      512, and make what remains                 of the edges into thirty 2-gons.
You       have      the zoned        hexarchaxine          knot    F = 1012320230.     Each
triangle abe of          F   is collateral with three 10-gons,              A, B,   and   C.
At a in A on            the left of b, complete            by the 2-gon /?y the small
triangle     <jy8y,   and at     b  in B     and c in       C  complete     by 2-gons the
triangles bya and c/Ja.             Do the like at each of the twenty triangles
of F,     operating in the same direction round each.                      Thus G is con
 structed.
    It   is easy in like manner to form upon the regular 20-edron
 hexarchaxine knots, both zoned and zoneless, on the 4-edron such
 tetrarchaxine, and on the cube or its reciprocal such triarchaxine
 knots.

 noticed, may be         found useful :—

                    "
  notice, viz. :— That henceforth the Meetings of the                       Royal Society
  be held   in the afternoon instead of at 8 p.m."
     A letter from Mr Murray was read by the Secretary.                             In this
  letter Mr Murray apologised for his absence, and recommended
  "That the Meetings should be held alternately at 4 o'clock and at
  8  o'clock."
     Mr T. H. Cockburn Hood                 proposed     as a second        amendment—
  " That   the first Meeting        in  each month take place at 2 o'clock, an
  that Papers upon Geology, Meteorology, and Zoology be read at                          said

 1.    Notes on the Waganda Tribe of Central Africa.                            By
           Robert W. Felkin, M.D., F.R.G.S., Fellow of the An
           thropological        Societies   of    London      and    Berlin,   &c.
           (Plate   XXVII.)
      The   paper which      I have  the honour of presenting to you to-night
  is similar in construction       to those  I  have previously brought under
  your notice     on the   For   and  Madi Tribes.
      The Waganda are very different from the tribes further north,
   and a description of them will            I  think aptly illustrate the very
   marked contrasts presented by the           various Central African Tribes.
      As in the former      papers,   I have   written from notes of my own
   observations made         when in the country,        and from information
   supplied to me by people         of the tribe.     While    I  do not give any
   thing that has not formed the subject of my personal investigation,
   it is yet impossible     to avoid mentioning       matters    and details which
   have been more or less touched on by other travellers.
      Uganda occupies       a  position to the north, north-west, and west of
   the   Victoria Nyanza. It is bounded on the north by the 1st
   degree of North latitude, on the south by the Kitangule River, on
   the east by the Nile, and on the west by the 31st degree of East
   longitude.     The country is divided into three provinces — Uddu in
   the south, Singo     in  the west, and Changwe       in  the east ; and to this
   latter province must be reckoned about 400 islands, called by the
   collective name of Sesse.
      The western frontier of the country is very ill-defined, and may
   be  found to extend considerably beyond the limit here assigned to

700                     Proceedings        of  the   Royal Society
it.     The equator, as will be seen from a glance at the map, divides
the country into two almost equal parts.
     Physical      Features     of    the   Country. — The       physical    features of
Uganda are very varied, and give                 a  distinct character to the different
districts.       The country bordering the lake and for some distance
inland is mountainous, especially in the north-west, where parallel
low mountain chains are found.                   The general elevation of         the lull*
above      their valleys is about 400 feet, and in the marshy valleys
between them sluggish streams make their way to the Nyanza.                              All
the    hills are covered      with splendid timber and abundant underwood.
 Further inland the         valleys widen and the hills gradually decrease in
size,    until   at   the   northern       border the       country becomes        a plain,
 intersected      at long intervals by large rush drains, and covered                  with
 open     forest    or rank grass jungle.             The eastern    part of Uganda,
 between Eubagaand            the Nile, consists        of undulating country varied
 by deep narrow valleys.
     Geology.    — The formation of           the rocks is volcanic or metamorphic.
 The upper strata of land, for the depth of                 2 or 3 feet,  is  a rich black
 alluvial soil, under which is a bed of red sandy clay averaging about
 30 feet in thickness, and              lower still in many places is           a  layer of
 tolerably pure porcelain earth.                 Large masses of mica are found,
 and     at   the    outcrop     of     the    metamorphic       rocks    crystals     may
 frequently        be   seen.     Ironstone       is   also   found   in    rather large
 quantities, but as far        as   is known no other metals are to be obtained.
     Climate. — The climate is remarkably mild, and                    the temperature
  very    uniform throughout             the   year.     The   extreme    variations    are
  50°    F. minimum          (extremely rare)          and   90°  F. maximum.          The
  rainfall    is about     50 inches,        and the      atmosphere    is very humid.
  There are two periods of maximum rainfall                      — March, April, and
  May,      and September,           October, and         November.       During      these
  months rain falls nearly every day, often accompanied                     by thunder.
      Population. — The total population of Uganda is                 about 5 millions.
  It  is principally composed            of the Waganda who inhabit the main
  land north of the Victoria Nyanza, and the Wasesse                         who inhabit
  the islands.        These two tribes are of the same stock, the difference
  in name only denoting the districts in which they dwell                         They are
  pure negroes, of dark chocolate                coloured skin (Broca's Table, No.
  35-43).        Colour of eyes, Broca's Table, 35.             The men are tall, well

built, and have good features, and the women in their youth are
good-looking, with small delicately formed hands and feet.                                          It is
of this tribe that my paper treats.                             I  shall not touch upon the
Wanyambo who live in Uddu and Karagwe, or the Wasoga who
live to the east of the 2»ile, but it                      will    be necessary        to mention       a
small tribe, the Wahuma, who inhabit scattered villages throughout
the whole of Uganda.                  They number between 40,000 and 50,000.
They       are    probably        descended          from      the original         inhabitants        of
Abyssinia, and there is no doubt that the ancestors of the reigning
family of Uganda were Wahuma.
     In order to give an idea of                the form and size of the                Waganda,        I
give the measurements                 of five men.              The numbers correspond to

     Notes on People              Measured.         — 1. Kanjambo,            a    Mganda.         Age,

tinge ; head shaved ; a few black hairs on upper lip ; pretty well
nourished ; pock-marked ; second toe on foot a little longer than
first   ; birthplace, Buriaki.
      4. Kitasmibo,           a   Mganda.        Age, about        23 ;  skin   dirty     senna
brown       ;  hair   short, curly, black, dull              ;  few  hairs on upper lip          ;
 pock-marked        ;    birthplace, Dunuga.
      5. Kibata,      a   Mganda.          Age, 44    ;   skin nearly sepia-brown         ;  lips
 a   little   darker    ;  iris, deep dark brown           ; conjunctivae,    dirty yellow       ;
 hair black, short, curly, dull ; a few hairs on upper lip, black,
 curly, bright ; ears small, with small lobes, lying well back ; nails
 light    ;  body fairly well nourished, not very muscular.
      The palms of hands and soles of                    feet of all the Waganda are a
 lighter shade than the skin ; their                      teeth   are all   good,    none     ex
  tracted.
       Anatomy and Physiology. — The temperature taken in the axilla
  for five minutes, the subjects being                  at rest in the shade, at about
  9   a.m., averaged         97"6 F.      (150 observations taken).             Respirations
  under like conditions            averaged      16, pulse 68.
       The Waganda do not bear cold very well. They usually keep
   up a fire in their huts during the cold nights, and in the early
  mornings they are always to be seen sitting near                       a good    fire.     The
  sun seems to have no untoward effect upon them, and they do not
   use any protection for              their   heads.       They are      hardy, and bear
   privation well.         Their    muscles     are decidedly red in colour, and the
   fat   has   a slight       yellow      tinge.     The       mucous    membrane        of the
   mouth is highly stained with pigment.                       The skin is velvety to the
   touch, this feeling being due to natural secretion                      and not to the
   application of grease.            They    do not perspire much.            I   noticed no
   peculiarity in their teeth.             The voice is melodious and rather deep.
       Pathology. — My          residence    in Uganda         was not sufficiently long to
    enable me to give any exhaustive account of this subject.                           I   must
    not, however, pass         it over without       some few remarks.
       Phthisis is not very prevalent in Uganda, but                   I saw some eighteen
   or twenty     well-marked          cases.      It  is recognised      by the natives as
    an incurable disease.           It  is treated by the actual cautery applied to
   the   chest   walls,      by cupping,         and also by decoctions of various
    roots to relieve        the cough.           Cows' horns        are used    in    place    of
    cupping glasses.

704                          Proceedings          of    the   Royal Society
     Small-pox          occurs      in epidemics, and                  is very            fatal        It    is rare
to    find         persons     pitted, for          very      few survive                 an       attack.      The
disease travels from east to west, and according to native tradition
it first     made       its appearance              after the arrival of a caravan                             from
Unyanyembe.                  Persons         attacked by it are                  to           a   certain    extent
isolated       ;    they are placed in a small hut in which a large fire                                          is
burning        ;    no meat       is given them, and the pustules are opened by                                    a
thorn,       the body             being      often       smeared       by butter or oil.                       This
disease has caused                so much ravage              in    the country, that at last the
people have connected                   it with     a    deity supposed                  to reside     at    the top
of Mount Gambaragara,                     and in times of epidemic offerings are                               made
in    the hope of staying the scourge.
     Toothache does not occur, at least                        I    never heard of a case                     ; but
sciatica       and lumbago are fairly common.                                    Treatment             for    these
disorders is the               application of a red-hot iron, which                                   is    usually
attended           by good results.           Cholera has visited Uganda on several
occasions,          but diarrhoea and dysentery are not very common.                                              A
good number of the people suffer                          from bronchitis, and rheumatism
very frequently attacks them.
     With regard             to    malarial       fever,       those        natives who are                   fairly
stationary in one district                   suffer      comparatively little, and from but
slight attacks of ague, but after removing to                                    a       new district much
severer attacks are experienced.                         It   is frequently observed                   that after
war, a number of men are struck down by severe                                                    malarial fever.
The Waganda have several medicines for treating this disease ; all
cause profuse          perspiration.           It       was   impossible for me to ascertain
the nature of these                drugs, as the medicine-men regarded                                  me    with
jealous eyes, and absolutely refused                               to satisfy my curiosity.                     On
several occasions,            when the king told them to show me the various
drugs they used, they tried to mislead me by producing valueless
specimens.
     Ophthalmia is not very common, although cases do at times occur.
Blindness is very rare              ;    I   only heard of one blind man.
     Neither        are skin       diseases     very common             ;    I    saw a few cases of
eczema, and no doubt leprosy at times occurs                                         ;    the people much
dread    it,   and recognise its hereditary character.                                   It   is   very common
to see people          covered by boils.                 Local applications of chewed roots
are made           for them.

                            of Edinburgh, Session 1885—86.                                705
     Epilepsy         is  fairly  common,      especially occurring         in   girls.    No
medicine is          used in its treatment, and        if the girls suffering from           it
marry, their father rarely receives any dowry for them. Temporary
insanity occurs ; the fits last three or four days, and those affected
usually retire to the jungle, returning when the fit has passed
away        ;   they are rarely violent.
      "Venereal diseases are very frequent, especially among                      ^the   men.
 All     varieties     are seen,  but it seems to have         a  tendency to cure.           I
 saw thirty or forty           cases  in which    the   tertiary symptoms were well
 marked.           The natives blame the Arabs for its introduction into the
 country.           I found    that, whenever the AYaganda came to me saying
 that they were suffering from             a snake  in their insides, their complaint
 was gonorrhoea.
       I  may mention that all the diseases appear                to be very acute, and
  there       is an undoubted        tendency to inflammation            ; but the people
  do not succumb readily, and             appear    to possess remarkable vitality.
  They        bear pain exceedingly well, and         I  am convinced that they do
  not     suffer as acutely as Europeans after an accident, although they do
   not evince quite so much sang froid as Arabs                   do under the knife.
       Wounds heal with remarkable rapidity, and                   I was much      surprised
   to   see    how quickly the "VVaganda recovered            after extensive burns or
   ghastly gashes.
       There is a class of medicine-men in Uganda, and although a good
   deal    of superstition is mixed up with and many                   charms are used      in
   the treatment of disease,            they unquestionably           have   a  remarkable
   knowledge of simples.              Their knowledge,       too, of the      treatment of
   fractures is very fair.          They also evince       considerable ingenuity           in
   the application of neatly constructed splints.
       Development        and Decay.    — It  was impossible to gain any accurate
   information as to the average or extreme length of life, but it may
   be generally stated that few very old persons                 of either sex are met
   with.         Puberty is arrived at early, and women               cease  child-bearing
   at a comparatively          early age.     Although     I  examined the teeth            of
   several       hundred    Waganda,      I  never saw      a case of caries.           Their
   teeth      are remarkably well-preserved, and even                in old    people    they
   are   little worn.       If  children's teeth do not appear at the right              time
    it is considered unlucky, but they are not put to death                       as  among
    some tribes.
       vol.     xiil                                                             3 A

706                    Proceedings     of  the  Royal Society
    Hair. — The Waganda           have    short woolly hair, which appears to
grow uniformly scattered over the             skull      It is coarse and dull, and
is not cultivated, but shaven periodically.                 It  is customary at the
Court for every one to have their heads shaved whenever                       the king
lias received a visit from his barber.             Some of the AVaganda              have
a   little hair on their         faces,    and    those who         possess    a    slight
moustache       or beard are very proud of them.                The hair from          the
rest of the body is almost invariably            removed, sometimes         by     means
of   a  razor,    otherwise    by depilation.         The women are the             usual
barbers    ;  they use a small sickle-shaped razor, which is sharp on its
convex side, and they employ their own milk for lubrication.                              I
saw very few grey headed people, certainly not more than a dozen.
    Colour. —     I  have before mentioned         the colour of this tribe, and
individuals       vary very little.      The     children    are   decidedly     lighter
at birth, but at about three years of age they correspond to their
parents.       The ruling families are undoubtedly of a lighter shade,
but this is accounted for by their origin.               Here,   as  in other Central
African tribes,        one   meets    with    individuals      having     small    white
patches      due    to  the absence     of pigment.         The    natives   attribute
these patches to syphilis (kabalongo), and say that the amount                          of
whiteness shows the extent of the disease.                     Europeans, they say,
must be in       a  shocking state.
    Odour. — The Waganda possess a national and constitutional odour.
It   is distinctive,      but not so objectionable          to   Europeans      as   that
exhaled by various other tribes.              It  is certainly     not due to dirty
habits or to cosnietiques.          With      one   exception, the Waganda             do
not use any cosmetic application            (see  Customs).
    Motions. — The Waganda walk with                a  long easy swinging        stride.
The body        is well balanced,    the head slightly thrown          back and the
arms are permitted to swing easily.              The foot is firmly planted when
walking,      and the length of stride is about 28 inches.                   The toes
are slightly turned out in walking.               When standing          at ease    they
place    one foot      in  advance   of the other, the knees being slightly
 bent.    All their attitudes       are graceful and unconstrained.                Their
arms hang with the palm to the side.                They are very fleet runners,
and spring and jump in a light easy manner, their joints being very
 pliable,    especially fingers and toes.           They occupy         the squatting
position when following the calls of nature                 as  a rule, but on the

                               of Edinburgh, Session 1885-86.                               707
 march they micturate standing.                        Each finger can be extended
separately.              In pointing at any object, the whole hand, the ring,
and sometimes the middle finger are employed (see Labour).
      Physiognomy. — The faces of the Waganda are most expressive ;
joy, sorrow,          anger, or disgust betraying           themselves on the features
 immediately.               They also possess the         power of mimicry, and when
  delivering a message or relating an occurrence will imitate                               the
  tones, gestures, and expressions of the sender of the message or                          the
  subject of narration. Affirmation is expressed by 'nodding                                the
  head vertically, negation by a lateral motion. In order to                               add
  emphasis both hands                are used   in the same way.
        Physical Powers. — The Waganda                 are probably one of the strongest
   of Central African tribes.               The men will carry loads of 100 or 120
   lbs. weight for           20 miles a day for eight or ten days without               incon
   venience.          A    party of Waganda          sent from Eubaga to Mrooli, 92
    miles    as the      crow flies, went and returned in five days, including                 a
    rest of half      a day at      Mruli.
         Senses. — Sight, hearing, and smell             are very acute.    The army test-
    dots were counted accurately at 24 yards by fifteen Waganda.                           The
    sense of touch is better developed than                 in some other African        tribes
     I know.         The average least distances at which             two blunted points
     of   a pair of compasses could be separately distinguished                     by fifteen
     Waganda         were as    follows : — Tip of      tongue, iVth of an inch ; tip of
     nose, Jd     of    an   inch  ; upper lip, |th of an inch; palm of the hand,
     ¦j^jths of an inch ; tip of forefinger, Jth of an inch ; back of hand,
      li inch; dorsum of foot,            2 inches.
         Abnormalities.        — Albinos      are   occasionally    met    with   ;  they    are
     looked upon          as  curiosities, and several      of them arc retained by the
     king and       the great chiefs as buffoons.            As a rule their hair is straw-
      coloured, and their skin rough and coarse and of                     a  pinkish-white
      colour  ;    their     eyes   are  very    weak,     and they     often    suffer    from
      ophthalmia       ;   they have very little power of smell.          They have       a  bad
      repute,    as  they are irascible and treacherous.              I  could not obtain
      any opinion from the natives as to their origin, but they stoutly
      deny their being the offspring of brothers and sisters.                     One albino
       whom     I personally       knew was the third child of a family of four,
       the first two and the fourth               being perfectly normal       ;  this albino
       was married, and had two normal children                   by two different wives.

708                     Proceedings     of  the   Royal Society
A few dwarfs          may    be seen about the          Court   ; they are privileged
nuisances    ;   their behaviour is very indecent, but they are greatly
petted and indulged, and often become                   possessed     of much wealth.
It  is very rare to find any other abnormalities.                 The pure Waganda
women have         a  custom which is so much disliked by the men                    of the
surrounding        tribes that it effectually prevents intermarriage                   'with
them.     The practice is that of forming the " Hottentot apron."
The labia minora are artificially elongated ; of that there can be no
reasonable      doubt, for     I have   failed to find any congenital deformity
in any of       the children      that   I  examined.         They are early taught
the necessary       manipulation, and, as soon          as the size    of the labia     will
permit, a weighted appliance is fixed to the parts to help to increase
the hypertrophe.           The longest labia        I  noticed extended to         within
an inch or so of the knee.             The origin of this practice           I  failed to
ascertain.
    Crosses. — The only intermarriages which take                    place    in Uganda
are those      of Waganda         chiefs with Wahuma              girls, and between
Waganda and women who have been taken during slave raids.
   The first class of marriages          produce decidedly superior offspring              ;
the first-born      children of the second         class, who are generally          girls,
are   inferior,     subsequent children showing                an improvement          (see
Causes that       Limit Population).
   Tattooing,      §-c.
                        — Tattooing, which is       so   common in all surrounding
tribes, is not practised by the Waganda                 ;   indeed,  it is strictly    pro
hibited, and the laws on the subject are very severe.                     To this is to
some extent due           the slight    progress     which Mohammedanism                has
made     in the country,          as  circumcision        is also    forbidden.       Any
Mganda upon whom this operation has been performed is liable to
be burnt to death;          indeed,   a few years ago some sixty or seventy
boys and young men upon whom some Arabs had performed the rite
were all    burnt by order of the king.                Teeth are never extracted,
and mutilations of the body, such              as  boring the nose or lips, are not
allowed.
   Dress.  — With the exception of the Wanyoro, who                          also   clothe
themselves      from head to foot, the Waganda are the only people in
Central    Africa that        are clothed    in   a respectable       manner.       Strict
laws are in vogue with regard to dress, and in the streets and public
places   every one over about five years                 of age is compelled to be

                        of Edinburgh, Session 1885-86.                              709
attired      completely.    Death is the penalty attached             to the neglect
of     this  law.    In the harems, however, the younger women usually
dispense with clothing          altogether,   or at most wear        a simple string
of     beads around the waist.          The national dress is mbugu, a dark
cloth       made    from a species of fig       (see  Manufactures).        The men
wear      a strip of this material as a loin cloth, and a large flowing robe
of     the same stuff draped like a Roman toga.               It   passes under the
left    arm and is tied in       a large   knot over the right shoulder           ; the
 arms are free, and a girdle usually of string fastens the garment
 round the waist. The women wear loin cloths too, but they fasten
 their mbugu dress just under the armpits. Instead of or added to
 thi3 costume the chiefs wear skin clothing, which is made either of
 a whole bullock skin or of two or             three goat skins sewn together,
 or of from twenty to forty skins of the Ntalaganya,                   a diminutive
 antelope      about the size of a hare, which          has a beautifully       glossy
 coat of     a rich dark brown colour.          Buffalo hide sandals,        in  shape
 like    a boat, are invariably worn      by  the chiefs, and the lower classes
 usually wear ox skin sandals.
     When going to war the men divest             themselves     of all their cloth
  ing   save the loin cloth, which on such occasions           is usually made of
  hide, and many of them wear feather head-dresses.
     Foreign dress is gradually        being introduced, and the chiefs are
  by   degrees    discarding  the mbugu       in favour of Arab and Turkish
  costume.      Ten years ago members of the Court alone were permitted
  to dress in foreign garb    ;   but of late years greater freedom has been
   permitted on this point
      The chiefs, pages, and others at Court wear fantastic head-dresses
   of white or coloured       pocket handkerchiefs.           Some of the king's
   bodyguard wear the fez.         Away from     the capital,   if  head-dresses are
   worn at all, they are small caps made of plaited grass.               Turbans are
   very rarely seen.
      Ornaments.    — The  men do not as a rule overload themselves               with
   ornaments,     but they content themselves           with    one    or two wire
   bracelets and a few charms        hung round the neck by            a  small cord
   made    out  of  the tail of   a giraffe.    The    women,     however, are far
   more   gaily decorated  ; necklaces,    bracelets,   waistbands, and anklets
   of beads being extensively worn.           All   these articles are very well
   made ;   the colours are tastefully arranged, and the shapes are varied

710                  Proceedings      of   the   Royal Society
and unique.        Some    of the bracelets            and necklaces are made of
neatly carved wooden beads of home manufacture, and many of the
women wear suspended              over one shoulder or round             the waist a
cylindrical pocket, highly ornamented with                    beads,  in which they
carry their tobacco, coffee berries,           and odds and ends.          I must
forget to mention that some few of the chiefs wear very                    well    made
finger rings of silver obtained from Maria Theresa dollars.
   Habits and     Customs.     — At court       and     in the capital the "Waganda
stand much upon ceremony, and this is not alone                       confined to      the
higher classes, but extends, though in            a   rather less extent, throughout
the whole nation.         If   two men of equal            rank meet in the street,
they slightly incline their bodies and say Kuh'uuji, or the one may
say Otia, to which the other replies Otidno.                   Sometimes also they
grasp hands, or place the right            hand on the left shoulder           of their
friend, but this is only       if they intend        to remain for a short      conver
sation.    If  an   inferior    meets    a   superior, he either bends forward,
placing his hands on his knees           ;  or  if  he has a stick, leans    well for
ward supporting himself upon it             ; or   if   of very low rank, he kneels
down, and bending forward grasps                   his legs with his hands, in all
cases saying either      Kulungi     sebbo    or Otia sebbo,     which is replied to
by E.     {Kulungi expresses           "good day," Otia, "how              are   you?"
and sebbo,    " master" or
                                "sir.")
    A woman meeting         a man bends very low before him as salutation,
 or may even kneel, this being always the case should the man
 saluted be of high rank.          If  two men meet after a long absence, or
 even   men    and   women who are relations, they take hold of                     each
 others' hands, and spreading them out throw the head over first one
 shoulder and then the other, at the same time making use of                          the
 following    dialogue: — Otia,        otia; otidno, otidno ; erddi, erddi ;
 nywji, nyogi ; warn, mam ; which                  is succeeded      by an indefinite
 series  of ugh's.       Members       of the       same    family    meeting in      the
 morning     do not usually         make      any remark.         Should    a superior
 visit an inferior      at his hut,      all rise and then kneel down             ;   hut
 should inferiors visit      a  superior, on entering his presence they              first
 kneel, and subsequently at           a wave      from his hand seat themselves.
 When strangers arrive at         a hut, it is usual for the occupants to           offer
 them coffee-berries,     water, and beer, and            the children run for lights
 for their pipes.        Should     the visit be made at a meal              time     the

                         of Edinburgh, Session 1885-86.                             711
stranger is always invited to               partake.       Chiefs visiting    the  king
stoop      or kneel before him       ;  he stretches      out his hand, which they
•fconch between        both theirs, after which they place their hands on
•fcheir lips.      If  any one receives a favour of the king he thanks him
in a      peculiar manner.         Ho kneels down, and placing both hands
 •together he sways          his body backwards and forwards, his hands
 arising and     falling   on either side of his face, while he says Nyanzig
 (J.   thank), repeating the word and action some twenty or thirty
 times.       He then suddenly falls flat         on his face, and commences          to
 "beat the ground with his hands and cheeks, the head being rotated
 at    each prostration, first one cheek and then the other touching the
 ground,      the legs being vigorously          kicked     at the same time.        At
  court it is customary if the king laughs, for            every one to laugh, at the
  same time placing the hand before the mouth.                   If the   king sneezes,
 everybody sneezes        ; should the king have a cold, every one simulates
  one   ; and as    I have before mentioned,         if  the king visits his barber,
  every one does the same.             Should a favour be requested          by a high
  chief and granted by the king,           the chief snatches up a stick, charges
  towards the king, executes a dance, and expresses his gratitude with
  exuberant compliments.
      On    all   occasions    rules    of   precedence      are    strictly  enforced.
  Strangers rank next the host at social gatherings.
      Flattery    is very commonly practised,             but this is less so in the
  country district       than at the        capital,    where   an artificial    polish
  exists.
      No remarkable ceremonial            customs     obtain in Uganda, nor are
  there any ancient feasts or harvest festivals.
      Should a man meet any of the king's wives in the street, he turns
  aside and averts his head.           When at court, too, men are very careful
  not to look at the king's women,              as  they might be charged          with
  flirtation.     On one occasion,        one of my servants           nearly lost his
  head by not knowing           this rule.     I  had taken him up to court to
  vaccinate     him in the king's presence, and whilst            I  was preparing to
  do so, he commenced          a mild flirtation       with   one   of Mtesa's   wives.
  The chiefs were intensely indignant, and demanded                     his execution,
  but the king for once listened to my protestations,               and a good laugh
  at last ended an awkward scene.
      Speaking of women, it is the custom for strangers to be provided

712                   Proceedings            of tlie Royal Society
with temporary wives in Uganda.                               Unfortunate              Europeans who
refuse the proffered        favour are despised by the men and                                   scorned by
the women.          Mtesa used to be very sarcastic                         on this            subject,       and
referred with great delight to Solomon's wives.                                  On one occasion                   I
gave great offence by refusing the munificent                              gift of eighteen dusky
beauties.     I   suffered for       it,                    of food
                                           however, by having my supplies
cut short.  This may perhaps be as well explained, as it will illus
trate another custom.    The king's women are allowed to pillage
right and left, and Mtesa, who had got tired of supplying my
voracious appetite, thought he saw    way out of the difficulty bv

dignant at my supposed depreciation of their charms.
    The only occasion for         a     set speech            in Uganda          is    when a        chief or
a   person of high rank receives              a     present.          If   it   is   small, he takes           it
in his right hand     ;if   too heavy, he lays his hands upon                               it   and makes
a   speech of thanks to the giver, extolling the value of the                                    present in
exaggerated       terms.

     Habitations.    — The first look at                a    Waganda            village informs the
traveller that he      is   in   a   region inhabited              by      a    tribe very different
from any he has hitherto seen.                          If    the place         is   of   a    considerable
size, broad, clean streets are found between the various compounds.
The groups of huts are surrounded by gardens enclosed                                                in well-
built wickerwork walls,              made from the tall tiger-grass                        or sugar-cane,
supported at intervals            by    a    species of fig tree, which                     throws out        a
large     crown of branches                affording         pleasant       shade.            Above      these
hedges may         be seen       the conical thatched roofs of                         I       suppose       the
largest     huts in Africa.            Even        in small villages the streets though
narrower are well kept, and                  it    is   rare indeed to find                a   hut without
a    courtyard in front of it.                It    is   remarkable also that the streets
are straight, and          that the fences               are straight           also      instead of the
usual circular structures seen almost everywhere else.                                           The com
pounds inhabited by the principal                            chiefs are very large               ;   there    is
only one door, just inside of which                       a    small hut          is      erected    for the
porter.       The whole          of the enclosure                is    divided            by fences       into
gardens     and     courtyards, and in each yard are one or more huts.
In   about the centre of the compound stands the largest hut, which

is occupied by                 the chief.             The        women belonging                   to his harem
inhabit others                 beyond          it,    and separated                    from   it    by       a   strong
hedge containing                  a    door.         The huts between                    the chief's dwelling
and      the main entrance are allotted to the slaves or are used                                            as store
houses.
      The huts           are      dome-shaped             in form, and being thatched down
to      the ground             look       like       huge        bee-hives.              The       materials           em
ployed in erecting them                        are the stout stems of the tall tiger-grass,
poles      made          from the fig trees, and grass.                                They are constructed
as follows — A fine ring of
                 :                                  grass, closely enveloped                    with the fibrous
 outer part of the banana                            stem,   is    laid        upon the          ground, and             a
 number of tiger-grass stems                         are implanted in              it    and securely tied to
 it   with strips of papyrus.                       Then a second and third ring are added
 at intervals of about                  15 inches.               At length when                 the curvature of
 the rings       becomes sufficiently slight to allow of the tiger-grass                                          stems
 being bent without                    breaking, the rings are formed of them instead
 of    the fine grass employed at first, the whole umbrella-shaped frame
 being gradually raised                  as the       work proceeds.                    This forms       the frame
 work for the top of the roof, and when finished                                              it   is   turned over
 and raised by means of poles to its requisite position.                                                The ground
 to be occupied by the hut                           is   then covered                 with     poles in parallel
 lines but decreasing                    in length from the centre                            outwards.           These
 support         the roof and also form                      a   scaffolding to enable the builders
 to complete             the rafters           of the roof and subsequently to thatch it.
  Long bundles of grass are now tied to the ribs to form the thatch,
  beginning          from the bottom, and finally                             a   peak,       formed of          a    large
  sheaf of grass very tightly bound together,                                     is   added.      The free edge
  of each        layer of thatch               is    carefully trimmed                   to give        it   a   regular
 appearance          ;   inside the hut wickerwork                             walls are constructed,                  the
  pattern in many cases being extremely neat.
       A   large door              or 10 feet          high          cut out of the side of the hut,
                                                                 is is
                              8
  over which         a    neatly curved porch                            erected.         When this              is   done
  many of the poles supporting the roof are removed, and the interior
 of the hut              is   divided      by numerous partitions                             of tiger-grass into
  various compartments, in the innermost of which the owner's bed
  is   constructed.            The floor of the hut                      is   level and beaten firmly by
  clubs; the door                 is   of wickerwork,               made          to slide backwards                   and
 f    jrwards,    and fastened behind                        by      a        bar and pins         ;    handles are

714                    Proceedings              of   the    Royal Society
placed in the middle of             it,   both inside and out, to move                 it    with.         2s o
aperture    is   left for the      smoke to escape.
     Outside the hut      a    bank of earth               is   placed all round, consolidated
by wetting and stamping                   it,   in order to prevent the water soaking
into the house during the heavy rains.                                 The floors of the huts              are
carefully covered         with soft fine              grass   ;   first   a    small bundle of even
lengths         placed on the ground, another at right angles to                                           and
                                                                                                  it, it
           is
partially overlapping             it,   and then        a   third       at right    angles to              and
so on.     Some of the huts, which one might term summer-houses,                                           are
lightly built of wickerwork walls and                           a   light thatched conical roof.
The wickerwork         is   often composed                  of various coloured grasses, and
the patterns woven are varied and chaste.                                    The chiefs pride them
selves     very much upon their houses,                             and should they find the
slightest mistake         after they are finished                         they have them pulled
down and rebuilt        ;     the builders           in such        a   case   getting no compensa
tion.
  A     hut here and there may be seen with gable                                  roofs and vertical
                                                                                                            d<
walls, but they have probably been copied from foreigners and                                               >
not need description,              save         that the walls are composed                      of three
layers, the inner and outer ones being of wickerwork,                                and the middle
one of grass some         2   feet thick.
     Furniture. — In the larger establishments huts                                are provided            for
different purposes.            There       is   first   a   reception hall, where the owner
receives his guests       ;    next his private hut, where he sleeps, has his
meals, and       in which     he keeps his greatest treasures.                        Then there are
storehouses     ;   one for dried plantains, another for semsem seed,                                which
is   kept in large earthenware pots or wickerwork                                  baskets   ;   another
serves    the purpose        of    a    cellar, and         in   it     may be seen innumerable
large bottle        gourds        filled with the native                     drink, plantain         wine,
neatly corked with banana leaves.                          Another hut serves as             a   kitchen,
and in     it   are several fireplaces               constructed of three stones.                 People
who only possess one hut use its various partitions for the different
purposes    just described.               From the            poles       which support the roof
baskets of various descriptions are hung, suspended by ropes, tied
to the poles by       a   complicated clove hitch.                           The beds are made of
wickerwork, and raised                  a foot       or two from the ground                 ;    they are
covered     by hides and Mbugu                    cloth.          In     many of the houses                the
walls are hung with Mbugu                       cloth, which            is   often dyed in various

                      of Edinburgh, Session 1885-86.                             715
patterns.      The huts aro remarkably clean, and on account               of their
large size one is not so much oppressed by the smoke from the fire
aa is so usually the case in      African dwellings.         The only drawback
to comfort is the       grass carpet,   which harbours an army of fleas.
 All stores of tobacco, coffee,    &c,  are neatly packed in banana leaves
 and tied with string.         Remarkable order obtains in the huts, a
 place for everything and everything         in its    place being the universal
 practice.
    Fire. — Fire is obtained, whenever required, by friction, one              piece
 of wood being rotated by the hands in a small hole cut in a                   piece
 of hard   wood.      Wood is the only fuel used.            Fire is  carried from
 one place to another by means           of a    slow match made of Mbugu
 cloth.    A  glowing ember is carried from the fire to light pipes, by
 either two sticks or neatly made            iron tongs.        At night torches,
 composed     of strips of wood from        a resinous      tree, are used when
 going for any distance     ;  this is partly to scare away wild animals.
    Food. — The Waganda subsist chiefly upon                a vegetable   diet, and
 the banana, of which there are several varieties,            is the staple    food.
 The varieties have all different names         ;  that named minvu is eaten
 raw  ;  nakalalulu, kibuzi, gonya, and mizunzu are the kinds used only
 for cooking.     The bananas grow everywhere, and require little or no
 cultivation save pruning, which is performed by old women.                      The
 sweet potato     is next in importance       as an   article of diet, and is the
 chief vegetable cultivated.       The coffee tree is extensively grown —
 the berries are very small, and they are eaten whole ; nearly every
 one carries    about with him a small wicker box containing dried
 coffee berries, and should he meet a friend he offers him a few berries
 as one might offer a pinch of snuff.          Small quantities of the follow
 ing plants are      grown : — Sugar-cane,     a    kind of  red spinage, casava,
 maize,    sesamum,     millet,   tullabone,      Hdmia bulbifera,        Colocasia
 antiquorum, several species of beans,              a species    of solanum,     and
 two or three kinds of pumpkins.           The principal edible fruits are —
 mpafu, a    fruit like a damson     with a very hard stone and             a sweet
 nut-like kernel, and matungru, a species of amomum.
    Arab traders residing in Uganda, have introduced the cultivation
 of wheat, rice, guavas, papaws, pomegranates,             tomatos,   and    onions,
 and    their cultivation    is gradually spreading among            the    natives.
 Radishes and Hibiscus escidentus have been introduced from Egypt.

Although there are a good number of fowls they are seldom                                                eaten,
and eggs are also rarely partaken of.
  Beef, mutton, and goat's flesh                         are all eaten, but              they are great
luxuries,        and can only be afforded by the well-to-do.                                      The         best
meat by far is the              goat's      flesh   ;   when young it is tender                       and well
flavoured.            The beef is tough and insipid and very lean,                              and       sheep
are very scarce.            Porcupines are also eaten.
  Near the Nyanza and in the islands of Sesse fish is                    largely con
sumed.           There is       a   great     variety, from the diminutive mukeni,
about the size of whitebait, to the large kambari, which often weighs
100 lbs.          Milk is       used     to a considerable extent;                       as a     rule sour
milk    is preferred.           Butter is made as follows              :—     The evening and the
morning milk are mixed, set aside for an hour or two, and then
shaken in gourds until the butter is formed                               ;   it   is then        placed in
small baskets lined with banana leaves.                            Cheese is made by              the curds
being strained through a grass sieve                          ;   they are then wrapped             in a
grass mat and placed                 under    a     heavy weight.             In   some     parts of the
country the people                  will not drink milk,             as    it would entail their
having to do             with cattle  later).  Locusts and ants are much
                                            {see
relished     ;   they are generally fried.    Salt is extremely scarce, and
is considered a            great       luxury       ;   it   is   imported         from         the     Albert
Nyanza.            Antelopes,          buffaloes,         and      elephants        are     all       eaten       as
opportunity serves.  Earth is occasionally eaten (see later).
   Cooking. — With the exception of milk and one species of banana
all articles of food are cooked.                        Women usually perform all culinary
operations save when the men are hunting                                  or at war.              There are
no ceremonies            or superstitions connected with cooking, and the food
for both sexes is prepared together, but                             it is      eaten separately              {see
Meals).          In   large establishments one or more                        huts are set apart                  as
kitchens, but even those families who only possess one hut cook
indoors, probably on account of the rainy climate and the sudden
storms.          There are comparatively few cooking utensils used                                      in the
preparation of food.                  The pots           employed         for      most purposes are
large     globular earthen vessels                      holding      about         two     gallons,           and
having very wide mouths.                       The bananas are cooked                      as   follows       :   —
A small quantity of water being placed in                                       the      pot,     sticks are
arranged         above    it,   upon which banana leaves are laid.                              The unripe
fruit   is   then peeled and placed upon the leaves so that                                       it   may        be

steamed.       If     meat or fish is to be cooked at the same time, young
banana       leaves    are    taken and            the greater         part of        the midrib
removed.        They are then held over the fire to make them supple,
and the meat is wrapped tightly in them and placed on the top of
the bananas.          This
                         of cooking renders the meat very tender.
                              mode
All the gravy is retained in the meat and is served up with it.
Sometimes meat is baked in pots ; if so, two or three sticks are
placed across the bottom to prevent it being burnt.                                   Sometimes
the meat is cut into small strips, skewered                          on sticks, and roasted
over red-hot ashes.            Some           kinds of   bananas and the ears of maize
are roasted in the ashes.                If   a sheep or a goat is to be roasted whole,
a stake is driven through                it,   and supported on forked sticks over             a
bright fire.        The stick    is      turned now and then, and sometimes                  the
meat    is   basted     with oil or rubbed with                   fat, but no precautions     are
taken to collect the dripping.                   No   ovens are used, nor are hot stones
employed in boiling.                 The natives prefer the meat well cooked
and fresh, high meat being very rarely eaten.                           The cooking utensils
are carefully cleansed after use.                  Bread or cakes are unknown, save
a    kind of   cake     made from banana                 flour.     The dried bananas         are
pounded in       a    wooden     mortar with a wooden pestle, and the flour
is   then either mixed with water and boiled                             as   porridge or else
baked in an open pot over the fire so forming                            a    cake.     Fish and
meat    are prepared         for future consumption by smoking or drying in
the sun, but they are afterwards further cooked either by steaming
or frying before          use.       Bananas are also preserved                 by being split
and then dried in the sun   War).         (see              Kitchen middens
                                                      are formed
in one corner of the compound not far from the kitchen, but they
are periodically         removed          to the plantain            groves   or forest      The
cooks wash their hands before                         commencing operations and also
before serving the food.
  Manufacture of Drinks.
                          — Brewing     extensively carried on in
                                                            is
Uganda, as the Waganda   have an inveterate objection to drinking
water, and many of them boast that from early childhood water has
never passed their lips.                  Almost       everyone       knows how to manu
 facture some kind of drink, and men and women, boys and girls,
 alike engage in this occupation.                     Two kinds of wine and two kinds
 of beer are    manufactured — Mubisi, fresh plantain wine, which
                                     :                                                       is   a
 perfectly teetotal          drink   ;   mwengi, an intoxicating                plantain wine     ;

inlaniba,   a  non-intoxicating      beer made of banana juice                with     a small
quantity     of boiled millet seed        ;   and malwa, which has                 a   greater
quantity of millet seed added, and is very inebriating.
   The Arabs        have introduced          the     manufacture        of spirits          from
mwengi, and distil         a  liquor from it which contains             a   very   high per
centage of alcohol.
   The mubisi        is made      as follows     : —A     large   hole is dug           in    the
ground   ;  it  is lined with banana leaves, filled              with     green     bananas,
and covered       over until the fruit is quite ripe.                 The [bananas are
then peeled and mashed             with fine dried grass in a large wooden
trough, boat-shaped,         with   a funnel       end.     A little    water is added,
the whole is mixed up either by the hand or                        with short wooden
sticks; the trough is then covered with                      banana      leaves,    and the
mixture     allowed to stand for an hour or two.                      It    is then       taken
out, and the liquor strained through sieves made of grass                         into large
bottle gourds, being then ready for use, and forming                         a  sweet, non-
intoxicating pleasant drink.
   To make mwengi the above decoction is set aside for three days,
when it ferments and becomes             a   slightly acid and refreshing drink,
but it is very inebriating.          Malwa and mlamba are made by simply
adding a definite quantity            of boiled         millet   seed     to   the mubisi,
setting it aside in large        earthenware jars, and stirring it from time
to time for two or three days.                No     substances      are added to any
of these drinks to change their flavour.
   These drinks        are never stored; they are made                 as required,          and
consumed by the evening of the fourth day.                          If   the mwengi be
bottled and kept in a cool place for                  a  couple of months,          it   tastes
very much like champagne.
   Meals. — TheWaganda usually partake of three meals                       a  day — break
fast  at about 7 a.m., dinner          at noon, and supper soon after sunset
Each household provides its own food, and eats separately.                               There
is a slight difference       among different classes          in the arrangement               of
meals.     As   a rule  in the upper       classes the master          and a few of his
wives eat together,       the head slaves eating in            a separate       group     ;  the
remaining wives, children, and slaves                  eat  in their own huts. In
smaller establishments the men             and women eat in separate groups ;
while   among      the lowest class         of peasants,        where      of course         the
numbers are not         so great,    men, women,         and children eat together.

                       of Edinburgh, Session 1885-86.                            719
Among all classes the meals are served             in identically the same way.
Before eating the hands are washed,                 either with water or with
circular napkins cut out of the succulent stem of the banana, which
contain so much sap           that no water is required.           The meals       are
served either     in the hut    or  in the courtyard    ; this depends upon the
 weather.     Part of     the floor or ground        is covered with a layer of
banana leaves, on which the food is placed in wooden bowls or
wickerwork       baskets.     It  is the custom at the palace           and in the
large establishments of the head chiefs for all the food for the mid
day meal to be carried before the king or chief, previous to its being
placed before their retainers.           The food is covered on its way from
the kitchen to the table by either banana leaves or neatly plaited
grass mats or wickerwork           covera     Mtesa, the late king of Uganda,
used to insist on examining various dishes as they passed him, and
if they did not satisfy him the cooks were severely punished.                    The
"Waganda     all  eat with their fingers; they never drink during            a meal.
After the meal is over they wash their hands, then drink.                      Coffee
berries are then handed round and are chewed, but never made into
a beverage.       They   are gathered before they are ripe, boiled, and then
dried in the sun.          When chewed they           have    a pleasant aromatic
taste    and tinge the saliva green.           After   a few berries have been
eaten, pipes are produced, and large quantities               of banana wine are
consumed.        There is no sequence         in  the order of dishes;        all the
food is placed at one time on the ground, and after the head of the
household has commenced to eat all fall to.                 The meat is cut by
one of the slaves, either      with     a knife or  a tiger-grass   splinter.    The
only person who dines alone is the king.
   The following account of a dinner, at which                I  was present,    will
afford a glimpse of the mode of procedure              at a chief's house    : — One
day   I was   visiting the katikiro (prime minister), and he asked me
to remain to dinner.           Several boys entered          the hut to lay the
cloth  ;  this consisted in covering two portions of the floor with
fresh banana leaves;          around these improvised           tables the guests
seated themselves on mats placed on the floor
                                                        — the katikiro, about ten
other chiefs, and myself at the one, some twenty of our host's wives
at the other.      I may mention        that as each woman entered the hut
she threw off      all her clothes    ;  the first one rather hesitated when
observing me, but after a laughing remark from her husband she

720                        Proceedings       of    the     Royal Society
made herself at home.                 As                    trays,
                                           soon as we were seated, large basket
piled up with steaming bananas and steamed and roast meats, were
brought in and placed upon the table, and each guest was provided
with a banana napkin with which to wash his hands before eating.
Then, at        a   sign from the katikiro every one began to eat,                                 helping
themselves with their fingers.                     When        the     host wished to             honour a
guest he handed him a                 tit-bit of   meat or a pinch of salt, salt                        being
very rare in Uganda.                  He    also called once or twice to one                            of his
wives, who came across from her table, and kneeling                                        beside
                                                                                            down
him he placed a pinch of salt in her mouth.                                During the meal, three
or four musicians played pleasing melodies at the door                                        of the     hut.
As     soon as dinner was over, napkins were again handed round                                          and
hands were washed;                the fragments with the cloths were                             removed,
and banana wine was handed round.                             We then all removed into a
private yard, where              native beds       were       placed        in   a    semicircle     under
the trees.          The katikiro lay down on the centre                              one,    reclining on
one of his wives, while                  the wife of the day                     (,-re    later) reposed
beside        him   ;    the   rest of the party, that               is,   the chiefs and          myself,
reclined on other beds, whilst the women grouped themselves behind
us.     Pipes were then lit, and beer again handed round by slave
boys to all save the host himself, who had an immense                                       bowl of beer
placed on       a   stool near him, from which his wife kept him constantly
supplied.           For about half         an hour       general conversation took place,
then    a     minstrel, ornamented with                a   fantastic head-dress,              and having
a    long goat's beard attached to his chin, appeared with                                  a   harp.     He
played and sang for some time                      ;   the    melody was sweet, and the
time which he kept with his goat's beard was good.                                       We     were then
entertained             by wrestling       matches,        followed         by    a      kicking match
between        some boys, and lastly by dancing, both solo and                                  in groups;
in     this    the women          took part.           Some        of the dances                were very
graceful and good, but of others the less said the better, as they were
indecent in the extreme.                   By this time       it   was dark and torches were
lit, which       made the dancing appear               all the     more grotesque,              but as the
party was getting too lively               I   said good-bye,              and was escorted home
by four torchbearers,            it   being always the custom in Uganda for guests
to be lighted and escorted home.
      There are no ceremonies              used at the commencement                         of meals.
      Cannibalism         is   unknown       in Uganda, but an idea prevails that

tnere       are people who roam about the forest at night, and                    kill and   eat
wanderers            who are not provided with a light.                 They are supposed
to     possess     the power of making themselves                 invisible at will and of
being invulnerable. This propensity is considered hereditary, and is
often attributed to people as witchcraft might be. They are avoided
 by     their neighbours, who will not employ them in any way, and no
 one will marry a woman who comes of such a stock.
       Narcotics. — Both men and women in Uganda are inveterate
 smokers, and           commence       the practice at an early             age  (10 or 12).
 The       king (Mtesa)      was the only person          I  knew who never smoked,
  and      who objected to the smell of tobacco.                    Before going into his
  presence it         was the custom        to   chew coffee berries to take away
  tlie     smell of the smoke.           Tobacco is the only substance                smoked     ;
  it    is never used as snuff, nor do they chew it; it is of                           a very
  pure quality, and never mixed with other substances.                                    It   is
   indigenous, and varies very much in strength,                         some     being com
   paratively mild, but most of it very strong.                     A   good    deal    of care
    is exercised in        the    cultivation     of    tobacco ;     the   plants     are   not
    allowed      to seed, the flower buds being picked off before they open
    (see    Agriculture).        The leaves are dried in the sun, made                      into
    neat packets of          10 to 20 lbs.       weight, tied up in banana leaves,
    and suspended in        the huts   till required for     use.    Neat tobacco pouches
     are in use     ; some    are made      of skin, others        of plaited grass, others
     again in the shape of grass boxes.               The patterns made are — bands,
     chevrons, chequer,        concentric rings, spiral, and guilloche.                  Cigars
     are unknown,       pipes, the bowls of which are made of clay, and vary
     in   size,   being used.        The bowls        are   very thin, and beautifully
     finished and smooth, but           as   no   flux or glaze is applied they are
     very brittle.      Two shapes of pipes are used — one with                a  round bowl
     and very small, the other conical, and holding                       half an ounce or
     more.       The stems      are  composed       of wood, and are          4  or  5 feet   in
     length, and no mouthpieces are employed.                  Water-pipes are not used,
     and    the pipes are       rarely passed from one individual to another,
      With the exception of            coffee   and sugar-cane,          no substances       are
     chewed.       The old women when at work                   in the field        sometimes
     smoke      a pipe with      a  short stem, which they hold between                    their
      teeth;    otherwise     they    smoke     the ordinary         long-stemmed        pipes.
      Tobacco     smoking does not appear            to  injuriously     affect the people.

    Occupations.     — Although the Waganda cannot                 be said to  lead  hard
working lives, all find more or less continuous employment, save those
of the higher ranks.          House building and fighting may be said to                 be
the chief occupation of the men, and the cultivation of the ground,
with household duties, that of the women                   ;   but, as the sequel will
show, a good        number of the people           of both sexes are engaged in
various arts and manufactures.               One thing only they         will never    do,
and that is to tend or breed cattle             (see later).
    The following        is a sketch of the Wagandas' daily life when                    at
home    : —
    A little  before sunrise they get up, and wrap themselves                    in  their
mbugus and build up large fires for warmth.                         Pipes are then fit,
and men and women smoke until breakfast is ready,                       it having    been
prepared    by one or two members               of the household.          By the    time
breakfast is finished the sun is well up, and they then go about
their several       occupations until dinner            time.      After dinner      thev
smoke again, and         it is only the poorer      classes and slaves who do any
work in the afternoon.             No work is      done     by anyone after supper,
when the whole of the inhabitants                   sit round the fires, smoking
and drinking beer,           till  8 or 9 o'clock, when           they retire for the
night.
   Morals.   — Judged by the standard of surrounding                        tribes,   the
"Waganda cannot be said to have very high morals.                       There seems     to
be an underlying         current of feeling that a man's present life will
affect his future state,        but practically they do not seem to be in
fluenced by this feeling.            A  standard of right and wrong no doubt
exists,   and in many things              strong public opinion          condemns     the
guilty and rewards         the    virtuous.     Popular      legends   to some extent
keep    alive     this    idea  ;    deeds   of   bravery       or of   cowardice     are
celebrated     in   tale and song, and children             are early influenced by
the recitation of such traditions,              which     doubtless help to        shape
their lives.
   The Waganda are liars, and consider               it a virtue to be proficient in
the art.     It  is thought wrong to steal, but               it seems to be a mnch
worse offence to be found             out    On the other hand, the people            an?
kindly and        courteous,      given    to hospitality,       and not     avaricious.

                           of Edinburgh, Session 1885-86.                                  72.3
They       are to a certain extent indolent, but then the necessities                        of
life    are easily obtained.           They are cleanly, hut drunken, and many
are gluttonous ; drinking              is not condemned       — gluttony     is.    They arc
very indecent.
      Human life        is  little   respected, the people       being valiant and not
afraid to        die.    Unless strongly moved by passion, they cannot be
said     to be cruel, and although passionate                 they are not revengeful,
that     is amongst themselves           ; against their enemies they cherish very
strong feelings of hatred, and                woe betide the district            into which
 they make a raid.
      Children     are well looked after, and the aged men                   are respected
and kindly         treated.      "With the women         it is otherwise,    as on account
 of   polygamy, they hold a low place in the social scale.                            Before
 marriage       they are fairly chaste,            afterwards, notwithstanding             the
 severe laws on the subject, they are very lax.
      Crimes. — It is rather difficult           to give definitely the state of the
 criminal      code, for this reason,          that although       the Waganda           have
 definite laws with         regard to the punishment of crime, yet they                think
 very lightly of it should they             escape detection.         Crimes against the
 person may he summed up as follows                       : — Homicide      is considered
 criminal,     except     in  cases where there has been great provocation, or
 in   some rare cases where a son                 kills his old father, in order to
 inherit his honours.            Suicide is very rarely practised,          and is greatly
 condemned.           Maiming, abduction, and assault may not                 as a   rule be
  revenged by the party injured,                 but the ordinary         legal procedure
  must be set in motion.              With   regard     to adultery, persons taken in
 the act,    if the adultery       is committed        with women belonging           to the
  king or     great     chiefs, may be summarily executed                ;  otherwise the
  case must be tried by a judge.                   Unnatural      offences, which        have
  been    introduced       by the Arabs, are intensely abhorred                  ; they are
  happily     of rare occurrence         ; the stake is the punishment.               Arson
  and theft are the principal crimes against property.                      Arson is con
  sidered    to he an        offence     against    the community,         whereas      theft
  is only an     injury against        an individual.        Crimes against the State
  are very rare ; when they occur              it is usually on       the instigation       of
  one of the sons of the reigning monarch.
     Until quite recently,            offences    against religion       have been un
  known,      but,    since     the   Arabs    and     European      missionaries have

724                  Proceedings       of  the   Royal Socuty
entered the country,          this has changed.             Those who undergo               the
rite of circumcision are put to death at the stake, and many con
verts to Christianity have suffered             the same fate.            (This last     since
Mtesa's death.)
    There is no distinct criminal class.
    Agriculture.   — There being two periods of maximum                          rainfall      in
the year, there      are two harvests.           The      cultivation      of the      ground
is    almost    entirely    carried    on   by women.            The     gardens of tie
Waganda are,       as a   rule, wonderfully        well kept, the various plants
being cultivated         on separate       beds,    which       are    carefully      weeded
and divided from each other by broad straight walks.                            The     hoe is
universally used both for turning up the earth and for removing
weeds.      In making fresh          beds   for any plant the soil is generally
turned up to a depth of about            9 inches.        I  have already enumerated
the articles grown in these gardens, with the exception                         of   tobacco
and the bottle gourd            (see   Food).      The tobacco is usually sown
 pretty thickly in small beds, but when the plants are a few inches
high they are carefully           transplanted and placed              in straight      rows.
 The bottle gourds are also widely cultivated, the plants being trained
 over trelliswork      frames     or over the huts, the object of this being
 to allow the fruit to grow suspended in the air, that it may preserve
 its shape.     These gardens are separated              from one another and from
 the road by high fences of tiger grass or by hedges                         of euphorbia
 and other bushes.           The bananas        are     banished from the gardens
 because their thick foliage would interfere with the growth of other
 plants.    They are grown in plantations             ;   but here, too, great        care is
taken to keep the ground clear by gathering up the fallen                             leaves,
 which, together with the weeds             from the gardens            and the produce
 of  the kitchen middens, are heaped up round the banana stems, this
 being the only attempt made by the Waganda to manure the ground.
 The only tradition connected with               the    introduction        of plants into
 Uganda     is the legend which          refers   to the banana         (see  Mythology).
 Each    household      cultivates its      own     land as       a   rule, but     persons
  who possess more         produce than they require sell                it to others.      It
 can hardly be said that there are crops,                  as so  little grain    is grown.
 The banana      is of great importance, as        it forms      the staple food for      the
 people  ;   its leaves     are   used    for cooking         purposes,      as paper      for
 packing up parcels, as dinner napkins, plates, and cups.                        The    pulp

                         of Edinburgh, Session 1885-86.                           725
of the tree        is employed for washing the hands instead of soap, and
string      is also made from the fibres of the plant.
      Cattle. —The Waganda do not tend cattle;                   they have a great
objection        to having anything to do with them, and the herds aro
kept exclusively         by Wahuma or Wanyambo herdsmen.                    The king
and those chiefs         who possess cows always have herdsmen in their
employ.          The prevailing colour of the cows is brown or iron grey              ;
 they     are large     bony animals.     Charms are hung round the cows'
 necks to        make   them prolific, and sometimes          also bells to prevent
 them straying.          They are bad milkers, giving only from half a pint
 to   a pint and a half at a time, and they give no             milk   unless the calf
  is  suckling    ;   should it die, milk fails.     Women are never allowed
  to milk      the cattle.    When their horns begin to form they            are often
  destroyed by the application of          a  red-hot iron   ;  this is only done to
  a special     breed which have very long horns.           There are other breeds
  •with no horns or       with very short    ones.    Castration is not practised.
  The number of        cattle in Uganda is remarkably small, when contrasted
   with the vast herds which constitute          the   bulk of     the possessions of
   surrounding tribes.         Besides being the herdsmen,          the Wahuma are
   the chief owners        of cattle, and they live mostly upon a meat and
   milk diet.
      A   great   many goats are found in Uganda;              they fatten quickly,
   are very prolific, but are mischievous and damage the gardens.                They
   are generally herded by children, and           in  large establishments huts
   are erected into which they are driven at night.              The poorer people,
   who only possess a small number of goats, permit them to sleep iu
   their own huts.
       The sheep belong to the Somali breed          ;  they are few in number,
   and   by no means well favoured.
      Fowls     are to be found    in most Uganda villages, but they are very
   lean and are never fed.         A  few wretched cats may be seen here and
    there ;   they are domesticated,      but are of no use as rat or mouse
    catchers.
      Twenty years ago nearly every Mganda had a dog, and this
   custom still obtains in districts away from the capital.                     There,
   however, owing to the influence of the Arabs, who believe that dogs
   are unclean,     the practice has to a certain extent died out             Some of
   the dogs resemble        a smooth    English terrier, and are generally tan

  owner holds in his hand or hangs round the wrist                      with a running
 knot.     In  hunting antelopes,        however, the dogs are          set free.        They
 are attached to their masters and are well treated.                   Hydrophobia             is
 unknown.
    Manufactures.
                      — The Waganda              are  very     ingenious      and      clever
 workmen.        All the articles they construct                are  made      with      great
 taste,  neatness,    and exactitude.           They    also   very readily copy,              or
 adapt to uses of their own articles of foreign manufacture introduced
 into the country.         I  shall    now describe        their different       trades       in
 order, and commence         with
    Pottery.  — Pottery is     a   distinct trade, and a good number                of    men
 and women are engaged            in it.     Boys and girls are at an early                age
 initiated into the art.         Two kinds of pottery,             a coarse    and   a fine
 variety, are manufactured.           Vessels for carrying water and             for   cook
 ing are made of the coarse kind           ;  they are of all shapes and sizes, and
 are well proportioned        and elegant in outline.              The water jugs          are
 round in form, made           to contain one or two gallons, and have a
 narrow long-lipped neck, while those used for cooking purposes                            are
 hemispherical, having no necks but             a  neatly curved lip.        Already      the
 Waganda       are beginning        to imitate European            pottery, and plates,
 basins, and mugs may at times be seen.                 Drinking cups and          tobacco
 pipes are made of the finer clay.                They are very thin aud beauti
 fully worked, but all the pottery is easily broken,                as no flux or glaze
 is used.     The fine clay contains         a good deal     of mica    ; it  is procured
 from the beds of streams, and is probably formed from the detritus                        of
 igneous    rocks.     No potter's wheel         is used.      The clay is first      freed
from stones, is mixed with water, and beaten with wooden clubs                            on
 a wooden block into a proper consistency.                   A    lump of this      dough
 is then taken and formed              into    shape    by the hands;           a wooden
 spatula is held in the right hand, the left being used to rotate                        the
 clay.    No moulds       are used      in   the manufacture of pottery.                The
 pots are ornamented both by scoring with                       a  sharp-pointed      stick
 and impressing        with     a    wickerwork       pattern.       The     most    usual
 patterns employed are circular dots, elliptical                punch marks,        bands,
parallel    incised    lines,   chequer concentric           rings, guilloche,       spiral
pattern, and basketwork.              The pottery is burnt after being               dried
in the sun in       large permanent holes            dug in the ground.             When

first burnt it        is grey,     but   after being hung over           a smoky        fire
and polished it acquires a permanent black colour. The pots arc
first polished with a pad of mbugu, and finally by the palm of the
hand. Drinking bowls and both kinds of pipes are sometimes
 coloured with red oxide of iron or with white                clay.
      Baskehcork. — The wickerwork              made    by the Waganda is very
 good indeed;          the   materials     they use are     grass    and the young
 leaves of the       wild  date palm.      Baskets of all forms and sizes, trays,
 covered boxes, fish traps, shields, drinking tubes, and various kinds
  of mats      are made.     Some of the work is extremely fine and elegant,
  and the patterns are very graceful.              Both stiff and flexible basket-
  work is made, and coloured grass is often employed.                      Blue, black,
  and red dyes         are also     used for dyeing      the grass.        Wickerwork
  coverings       are constructed to       protect jars    and pots.          The   large,
  shallow, circular baskets          used as dishes are made          as   follows   :—A
  continuous ring of fine grass, bound closely round with plantain
  fibre, is coiled on itself in a wide spiral, the individual rings being
   sewn      strongly together     with the     same fibre,    and so carefully and
   tightly    are these baskets      made that they are perfectly water tight.
   (Fish Traps and Shields, see Fishing and War.) Mats for all kinds of
   purposes are made of grass or of strips of the young loaflets of the
   wild date palm.         These leaflets are dried and bleached            in the sun,
   and      then cut carefully       into   strips and plaited into large mats,
   which are very pliable,            and will     roll up without          cracking       or
   splitting.     The large     sized   mats    are   used  to carpet        the floors      ;
    smaller sizes to cover the native beds, and others              again are carried
    by slaves for their masters to rest on when away from home.                        The
    tubes which are used for        drinking    purposes are made        as   follows    :—
    A hollow curved stick is taken and                 covered    with     close   fitting
   basketwork      of date palm leaves       dyed various colours, while at the
    bottom is a strainer terminated by a
                                                   " crown  "
                                                               knot.      Small square
    covers    are also constructed for jars and         drinking     cups.      Different
     styles   of plaiting    and patterns are employed for almost every
    purpose for which basketwork is used.
        Metal   Work. — The work         of the    smiths is far superior to any
    seen among     the neighbouring tribes.         The iron found in Uganda               is
    of excellent     quality, and is very         abundant;      it is obtained by
    smelting from      the   ore.    The smelting ovens are conical in form,

728                    Proceedings      of  the   Royal Society
about     3 J  feet high, layers of charcoal and iron ore being                alternately
placed in       them.    Six,  eight, or ten pairs of bellows are           employed for
the blast      ;  they are worked by men and boys in time to a chant.
The tools used by the blacksmiths                are of a very         primitive nature.
Oblong stones of various sizes are used               as  hammers,        large   flat   ones
as  anvils, and the tongs are usually merely pieces                       of green wood
with    a  cleft in them.       A   few iron hammers,          files,    and tongs have
been imported from Zanzibar, and the Waganda                         smiths soon learn
to imitate        European work.         For    instance,    they convert         flintlock
guns      into percussion      guns,    and   they make brass            cartridge     cases,
which, though only cast, are wonderfully                   true and smooth.              The
bellows which supply the blast for the clear                 charcoal fires used by
the smiths consist        of two   earthen    pots firmly bedded          in the ground        ;
over the mouths of these a pliable                 skin is fastened,        while to      thc-
ccntre of this hollow sticks are tied.              A  boy holds one stick          in each
hand and works them up and down rapidly and alternately, closing
 the end of the hollow stick          with his thumb        as    he presses     it down,
 thus creating a constant blast.             There is a hole near the bottom of
 each pot, on the side facing the fire, and through this the blast passes
 through      a  clay tube which conducts it to the hearth.
    The spears, knives, and           arrow-heads      are wonderfully         well made,
 and they also construct chains, bells,              and rings for fingers, arms,
 and legs.        The nkumbi       or hoe is heart-shaped,           with   a  long flange
 from the broad         end, which      is firmly tied to a hook-shaped wooden
 handle       about   3   feet  long.     The     knives    are     always curved, the
 blade being about         9 inches long and very thin             ;   they take     a keen
 edge.       They are sometimes painted with red oxide of iron procured
 from an ore resembling haematite.
    Two kinds of axes are made, the one a rude shaped piece of iron,
 which is inserted into        a  heavy wooden handle and used for felling
 trees,     splitting   up firewood, &c.           The    other axe is much more
 elegant;      a broad   thin blade, almost crescentic          in    shape,   is fastened
 like a knife in the end of a long well-balanced handle of wood.
 The flat part of the blades             of knives and axes is covered               with   a
 thin film of black oxide of iron, except along the cutting                            edge;
 this prevents rust.
    Mtesa sent        a  few of his smiths to the English mission to                       be
 taught blacksmithing, and            it  was surprising       to    see   what progress

they made, and how proficient they soon became in the use of
English tools. They seemed almost instinctively to understand
¦what the implements were                     made       for, and expressed          surprise that
they had not            made such themselves.
  Manufacture of Bark Cloths. — A species of fig (Ficus India), which
grows abundantly throughout Uganda, is the tree from which mbugu
or bark cloth is procured. The bark is taken from young trees;
two incisions           are made round the trunk, a third, which is vertical,
joining the other               two.        The    bark is then stripped off and the
 outer surface           carefully removed,          and it is then laid on a smooth
 square block of wood and rapidly beaten in time to                                  a   low chant
 with heavy            wooden    mallets.         These     mallets have circular grooved
 heads, which give to the bark a ribbed appearance                                  like corduroy,
 and     under their            blows       it quickly thins          out    like     gold    under
 the goldbeater's          hammer.            When the bark          has been beaten         out to
 the requisite thinness it is hung up to dry, and afterwards any holes
 which may have been produced in the beating are neatly patched
 with        the   trimmings        from the edges.                The thread used        for this
 purpose is made from the bark, or from the fibres                              of the plantain,
 and     a   long thorn is used for a needle                   ;   the sewing is remarkably
 neat.        The mbugu when new is of a yellow-brown                             tint, resembling
 freshly tanned leather; some of the finer sorts, however, are of                                  a
 dull brick-red           colour.          They vary much in quality, some of the
 better kinds           being beautifully soft, and these are procured chiefly
 from the Sesse group of islands.                        The principal fault of this cloth
 is that      it   soon decays      if it   gets wet.       Sometimes       the mbugu is dyed,
 generally         black, or various patterns                 in black,     red,    and blue are
 printed on it.            The tree from which the bark is removed                            is not
 killed by the operation               ;   the wound is covered           with     banana leaves,
 which are bound closely round                     it,   and in process of time new bark
 grows.            A   considerable number of people                    are employed         in this
 manufacture;            the women strip the bark from the trees and do any
 repairing to the cloth that                is   necessary,    but men beat out the bark
 and make the cloth.
    Wood           Work. — A large           number of joiners            are      employed, and
 although they work slowly, whatever they make                               is    well done and
 neatly carried out.              Milk bowls,            pear-shaped,     containing      about   a
 quart, are cut out of            a    solid block of wood; they are often highly

730                 Proceedings      of   the   Royal Society
ornamented.       Drums,      drumsticks,       axe    handles, and paddles              are
made   in large numbers        ;  and walking        sticks, made      out   of a     hard
white wood, are beautifully         rounded and polished.             Small axes        and
knives are used by the carpenters.              Fire is not employed, save               for
the purpose of hollowing           out pipe-stems.            Small   carved      wooden
animals are also made; the carving is neatly done, but the forms ars
not very accurate.
   Leather     Work. — The       Waganda         are    very     good    tanners,       and
manage    to   get their    skins   as    soft as the best kid leather; they
pride themselves very much on this art, and laugh at the unsuc
cessful attempts of others to compete                 with      them.      Lion skins,
ox hides, buffalo hides, and the skins of leopards and all the
varieties of antelopes are used for leather.              In some cases the hair
is removed,    but generally it is left on.          They first dry the skins in
the sun, then stretch them out on              a frame,    and the inner surface is
carefully scraped      with   a sharp knife.          They are then rubbed for             a
long time with flat heavy stones until quite smooth ; this produces                        a
fine grain.     Butter or oil is then applied in considerable quantities,
and the skin once more placed               in  the sun     ;  this latter process is
repeated   several    times.     Both     men     and women         are employed         in
tanning.     Some skins from which              the hair has been removed are
dyed ; others have       patterns printed on them,             and the thick buffalo
hide from which sandals are made is ornamented by either a knife
or   a red-hot naiL       Leather     ropes     are   sometimes       used    in house
building,   if so it is before they are tanned, but the leather                 used for
straps, traps, or nets is first tanned.
   Dyeing. — Five colours are used by the "Waganda                     — black,    green,
orange-yellow, red, and blue.            The black dye is the soot of a sweet-
scented   wood mixed with oil          ;   the yellow dye is obtained from                a
tree called the mulilila, resembling our lauristinus ;               it is  a gum, and
exudes from the bark       in small    drops.      Unfortunately       I  do not know
how the green, blue, and red dyes are prepared.                    The dyes are      used
in two ways     ; either the article to be dyed is immersed in                 the fluid,
or else wooden stamps         are used on which           the dye is smeared        ; the
most common pattern for these dyes is lozenge-shaped.                     Earthenware
jars, pipes,   &c,  are coloured by sticks, the ends of which have                   been
chewed until they very much resemble a paint brush.
   lieadwork.   —A     good     number       of women         are  employed in         the

                        of Edinburgh, Session 1885—86.                             731
manufacture of bead ornaments ;                  necklaces,     bracelets,    anklets,
stomachers, and rings for the waists             are made.       Red, blue, white,
black, and green beads are all in vogue. The patterns show a
great amount of good taste, and none of the gaudy contrasts so
usual amongst African tribes are to be seen. The hair from the
giraffe's      tail is used    for stringing   the beads.        The beadwork         is
often      arranged over pads made of grass tightly covered with banana
 fibre.      Some of the little grass caps before referred to are orna
 mented with beadwork patterns, the              beads   being sewn on to them
 with     hairs, and thorns being employed as needles.
      String. — String and rope of various        sizes and of various materials
  are manufactured.         They are both spun and plaited.          String    is made
  from    banana fibre, the fibre of a species of aloe, the sinews of animals,
  their    intestines, and more rarely from wooL             The long fibres are
  usually twisted on      the thigh with the hand, which is generally wetted.
  In   plaiting,   3, 6, and 9-ply are employed.         The ropes are generally
  plaited, and they      are made either of string or of hide.           Weaving is
   unknown in Uganda.
      Boat-Building      and    Navigation.  — Tho Waganda           aro   extremely
   good boat-builders, and various       sizes of boats are made, from small
   fishing    canoes capable of holding two or three men up to the large
   war   canoes    containing    sixty  men.    The canoes are         made     in  the
   following manner :— The straight trunk of             a  tree of the      required
   length    is taken, and the bottom of the         vessel  is constructed from
   it by cutting    away the    superfluous wood with an axe.             It  is care
   fully hollowed out down the middle,          tapered   off at both ends, and
   at the bow a horn is formed, which projects some              3  or  4 feet above
   the cutwater when the canoe is finished.            Along both      edges of this
   bottom log small holes       are bored   with   a  red-hot iron at     a  distance
   of  2 or  3  inches apart      Two long planks, hewn with          an axe out of
   the solid trunk of a tree, are then taken, and            a   number of holes
   having been bored, to correspond with those               in   the   bottom log,
   they are tied together with         the  root of fibres      of various plants,
   curved boards being added at either end where the canoe narrows.
   These boards     are curved by being placed with           the ends resting on
   two logs of wood, heavy weights being placed between them.                      The
   planks are sloped outwards at an angle of about 60 degrees, giving
   additional breadth to the canoe.

732                  Proceedings       of the  Eoyal Society
    The sides of the boat are then completed by other planks                       tied
at right   angles    to the    last mentioned, therefore vertically.            Large
holes are made along the lower edge of the second                   row of planks to
receive   the thwarts, which are securely tied in position by root-
fibres or sometimes      by thongs.
    The outside of the vessel is then painted              a light red, with oxide
of iron, obtained by burning an ore resembling haematite, and                     then
the seams are corked with plantain fibre, which has been steeped                       in
water.       The boat      is finished     by adding the nsanda or curved
prow, the top of which is ornamented with a pair of antelope's
horns, and from this to the bow a fringe of grass                      or feathers      is
fastened    to give an       additional    ornament.         The paddles are      well
made of a hard wood, and both               hands are used in paddling.            The
canoes are steered by the two paddlers               in the    stern, and propelled
with    great  rapidity.      The Waganda are, however, afraid of going
out on the lake          more     than    a   mile    or so, on      account of     the
sudden storms which arise very quickly.                    When compelled to go
from the mainland to an island they invariably paddle along the
coast to the nearest point, and then, having rested, make all speed
across    the   intervening         channel     (for    further    information,      tee
Fleet).
    Fishing.  — The Waganda who live             on the borders      of the lake and
 the Sesse islanders      are mostly accomplished fishermen.                They   n< it
 only catch the fish for their own consumption, but after it is dried
 and sometimes      smoked they use it       as an    article of barter with friends
 living inland.       Various     methods are employed to catch the fish.
 First in importance is —
     The Rod and Line. — A light             reed or cane, about 10 feet long,
 forms the rod     ; the  lines are very fine and strong, and manufactured
 from the fibre of a species of aloe.          The hooks are made of native
 iron, are usually      small, and are not barbed.              Freshwater    shrimps
 and earthworms form the bait.              Night lines     are also employed,     and
 are set from canoes at       f  of  a mile or a mile from the shore.           Some
 of them are    as  long   as 400 feet in length.         They    are sunk by means
 of heavy stones, floats of ambatch wood being used to indicate their
 position and aid in their recovery.               Hooks      of a larger size than
 those used in rod fishing are attached to lines made fast to the main
 rope at intervals     of about    10 feet.    The hooks are fastened to the

                             of Edinburgh, Session 1885—86.                                            733
line in two ways — either the shank of the hook is rough and the
line is whipped to     or else the head of the shank has
                                  it,                        rough                              a
 knob below, while     kind of clove hitch secures the line to the
                                  a
book.
      Spearing fish         is   not widely practised,         but sometimes            it    forms an
amusement for the boys,                       who use light spears               for the        purpose.
Two kinds of wickerwork                         traps are employed for catching fish.
One      is   like our lobster             traps, and used        in the     same manner            ;   the
other consists          of   a   large      conical wicker basket, about                4     feet high,
open at the large end, around which                          a    ring of twigs          is   fastened,
radiating inwards so as to allow the fish to enter, but preventing
their    escape.        Eight or          ten of these baskets, tied side                by side, are
taken out by canoes, and sunk by means                                of stones so placed that
 the baskets lie on their sides                     with their mouths facing                the shore     ;
 they are hauled in by long ropes which                               are made fast           to them.
 Women          rarely fish, but boys                  are   early instructed            in      the    art.
 Women are, however, employed in cleaning and curing fish.                                              The
 lake    is   abundantly stocked              with     them, but   I     had no opportunity of
 determining the species.
      Hunting.     — The Waganda                    are great hunters, and game                  is    very
 plentiful.           Elephants,          buffaloes,    zebras,   rhinoceros, wild boar,                 12
 species       of antelopes,            lions, leopards,     jackals, foxes,         hyenas,        hares,
 chimpanzees,           and several          species    of monkeys inhabit                the     forests.
 Snakes are numerous,                     many of them being very venomous,                             and
 there    is  a   harmless       species of bright green which                   gives its name to
 that colour           (a    noandagala).            Boa constrictors are also frequently
 found.         Hippopotami, crocodiles,                and otters abound          in    the lake and
 in   the     Nile, and      there are      a   great many water-rats             whose skins are
 highly prized.              The        principal    birds are parrots, guinea-fowl, owls,
 vultures, adjutants, goat-suckers,                    kites, eagles, ducks,            geese,      storks,
 cranes,       herons,       gulls,       scarlet    flamingos,       darters,    the     sacred        and
 glossy       ibis,    and brilliantly coloured honey                       birds.       Among          the
 insects    I     may mention mosquitos,                   locusts,     white and driver ants,
 bees,      and innumerable butterflies.
      There are hunters by profession in Uganda.                                   These men are
 very courageous and expert.                        They use spears of different sizes, and
 generally hunt in parties                      of three or four.            Thus        they attack
 elephants,       lions, &c, but notwithstanding their agility and bravery,

  734                Proceedings       of  the  Royal Society
 many fall victims        to    their   would-be       prey.    These    hunters also
 employ variously constructed traps.              For large game the most usual
 form is    the pit-fall.      The pits are       about 7 feet deep and taper
 towards the bottom, in which               spiked      stakes  are   often    inserted.
 They are very neatly covered over by reeds, over which                     are   spread
 banana leaves, and these again            are strewed       with  earth.     Buffaloes
 and large     antelopes     are    caught     by wreaths        composed        of the
 branches of the thorny bush, so contrived that the thorns                    all point
 inwards.     These wreaths are somewhat conical in shape,                     and are
 placed in holes scooped out of the ground.                 They are secured by a
 strong rope to a heavy log of wood or to the trunk of a tree. When
 the animal steps     on the wreath its foot goes through it, and                    the
 thorns prevent      its being      shaken off.        Other traps      are  made     by
 suspending heavily weighted spears above the paths                    by which      the
 animals    go  to   water   ;   they are arranged to fall as the               animal
passes underneath.        Heavy beams of wood are also arranged with,
a   very slight support, which,          when touched, allows the beam to
fall.   Baits are placed beneath these traps.
    A  great variety of    noose snares are employed.              Hippopotami are
hunted from boats with two-pronged harpoons.                       The    natives are
very expert in avoiding the wounded animals.
    The inhabitants      of several villages often join together for the
purpose of    driving   game into nets.        A   large enclosure     of strong rope
nets is made, each village supplying            its own proportion of men and
nets.     The animals are driven within the circle and then speared.
By this    means   hundreds of animals are sometimes                slaughtered in    a
day.     In hunting, the man who gives               the fatal wound is supposed
to appropriate the horns and to get the               largest proportion of meat,
but a great deal of discussion and quarrelling                   take place in the
hunting expeditions.         This   is more    especially the case when one of
the party happens to be of higher rank than the others,                          as  he
generally annexes the best of the booty, and permits his retainers to
fight for the remainder.          There are no laws for the preservation of
game   in Uganda, but certain skins           (I think      leopard) and a propor
tion of the ivory must be handed over to the king.
    Meat is preserved by drying          it in the sun or smoking it over the
fire.   The animals are skinned and cut up where they fall.
    I only know of three superstitions connected               with hunting.       The

                                of Edinburgh, Session 1885-86.                                           735
first      is,   that all good luck for the day would be at an end                            if   a   man
'turned back after                once starting out; the second, that the game should
always           be skinned before bringing              it   under cover       ;     and tho third,
that when returning from the hunt                        a   different path must always be
•followed from the one taken on the way out.                            If much       game has been
captured          a   great feast        is   often held at night, and fearful scenes of
gluttony          are sometimes           witnessed.     I    have seen men eat              until they
have fallen down in                 a   perfectly helpless condition, and have had to be
carried          home by their friends.              Whistles are used for giving signals
¦when        hunting.             The Waganda track game fairly well.                         Dogs are
used, especially in antelope                     hunting.      Bows and arrows are very
rarely       used       indeed, save by the Wahuma                  ;   nor are the Waganda
successful with fowling pieces, of which                             there      are   a   few in the
country.            The spears used in hunting are the same as those used in
war, with the exception of the elephant spears, which are very heavy
and large, and only used for thrusting with both hands.
    No poison               is    used    by the Waganda            in hunting.              The       only
animal they are chary of attacking                       is    the buffalo, which are very
 fierce.         Only       large    parties of men attack them, and even                              then
 many casualties take place.
     War. — The Waganda                       are very   warlike; in         fact,     one    may say
 that      they are constantly                 at war, making       continual          raids on the
 surrounding               countries for cattle and slaves.               All    the adult males
 are compelled to serve                   in the army when required, and                  a    military
 organisation, having its headquarters at the capital, ramifies through
 out the whole land.                     The number of men capable of bearing arms
 in Uganda            is   probably about 600,000, but certainly not more than
 half this number would                       be available at one time or place.                         The
 king must            be considered as the head of the war office, for he keeps
 in his          charge the war-board, which              gives     him   a   general idea as to
 the    number             of     troops available.          This   board       is     covered         with
 numerous holes, in which pegs are placed of three different colours
 and sizes, representing tens, hundreds, and thousands.                                 The pegs are
 white for ten men, black for                   a   hundred men, and red for              a   thousand
 men.            The rows are manipulated from right to left, that                                 is,   the
 black and red pegs are placed to the left of the board.                                      When        an
 expedition           is   sent     out the king takes as many pegs from the board
 as there are          soldiers required, and after the return of the army from

736                    Proceedings         of     the    Royal Society
war the number of killed are deducted by the chiefs, and they return
the pegs which represent              the living to the king.                      The council of
war consists of the king and a certain number of chiefs ;                                  in fact, it
is composed as is the national council (see Government).                                  The whole
country is divided into districts, and the head chief of the district
is the commander of the soldiers living in                             it,   and    is   responsible
to    the king and          council    for      providing       the requisite number                 of
men.      Under his command                  are        sub-chiefs, who         are      responsible
for the soldiers inhabiting               different villages.            War       is    declared by
the  king sitting in council, the big war drum being immediately
beaten.   As soon as its sound   heard all the chiefs who are present
                                             is
seize their walking         sticks, and brandishing them on high execute a
war dance before the king, swearing fealty to him, boasting of their
own prowess, and of the terrible fate to which they                            will deliver their
enemies.        The king then distributes the war pegs to the chiefs, who
immediately rush forth to collect their men.                             The soldiers residing
near the capital gather next morning                       outside the palace attired for
battle, dressed        only in loin cloths, and their faces whitened                             with
ashes to strike terror into the              hearts of the enemy.                   Some are also
smeared       with red and black paint                     The king stands               outside the
palace gate holding         a   shield and two copper spears, which may be
only carried by the king and the principal                           chiefs.       He    is   attended
 by   bis court        A   war dance         is   then executed,             the troops passing
before     the king,       brandishing          their     spears,     shouting          and vowing
vengeance       on their foes.        After this          parade the chiefs           in command
of the army are assembled and receive their orders.                                Messengers      are
then sent to the troops at            a   distance telling them where the trysting
place    is   to be.       Several flags and war drums are entrusted to the
keeping of the army, which then sets out on the march.
     The king     is    kept informed             of the progress             of the army          by
messengers, who wear            a   leopard skin cape           as   a   sign of their office.
I    had several opportunities of seeing the Waganda botli on the war
path and in actual fight, and was much surprised at the regularity
and precision      with which all their             movements          are carried        out      On
the     march they send out skirmishers                     ;   their front and flank              are
always well protected,          and they use all the natural facilities of the
land     both    for    cover and for             reconnoitring           their      foes.      When
camping at night the fires are made in hollows, and screened to pre

                            of Edinburgh, Session 1885-86.                              737
vent the         enemy seeing them, and sentries are placed round the camp.
Commands            are given both by word of mouth, drums, and whistles,
and        disobedience        to   orders    is  severely     punished.      Each     chief
commands his own                   men,   but a commander-in-chief,           aided by a
council, directs all the operations.                When     the army approaches         the
enemy they do not commence to fight at                       once, but perform a war
dance and curse their enemies in no very                    polite language,     for some
considerable           time.      They    then begin to throw          their spears,    but
soon,       warming to the fray, yelling              and shouting, they rush to            a
hand-to-hand            conflict to the beat of their noisy war drums.                  The
drum        takes very much the place of            a regimental flag; round it the
 detachments          assemble, and its loss in battle is considered             a fearful
 disgrace.         In going from Rubaga            to  Mruli,    I  passed   a  battlefield
 in    which     the Waganda         had been beaten, and grouped around the
 war      drum    I saw    the bodies of more than 300 "Waganda,               so fiercely
 had they defended their              standard.     They are extremely brave, and
 have no       fear of death.        Their fights    are often very sanguinary, and
  they frequently lose 30 to 40 per cent, of their men. The feats of
  noted warriors are celebrated in their war-songs and traditions, and
  warlike      achievements        are rewarded by an extra share            of the spoil
  or by a rise in rank.              After    a  battle in the open their wounded
   opponents are not butchered in cold blood, but are left to take care
   of themselves        as best   they may; but should        a  village be sacked, it is
   the usual custom          to put all the adult        males    to death.     The dead
   are not buried unless they hold high                rank.     A certain number of
   medicine-men accompany               the army in the field to give aid to             the
   wounded.         Should      a  chief be killed in battle his followers usually
   run away.         In returning from war nightly             carousals   take   place, at
   which      the female       prisoners are compelled         to   be present    and the
    utmost license prevails.           At   these festivities war songs are sung and
    tales are told of the heroic deeds of the honoured dead.
        In   every    village stores of dry bananas            are   maintained     by the
    head man for the use of the soldiers when they are called to war.
    At the    same time especial         contributions     are levied on the       villages
    through which the army passes on its march.                    When camping huts
    are  usually constructed for the whole army, and it is wonderful                       to
    see   the   rapidity with which these grass shelters               spring up.      Four
     men    will   erect    a  commodious hut in three-quarters              of an hour.

 Women do not accompany               the men to war, but the head              chiefs tab      |
 one or two wives and a few female slaves with them                           to    ¦within  t
safe distance.         When camping, the huts for              these    women and          for
the chiefs must be first erected.              Commanders who are unsuccessful
may be reduced in rank or fined.                In attacking an enemy's village,
they sometimes         use   red-hot arrow heads wrapped in mbugu cloth to
set fire to the dwellings.
    Weapons.     — The      spear   is the Waganda's weapon, and                 it is made
remarkably welL            The shaft is about       7 feet   long, smooth, and very
neatly finished.         It  is made    of very hard but comparatively light
wood    ;   the head is 15 inches long, the blade 10 inches and                     3i   to   4
inches      broad.     They are very sharp, and are protected by neatly
made      leathern cases ornamented at the tip by plumes.                        The    cases
are joined       together by a thong of leather, so that                     they can be
suspended       round the shoulders or arm when the spears are                       in  use.
The Waganda shields are made of wood, covered                        with wickerwork
of an       open    zig-zag    pattern.      They    are   large    enough       to    cover
the    whole     body when         in   a   stooping     position.      They are pro
vided with       a  wooden boss in the centre, which is conical                     in form
and hollowed out inside to reduce                 the weight and to permit the
soldier's hand free play.            Across the inside of this boss there is                 a
wicker handle, or sometimes a wooden one, carved in the shape of                             a
lizard or some other animal.                  The   Wahuma         possess      bows     and
arrows in addition to spears.             The bows are about          6   feet long, and
unusually       stiff.    The arrows, which are feathered, have                    notched
heads      and extremely barbed points; they are sometimes                        poisoned
by being dipped in the juice of a species of euphorbia.                            I doubt,
however, whether this is a very strong poison, but the wounds
caused      by the poisoned arrows have a great tendency to slough.
The Wahuma shoot well up to 40 yards.                       There are probably not
more      than 2000 guns in Uganda;                they are not much used,                on
account of the difficulty which the people have in procuring powder.
Some of the Waganda are              fairly  good shots     with the rifle, but         most
of them fire from the hip.
    Fleet.   — The Waganda            possess    a large      fleet   of war         canoes.
 Unfortunately,        I never had the pleasure of seeing              it  ;  therefore all

       Government.       — The     head of the government      of Uganda is nomin
ally       the king (Kabakka).            Succession to the throne is hereditary,
but;       the new king is selected from a minor, the three hereditary
chiefs         and the young king's mother carrying on the government
 until      he is of age.        (I believe this takes place when his first son is
born.)          This    arrangement      prevents the king becoming too power
 ful,      and also avoids intrigues during his lifetime.             Directly a king
 dies       all  strangers     who      may    happen to be in      the country are
 compelled to live in certain                 places under a strong guard.       They
  are     quite safe there, but should they leave the enclosure they would
  certainly       be killed.       A   meeting of the three hereditary chiefs is
  held      to elect the new        king; should they not       agree in their choice
  they      fight, and the victor places his nominee on the throne.              With
  the exception of two            or three' of the young king's brothers, the whole
   of    the late king's sons are burned; the             former are kept in strict
   confinement,        but their preservation is necessary in case of the king
   dying childless.*          The king's power is distinctly limited, that is to
   say, in vital matters he would never dare to go against                 the will of
   the hereditary        chiefs.     It is true that he is on the throne, and that
   everything        is referred      to him ; but he is placed and maintained
   there by his chiefs, who are wise enough to know that there must
   be a king or there would be everlasting fighting for the supremacy.
   The king is not permitted to               have much property of his own, but
    he can requisition women,            cattle, food, in fact almost anything, to
    any     extent, except land.            The reigning     family   in   Uganda   is
    descended      from the Wahuma           tribe.  Mtesa professed to trace back
    his descent to      Kintu (or Ham), the founder of the dynasty. The
    names of     the   kings are as follows, but      I have grave doubts as to the
    list being correct.           Kintu (or Ham), Chwa,          Kalemala,    Kimela,
    Rumaansi,        Tembo,        Kigala      Wampamba,       Raima,     Nacbibinge,
       *
          Europeans have exercised so much influence on the people that when
    Mtesa, the late king of Uganda, died, his son Mwanga was placed on the throne
     without any bloodshed.

Suna    II.,     Mtesa, Mwanga.
I      must now give         a   short sketch of Mtesa, the late king of Uganda.
When   I       knew him he was about 45 years of age, a splendid                                       man,
some    6   feet high, well-formed and strongly                     built         He had         an    oval
face, and his features           were     well cut.      He had           large   mild eyes, but
if   roused by anger or mirth they were                       lit up by       a    dangerous               fire.
He had lost         the pure        Mhuma features           through admixture of                     negro
blood, but still retained enough characteristics of that tribe                                   to pre
vent all doubt as to his origin.                       All   his movements were                        very
graceful     ;   his hands were slender, well-formed, and supple                            ;    he was
generally dressed          in   a   simple white Arab kuftan.                     It   is   somewhat
difficult    to describe         his character     ;   he was           intensely      proud,         very
egotistical,        and until       towards the end                of his     life     he     thought
himself to be the greatest                  king   on earth.            In   his youth, and                 in
fact until 1878, there              is   no doubt that he was very cruel,                        but an
illness from which he suffered                   certainly softened him.                    His chiefs
often said to       me — "Ah,        if   Mtesa were well, there would be plenty of
executions."          It   has been said that he was extremely changeable
and fickle, and to superficial observers                     he was so; that                is   to say,
as far as his intercourse                 with Europeans went                  If, however, one
looks   a    little deeper into his character one finds that his apparent
vacillation was overruled by                a    fixed idea, which was to benefit his
people,      increase his own importance, and to get as much as possible
out of the strangers who visited his court.                          This explains his being
one day      a   friend to the Arabs, on another to the Protestants, and on
a    third     to   the Catholics.          A    new comer,          especially        if   he    had        a
large caravan,         was      always the favourite               of the hour.          It      is    easy
enough for anyone to get into Uganda, but to get away again                                           is    no
easy task unless one              is   going for   a   fresh supply of goods.                     Mtesa
liked Europeans and Arabs                   to be present at his court;                 it   gave him
 prestige,       and he also wished his people                 to learn as much as they
could from the white man, for he well knew and appreciated their
 superior knowledge.                In manner      he was courteous           and gentlemanly,
 and he could order anyone off to execution with                                  a    smile on his
countenance.           His mental capacity             was of       a   very high order.                   He

                          of Edinburgh, Session 1885—86.                               741
was shrewd and intelligent                ; he   could read and write Arabic, and
could       speak several native languages.               He  had a splendid memory,
and enjoyed          a good    argument very keenly.             If  he could only get
Protestants,         Catholics, and Arabs to join in a discussion before him
he was in his element;              and     though apparently siding with one or
 other, who might happen to be at the time in his especial favour, he
 took good care to maintain his own giound, and I do not believe
 that he ever really gave up the least bit of his belief in his old
 Pagan ideas. While too shrewd and intelligent to believe in the
 grosser superstitions which find credit                among his people, he was yet
  so superstitious       that   if he dreamt of any of the gods of his country
  he     believed it to be an         ill  omen, and offered human sacrifices             to
  appease        the anger of the offended              deity.    Shortly    after   I  left
  Uganda,       he dreamt of his father, and           in consequence   had 500 people
  put to      death.    He   also believed      if  he dreamt of any     living  person    it
   was a sign that they meditated treachery, and he condemned them
   forthwith to       death.      This   supposed power of divination           is said to
   be hereditary in the royal race.                In  concluding my remarks about
   Mtesa,     I   may   say that he denied his            Wahuma     origin   ; not only,
   however, did his features betray him, but many of the traditions he
   held regarding his ancestors, especially his descent from Ham, point
    conclusively to an origin in the old Christianity of Abyssinia.
        "When     I was  in Uganda Mtesa had two or three hundred women
    always residing at his court.            He did not know exactly how many
    wives he had, but said that they certainly numbered 7000.                      He had
    70 sons and 88 daughters.
         The queen-regent      exercises     practically    the same rights as      a  king
     until her son ascends the throne, and for some little time after a good
     deal of jealousy exists between           mother and son, as the mother does
     not like being deprived of her power.                 The king's head wife and
           "
     the king's sister
                           "
                              are almost invariably present at the council (see
     later), and certainly exercise a considerable influence over the king.
     This "king's sister" is appointed by the chiefs, and is credited with
     an immense stock of wisdom.               She sits near the king to his left, and
      is often appealed to by him when he is called upon to decide difficult
      matters.     She also exercises        a certain amount of authority           in the
       king's household, and she is not allowed to marry.
          The   population     of Uganda        may     be  divided   into four classes,

742                  Proceedings     of  the  Royal Society
the lowest class being the slave population, consisting               of prisoners
taken in war and their descendants.                 They are   very well treated,
but are liable to be sold to Arab slave dealers.             The second are          the
Bachopi     ; they form the mass of the population, and from them                    the
army is recruited, which has made             the army of Uganda         feared       far
and near.
    The third class, that of the Batongoli,             are recruited     from       the
Bachopi, but their honours are not hereditary.                 They govern the
provinces, and are obliged to collect a             certain number of soldiers
in time of    war.    They receive     their rank for distinguished bravery
in the field or for other       services   rendered to the state.        Although
bearing the same name they are not all of equal rank, as some are
governors of towns, others only of small villages.               The fourth class
consists   of Bakungu, nearly all of whom belong to the Luchiko, or
council, and are governors of large             districts of land.      The     three
great hereditary chiefs belong to this class.            They govern the three
districts into which Uganda is divided, and naturally take precedence
over    all other members        of their    class.    The   prime    minister       of
Uganda is appointed by the king.                He   is called the   katikiro    ;  he
sits next to the king, being also next in authority             to him, although
he may previously        not have been        a chief.     The privy council is
composed      of the katikiro,     the three hereditary chiefs, and one or
two other favourites        of   the   king,    and the king's       sister.     The
general    council consists of all the Bakungu and Batongoli who are
in  residence   at the capital, — for the rule is that all must reside there
in rotation for three      months in the year.          The other nine months
they can live where       they like, unless required on account of war.
The chief brewer and the head cook to the king are also members
of the great council, and possess         a considerable   amount of influence.
 Whatever      the privy council decides         must be carried out, for no
king   dare oppose their decisions.         This   general council is   in   attend
 ance daily at the palace      from about nine to twelve, but it does not
 follow that it    meets   the king every day,          as it is summoned          and
 dismissed     at his good    pleasure,    although in exceptional cases the
 hereditary chiefs can insist on the council being held.               Should the
 king wish for     the advice    of the privy council during the sitting of
 the general council, he summons them close to him, and they con
 fer in a low tone, their voices         being rendered      inaudible     to  those

   There         is no real taxation in Uganda, hut the people are compelled
to render feudal service to all their superiors.  Requisitions may
be made on them for all kinds of produce. All the chiefs are judges,
 and although they have no written laws they manage to administer
 them in a satisfactory manner. There is a right of appeal from the
 Datongoli to that of the mkungu of the district ; from him to the
 katikiro, and finally to the king sitting in council. The katikiro
  sits in the judgment seat almost every day from seven to nine. If
 a man is         charged          with any      offence, he and his accuser must appear
 before the judge              ;   they can both call witnesses and argue their cause
 in person, but the judge alone has                       the right to cross-examine            witnesses.
    Laws — (A) Land. — The land                           does not all belong to the                chiefs
 although they             possess large tracts            in their      several districts.        Anyone
  may acquire land, either by annexing a piece of unoccupied property
  or by purchase.                   Even       head      slaves    are     not debarred         from this
  privilege.          At      a man's         death      the land descends           to his sons,        the
  eldest son,           however, coming                  in for       rather      the    largest    share.
  Daughters do not inherit land                       ; there     is no law, however, to prevent
  a woman from acquiring                        it,   and some of the witches do in fact
  possess land of their own.                      By law       an infant may inherit            land, but
  if    very young he stands                    little    chance      of possessing       it,   unless    he
  belongs to the family                  of   one of the big chiefs.               Disputes as to the
   possession         of land are settled by the judges, the final                                decision
   resting with the king in council.

 744               Proceedings      of  the   Royal Society
    People are put to death in various ways, strangling                and     behead-     I
ing being the most common.            Sometimes,     however, the criminals            are
slowly bled to death    ;  they are gashed with tiger-grass          splinters,      care
being taken to avoid the main arteries, or they are tied to a pole,
gradually mutilated, cut to pieces, and literally thrown piecemeal
to the vultures.     Occasionally persons         are burned to        death.       If   a
person is strangled or beheaded,        the body lies where        it falls to    serve
as a  warning to evil-doers    ; no one is permitted to remove             it on    pain
of death.     Adultery and murder         are, as a rule, punished          by  death,
but generally the payment of a heavy fine is considered sufficient for
the latter crime.    The hand, nose, or ears may be cut off                 for theft,
the hand being disarticulated at the wrist-joint.             One meets a consi
derable   number of people       minus nose or ears, the loss of which is
considered   a great   disgrace,    not so much for the fault which                 has
been committed, but for having been found out.                 Small offences        are
punished by the stocks or by flagellation.            Prisoners may be said to
be unknown.       On the whole, justice is administered fairly, but the
punishments tend towards severity.             This  is especially the case after
an appeal to the higher courts.

 polygamy, however,     a large   number of the poorer men are unable                 to
marry, and this notwithstanding           the   larger excess of females          over
 males, being about 31      to   1.    This   preponderance       of females      over
 males is due to three causes — (1) more females are born than males;
 (2) a great number of males are         killed in war; and (3)           there is     a
 constant influx of women into the country             as  prisoners of war.           I
 have   made some observations        with   regard    to the excess       of  female
 births which may be of interest, namely, that the very great                     pro
 portion of children born of newly-caught female                  slaves are     girls.
 This point is all the more noticeable,            because    I  found that it        is
only in the first births that girls predominate            so  largely over      boys.
 To   make  this clear,   I  may    give the following figures: — Of               300
 Waganda women observed           9, or 3 per cent., appeared to be sterile;
 291 had children.      The male first births were 144, the female                first
 births were 147.     Of 500     women who had been captured, 12 only,

                       of Edinburgh, Session 1885—86.                            745
or    3 '6  per cent., appeared to be sterile;        and tho number of male
first births     was 79, of female 403.        In  the subsequent     births, how
ever, male and female children born were nearly equal in number,
the    females being only     slightly in   excess.
     Of the whole 800 women          observed   69 had 4 children, 3 had 5,
3 had      6, 3 had 7.
     2. Separation     of Husband and Wife. — Although in the                 poorer
families the      women    are prolific,  it being common enough           to meet
•with mothers of six or seven children, yet on account of polygamy
 most      of the women have         only one or two.         It  is the custom,
 except in the lowest class of society, for a woman to separate from
lier husband from the time of her pregnancy until                she has weaned
her child, and this is not done until it is two           years    old.   Even in
the    lowest class a few months separation         is usual.
     Chiefs who have very large harems            have establishments in the
 country     to which their women are banished during            this period, and
 in  them they are strictly watched.          In  sexual matters they are very
 cleanly, regular ablutions being rigorously prescribed.
     3. Loss     of Infant Life. — Still births      are very rare, and infant
 mortality is very slight.        Infanticide is never    practised,    but miscar
riages, said by the natives to be due to syphilis, are not infrequent.
     Treatment     of Widoics. — As the     custom obtains for the eldest son
 to marry all his father's widows, with             the exception of his own
 mother, they do not suffer much by the loss of their husbands.                   At
 the present time no women are sacrificed at their husband's graves,
 but    there   is a tradition   that at one time some of the widows of
 kings and hereditary chiefs were tied up in the               enclosures     round
 their husband's graves and starved to death.
     The women age at a comparatively early period, and are then
 compelled to do more field work,           &c, than women in the prime of
 life.
     Education     of Children. — The children in Uganda are very well
 behaved.        Their education commences at an early age, and they are
 taught to follow the occupations of their parents.               Fighting,    danc
 ing, and music are taught to            children    of six or seven.          Strict
 obedience and respect       to their elders are rigorously inculcated, but
 the children are happy merry little things notwithstanding.                   I was
 much struck by the way in which they amused themselves.                    Instead

 746                 Proceedings    of  the   Royal Society
of making senseless mud pies,        I used     to see them making          miniature
villages, copies of mountains, rough models of men and animals of
clay, and    I was surprised to      see   how neatly they constructed                 the
miniature huts, which        were almost exact copies            of the dwellings
around them.        They would he thus employed for hours                    together,
day after day, and would persevere until their models were complete.
When      strangers    visit their parents they sit          at   a  little   distance
listening to the conversation, but ever ready to run on any errand
that may be required.
    The children     inhabit   the same huts        with their parents, but              in
many of the huts a sleeping room is partitioned off for them.
   Slavery. — Slavery has existed in Uganda from time immemorial.
The slaves are captives made in war and their descendants.                          The
number of slaves held varies           necessarily with         the position         and
wealth of the owner.        They are well treated, and their lot is by no
means a degraded        one ; they have      definite rights, and although               a
master    may   kill  a slave,   public opinion is against such              practice.
The head slaves are allowed to marry and to hold slaves themselves,
whom they may sell or exchange,           but their own descendants belong
to   their master.     About 1000       slaves    are exported annually           from
Uganda    ;  they consist of boys and young men and a small pro
portion of young girls.         Female slaves are        as  a  rule incorporated
into the harems of the Waganda.                The price of slaves is steadily
increasing, and is about four times         as  high now as it was ten           years
ago.    The slave population       is diminishing,       and the      Waganda        are
beginning to feel that the exportation              of slaves must       cease,  for if
not, they    will be compelled to do manual            work themselves, which
work they strongly object to.
    Games and Amusements.         — Men and      women, boys and girls, amuse
themselves     by singing and dancing, and there are frequent                   enter
tainments in the villages at night.          The two sexes dance          separately,
not in couples.       The dances     are accompanied by music, and some
of the figure dancing is very graceful.            A   shuffle   dance is also per
formed singly or in groups.        The performers advance or recede with
knees   slightly   bent,  the   arms  stiffly held      by the sides,       with    the
hands stretched out, and the palms downwards.                     Every    muscle in
the body is brought into action, and           it is  so  exhausting that it        can
only be kept up for two or three minutes.                   This   dance    seems     to

                         of Edinburgh, Session 1885-86.                            747
afford considerable         pleasure   to the people, and a good dancer, that
is one who can keep up for a long time, is much in request, some
of the chiefs       even maintaining professional dancing boys.
    Boys also are incited to kicking matches, at which they exhibit
considerable agility.          They endeavour        to   strike with the sole of
their    foot, no sandals being permitted.            Wrestling     matches are also
very common.            The right hand may at first be only used until a
good grip is obtained, the left being held behind the back.                         As
well     as  affording amusement,        wrestling is practised to settle dis
putes;      in such cases an umpire is           often appointed by         the two
disputants.
    The Waganda are exceedingly good story tellers, and wile away
many an hour by relating anecdotes               in turn.      The stories   treat   of
all kinds of incidents,         grave and gay, decent and the reverse.             The
following       stories  will  serve to illustrate their style, as well as .to
afford some information on other matters              : —
    1.   A hunter had        been very unsuccessful for a long time.                He
was sitting in his hut one day with his wives and children, because
a terrible storm raged through the forest               ;  presently a bird flew in
for    shelter,    and the children      seeing    this tried to catch      it.    The
hunter, however,         took its part, and forbade the children to touch it.
When       the storm      had passed away, the bird said to the hunter, "             I
will help you now ; you          are a  kind   man.      I will  fly before you, and
lead you to the prey;" and it did so, and the hunter rejoiced.
    2.   A  chief once had a favourite wife, to whom he committed the
care of      all  he had.     Even his other wives, and they were very
numerous, were under her control.                He returned home from hunt
ing one day, and called           his wife, but she had disappeared          mysteri
ously, and was nowhere to be found.                  This    loss was a great grief
to   him;        his household      was    disordered,     and     his  other wives
quarrelled.        He   was  in despair, when one day, as he was walking             in
the forest      and thinking of his lost wife, he           cried aloud, " Oh    !  my
treasure,     coidd   I but  find you."     A honey bird flew to him,       and said,
" Your wife is in the sky."             For  a moment he was overjoyed, but
then became more sorrowful than ever, for, although he might seek
throughout the forest, he could not climb the clouds.                     A  rat then
came to his aid, telling          him of a tree that grew very quickly, and
offering to show it to him.           He followed      the rat through the forest,

748                    Proceedings       of   the   Royal Society
until   he came to a tree which was                 visibly growing, and the top               of
which had almost passed out of sight.                        .At the rat's      bidding       he
climbed      the    tree,   and   the honey bird             kept  him     company          and
encouraged      him.      As   he climbed higher             so the tree      grew,     till   at
length far above          the clouds he landed in the spirit world.                         The
spirits asked him what he required, and he begged                       for his wife, who
was given him as a reward for his perseverance,                    and they descended
the tree together.           Then he rewarded the rat and the honey                       bird.
Some time afterwards the chief went to look for the tree, but                          it   had
vanished.
    3.  One night       a man     was returning to his home from a                 feast, at
which he had eaten largely and drunk much mwengi.                             He was      very
tired and sat down to rest             ; he    fell asleep, and when he awoke he
found that his torch had gone out, and it being very dark he                            could
not find his way.          As   he wandered hither and thither               in  the   forest
a  jackal met him, and asked                him where he was going.                 "  I    am
trying    to find my way home," said                he.     The jackal offered to          run
on before and show him the right path ; he accepted the offer,                            and
they went      a  considerable distance together.                The man then asked
the jackal    if he were near home.              " Yes,"    was the reply ;
                                                                                " you    will
soon be home ; you have feasted, and now we                       will  feast."     Having
said   this he   called out " Lion        !  lion   !"  and with a     loud roar a lion
sprang on the man and            killed him      ;  so  the lion and the jackal got a
good meal.
    4. Two     men     once    had     a  dispute      as   to  which     was    the most
successful    liar.     The one proposed           that they should each tell lies,
and that the one who told the best should be acknowledged by                              the
other   as the   most clever.       His friend       agreed, and asked him to begin.
So he      told   a    number of outrageous              lies, and then said         to his
friend, " Now how          do you propose to beat me?
                                                                 "  " Easily," said he ;
"everything that you           have said is true; now that is the biggest                lie."
Then they both burst out laughing.
    5. Some      driver     ants   once     invaded a man's          hut.     Ho    was     so
angry that he killed          a great    number by setting some grass on fire.
The ant3 went away, but held a council of war, and their                              leader
addressed them, and said,            "  A  man, because of his great size, injures
us, for he thinks that we are small ; he is cruel, so we must punish
him."     Messengers       were then sent by the ants far and wide, and at

                      of Edinburgh, Session 1885-86.                          749
•the  appointed time, the next new moon, they assembled in great
numbers, so great that they could not be counted.                Several leaders
were then appointed and they attacked their enemy's hut, which was
soon all "eaten up."         The man, his wives, and his children, were
also not spared.      Know then that the big should not ill-treat the little.
    The children are sometimes amused by having tales told them on
their   fingers.   The following string of words for       instance,   is told off
on   the five fingers.    Mkazi, nyumba, mulongo, toki, mwengi.               This
is probably intended      to illustrate the five wants of a Mganda,          for it
means a woman,        a hut, twins, bananas, and wine.
    The only real Waganda game is called mweso.               It  is played on a
"board containing thirty-two holes, and stones, coffee-berries,          or beads
are used.       The people   will play this     game for hours on end, but        I
am sorry to say that        I cannot     explain it ; it was too difficult      for
 me to comprehend.        All I know      is that two players move the stones
 from one hole to another under certain conditions, and under other
conditions the one player confiscates           the stones of another.        That
 the game is an exciting one may be drawn from the fact that the
 players are often as furious      as  crusty old whist players, and that a
crowd collects      to see the play.       They are not, however, allowed to
comment on the game until           it is finished
    Music.  — The Waganda        possess a decided genius for music, and
 are very clever in picking        up new tunes.        Their   voices   are soft,
 clear, and melodious, and of considerable range.            They have     a great
 variety of tunes, orchestral,     dance, and vocal music having distinct
 characteristics.     They prefer their songs to be accompanied,          but are
 quite capable of keeping in tune without this aid.            They have solos
 and choruses, and many of their musicians improvise readily.                Then-
 bands are led by conductors, and some of them number 40 or 50
 performers.      The king and chiefs have professional singers           in their
 employment and private orchestras of stringed instruments, but they
 are mostly      composed    of the Wasoga, who are the best harpists in
 Central Africa.
     The Waganda have songs suited to various occasions             — love  songs,
  war songs, dirges,    and songs to illustrate many of their traditions.
 The following two songs were translated by the Rev. C. T. Wilson,
 the first being in praise of Mtesa, and the second a lamentation over
 some dead chiefs.

     Musical Instruments — (1) Harmonicon (Madinda). — This consists
 of twelve to twenty pieces of hard resonant wood which are]scooped

    (3) Drums.                                                             which
they have various sizes, from small cylindrical instruments, open
at one end and closed at the other by python              skin, which are held
under the arm     and  struck    with   the fingers or hand, to huge drums,
formed   like  kettle  drums,    which    require half a dozen men to carry
them, and are beaten      with drum sticks.         The wooden logs of which

the drums            are made are shaped           and hollowed     out with the axe.
The king's great war drum is said to                     be very old, and is guarded
night and day. Covers made of tanned                     hide, are used to protect the
drums from           the influence of the weather.            Many of the drums are
provided with cords to               tighten them up when needed.
     (4) Horns. — Various             sizes are used, made out of elephants' tusks
(rare), or        the horns of antelopes.          The tips are cut off, and they are
blown         from the      side, but two notes can be produced by closing the
 hole at the tip with the finger. These                 horns are also used to convey
 orders on the march and in battle.
      (5)     Whistles.   — Although all       the "VVaganda can whistle       with their
 fingers,       they have      small wooden whistles, with two or three notes.
 These        are blown from the end, and they carry them suspended                 round
  the neck by         a  string.
       (6)    Flutes, which are blown from the end, have two to four notes                 ;
  they are either         made of reeds or hard wood, and are highly polished.
       (7) Harps are constructed as follows : — A basin-shaped piece of
   hard wood is taken and covered with python skin or the skin of a
   water lizard,      so as to form a sounding box.            To this box is fastened
   a  long curved        arm, in the upper portion of which six to eight pegs
   are inserted, to which the strings are attached so that they can be
   tuned just like        a  violin.    The other ends of the strings are fastened
   to a strip      of wood which          spans   the  centre  of the sounding box.
    The twisted strips of intestines of either             the goat or sheep are used
    to make the strings.             The instrument is played by the fingers of
    both hands.
        All    these    instruments      have    only   whole    tones,    but  that the
    "VYaganda      can appreciate       semi-tones    is proved by the ready way        in
    which      they    distinguish      them    when they hear       European      music.
    The instruments are always ornamented with plumes, beads, bangles,
    &c, and the performers array themselves in very striking                       attire,
    with monkey or goat skins round their shoulders, and goats'                    beards
    attached     to their chins.
        It  is impossible for me to describe the effect produced by sixty
    or seventy of the above varied instruments, — one of the king's bands,
    for instance,    — but it      is melodious, although       fantastical and weird.
    Roving minstrels are always to be found present                     on  occasions   of
    festivity.      They both extemporise           songs   in honour of the       event,

 generally managing to bring in          a  few verses flattering           to the   host,
 which are always much applauded by the guests, and also sing songs
which have been handed down by tradition, and are well                        known     by
all the people and often called for.            Comic songs are also much in
request,   and are greeted by roars of laughter from the                  audience,    but
many of them are very lewd.           These bards,        as  well as being supplied
 with   as much food and drink       as  they can consume, are rewarded for
their services by a present of cowries, mbugu, or even                    a  goat.    The
songs which       pleased  me most were those           in which       solo  and chorus
followed each other in rapid succession              ;   the pleasing         effect  was
heightened by the surroundings, for generally these gatherings                       take
place under spreading trees,       lit up by the silvery light of the moon
or the ruddy glare of enormous bonfires.
   Mtesa's envoys who accompanied me to England had their harps
with them, and       I was  often surprised to hear them, after they had
retired for the night, persevering until they had reproduced some
catching melody they had heard during the day.                       One of them was
very fond of sitting down to the piano, and managed to learn in                          a
few days to play two or three simple tunes.
   Trade.   — There is not very much            home trade         in Uganda, and it
is limited    to the barter of native manufactures.                    Several times    a
year    caravans    arrive  from Zanzibar,         bringing         calico of    various
qualities, guns of cheap Belgian manufacture, powder mostly made
in Germany         and of a very        bad quality,         files,   knives,   needles,
coloured pocket handkerchiefs, suits of Arabic                   clothes and cowries,
&c.     These articles they exchange            for    ivory      and slaves.       This
foreign trade has increased      immensely during the last ten years, and
the   people    are  already beginning        to feel the necessity          of finding
some     other commodity with which              to procure foreign            produce.
Ivory is becoming scarce, the price of slaves is rising enormously,
and little by little the people         are    beginning        to understand       that
either they will have to work themselves            or else stop the exportation
of slaves, of whom about 1000 are exported annually.                          "When an
Arab caravan first arrives in Uganda, it is etiquette for the leader
to first pay a visit to the king, make him a present, and at the same
time give him a list professedly of the whole contents of his caravan,
lie   also gives presents     to the katikiro and the three hereditary
chiefs.    The    king and his council then               decide      what guns and

amunition they will buy for the State, and a week or two is generally
occupied in coming to terms with the trader and in paying the
stipulated price.        The Arabs generally ask about five times the
amount that they intend finally to accept. They are usually paid
for the Government goods in^ ivory. As            soon as this State business
is concluded, the king and the principal           chiefs make their private
purchases, and      it is only when they     are satisfied that the trader is
allowed     to dispose   of his remaining stock   to all comers.      About two
months are required by the Arabs to dispose of all their goods, and
the Government always provides them with               canoes to transport the
ivory and     slaves they have obtained, from Ntebbi, the port near the
 capital Eubaga, to Kagei, at the south end of the lake.                The large
 traders in Unyanyembe have agents constantly residing in Uganda,
 who generally collect ivory and slaves to be ready for the arrival of
 the caravans, and otherwise look after their interests.            It was these
 agents who had a good deal of influence with Mtesa, and who try
 to make the sojourn of Europeans in Uganda                   as unpleasant as
 possible, for they fear that their business         will be spoilt, especially
 that    in   slaves,   by   the   introduction    of   European       commerce.
  Formerly    a small trade      was  carried on with the Soudan          ; coffee,
 tobacco, mbugu, and cattle were exchanged           for fezes, calico, and red
 slippers, but the withdrawal         of the Egyptians     from Mrooli put        a
 stop to this traffic.
     Strangers residing in the country were, until quite recently, pro
  hibited from buying produce (see Treatment of Strangers).
     No fairs are held, but at the capital a very primitive sort of
  market is held daily.
     Money. — Exchangeable Values.        — The king and a few of the richest
  chiefs possess Maria Theresa dollars, but they are seldom used as
  money.       The   standard value of an article may be said to be
  reckoned by a string of 100 cowries or an arm's length of calico.
  Beads,    hoes,  salt,   and fish    are  also employed as mediums of
  exchange.
     A  fat cow costs about 2500 cowries, or three arms' lengths of
  cloth, or two needles, or    a small box of percussion caps, or 20 charges
  of powder.      A   young slave boy is worth        100   percussion caps, 4
  needles,   or about 4000 cowries, whereas a young slave girl is worth
  about a third       more,   and a full grown      female    slave  costs about
     vol.  xia                                                        3 D

50 jars of beer,         &c,    <fec,    and fines are paid in the same way.                    It     is
also a common custom,               if   a   chief is found fault with by          the king,         for
him to give equal proportions of everything which Uganda produces
as a peace-offering.
    Weights and Measures.                — The only           measures used    in Uganda          are
the span of the hand, the cubit, and an arm's length, and,                               with    the
                                                        ivory, no
exception of one balance at the capital used for weighing
weights are in existence. Capacity is measured by handfuls, and
also by baskets and jars of various sizes, the largest containing
about two gallons.              Tallies and counters are used              (see   Arithmetic).
    Communications.            — Uganda is the only country that                  I know of in
Central Africa where an attempt is made to facilitate                              communica
tions between one part of the land and another by real                                     roads.
Another        remarkable fact               is,   that nearly all the roads are straight,
and lead in direct lines through forests and over hills.                           Some of the
principal      roads are 80 feet broad, and the narrowest are not less
than 25.      I     believe that         King Suna IL introduced roadmaking                  into
Uganda, and since then they have been regularly maintained.                                  The
heads    of villages       are all responsible for certain portions of the roads,
and the king sends out inspectors from time to time to                             see   that the
work     is   properly done.
    Should      a   swamp have to be crossed, causeways are constructed,
with bridges at intervals formed by the trunks of trees, to give                                free
passage to the streams                  which filter through them          ;   and sometimes
corduroy roads are even met with.
    No metal        is   placed on the road.                 "With the exception of the small
bridges just mentioned, the only bridge known in Uganda                                    is   the
usual primitive tree bridge.                       At   most of the creeks ferry boats may
be found,          but these are in nearly all cases private undertakings,
passengers         being expected             to pay      a   small fee.   Heavy weights         are
carried slung to poles which men carry on their shoulders, sometimes
 four or six men together.                   Persons are carried either sitting straddle-
legs over the shoulders, or else on                      a    rough stretcher carried on         the
shoulders of two men.                   The king's daughters,          and the head wives            of

                              of Edinburgh, Session 1885—86.
some of           the principal chiefs, are usually carried in the former manner.
!N"o animals are used as heasts of burden.                    There are no inns, and
travellers are obliged                to obtain accommodation as best they may.
 Heavy weights, such                  as the trunks   of trees, are hauled along the
 •ground          by   ropes     attached    to them.    The men pull by word of
 command.               The use of levers is also understood to a limited extent.
        Treatment of Foreigners.— Until the novelty of their presence has
  passed off, foreigners are well treated in Uganda. They are con
  sidered the          guests of the king, and huts are provided for their use at
  the capital.            There was, however, a difficulty in obtaining food when
  I was there,           as no one was permitted to sell anything to the king's
   guests.         I believe     that to some extent this prohibition       has been re-   .
   laxed.         The late     King Mtesa liked having       strangers   present   at his
   court      ; not so however the chiefs, who greatly feared their influence.*
          Strangers       travelling    through   the country, accompanied by an
    escort from the king, are always sure of obtaining good accommoda
    tion,     as the escort goes to the best          hut in the village, turns the
    inhabitants        out, and takes possession of it for the time being.            The
    people       are, however,        hospitable, and endeavour to make one as
     comfortable         as   circumstances     will permit.      Foreigners     are   not
     permitted to enter Uganda without                 permission of the king      ; they
     are compelled         to halt at the first village until it is granted.      One or
     two      of the king's        pages,   bearing a drum and flag        as marks of
      authority, are usually           sent  with a requisite number of porters to
      transport     the stranger       and his goods to the capital    ;  but it is not
      etiquette for this to be done rapidly, and circuitous routes are always
      chosen, and the halts made are frequent and tantalising.             The traveller
      is also constantly annoyed by the frequent disputes between                      his
       escort and       the   villagers, which     sometimes    end in blows, and       it
       requires great tact on his part to keep the peace.            The king's pages
       are overbearing,       and treat the villagers abominably, requiring them
        to perform impossibilities, and beating them          if they refuse.     On one
        occasion,   when travelling with a very small escort,         I nearly   lost my
        life  through      their plundering      propensities.    The   drummer, who
        marches at the       head of the caravan,     gets the head of any cow that
        may be    killed for food on the march as a perquisite.
           •The objection     of the chiefs to foreigners has lately culminated in the
         murder of Bishop Hannington on the borders of Uganda.

     The "Waganda        are admirable      porters, taking     great  care of        any
goods committed to their charge.                 When they halt for the night
huts are built for the goods             to   protect them from the rain, and
although you may not          see  your goods for several days together,               yet
they     will  be invariably      delivered up to you at the end                 of    the
journey in good condition.
     Foreign    Influence.
                            — The Suaheli language has been extensively
 introduced into the country by the Arab traders from Zanzibar.
 The use of chairs and stools is appreciated by many of the chiefs,
 and a good many articles of European manufacture are gradually
 finding    their way into       the country.        The number of firearms              is
 yearly increasing.
     Marriages.    — Polygamy       is   universal,     and   even      the     poorest
 peasant    does his best to obtain more than one wife.               The marriages
 are contracted       rather early,    and,    strictly  speaking, marriage is            a
 bargain between the bridegroom and the father of the bride.                         The
 usual price for a wife amongst             the lower orders       is three     or four
 oxen or six needles, or the equivalent in cowries.                  The price      rises
 according to the rank.          The only restriction on marriage           is the in
 ability   to pay the dowry.        The chiefs have very large harems.               The
 marriage ceremonies        are   of  a very    primitive   character,   if   they    can
 be called ceremonies        at alL      In    many cases the young           husband
 simply erects his hut, and having paid the dowry, takes his                        wife
 home with him.            More rarely, however, the preliminaries              having
 been    settled, the friends      of both parties meet in the bride's              hut,
  where a dinner         is provided     by her father.       The afternoon          and
 evening are spent in dancing, singing, and drinking,                    after which
  the bride and bridegroom are conducted by their friends to their
  hut,   the door of which is then closed, while the friends                    remain
  outside    and    carouse    throughout      most of the night.          The      next
  morning     they     congratulate    the newly        married    pair,   who      then
  proceed    to give a feast.        The songs on these occasions             celebrate
  the joys of marriage,       and detail the duties of husbands and               wives.
  Marriages between relations are not forbidden, and brothers                     some
   times marry their sisters.
      In  large   establishments      separate     huts are appropriated         to   the
   women, but in no case does            a  single wife have      a  hut to     herself.
  The wives are very jealous of one another, and only the head                     wives

                             of Edinburgh, Session 1885—86.                             757
liave         definite    privileges.      In   large    establishments the favourite
for the          day wears some distinguishing               ornament;    in   some    cases
it is      a small bell hung round the neck.
       Divorce       is unknown,         for if    a wife    misbehave herself she is
 executed.           Notwithstanding         this stringent law, an immense amount
 of immorality            prevails.      There is no class of courtesans,          such as
 exists in        the neighbouring          country of Unyoro, where an elaborate
 system is in         vogue.
        The condition           of women in Uganda             is a very pitiable        and
  degraded        one, as,    with   the exception of one or two favourite wives,
  they      are mostly devoted to a monotonous and hardworking existence.
        Births. — In ordinary circumstances, women are delivered in their
  usual huts, being assisted by a few female friends, men and
  children being          excluded.       The woman is delivered on her back, her
   legs being placed against the wall of the hut.                      In  difficult cases
   medicine-men          are called in, but       I was    unable to ascertain whether
   their aid      was successful       except   in  the   cases  in which they perform
   abdominal section.*
         For   a few days before a woman expects               her labour, she eats very
    little food and         abstains    from exercise.        During and after labour
    frequent ablutions are performed,              and the child is washed and oiled
    soon after birth, and then at once put to the breast.                      Should the
    mother's      milk be small in quantity, an application of some chewed
    root is applied to the breasts, which is said to be a very valuable
     galactagogue.        In primapara,        the nipples are always drawn out           by
    the woman's        friends some days before            they will  be required.        In
     the large establishments of the             chiefs an old woman has charge of
     the women, and acts as head                midwife.      After labour the      women
     are not expected        to work for about fourteen days.
         The navel cord         is preserved,     and in the     case  of the king and
     chiefs it is covered         with beadwork       ornaments.      The king's navel
     cord is committed to a chief of high rank, and he                       brings   it to
      court on special       occasions.      The placenta is buried outside of the
      hut, that of males on the one side, of females on the other.
          Births  are celebrated       by great rejoicings amongst         the relations,
      but should twins be born tho whole of the villagers assemble on the
      fifth or sixth day at the hut         in which    the woman and children live.

It  is considered     a   very lucky event for the whole village, and                     the
general congratulations are hearty and prolonged.                     The    women and
girls deck themselves with flowers,               tie banana leaves round               their
waists,   and dance        round drums, singing meanwhile a song                   adapted
to the occasion.        The rest of the company sit in groups,                   watching
the dancers,      drinking beer, and smoking.                  The father      makes       the
round of the groups to receive                 the congratulations of his           friends,
the mother sitting in the meantime with her child at the door                                of
the hut, where,       one by one, the guests congratulate her.                    During       a
pause   in  the dancing the          people assemble        in a semicircle round          the
happy mother, and the eldest grandfather takes the child, and holding
it up, cries out, " Its name is so-and-so," e.g., Mwenda or Kataruba.
This is greeted with the shouts of " Mwenda, may he live happy,
may he be        brave,       may he      have many wives,           may      he    become
great," and       such-like        good     wishes     for   the   child's    future.        A
Waganda       child    receives     only one name, but the variety of                 names
among them is very                great.    The      names    of gods,     animals,       and
insects are      often given.          The     king,    however,     and     the     chiefs,
although      at   first    possessing      only     one   name,    gradually       acquire
more, as after each feat of arms or special event                       in their     lives     a
significant    name      is given to them,            and for this reason         I   doubt
whether the list of kings             I   have given is correct        ;  I suspect      that
 more    than one name has been given to one king in the list                                 I
 never heard two lists agree exactly.
     Deaths. — When         a  man dies, a messenger            is sent round         to his
 friends to summon them to the funeral, which always takes                              place
 within twelve hours after his             decease.      The body is not       embalmed,
 but simply      wrapped in mbugu cloth,                  during   which      process      his
 friends sing funeral dirges, and             a  minstrel is often engaged           to sing
 an extempore eulogy of the man's life.                     The body is then         carried
 into a jungle, where         it is buried in a deep grave.          Nothing      is buried
 with   the   body.     The friends then generally return to the dead                  man's
  hut, where a cow is killed, and a funeral feast takes                         place.       If
 a chief dies, his body is placed              in a coffin, and the mourning              and
 funeral festivities        last three     or four days.        The    kings     and their
 mothers are the only persons to whose memory monuments are                          erected.
 Their   graves[are prepared as follows            : —A    large square hole is       dug, at
 the bottom      of which        are   laid layer after layer of mbugu,                 skins,

                          of Edinburgh, Session 1885-86.                               759
and.      calico; in order to get enough of the latter commodity, all
the chiefs are compelled to contribute largely, and all merchants or
strangers who may happen to be in the country are expected to give
presents. On the top of these cloths the coffin is placed, and is
surrounded and covered by other layers of the same materials. Earth
 is then      piled over them,       and   a    hut is erected    over the spot,        and
 enclosed in a       strong fence made of tiger grass.         When all is completed,
  a sacrifice of many hundred           slaves     is offered.    From time to time
  these     huts are renewed, and      a fresh sacrifice is then made, the victims
  being always beheaded.             When      a slave   dies he is simply thrown out
  into the jungle. Most            women are buried without              any ceremony
   whatever.
        Superstitions.   — The   Waganda are excessively superstitious, and a
   thorough examination of their superstitions would, I am convinced,
   reveal much that is curious and interesting. I am not able to do
   full    justice to this     theme,     as a long residence         in  a   country     is
    necessary     to enable    one to collect        any save    the most      superficial
    information.        The   Waganda       lay     great   weight on dreams        ;  they
    imagine that in them future            events     are depicted, that impending
     evil may    be avoided by attention to nocturnal warnings, and that the
     names or faces of those who would do them harm are revealed                       with
     unerring    accuracy   in  the night watches.          Consequently      their daily
     life is influenced by      these  dreams, but, notwithstanding             this, they
     are not, save under exceptional circumstances,              very superstitious of
     their neighbours.       They   appear to      think that harm     is more   likely   to
     accrue to them from the numerous sprites which inhabit the trees or
     bask on the banks of the streams, or from the denizens                   of the sun,
      the moon, and the stars.       The demons, who are supposed to dwell on
      the opposite side of the lake, are believed to have the power of
      spiriting away Waganda;         and should any one be lost in an un
      explained manner, they say that the demons                have    carried him off.
      Some animals too are supposed           to have     an evil character,    others    to
      possess virtues for guarding and directing men.              There are numerous
     stories  in which animals play          a   leading part,    by either aiding or
      punishing    men.      Thunder     and lightning may be said to be wor
      shipped, and most diseases are referred to some deity or demon.
      If going on   a journey or even for a walk, it is considered unlucky
      to  turn back for any article          ;    the Waganda       also   return     by   a

760                    Proceedings               of   the   Royal Society
different path from the one taken in going.                                 Should         they         stumble
when walking,          it is   a    sign of bad luck               ;   and the leader of a party
who notices any impediment in the path strikes                                  it    as   a warning                to
those     following     him, and each man as he passes repeats                                   the signal
Some people are supposed to possess the power of the                                       evil        eye, and
are dreaded      in    consequence.               They are so much dreaded,                             in    fact,
that the people are afraid to harm them for fear of                                    their           revenge*
Rain is believed         to be given and withheld by some                                  inhabitant               of
the spirit world, and the failure of increase in their herds or crops
is attributed     to     the same cause.                    The fertility of women, cattle,
and the fields may be ensured,                        they think, by proper offerings                              to
the respective        deities who overrule their destinies.                           It is not             to be
wondered at,          if people given                 to so      much superstition,                resort          to
magic      in their troubles.                   Medicine-men           are to be found                 in    great
numbers in Uganda,                  and a few               witches        of high         repute           dwell
scattered     throughout           the land.             These persons           are       all powerful,
though naturally          some           are     more       celebrated         than    others.              They
profess to interpret           dreams, to make rain and                        withhold          it,   to cure
disease and to induce              it,   to discover stolen articles and to indicate
the thief.      They      also intimate               to their clients          that they are able
to influence the deities for good or                             ill — of    course, all for           a     con
sideration.      They often amass great wealth,                              and      form       a     mighty
power in the land.                 It   is   from these magicians that the Waganda
obtain      the numerous charms,                      which       they believe to possess                     the
power of protecting                their        persons         and belongings             from        injury.
Charms are used to                  keep         their      dwellings       from      fire,      and their
possessions      from thieves            ;   others       to    ward off sickness, or to                     cure
disease.      Some      are celebrated                for their power over the bites                           of
venomous snakes           ;    others are supposed                      to direct          the    flight       of
spear or arrow, while                   still    others        make    their wives faithful                  and
their cattle prolific.         Some             charms         secure to   a   suppliant the grant
of   a   favour, and some are used by women in the form of an oint
ment, with which           they smear their bodies, in order to gain their
husband's special favour.                       Most of the charms are simple in                             con
struction, but they are manufactured with due mysterious                                               secrecy,
in   some remote        forest glade at dead of night on the appearance                                        of
the new moon.             The magicians arojmost careful that no prying
eye shall watch their manipulations;                            in their    retreats they construct

                           of Edinburgh, Session 1885—86.                          761
small        huts surrounded by strong tall             fences, and  in this solitude
they perform their           mystic rites.
      The charms are          made   of the claws, the teeth,        or the horns of
animals, often blended into fantastic ornaments highly                      decorated
by        beadwork.         Others    consist      of   cunningly-devised     powders
 containing numerous ingredients,               such as burnt roots and bark and
 leaves,       the nails of dead men, tufts of hair, and            sometimes   teeth.
 These powders are either placed in horns, usually closed by python
 skin, or else they are packed in small neatly made boxes covered
  by skin.          Charms arejhung round the waist or the neck, suspended
  to the rafters of       the huts or over the doorway, or else may be they
  are hung to the branch of some mighty forest tree,                  supposed   to be
  inhabited by a sprite ; others again are cast into                   the streams   or
  lake to propitiate        some offended     river deity.
        Besides the charms which these magicians retail to their dupes,
   they      profess   to possess special     ones    which    never go out of their
   possession.        These they use only on rare and important occasions              ;
   for instance, should       a great chief be sick, they bring the charms to
   his hut that they may         cure him.
         A  great many national charms also             exist in Uganda, which      are
    regarded as most sacred ; huts are provided for their accommodation
    near the royal palace, and special custodians are appointed to guard
    them night and day.          Some drums and horns are also supposed to
    possess the       special power of striking           dread into    the hearts   of
     national enemies.        Should     any great       war be    undertaken, these
     charms      are brought before the king,          and should untoward        news
     arrive    from an army in the          field,  it is not unusual for     some of
     them to be sent to aid by their            subtle spell the wavering troops.
     The Waganda take good care to let their opponents know of their
     presence,    hoping by this means to gain a victory all the sooner.
         As   I  before mentioned      (see   Pathology), some ,of the magicians
      practise as doctors,   and far be it from me to depreciate their skill, for
      I am   sure, after repeated observation, that many of the drugs they
      use are   active remedies, and that they are administered with con
      siderable   insight and skill.
          Beligion.  — It is very difficult   to know what the "Waganda really
       think about death and departed          friends, and one would be inclined
       to say  that they think nothing of        a life after death, were it not that

762                      Proceedings         of   tlie   Royal Society
indirect evidence seems to prove that they do not think that                                       death
means annihilation,           but have an idea that a man's life influences                                  a
future state, and that the departed can exert an influence on                                         men
and events.         At     least many of their traditions go to prove the pre
valence of this belief, and several of their ancient kings are said                                       to
be more or less           powerful spirits, who are engaged                      in watching         with
interest the actions of their descendants,                           and are able to overrule
the fate of those            who honour their memory and make periodical
offerings    at their graves.
    The Waganda have no images or outward symbols of their                                          gods,
but they         hold      that the     world        was      created      by the great Spirit
Katonda, who is said to have                      been        well pleased           with   his work,
but to be far too mighty to take^any personal interest in the world
he has      made.        They therefore do not worship him, but offer their
gif ts to the lesser gods or demons to whom he relinquished the rule of
the world.         At    least one     of   these is supposed to be able to depute
his power to mortals,               namely, Mugasa, the god of the lake.                           He     is
a   kind of Neptune, and lives in and rules over                           the    Victoria    Nyanza.
Occasionally he is believed to take up his abode                                  either in    a     man
or woman, who is greatly feared and respected                              by both king,       chiefs,
and common people, and is from time to time consulted by                                        them.
This   oracle can order or prevent war;                       a   word from it is supposed                to
cure sickness or prevent              it,   and   it   has the power of withholding rain
or causing famine.               Large presents              must be given to the               person
who    is   supposed        to be the incorporation                   of this spirit        whenever
advice      is   asked.       Before        the Waganda              venture to undertake                 a
voyage      on the       lake they place some food on                      a     paddle, and        say   a
short prayer, asking for protection on the way and a safe return                                          ;
they then throw the fruit into the lake, and start on their journey.
The god to whom             is   ascribed the power over smallpox,                      Xdaula*           is
another much-feared spirit,                  who       is   said to live on the             snow-clad
summit of Mount Gambaragara.                             There       is   also   a   thunder       spirit,
to whom are erected arches or else                          little huts over every          place    that
has been         struck by lightning (which                   is    very much dreaded),               and
strangers    are forbidden to approach near them.                            When, however,           the
huts fall to pieces they are not rebuilt                          In several places river       deities
are supposed to live, and should the king or one of the three hereditary
       This god     is   supposed    to be identical with the former             king of    Uganda.

                          of Edinburgh, Session 1885-86.                            763
chiefs       dream of them,      it is customary       to offer human sacrifices       to
tlieru.        On such occasions        the executioners will be commanded to
catch       a hundred or so individuals ;            they rush madly through the
streets,      seize any one they may happen to find, and when a sufficient
number         are collected     together     they lead     them to     the supposed
 residence of the spirit, and          decapitate    them over   a large  hole dug by
 the     side of the river to receive their blood.
       The Waganda        have two gods        of war, Chiwuka and Nenda, who
 are said     to reside  in certain   trees in different parts of Uganda.         These
  trees   are tended by men who are supposed to possess priestly functions,
  and to     them    offerings  of black cattle (sheep and goats) are made by
  the warriors, who pray under the trees before going to                    war.     The
  animals are not killed when the prayers are offered, but                   are given
   into the    charge    of the   priests,   who consume them at their leisure.
   One may      say that all the offerings       to the deities in Uganda are of        a
   propitiatory     character.
       Mythology.    — When sitting        at a camp fire in Uganda the traveller
   often gains much information             concerning the legends of the people.
   Could     he   always note      down      at the     time the    information     thus
   derived, an immense          number of legends          might be preserved,       but
    during my travels in       the country both note-book and pencil had to
    be kept as much as possible out of sight.               The prying eyes of the
    king's    pages    noted every action, and rendered               caution  in this
    respect   of vital  importance.
       The Waganda legends and traditions deal with the origin of the
    tribe, with the colonisation of the country, with the prowess of
    former monarchs,        and the brave deeds of chiefs.            They depict     the
    wars in which        the country has been engaged, and many indicate
    changes which have taken place            in  the manners    and customs of the
    people.
       Apart from what         I  may call these national         traditions,  legends
    are told of gods and demons,           giants and dwarfs.        Fanciful   tales of
    plants and animals are strangely mixed up with allegories exempli
    fying   some virtue or vice.
        Some of the legends undoubtedly point to foreign origin, although
    when they were brought into the country it is impossible to say.
    The Waganda are very fond of reciting, and in this way legends
    have    been   handed down from generation to generation,                 and one

764                 Proceedings       of  the  Royal Society
notices that the same story told by an old man                   and      a young       one,
although having one and the same main idea, yet varies considerably
in detail and style.        This   is less the case when the          stories      are told
by professional story-tellers or sung by the bards.                      In    such    cases
almost identical       sequence      is followed,       the   same      sentences       and
modes    of expression being        preserved     as  accurately as       the incidents
themselves.
    The founder      of Uganda        is said to have been           Kintu, and          the
account the people give of his arrival in the country is shortly                           as
follows   : — Many    years    ago  Kintu with his wife,        one cow,        one   goat,
one sheep, one banana root, and one sweet potato,                   crossed the Nile
at   Foweira, and arrived on the borders of Victoria Nyanza.                             He
settled there,     planting his banana and sweet potato,                    which grew
 with extraordinary rapidity — in fact,            the sweet potato         grew so    fast
that the people say the tendrils             could be seen creeping along               the
ground.       His wife   bore him four children          at a  birth    each year, and
so precocious     were they that at two years of age the female children
bore sons and daughters.            The cattle likewise multiplied as rapidly.
The country in this way soon became populated,                     till   at last  Kintu
was    obliged to send many of the families away;                       he gave      each
family    a piece   of the original banana root and potato plant, and
they populated the surrounding districts.                 Kintu     appears      to have
been a      kind of priest    ; he   was very humane, and could not bear
the   sight of blood      ;   even    cattle   killed for     necessary       food were
slaughtered at some distance from his dwelling.                    As time went         on
and   age    began to tell upon the monarch, his children                   caused    him
considerable trouble.         They became drunken and quarrelsome,                    and
 even murdered one another, and at length being unable to witness
 their wickedness longer,       Kintu departed        at night-time      with his    wife,
 and their original cow, goat, sheep, banana root, and sweet potato.
    His   sons sought him three days             without    success, and then his
 eldest  son took up the reins of power.                 Tradition     says that each
 succeeding     king lived in      the hope     of one day finding           Kintu,   and
 many an expedition, instigated by various kings, searched the whole
 country through and through without                 success.     It    was    not until
 the reign of Maanda that news of                 Kintu arrived.           It  happened
thus.     A   peasant   one day, some distance from home and fatigued
by hard work, passed         the night      alone   in the   forest.      He    dreamed

                         of Edinburgh, Session 1885—86.                           765
a   dream which was          repeated    three   times,  in which   he thought      he
heard a voice directing him to go to a spot in the forest where
valuable information would he given him. On waking, after some
misgivings, he followed the directions of his               dream, and on arrival
at the place which had been indicated, he                   came upon a party of
 men with        pale faces,  in the midst of whom was seated an aged man
 ¦with a long white beard.            They were all clad in white robes.          The
 old man told          the peasant to go to the king, and        tell him    to come
 ¦with his wife and his mother to see              Kintu.    This  message he was
 to give secretly, and to strictly charge Maanda to come in secrecy.
 The peasant went upon his errand, but in order to gain admittance
 to the royal presence he "was compelled to tell the katikiro or prime
  minister that         he  had urgent       business with     the   king.    Having
  gained admittance to his majesty, whom                he found   with his mother,
  he told his tale, much to the surprise of the king who had dreamed
  that night      a strange dream     in which     he had seen the features    of this
  peasant.       The king and his mother at          once decided to go    with him,
  and they secretly left the royal palace.                 It soon became noised
   abroad that the king had gone into the forest accompanied by his
   mother and a strange man, and the katikiro who was devoted to
   his     master    cautiously   followed     them,    dreading some      treachery.
   In    course of time, the     little party arrived before Kintu, who asked
   the king why he had not followed his instructions                and come alone.
    Maanda replied that he had taken all precautions, and had repeatedly
    looked back to see that they were not followed ; but Kintu insisted
    that   a  spy was present, and stated that he saw him behind                a tree.
    The katikiro,       hearing   that he was discovered,        hereupon stepped
    forward, and Maanda in fierce anger killed him with his spear.
    At this Kintu and his company vanished, and the king, his mother,
     and    the peasant    wept and cried out for Kintu.            No answer       was
     vouchsafed     them, save the echo of their own cries.               Since then
     Kintu    has never reappeared.
         The next story illustrates       Kintu's kindness to      animals.     Kintu
     was a    hunter, and animals would often, after having been caught in
      his traps, ask for their freedom, saying to him, " You be kind to us
      in the sunshine, and we       will  be kind to you in    the rain  ;" that is to
            " You       kind to  us now that you are well off, and we
      say,          be                                                         will  he
      kind to you when you are         in trouble," and     he often granted their

 766                      Proceedings           of tlie Royal Society
 request.      One day, on returning                  from a hunting               expedition,          he
 found      that his cattle had been carried away.                            He     searched          for
 them in vain,          till   at last he met a man who told                 him that the            gods
 came down from heaven                     and carried them away.              Thereupon Kintu
 went up to heaven and demanded his cattle, which the gods                                expressed
their willingness              to restore      after he had performed               certain         feats.
Enough        food to satisfy fifty or sixty men was placed before                                  him,
and he was ordered to consume it all.                      While debating with                 himself
 how he should accomplish this impossible task,                              a   number of           rats,
whose lives he had spared                      on earth, appeared,          and soon consumed
the food.          Overjoyed, he took the empty basket to the gods,                                  who
then showed him a deep well, and told him to fill a jug from                                    it,   but
no rope was supplied him.                      A   number of swallows then                appeared,
and taking the pitcher from him flew with                              it   down the well,            and
soon returned        with       it    filled with water.        When he took              it   to the
gods, they led him to              a   vast plain, and showed him immense                       herds
of cattle grazing.             His own         were amongst        them they said, and               also
added       that   if    he     could      distinguish   them without              mistake,         they
would restore them, but                if   he made one slip he should forfeit them.
A     bee now aided him           ;   it   flew to him, and said, "       I      know which           are
your cattle, and     Iwill go before and hover over each one." This
it   did, thus enabling Kintu to succeed in this task likewise, and he
was then permitted to return to earth, taking his cattle with him.
     An ancient warrior named Kibaga                     is   said to have          possessed        the
power of flying.               This power was         made     use of by his king during
his wars with            the Wanyoro.               Kibaga soaring through                the skies
detected     their ambuscades              ;   he also destroyed great numbers                 of    the
enemy by dropping rocks upon them.                         One day Kibaga             saw among
                                     women          maiden passing fair.             Smitten          by
the    captive Wanyoro                          a
her charms, he begged her from the king                       as   a   reward for his      services.
His request was           acceded to, but the          king warned him not                to   reveal
the secret of his powers to his wife.                     For      a    considerable       time       he
managed      to keep his own council, but his wife, being surprised at his
sudden disappearances                and as sudden return, at length kept                       strict
watch upon him, and solved the mystery.                            She was not long in          com
municating her discovery to her tribe, who at once placed                                   archers
on the summit of their highest hills, and soon Kibaga was shot,                                   and
was found lifeless, entangled                  in the branches of        a   tall tree.

                         of Edinburgh, Session 1885-8G.                                 7G7
    In the       reign of Chabugu war was declared                 against    the Wasoga
for the first time. On the Waganda assembling to cross the Nile,
the Wasoga mocked and defied them, whereupon a mighty chief,
Wakinguru           by name, requested        permission to cross the river and
attack the enemy single-handed. He was an immense                                man, and
his shield was so heavy that it required two ordinary men                        to lift it.
Taking       this with him and        a large     bundle of spears, he challenged
the Wasoga           one and   all  to combat.         They rushed forward to the
 attack, but so great was his strength that one man after another fell
 pierced by his spears before they could get near enough to injure
 him. He fought all day, slaying 600 men, and at night lie recrossed
 the   Nile,    repeating this exploit        on two succeeding days, when the
 Wasoga acknowledged their             defeat and tendered their submission.
      As   before stated, the graves of the former kings are kept in good
  order, this being considered            a religious      duty,     as  after death the
  Waganda monarchs          are looked upon as semi-gods.
      Astronomy. — The length of          the Waganda year is six months, this
  year and     the lunar month        being the only divisions             of time.     The
  first month in      the year is the time at which they sow their seed, and
  is therefore     called  " the   month for sowing food."                The others are
  called the "months for eating food."                 When the new moon is first
   seen   there are great rejoicings, feastings, and dancing, but this is
   more noticed at the capital than elsewhere, and                 I  cannot help think
   ing that the custom        has been     introduced       by the Arabs,       it may    be
   many years ago, notwithstanding             the fact that the people profess to
   be  able to manufacture charms more successfully at this period than
   at any other.       With this exception        there are no set festivals.           The
   day is divided by the height of the sun in the heavens.                      The stars,
   of which many have names, are said to be inhabited by superhuman
   beings, who are thought to be very tall and powerful.
      Arithimtk. — Native       names are given to numbers up to thousands,
    and the    Waganda      are very     found of counting.             The root of all
    multiples of 10 is kumi (10),           e.g.,   kikumi      is  100,   lukumi,    1000.
    They are expert in mental arithmetic, which is required in mweso,
    a game    of which they are very fond             {see  Games).        Notwithstand
    ing this aptitude, they seem to need aids to the memory of figures,
    for when sent for a definite number of men, cattle, &c, they use
    either twigs, stones, or    a  knotted rope       as   tallies.     No written     signs

for numbers are employed, but wood is at times notched to represent
them.        Short notches stand for units, longer ones for tens and still
longer for hundreds.               In driving     a bargain      it is not possible to
cheat them,       and this the Arab traders know full well.                      I  have often
tested their knowledge in reckoning, and rarely detected                              them in      a
mistake.        When trying         to make me understand            numbers they             used
their fingers, sticks, or lines drawn on the ground to make it                               clear
what they meant.               So fond of counting are they that                  they    always
count each string of cowries used as money,                       also    the       number        of
beads      used   in making        necklaces,   &c, and should          a     book     be given
 them the first thing they do            with it   is to count its pages.
    Language.      — The      language    spoken in Uganda is very pure, having
but    a    small admixture          of Suaheli and Arabic            terms,        which      are
 chiefly names of articles of trade.                 The language,        which is         called
 Luganda is one of the great Bantu family, and is very rich in words.
 It  has ten classes         of nouns, the noun being the most important
 part of speech.           Grammatical        inflexions     are formed           by   prefixes.
 For    instance,
                     " lungi,"      is good ;   " muntu mulungi,"              a   good    man ;
 "
    Waganda walungi," good               Waganda     ;
                                                        " miti mulungi," good              trees;
 " nyumba nungi,"             a good    house; " toki dungi,"           a good banana;
 " matoki malungi," good               bananas.       Prefixes added to the               verbs,
 also indicate      their person        and tense.       The inflections           of the    pro
 nouns, adjectives, and verbs vary according to the class of the govern
 ing noun.         Adjectives       agree with the substantive            in number          and
 case,   and always follow           the noun.       As  regards numerals, there              are
 words to express all numbers up to thousands.                       There       are personal,
  possessive, relative, demonstrative and interrogative pronouns.                         There
 are several     forms of verbs.
    The following short vocabulary will give an idea of the                           character
 of the language : —

      The    recent   extensive therapeutic use      of cocain     has    naturally
   aroused great interest with regard to its chemical constitution.               As
   is well known, when heated        with dilute mineral      acids,  it  takes   up
   two molecules of water, and becomes decomposed              into benzoic acid,
  methyl alcohol, and another alkaloid         ecgonin.     When     cocain,   how
   ever,   is simply heated     in watery solution for      some hours, a less
   complete decomposition ensues, the solution          depositing on evapora
   tion a crystalline     substance,  which is benzoylecgonin.           This   sub

 772                   Proceedings        of  the  Boyal Sockty
 stance   has     been    studied chemically         by Dr Paul (P/iarm.              Jour.,
 Oct.   17,   1885,    and     March      27,  1886), by Merck and by               Skraop
 {Sitzungsbericlrfe      der Wiener Akad.,            1885). The following short
 description      is taken mainly           from   Paul's papers on the subject.
 Benzoylecgonin represents            cocain, from which        a  methyl group (CH3)
 has been removed and replaced by hydrogen (H), thus —
                                     3
 On heating cocain in         a closed     tube with about twenty parts of             water
and then evaporating the liquid, benzoylecgonin                         crystallises      out
in   needles, closely resembling            those   of ammonium oxalate.               It   is
soluble in water, has         a neutral reaction,       a  bitter taste, and forms           a
crystallisable salt with hydrochloric              acid.     Paul points out        that it
may easily be produced in the process                 for the extraction of          cocain
from the coca leaves.           It  was    with benzoylecgonin obtained in               this
way that my experiments were carried out, and                     I am much     indebted
to  Mr E. M. Holmes who procured it for                   me.
                                   Action on Frogs.
    Winter    frogs of both species         — Rana temporaria and R.            escuhnta
— were    used.
    When benzoylecgonin dissolved in water is injected                        under the
skin of the back, the effects produced depend largely on the                        size of
the frog and of the dose.              Doses under           grain had no       apparent
effect.    If  55 to         grain be administered to a medium-sized frog,
there occur symptoms of slight muscular stiffness, and on the third
or even fourth day afterwards a very decided increase in the skin
reflexes.     AVith     large   frogs the      effect  of such       a dose   is hardly
apparent.       If        to  § grain (0'006        to 0-02     grm.) be given,          the
animal is much more decidedly affected,                   but the degree varies           in
individual      frogs, the smaller dose having              in some cases an         equal
or even     greater    effect than the larger.            After administration          the
frog remains for half an hour or more apparently                       unaffected,      and
moves     about     as    usuaL        It   then    becomes      quieter,    and    shows
great disinclination        to move      spontaneously, but         if irritated   jumps

                            of Edinburgh, Session 1885-86.                            773
readily        enough.        At this period or later the       character   of its jump
"becomes altered          ; there     is a very decided stiffness in its movements,
 and. when it jumps it lands rather heavily                    on its belly, the hind
 legs being          somewhat        straggling.   The unwillingness      to move       in
  creases, and the frog, when irritated, walks rather than jumps.                        In
  walking the gait is peculiar, the limbs being stiff                 and almost     fully
  extended.          The pupil is always dilated either at this stage or later.
  In      about     eighteen     to twenty-four hours after administration             the
   muscles      are  still in    the same condition, but the reflex         excitability
   bas in the interval         become very much increased.           The extent of the
   increase varies, the animal being in some               cases   thrown into    a state
   of violent tonic       spasm, exactly resembling that induced by strychnia,
   and in other         cases     simply    showing greatly exaggerated         reflexes.
    When the       reflexes are only slightly affected        respiration and circula
    tion   go on as usual.
         This condition      lasts one or two days, the state of greatly increased
    reflex excitability gradually passing off, but the skin reflexes remain
    exaggerated for one or two days longer,             at the end of which time
    the muscular stiffness          has also disappeared,   and the frog returns to
     its normal condition.             The time required for complete          recovery
     varies in different frogs.
         Doses of £ to     1  grain (0*032 to 0-064 grm.) always proved fatal.
     Shortly after the injection the animal became very dull and un
     willing to move.         It   could still jump, and did so      as previously de
     scribed, but in a more pronounced manner.               In about eighteen hours
     tetanus supervened,         lasting until    death  from general       exhaustion
      occurred, usually about the third          day.   Eespiration goes on inter
      mittently, and the heart         continues to beat until the exhaustion is
      very marked.
         Post-mortem     Appearances.      — Heart in   diastole   and not excitable
      by electric stimuli.        Ventricle is acid in reaction, and usually has a
      peculiar shrunken look.
         The veins are filled       with  venous blood, and the viscera generally
      are very congested.
         The skeletal muscles at the point of injection did not contract               to
      electric stimuli.     The other muscles generally contracted at 60 to 70
       mm. (Du   Bois Reymond induction apparatus and one Daniel's cell),
       and had a  strongly acid reaction.

774                     Proceedings      of  the  Royal Society
    The sciatic nerves          apparently retained their normal          excitability
or nearly      so.
    With     very large doses, such as 2 to 3 grains, the           injection had      to
be made at several points, owing to the amount of fluid.                   The   poison
takes effect      in  a  few minutes, the frog gradually becoming more               and
more paralysed.           Respiration    ceases,  and it lies in whatever position
it  may be placed.          The heart is also arrested, and death occurs           gene
rally without any symptom of increased reflex excitability.
    When benzoylecgonin              is given     by the mouth, both       species of
frog recover after one grain.              It  is more   slowly absorbed, and the
effects last longer than when given hypodermically.                      When it        is
injected into the anterior abdominal vein, the symptoms are also
similar.
    Division of       the spinal    cord at the medulla has no effect on             the
convulsions.
    Ligature of one iliac artery before administration does not exclude
the corresponding leg from the tetanus,               while division of one sciatic
nerve causes a cessation          of the spasms in the same limb.
     If  the brain be destroyed,         the tetanic stage comes on earlier and
 with smaller doses than in the uninjured animal.
    The administration of curara prevents or stops                 the convulsions.
 Chloroform        abolishes them        also, but   they gradually return as the
effects of the anaesthetic         wear off.
    From      the    foregoing     general    description    it is evident that     the
 action of benzoylecgonin            is very similar to that of caffein on frog-.
 The muscular and central nervous systems                    are  primarily  affected,
 the heart suffering less markedly while the peripheral nerves remain
 apparently untouched.
                       Action on the Individual Systems.
     Heart and Circulation. — If            the excised    heart be placed in      a 1
 per cent, solution        made    with   f  per cent, salt solution, there occurs
 at once an increase          in the number of         beats   and a more     marked
 systole.     The increa?ed rate is maintained for 10 to 15 minutes,              after
  which it slowly falls        ; the heart finally stopping in diastole.         Satu
  rated solutions rapidly         killed   the heart.
      To observe the action on the heart in situ, the frog was fastened
 on    its back in the ordinary way, the rate determined, and the

                            of Edinburgh, Session 1885-86.                           775
alkaloid,       then    injected into the posterior lymph sac.              Curara was
sometimes          used.
    Doses       of  J to J grain caused       very quickly a slight increase in rate
(2 to 4       heats per minute), which lasted for about an hour, the heart
then      returning to its original condition.             During the increase the
systole      was very marked, while the pause            in diastole was appreciably
shorter than in the normal frog.
     Larger doses (| to 1 grain) have a              much more decided effect both
 on the rate and rhythm of the heart.                  The rate increases almost       at
 once 4 to       6 beats     per   minute, the systolic contraction becomes very
 decided,      while the pause in diastole is hardly perceptible.
      The    increase     in rate passes off in    a varying time and is succeeded
 by a slight fall, the systole, however, still remaining marked. After
  an hour or thereabouts, the heart in some cases was observed to
  make long        pauses in diastole, often stopping for some seconds, and
  then going       on regularly for a few minutes, when another pause takes
  place.      There is some resemblance           to a digitalis   heart in the inten
   sity of the systolic contraction and the marked manner in which
   bundles of the muscular fibres stand out during it In one case
   also   the base contracted           before   the apex,    giving    the  latter the
   appearance of pouching.
       The heart     stops    in  diastole.    With very   large   doses the heart     is
   rapidly    enfeebled.
       Blood-Vessels.      — Under the         microscope    no    change    could    be
    observed in the calibre of the blood-vessels           of the web.
       Nervous      System   — Brain. — It is difficult to       decide   whether the
    brain is stimulated         or not.     After medium     doses restlessness    gene
    rally lasted for a longer time than the                pain of injection      could
    account for.
       Spinal Cord. — The        late stage at which spinal symptoms supervene
    can only be accounted           for on the hypothesis that the alkaloid is
    at once absorbed       by the muscles.       The results of the direct applica
    tion of solutions of benzoylecgonin to the exposed spinal cord go far
    to prove this.       In the experiments       made on this point both species
    of frog were used.
       The posterior portions of         one or two vertebra;     were removed     with
    almost  no bleeding, and the animal allowed to rest quietly until it
    had recovered      from the effects of the operation.           Some drops of a

776                    Proceedings      of  the  Royal Society
cold saturated       solution of benzoylecgonin were then applied to                  the
exposed cord.         In  a few minutes the reflexes became more sensitive,
and    within half     an hour a slight touch brought on a            tetanic    spasm.
Spontaneous spasm also occurred,               the tetanus ultimately        becoming
continuous, and lasting            for two or three days, when           death      from
exhaustion took place.
    If a supersaturated      solution were used, there were immediate             symp
toms of great irritation followed by a few tetanic spasms.                   The     cord
became quite paralysed,          and the animal lay flaccid and motionless.
    Investigation       by Tiirck's    method showed no change          in the    reflex
period during the first day.              On the second day spasm was invari
ably present.
    Motor      Nerves.   — The     motor     nerves   are   practically    unaffected.
This    was ascertained       by tying one iliac artery, the sciatic             nerves
were     then divided high up, and their excitability               tested   with     the
Du Bois Eeymond coil.             The benzoylecgonin was then administered,
and the nerves tested from time to time.
     Immersion       of the sciatic nerve        in  a weak solution      made with
normal saline does not appear to injure its conductility.
     Sensory Nerves.      — These     are also     unaffected.    Neither     paiuting
the skin with         a saturated    solution nor subcutaneous injection pro
 duced any local anaesthetic effect.
     Striped Muscle. — The action on striped muscle is not nearly                      so
 violent    as  that of caffein is described to be.          In all my   experiments
 curarised frogs were used, so           as  to exclude the motor nervea.           If {
 grain or more dissolved in           a little water   be injected under the skin,
 the muscles in the immediate neighbourhood retain their contractil
 ity very little impaired during the whole day, but next morning                   they
 arc quite inexcitable.         The muscles at     a distance are unaffected     unless
 the dose be very large.          If  the forearm be the seat of injection,       gene
 rally all the muscles         there    are found dead      after about twenty-four
 hours    ; but   if  a more    muscular part, such as the thigh, be          selected,
 all the muscles         may retain their contractility although more            or less
 impaired.        In   the case of caffein, this condition has been ascribed
  to rigor mortis being induced.
      Another method of investigation was also adopted.                   In a deeply
  curarised frog the coccygeal region was exposed by reflecting the
 skin. The muscles on one side of the coccyx were kept moist with

                      of Edinburgh, Session 1885—86.                                777
saturated solution of benzoylecgonin in normal saline, while those on
the other     side   were    kept moist with normal salt solution.                  The
former    lost their excitability       to    electric   stimuli very much more
rapidly than     the latter.
    Dr Ashdown examined for           me the effect on the histological struc
ture of muscle.       When the sartorius is teased in a saturated solution
of benzoylecgonin made with aqueous humour, the fibres swell up.
There is a tendency to early development of longitudinal striation,
and the nuclei appear          somewhat       early.     Transverse cleavage very
readily    occurs.    After this     the    fibres    become      somewhat rapidly
disintegrated.       There is no detachment of the sarcolemma.
                             Action on Mammalia.
    Mammals are by no means susceptible to the action of benzoylec
gonin, and want of material necessarily             made my experiments few           in
number.
    A  rabbit which got 24 grs. subcutaneously showed                   no symptoms
except a very depressed          appearance       and a great disinclination          to
move.      Next day it    had diarrhoea.
    On cats a very decided          effect was produced,          provided the dose
 were large enough.        Two experimente          were   made —
    Experiment I. — Cat,       3 lb. 12 oz., received         at 11.5, 15 grs. hypo-
 dermically.
    11.45.  — Reflexes very much           exaggerated.         Irritation   causes    a
spasmodic     start.    Animal is very timorous            ;  cowers  in   a corner of
 the cage, and seems very much disinclined to move.
    12.50.  — Reflexes same. Gait is rather stiff.
    2.20. — Reflexes less marked. Pupils are very dilated.
    The reflex excitability       gradually diminished,           but   the pupil re
 mained dilated all afternoon.           At    6  p.m.  it   was apparently normal,
                                                                •
 but during the night had very severe diarrhoea.
    Experiment      II. — Same     cat received       six days later 25 grs. sub
 cutaneously    at 12.5     p.m.    Shortly after it vomited           several   times,
 and was severely      purged and salivated.            The reflexes were greatly
 increased, and the animal trembled continuously.
    1.32. — Was      seized   with    a  violent tetanic spasm            lasting   one
 minute.     After this it lay on its side breathing slowly                  and   in  a
 laboured   manner.      The slightest irritation brought on a spasm.

778                  Proceedings      of  the Boycd Society
    During the next hour the animal had                a succession    of tonic    and
clonic spasms, which brought on a condition of complete exhaustion,
in which it       was    insensitive to external stimuli.          The pupil        was
fully dilated      from      an  early period         Eespiration     became      very
irregular and slow; the heart's action was only slightly affected.
    Death     from general        exhaustion,      with failure    of   respiration,
occurred at 6.15        p.m.     The rigor mortis came on very early, and
was      very marked.          Blood    was     venous,    and   the large       veins
congested.       Ventricles     were   both     empty.    The viscera,     generally
speaking, were deeply congested.
     The small intestine presented          a  remarkable appearance.          It  was
 firmly contracted,     and had a moniliform           appearance,    owing to      the
 contraction being more intense at some places than at others.                       It
 was very anaemic, the lumen was occluded, and all the parasites had
 been expelled.       The bladder was also firmly contracted and empty.
     The muscles and sciatic nerves did not respond to the interrupted
 current.
     The unwillingness to move, and the contracted state of the small
 intestine and bladder, show that both the voluntary and involuntary
 muscles are profoundly affected, while the spinal symptoms are also
 of the most marked character.             The violent diarrhoea and vomiting
 are no doubt due to the increased            intestinal peristalsis.
     A   much more extended investigation             than  I have   yet been    able
 to make      would be necessary        to determine      the   exact relationship
 between     the dose and        the degree in which different systems             are
 affected
     In conclusion, it        may   be interesting     to  point out shortly       the
  chief differences    between     the action of cocain      and benzoylecgonin.
  In frogs    cocain   in very small       doses   (J  mgrm.) produces       a short
  stage of excitement followed by general             paralysis, while with larger
  doses paralysis supervenes         almost at once, accompanied          by failure
  of the heart and respiration.             No    tetanus   is induced,     and    the
  striped muscles are unaffected.           One of the most prominent         actions
  of cocain   — viz., paralysis of sensory         nerves — is quite    absent with
  benzoylecgonin,     as   is also paralysis of motor nerves.
      In  the case of mammalia the general action is           strikingly  different.
  The convulsions produced by cocain are dyspnceic                   from paralysis
  of the respiratory centre, and come on almost immediately with                     a

                                 of Edinburgh, Session 1885-SC.
comparatively small doso (0-04) in cats; with benzoylecgonin the
convulsions are spinal in origin, and come on later. Local applica
tion of             benzoylecgonin to the eye has no effect on the pupil, while
cocain          dilates it markedly.
   I     have         to express my thanks to Professor                         T. It. Fraser for much
valuable             criticism and advice while carrying on the investigation.
                     3.    Laws of Solution.                By William Durham.
    In        my paper           on    "Chemical Affinity                  and Solution,"    read before
the Royal Society of Edinburgh on 16th February                                             last,    I    gave
 some general proofs of                     the       correctness          of my theory of solution,
 taken from Thomsen's                    researches        on thermo-chemistry, as given in
 Muir         and Wilson's             book on that subject.                    In   the present paper       I
 propose            to extend these proofs, and to show the laws of solution, so
 far at         least      as   chlorides, bromides,                 and    iodides are concerned.           I
 have verified              these laws in the case of many sulphates,                       and     have no
 doubt they               govern   all cases of solution.                  My theory is simply this,
 " Solution              is due to the chemical affinities of the                     constituent atoms
 or elements of the body dissolved for the constituent atoms of the
 solvent."                For   instance,     BaCl2 in water is due
                                             the       solubility          of
 mainly to the affinity of the Ba of the salt for the O of the water,
  and of the CI of the salt for the                       H of           the water, and     the degree of
  solubility         depends       on the relation between these affinities.                        Now it
  can be shown, from Thomson's researches, that the heats                                     of solution
  in water          of    chlorides,   bromides, and iodides vary directly —
       1st,     As    the affinity (as measured by heat                         of combination) of the
                positive element for              0    varies    ;
       2nd, As the affinity              (as measured            by heat of combination) of the
                negative element            for    H    varies       ;
  and inversely —
       As     the affinity (as measured by heat of combination) between the
                positive and negative elements of the salt varies.
  That        is,   the greater affinity the positive element                         has for O, and the
  greater affinity the negative                    element           has for     H,   the greater    is   the

780                  Proceedings        of    the    Royal Society
heat of solution,       and the greater         the affinity between the positive
and   negative elements           the less is the heat of solution.                               Whether
the quantity of salt dissolved varies                   exactly at same rate, or only
proportionately,        I    am   not yet in a position                    to state,          but it           is
generally true that the greater               the heat of solution the greater                                 is
the amount of salt dissolved in similar compounds.                                 The following
examples     illustrate the laws just         stated—

 these salts being too great in comparison with                   above.       It    is appa
 rently proportional, however.
    It  is pointed out in Muir and Wilson's book that between                                the
 heats    of formation of soluble chlorides, bromides, and iodides in
 water, there       is a constant difference,       no matter what the positive
 element is.        Thus we   have —
            Salt.          Heat of Formation.           Salt.            Heat of Formation.

    Now,  the    reason   of this is perfectly obvious.            It  is due to the
 laws of solution.       An}' variation from the above differences on the
 heats of formation of the anhydrous salt is at once counterbalanced
 by the heat of solution, which varies inversely.                     The following
 example   will   make this evident       : —

and so on in other cases.
   In  my last paper      I  pointed out that the differences           in the    heats
of formation      of HC1,      HBr, and        HI   are exactly proportioned in
versely to the differences        of the atomic weights of CI, Br, and                L
On further      consideration,     I  am convinced the law obtains               in all
compounds of these elements, and the different proportion                   found in
solutions is due to the modifying               action of the affinity of these
elements   for the O of the water, and in the case of solid compounds
to another cause.        This, however, with many other points,                I  leave
for further consideration.
                    Note    to Paper    on Laws      of Solution.
   There is another way of putting the matter, which not only con
firms the foregoing laws, but also shows the conditions which deter
mine the heats of solution whether positive or negative.                  The    heats
of solution are simply balances of transactions between the elements
of the body dissolved and the elements of the solvent                   The follow
ing examples     will illustrate this : —

We thus       see    that on solution tho salt and water are virtually
though not actually decomposed,                and built up again           into another
system in which        all the affinities of the constituent            elements         take
part.     When there is no balance            of affinities on either side there is
no heat of solution, and the salt is insoluble.                   "When      the sum of
the heats of formation of the salt and of the water is greater than
the sum of the heats          of formation of the oxide, the acid and of
neutralisation, then the heat of solution of the salt is minus — that
is,   there   is   absorption of heat,        and the temperature            is   lowered.
The     above conditions hold good whether the oxide                   is   insoluble or
not, and indeed when both oxide and salt are insoluble.

     The Keith Prize for 1883-85 was presented to John Aitken, Esq.,
  Darroch, for his paper " On the Formation of Small Clear Spaces in
  Dusty Air," and for previous papers on Atmospheric Phenomena,
  after the following statement hy Mr Buchan           : —
     One of the earliest of Mr Aitken's communications to the Society,
  and certainly one of the most valuable, is that on          " Dust, Fogs, and
  Clouds," in voL xxx. of our Transactions.              The discovery that     a
  solid nucleus is necessary       for the condensation of water-vapour is
  one of the most important contributions, alike to pure and to applied
 science, which has been made in recent years.            Mr Aitken    made the
 discovery independently      ;   but he had been to      a certain extent anti
 cipated by Coulier, who, however,           by a strange want of judgment,
 withdrew his statements         not long after they had been published.
 The paper referred to, in intimating the award of the prize,          " On the
 Formation of Small Clear Spaces in Dusty Air," is in continuation
 of the same subject.
    The more important of his other contributions to Meteorology are
his papers " On Thermometer Screens," read in June 1884.                 Owing
 to the extreme    difficulty of making observations          of the true tem
perature    of the    air  at    any given instant,       meteorologists have
contented    themselves   with uniformity in the methods of observing.
In this   paper  Mr Aitken has, by the novel appliances for observa
tion introduced by him, made a distinct advance                towards making
observations    of atmospheric      temperature   more approximately correct
than those hitherto made       ;  and, it may be added, that the ultimate
solution of the problem is likely to be reached on the lines he has
thus indicated.

Tables requisite therefor;"       and, generally, for his recalculation of
Logarithms      both of Numbers and of Trigonometrical              Eatios, after
the following statement by the Hon. Lord Maclaren                : —
    The Society is aware      that, by the terms of its foundation, the
jVIakdougall-Brisbane Prize may be awarded either iqr contributions
to the Society's publications, or for          services    rendered    to science
outside the work of the Royal Society.
    In   awarding this prize to     Dr Edward Sang, both requisites             are
fulfilled  ; because we make     this award in recognition of the valuable,
original, and responsible work on which            Dr Sang     has been engaged
 for many     years, and which has been        from time to time communi
 cated to the Society,    I mean    the recalculation      of the logarithms of
 numbers and of trigonometrical ratios.          The latest of     Dr Sang's con
tributions on this subject is      the paper     read   in  1 884, entitled
                                                                              " On
 the Need for Decimal Subdivisions in Astronomy and Navigation,
 and on Tables requisite therefor."
     More than fifty years have elapsed since         Dr Sang    began to take a
 part in the work of mathematical and physical investigation; and
 from the year 1857 to the present time he has been a constant
 contributor to the Transactions and Proceedings of the Royal Society
 of Edinburgh.       His papers cover a wide range of inquiry,          embracing
 various branches of pure mathematics,         mechanics,     and optics,   as well
 as the application of these sciences to practical astronomy, chronc-
 metry, and naval architecture.        I must,   however, in this brief notice
 of the work of     Dr  Sang, confine myself to the subject immediately
 in hand.
     I  begin with    one  fact,  which    I  state on the authority        of the
 Encyclopaedia Britannica, and which         I think demonstrates       the utility
 and value of the investigations for which this prize is awarded.                 It
 is this, that until Dr Sang undertook the labour of independent
 computation      of the logarithmic     tables,    all the    published    tables,
 English and foreign, were derived from            one and the same source,
 viz., from the tables which were compiled more than two centuries
 ago,   partly   by Briggs, and partly       by    the Dutch       mathematician
 Vlacq.      If Dr  Sang had done nothing more than verify their results
  by independent computation, he would have rendered                   a valuable
  service to mathematical science.      But Vlacq's     tables of the logarithms
     VOL.  XIIL                                                        3 P

  786                 Proceedings      of the  Royal Society
  of numbers were computed only for numbers below 100,000,                   and to
  fourteen places of decimals.          Dr Sang, in the tables first    communi
  cated   to this Society in 1872,         extended the tables     as  far   as the
  number 200,000, and his logarithms were computed to fifteen places
  of decimals.    In his later work, communicated to the Society in 188 4,
  the tables are brought down to the number 370,000, and, by                adding
  to each of the logarithms        already computed the log. of 2 or         3, the
  tables can be completed to 1,110,000.
   • In order that his results should be entirely independent of                  the
  work of previous computers, Dr Sang began by computing                         the
 logarithms of all the prime numbers from zero to 2000 (and even
 tually from zero to 10,000) to twenty-eight places of decimals, by
 a   method not known in Vlacq's time, founded on the series for                 the
                    1 4- x
 expression    log.
     From the logarithms thus obtained, and their multiples and pro
 ducts, the intermediate quantities were derived (as he explains in his
 paper in the 26th volume of the Transactions, 1872), by means of a
 system of interpolation, which was ascertained         to give accurate results
 to the fifteenth figure.
     The   recalculation    of   the tables of logarithms       of the trigono
 metrical functions        was performed     with equal    care, and by strictly
 accurate    methods.      These were also communicated to this Society
 by papers read in the years           1877   and 1878,    and printed in      the
 Proceedings.       Further    tables,   adapted to the decimal division         of
 the circle, were communicated in 1884.
     Dr  Saug's logarithms of numbers,        as is well known,   are published
 in   the form of seven-place       tables.   It  is to be regretted    that the
fifteen-place tables       have not been      printed   and published.       It   is
certainly desirable that such a work should be accessible in            a printed
form in our public libraries.           Pending    the realisation of this    pro
ject, it may be hoped that the MS. volumes (which the Fellows had
an opportunity of seeing two years ago) may in some way be made
available to science.
     Even   more    valuable    in its immediate results would            be   the
publication of the million table carried to seven or eight             places of
decimals.      This could      be   accomplished in      two   volumes of      the
ordinary size, and ought to be undertaken at the public             expense.      I

                     of Edinburgh, Session 1885-86.                          787
believe there is but one opinion         as  to the very great     accuracy and
trustworthiness     of  Dr  Bang's   tables.    The methods which he used
ensured the detection of errors, whether of computation or of tran
scription,    with almost absolute certainty.           Such results,     I  need
hardly    say, could not be attained without the expenditure           of labour,
perseverance,     and unremitting attention, in a degree exceeding            that
required by almost any other human undertaking.                   No  considera
tions, save zeal for the advancement of science and a benevolent
desire to lighten the labour of future computers,          could have induced
 Dr Sang     to undertake such a gigantic task, or have sustained him
 through the wearisome mass of mechanical detail which overlaid the
 more interesting parts of his occupation.
     I may   conclude with a remark on the subject of            Dr Bang's last
 communication       to   the Society on this         subject, — the paper on
 decimal subdivisions of the circle.           Although the author       has   in a
 manner pledged himself to the system              of decimal division of the
  quadrant in the elaborate      table of sines which he has constructed
  on that basis, he is willing to allow that there may be some good
  in other  methods,    and, indeed,   indicates that he does not view with
  disfavour    the rival proposition of the decimal subdivision             of the
  degree.
     So far as the business of astronomical computation is concerned,
  it really makes no difference whether the circle is to be divided into
  1000 equal parts, into 360 degrees, or into 24 hours.            But the    sexa
  gesimal division of the hour and the degree into minutes and seconds
  is  a real disadvantage,    increasing at once the labour of reduction,
  and the risk of making mistakes in readings.                 If  the degree be
  selected as the    unit of angular      measure, and no doubt       it is a very
  convenient unit, undoubtedly the fractional parts of this unit ought
  to be expressed as decimals of a degree.         Apparently the only reason
   for the non-adoption of this         most   desirable reform is the want of
   convenient logarithmic tables adapted to the decimal subdivision               of
   the degree.     The quantities corresponding to tenths and hundredths
   of a degree (being 6' and 36" respectively) can be taken directly from
   existing tables,   but the intermediate numbers to thousandths of a
   degree, or 3*6, must be got by interpolation.          It is to be hoped that
   Dr   Sang"s   suggestions   on  this subject will      not be lost sight of,
   because the publication      of decimal trigonometrial tables, based on

 788                 Proceedings     of  the  Royal Society
 the degree as unit of angular measure, would be a real service                    to
 science.

    After many     years of successful exploration       in the Lowlands        and
Southern      Uplands    of Scotland, he was deputed to map out the
geology    of the north-west       Highlands,    a region showing the most
involved and puzzling structure, and one which had been variously
interpreted by almost every geologist who has traversed it.                In   due
time, however,       Mr Peach, in concert with his             colleague    Mr J.
Home, succeeded in bringing order out of chaos; and now that                  bone
of contention, over which geologists have worried for more than                   a
generation,     has been removed.        Only  those   who know the       physical
labour entailed in walking and climbing daily for months over                 such
a  country, and the enormous difficulty involved in working out                 the
structure of     a  mountainous region, composed          of highly    contorted,
inverted,     fractured, and metamorphosed rocks, which                seldom    or
never show any trace          of organic remains,      can possibly appreciate
the   endurance and the skill which            Mr Peach and his         colleague
brought to bear upon their work.               But Mr Peach       is  not only     a
highly-trained      and skilled geologist,      he   is also an accomplished
palaeontologist.      He inherits his father's inevitable       eye.     If fossils
 occur in any given series       of rocks, you may be sure they will            not
 escape our friend.      And he has thus enriched Scottish geology with
                       " finds."    And, allow me to remark, there is more
 many remarkable
 skill required to discover fossils than some may be apt to sup
 pose.    It   is not mere     haphazard      work.    The   skilled   discoverer
 knows exactly what rocks to search and how to search them,                    just
as a good     angler knows where         to  throw his bait with       successful
results.     Many geologists     can  find fossils, but only a very       few can

describe     them, and amongst        the latter  Mr Peach holds    an honourable
and      prominent    position.    I need    only refer to his papers contributed
within the last few years to the Transactions of this Society. Thus
in his paper, " On some new Crustaceans from the Lower Carboni
ferous      Rocks of Eskdale       and Liddesdale," he has described several
phyllopods and decapods which are new to science; while, in later
 papers, he has added to the number of these crustaceans, and has
 introduced us to several new species of fossil scorpions from the
 Carboniferous       rocks, and some fossil myriapods from the Old             Red
  Sandstone of Forfarshire.        All   these papers are illustrated by beautiful
  drawings, for Mr Peach, like Dr Traquair and Mr Kidston, of whose
  labours Scottish geologists are so justly proud, is an admirable
  draughtsman.         I may   add that, while most of       Mr Peach's work    has
   been done in connection with the Geological Survey,                  he has yet
   accomplished     a great deal outside of his official labours.        Numerous
   papers read before the Geological Society of London and the Royal
   Physical    Society, several      of them written     in conjunction with his
   colleague Mr    J.   Home, testify to his abundant Zealand enthusiasm,
    and   have  greatly increased       his scientific reputation.     One of the
   latest of these   joint-papers,
                                       " The Old Red Volcanic Rocks of Shet
    land," which    appears   in the current volume of        the Transactions   of
    this Society,  is   a  masterly exposition of the igneous          geology and
    petrology of Ultima Thule.           In Mr Peach    we recognise one who has
    not only maintained but         increased    the reputation of the Scottish
    school of geology,      and   the present      award of the Neill Prize can
     hardly be more gratifying to him than it is to all his fellow-workers
     in Scotland.

2.    On the Tidal Variation                 of Salinity and Temperature in
        the Estuary of the Forth.                 By Hugh Robert Mill, D.Sc.,
        and J. T. Morrison, M.A., of the Scottish Marine Station.
        (Plate    XXVIII.)
    The observations which were described in papers read                     by one of
us to this Society         in January and April 1885,* and others since
made, though as          yet unpublished, serve to establish the condition of
the    Firth of Forth in its            seaward     reaches as to salinity    and tem
perature.       Between Queensferry and the Isle of May the increase
in salinity, and the increase             or decrease of temperature,        are   slight
and gradual; there          is  little  difference     between   bottom and surface,
and tidal effects are insignificant.              Between Queensferry and Alloa,
on the other hand, the change               in salinity per mile is much        greater,
and the tidal range is very considerable.                  The isolated observations
which had been made in this region, and especially about Kincar
dine, seemed to indicate that the same regime                     held there   as in  the
estuary of the       Spey,f only the         effects were    on  a reduced   scale    and
somewhat        modified.
     It was necessary to test the applicability               of this theory, and we
lately spent a week at Kincardine for this purpose, working from
the sailing-boat "Paracelsus
                                         " between
                                                        Kincardine and Cambus.
     The words river, estuary, firth, are used with considerable latitude,
 and    it   is advisable in        considering salinity       to employ them with
 precisely     definite meanings.          This cannot     be very easily done if the
 terms be used        in  reference      to the geographical position of a river-
 system ;      but,   if  we     may    suppose      that the river proper may          be
 shortened      by the intrusion          of the estuary      and   lengthened by its
 withdrawal,      a  sufficiently precise meaning can be given.                 A   river,
 then,     is a stream       of fresh water,          which   by gradual increase       of
 salinity may merge into an estuary,                  or by an abrupt accession         of
 salt water may run directly into a firth or sea.                    An  estuary is the
 region where the tidal current effects a mixture                  of river water with

                            of Edinburgh, Session 1885-86.                               791
that       of the      sea   or   firth;   its length and position in any system
depend           on many conditions,           and may vary slightly with rainfall,
tidal       range, wind, and other variable factors.               In an    estuary, salinity
 increases rapidly from river to firth or sea. A firth is an inlet of
 the sea connected with a river through an estuary ; * in it the water
 gradually         increases in salinity from estuary to sea, and tidal effects
  are     not strongly marked.            The term river-system has been used here
  in    a restricted sense to describe the connected                 system     made up of
  four parts — river,         estuary,    firth, and adjacent      sea ;   but this does not
  affect       its   more      general     geographical meaning,            which    includes
  tributaries and feeding             lakes.
        Applying      these definitions to the      Forth   system, the river terminates
   in    ordinary weather between                 Stirling and Cambus, the estuary
   stretches from the end of the river to about a mile east or west of
   Queensferry, and the firth then begins, extending to beyond the Isle
   of   May.
        Examination        of the estuary was conducted           in the manner adopted
   for the Spey, only the temperature was observed more frequently.
    The boat was anchored in the channel where the depth varied from
    3 to    5   fathoms,     according to the tidal phase;              samples     of water
    ¦were    collected     by means of a bottle, the stopper                 of which     was
    pulled out by        a string when       it  was sunk to the proper depth ; tem
    perature was observed            with    the Scottish-frame Negretti          and Zam-
    bra's thermometer.              Every hour, or half hour           if the    change was
    rapid, a series of temperature            observations at distances of every         2 or
    3 feet    from the bottom upwards was made, and                      if  a considerable
    difference      appeared between two positions, one or more intermediate
    observations        served    to define     it exactly.    Observations of density
     were    made      in like manner with a small hydrometer graduated
    directly to read "specific gravity at 60"             F." from        1-000   to 1-030;
    and samples were            frequently kept to have          their density carefully
     determined       with    the delicate       hydrometer on shore.          Observations
     were continued         for from two to seven hours at a time, and were
     arranged so as to include the most interesting phases of the tide at
     positions     between     Kincardine and Cambus.
       *
          The inlet must be a narrow one relatively to its length, otherwise it is
     a bay or   bight. The Moray Firth, for instance, is not a firth in our meaning
     of the word.

  The weather was throughout clear and dry, and with the excep
tion of one            day,             April      27,    which         was      extremely warm,                   the air
temperature          was low, and an easterly wind prevailed.

       At   a  given time the vertical distribution                              of salinity in          the water
  was found to be determined by the depth, position, and state of
  tide.       At Alloa, for            instance,          the difference             between         bottom and
  surface water was so slight, and the depth so small, that the hydro
  meter employed was of little use in tracing the form of the density
  curve.

  more rapid         dilution ; but             before       low water the slight and uniform
  change        was re-established.                  If    the ebb continued long enough                                 at

  the     ordinary         low-water mark, our observations indicated that it
  would be entirely fresh in ordinary weather.                                         In   times of flood, of
  course, fresh water is found even                             farther down the estuary.                          The

794                   Proceedings        of the  Royal Society
curves of salinity obtained at Alloa on April 28 are                shown on Plate
XXVIII.      fig. 6.
    At Kincardine       there was always a more marked change              in salinity
with depth, and while           at high water there was a          minimum differ
ence between       surface      and bottom, and a        nearly uniform vertical
distribution,    in the early part of        ebb the greater part    of the increase
of density was in the first fathom, and in the early part                  of flood in
the fathom nearest the bottom.                 The travelling    downward of         the
point of inflection in the curve corresponding to the increasing fresh
ness of the upper strata of water as the tide falls is                shown clearly
in diagram 5, Plate         XXVIII.
                           Observations     of Temperature.
    The relation of the temperature of the water to its salinity was
such    at the    time of our observations            that surface water        which
was fresher was also           warmer than that at the bottom, and water
from the upper part of the estuary was warmer than that in the
lower part.       It   thus happened          that an increase      of salinity    was
always accompanied by a decrease of temperature, and                    a decrease    of
salinity   by an increase of temperature.               It will  be seen,   by refer
ence to Plate     XXVIII.         figs. 5 and 6, that the curves illustrating      the
 vertical distribution        of temperature      in the water     at any time were
 almost mirror images of those representing density.                    The position
 and amount of inflection in the corresponding curves are, in fact,
 the same, though the directions are opposite.                It  thus appears that
 at this   season     of the year the thermometer alone is sufficient                 to
 trace out the interaction of the           frithial and fluvial water in     such an
 estuary   as  that of the       Forth      The following notes, although taken
 from individual       cases,    illustrate what we found to be the conditions
 characteristic of the various phases of tide during the period of our
 observations.       The range of temperature for the whole time                   was
 rather less than      5°   F., varying from     50° to 45°-5, and the difference
 between    surface and bottom rarely amounted to so much as 3°.
     Ebb Tide. — Kincardine            : depth of water,   3 to  5  fathoms.     From
 one to three and a        half hours of     ebb the vertical distribution     of tem
 perature   remains practically the same, being nearly uniform from                 the
  bottom to about        4   feet from the surface,       where there is a sudden
  increase in the rate of rise.           The temperature    of the whole mass        of

                           of Edinburgh, Session 1885-86.                                   795
water increases uniformly with                  time,    so that the curves of vertical
distribution          for successive      half-hourly      periods are parallel to each
other.         This indicates a      movement       of water    en masse     from the upper
to the lower parts of the             estuary.
      From      three and a      half  to five hours ebb         the temperature         of the
bottom water does             not increase much, but between              1A   and 3 fathoms
from the bottom              there is a continuous rise of temperature,                  which
becomes less marked near the surface.                       The curves show         a  shearing
displacement during this period, and                      appear      to indicate that the
 current at the bottom is slackened, and that the upper and middle
 layers of water flow on over it
       During the last hour of ebb the bottom water gradually but
  distinctly cools, and the fall of temperature is shared in by the
  lower fathom          and a half   ;  the next fathom shows             a gradual rise in
  temperature, while          the surface     layers remain        ne arly unaltered.       The
   water on the bottom appears to be flowing, while that on the surface
   is still ebbing. Ships anchored in the channel begin to swing, and
   turn completely round, from half an hour to twenty minutes before
   boats anchored in            a  similar     position     are    moved,      a  fact which
    proves conclusively that         flood tide sets in first at the bottom.
        Ebb tide       at Kincardine       is illustrated      by the curves          in Plate
    XXVIII.      fig.  3.
         Ebb Tide. — Alloa: depth from             3 J to   1  fathom.       The difference
    of temperature (and of salinity also) between surface and bottom
    is here so slight that it is difficult to determine the exact vertical
    distribution.       Speaking generally, the curves               move along the scale
    nearly parallel to themselves,          showing      a  movement of translation in
    the water from the upper part of the estuary firth wards; there are
    indications, but too slight to be held             as  altogether satisfactory, that
    a   certain amount of shearing motion takes place                     as at   Kincardine
    just before the turn of the tide (see Plate               XXVIII.       fig. 6).
         Flood Tide. — Kincardine: depth from                 3   to 5 fathoms.         During
    the two first hours of flood           the whole body of water from surface
     to   bottom    falls in   temperature        uniformly,       the   curve of vertical
     distribution     showing     an    inflection     in the second           fathom     from
     the   bottom.       This indicates      a   flowing      up-stream       of the whole
     water.     An upward travelling of              the   inflection     along the curve
     shows that the actual increase of depth is due not to the damming

796                  Proceedings            of     the    Royal Society
back of water above, but to rapid influx from the lower parts                                                      of
the estuary.       During the next two and a half hours the temperature
is nearly    uniform         from the bottom to within one fathom of                                            the
surface,    where there is          a   sharp rise.          After five hours flood,                         while
the lower strata are           still falling in          temperature,             the surface fathom
is rising rapidly       ;    showing that ebb has begun                               above      while       flood
continues below, the result being, of course,                            a   shearing motion.
     The greater    part of both flood and ebb tide is characterised by                                               a
strong current     as       nearly as possible of equal velocity at surface and
bottom, but at the turning points of flood and ebb, and for about
an hour before and after these crises, there is a shearing motion, the
sliding    of one       layer over another.                     By this                means         the     same
condition      of things is established at high and at low water, viz.,                                             a
colder bottom layer,           a   warmer surface layer, and                      a   short intermediate
region of comparatively rapid change                               of temperature                    (see Plate
XXVIII.      fig. 4.)

consists of a temporary stoppage or reversal of the current                                             ; when

lated low water at Kincardine the tidal current has become                                                 imper
ceptible in the lower part of the estuary, and shortly afterwards                                                  it
turns and runs up.                 The stream of salt water going up the                                estuary
 meets     the down-running               current of fresher water as                            a    wall,    and
 serves to dam      it      back for some time, slackening the rate of                                         ebb
 throughout the whole estuary, or even reversing                                      it   for   a   short    time.
 Very soon, however, the difference                          in density of the two                      streams
 asserts its influence, the             Salter water penetrates                       the lower layers             of
 the fresher, and flows up under                     it   as   a   very diffuse and ill-defined
    wedge, while the surface             layers,     being released                   from the         pressure,

flow outwards again until ebb tide is completed, and the force of
the flood tide is strong enough to ensure reversal of direction all
along the estuary.
    The subject of leaky          tides deserves more careful observation for a
longer period than         we were able to devote to it.
    Explanation of Plate XXVIII. — By way of a summary of the
 principal results, the meaning of the various curves in the Plate may
 be briefly pointed       out.
    Figs.  1   and   2 show     the variation of temperature       and density dur
 ing an entire tide      at Kincardine        on 27th   April  1886.
    Fig.  1.   Kincardine,       27th    April  1886, from 10.30 o'clock to 16.30
          o'clock, i.e., from          2  hours ebb to     2  hours flood.     Depth
          varied from       4  fathoms      4 feet to 3 fathoms   2  feet
       Curves showing the variation with time or phase of tide of
          the temperature          of the water: —
                         (a) at the surface,
                         (b) at 3 feet below surface,
                          (c)   at 2  \  fathoms above bottom,
                         (d) at bottom.
                  Abscissae mark time, ordinate? temperature.
       Surface curve is made irregular by sun-heating.                    The others
          show that while the bottom layer attains its maximum tem
          perature      an hour before low water,          the intermediate maxi
           mum is later, and the water near the surface is warmest after
           low water.        The shearing motion that        occurs near high water
           is made very evident by these curves.
       If corresponding          curves for 12 hours could have been obtained,
           they would probably have shown —
                (1) at the bottom, a minimum               temperature     after high
                   water, and       a maximum before low water, and therefore
                   a steep rise.
                (2) near the surface, a minimum temperature before high
                   water, and a maximum after low water, and therefore a
                   steep fall.

            o'clock, i.e., from       2  hours ebb to   3 hours flood.

       So far as interpretable,                   these      curves      accord     with those of
           temperature           in fig.   1.

      (a), (6),     (c)   are similar        in form, and probably indicate transla
           tion of water         en masse.
      In (d) the shearing motion above referred    clearly suggested         is
        by the back-throw of the bottom of the curve.

          John Jas. Barlow, Manchester Technical SchooL
     A   short time ago           I      published         a   method in the Chem. News, vol.

                     " On the           use of Hydrogen Peroxide as an oxidising agent
for detecting           and estimating Manganese;" showing the advantages                               it
had over other sources of oxygen for oxidation purposes, simply on
account of the fact, that when using hydroxyl you do not introduce
any objectionable foreign substance, such                                  as    manganese,   chromium,

     Since then       I      have used         it    with      advantage        in many other chemical
operations where oxidation was necessary, amongst                                        others, the sub
stance        of    the present          paper — the        detection      of chlorine, bromine, and
iodine.            The detection of these substances,                           in the   presence of each
other, has been accepted    (to say the least) troublesome and
                                                as                                                 ;
numerous papers have been published within the last four years on
the subject by              A    Cavazzi; P.         S.    Brito, M.B.     ;    E. Hart; and F. Jones,
F.R.S.E., though none of the                         methods       given by these chemists can be
called satisfactory              ;      the last two may be considered                   the best, though
they both introduce foreign substances,                                 and in the last, F. Jones'
method, where Mn02    used for oxidising, iscould not detect the           I
substance,  in small quantity, and its introduction always pre
                     if

observed.
     The following               method, which has given entire satisfaction both to
myself and also to                      Dr Griffiths, F.R.S.E., Technical School, Man

peroxide.            To insure    success,    close     attention should be given to
various little details mentioned.
      The sketch shows the apparatus used, and consists of a glass tube
A, about         4   inches long and     f inch diameter,      with      a   small bulb blowa
on the bottom capable of holding 10 c.c                        It   is fitted      with a tight
cork       I,   through the centre of which passes a small funnel tube                          R
This must            reach to   within   \ inch     of the bottom of the bulb, and
should be fitted with a stopcock S, just below the funneL                                 On one
side of the tube         A, just underneath         the stopper     I,   is the arm r, about
1   inch long and        \ inch diameter,         on the end    of which is joined, by           a
piece of rubber tubing, a glass tube t, bent at right angles, the long
arm being about 5 inches ; this conveys the vapours which                              distil over
into the receiving tube C (i.e., an ordinary test-tube), which contains
the solution of starch, ether, &c.
    In making         an experiment, place the substance                 under examination
(it   is                    than 0-25 grm. at once) in the tube A,
           best not to use more
nearly fill the bulb with water, then run down      after warming            B,
slightly, two drops of dilute sulphuric acid                   (1   in   5).      If   nitrates or
chlorates        are present,    the fluid   will   change colour, yellow or red, due

to the liberation of iodine; if              so, boil until  the colour disappears.
If    chlorates and nitrates are absent, no change of colour takes place
in    the bulb, until on adding two drops of hydrogen peroxide, whence
if   iodine     be present, the     liquid in the bulb immediately          assumes a
yellow, then        a rosy red colour, and on boiling a violet vapour makes
its    appearance     in the upper part of the tube, even when only minute
quantities       of iodine are present      ;  dispel the iodine gradually by care
 fully adding hydroxyl,              two drops at       a time.     The iodine being
 expelled, add two drops of dilute H2S04 and three or four drops of
hydroxyl ; the bromine will now make its appearance, and hydroxyl
solution must         be added, two drops at a time,             until it  has all dis
 appeared,       which will be known by the clearness of the liquid in the
 distilling bulb, and will            be also    almost colourless.     Very often a
 little chlorine      can be detected         coming over with the bromine, but
 this only       occurs   when the quantity          is large, or when too much
 H2S04       has been added, and so making the solution strongly acid.
 In    fact, this must be done        if the experiment is to be successful       in all
 cases, and great care must be exercised              in adding   the H2S04,    as well
 as the hydroxyl         (H202).      If now, after the bromine has disappeared,
 a few drops of a solution of AgN03 be added to the solution remain
 ing in      the bulb, a white precipitate of           AgCl will    appear, showing
  the presence of       a  chloride.     It is always better to divide the solu
  tion into two parts, or take only a portion for the detection                    of a
  chloride.
      In  every experiment        I   detected    the iodine when present, either
  by the flash of red colour in the distilling bulb, the vapour (violet)
  in the upper part of the tube, or the blue colour with starch, even
  if the   iodine present only amounted to the one-thousandth part of
  the substance present.
      In only    one case, out of a great         many experiments,     was   I unable
  to detect bromine, and that when the amount of bromine, compared
  with the iodine and chlorine, was very small.                 The detection    of the
  chlorine was always sure, in some cases by the smell, but always by
  means     of silver nitrate (AgN03).
      The    following     acids do      not   interfere with the      test : — hydro-
  sulphuric,     sulphurous, hyposulphurous, carbonic,             phosphorous, and
  hydrofluoric acids.

the heavy metals, the experiment                    in  some cases is not so successful,
so  that it is always better to boil with Na,2COs or K2C03,                            so as to
expel the heavy metals, and get                    the    acid radicles in combination

            Geddes     and     J. Arthur          Thomson.         (Plate       XXIX.)
     The development of spermatozoa                    has been for the              last twenty
years       the subject of prolonged research                   and controversy, which
cannot yet be said to have resulted in satisfactory solution of the
involved       problems.         In    view of the intrinsic             difficulties of the
subject, and the discrepant results and nomenclature of different
authorities, it is the object of the present                   paper   to recapitulate          the
history of investigation, to collate the results and the nomenclature,
and to propose         a   theory which will explain and rationalise the maze
of apparently conflicting             observations.
     § 1.   History. — The modern period of investigation,                      despite a few
researches         by Wagner, Von Siebold, and others,                      practically opens
with Kolliker's fundamental observation* (1841), that the                               head     of
each spermatozoon             arose from the nucleus of a seminal cell (Samen-
bildungzelle).
     In     1844    Meckel described,           in Helix, how the cell destined                  to
become        spermatozoa       arose superficially from a mother-cell,                   in    the
epithelium          of the germ follicle.             According to Kolliker, however,
the central body round which the immature sperms were grouped was
no cell, but only the residue                 of the mother-cell within which the
sperm cells had arisen endogenously.                      The research of Ankermann*
(1854) also deserves mention, for his derivation of each spermatozoon
from a distinct cell.
     The account of spermatogenesis                   became    somewhat       more complex
when Kolliker described,                in    1856,    two kinds       of    cells   lining     the
tubules — (a) outer cells with large nuclei and nucleoli, and under
going rapid multiplication;                  (6) inner cells, becoming differentiated
into      seminal cells, which formed in some                    cases      cysts,    and from
whose        nuclei     the    spermatozoa         were      formed.        Henle      also    dis
tinguished two kinds of round cells (a) with granular, and                               (6)   with

 804                    Proceedings     of  the  Royal Society
clear refracting nuclei, from both of which                sperms were developed            :
he emphasised        the cellular    homology of the spermatozoon, deriving
 the head from the nucleus, and the             tail from part of     the protoplasm,
 while Kolliker was more inclined to regard the whole as a modified
 nucleus.
     That the simple developmental history described by                   Kolliker      and
 Henle did not express          all the facts of the case was proved                by  the
researches of Sertoli, who (1865) described                in the seminal         tubules
 certain "ramified cells" which projected between                   the round cells,
 and were often branched internally,               while    the  peripheral        end of
 each,   with    the nucleus, was in direct contact          with    the   wall of      the
 canal.     He    regarded    their function, however, as only secretory, and
 contrasted     them    as  epithelial and fixed, with the round, mobile cells
 which had the direct role of producing                  sperms.       This discovery
 was abundantly confirmed, but especially by Merkel, who described
 (1871) large cells lying close to the tunica propria, which he called
 Stiitzzellen, and regarded as forming a supporting framework for
 the adjacent round cells from which the spermatozoa                   developed.
     These round cells had been hitherto regarded                 as    alone    directly
 essential    to spermatogenesis,      but   a contrary opinion was maintained
 in   the   classic   research   of Von Ebner         (1871).    Within the endo
 thelial tunic of the seminal canals             of the rat, he described         a  layer
 of two kinds of cells — (a)            round    granular cells,      and   (?•)  larger,
 elliptical cells, the latter confluent at the base, and forming a proto
 plasmic     layer or Keimnetz.        The inner end of each of these large
 cells enlarges     and divides, forming irregular digitate prolongations
 which project into the lumen of the duct.                     At the      base of the
 whole cell, which with its prolongations he termed                 a  Spermatoblast,
 the primitive      nucleus remains undivided, while at the base of each
 lobe a nucleus          is   observed,     which    he   ascribed to      endogenous
 origin.     The nucleus of each digitation            elongates   to form the main
 portion of the head of        a spermatozoon,      and a   thin film of protoplasm
 elongates into the tail.         The heads of the resulting spermatozoa                 at
 first press downwards         within    the spermatoblast, reaching almost to
the Keimnetz ; their tails protrude into the lumen.                      When finally
liberated the sperms         curl themselves       up to roll down the seminal
tubule, and the more or less branched stump of the spermatoblast
is left bare.       The round cells take no part in the process (though

                         of Edinburgh, Session 1885-86.                                   805
he also       described     multinuclear         cysts)  ;  they originate from blood
corpuscles, and perform nutritive or mechanical                       functions.
     Over    this a vigorous controversy at once arose.                       Merkel (1874)
identified Von Ebner's              spermatoblasts      with his     Stiitzzellen, but while
maintaining the origin of the sperms from the round cells, allowed
that they were secondarily received into side pocket-like cavities of
 the Stiitzzellen.         According         to Merkel,      this secondary         stage had
thus     been mistaken by           Von Ebner for       the primary.
     The next        important         contribution      was      that     of   Sertoli,  who
 described the fixed, ramified, epithelial cells as before, and identi
 fying     them    with Merkel's Stiitzzellen and the lower part of Von
 Ebner's spermatoblasts,             still maintained that they took              no part    in
 the actual spermatogenesis.                 This he ascribed wholly to           the mobile
 round cells which arise between                  the fixed cells, and which he dis
 tinguished       in their                    state as
                                                          " germinative," and later          as
                               youngest
 the larger "seminal" cells from the division                         of which the small
 numerous nematoblasts               or undifferentiated spermatozoa result.
     Merkel was supported by Von Brunn, and by Bloch who followed
 the development of the                 "round cells."         Neumann, on the other
 hand, denied the existence                of Merkel's framework altogether,              and
 described     free    nucleus formation within the spindle-shaped,                       first
  blunt,    then fringed,          spermatoblasts,       which,      differing    from    Von
 Ebner, he regarded          as modified from the ordinary epithelium of the
  tubule.     He    also described          the origin of spermatozoids             from free
  cells,  which he explained              as  separated     lappets     of spermatoblasts.
  Krause (1876) also essentially supported Von Ebner, but described
  the spermatoblasts as ciliated cells with ramified and even anasto
  mosing processes, so doing away with a connective system altogether.
  Von Ebner was further corroborated                    by Mihalkowics, Rivolta, and
  others, and his account of the                 processes     has been       perhaps    most
  generally     adopted       (cf.    Landois,      Frey,    <fcc.).    Blumberg       (1873)
  attempted      to reconcile the disputants by ascribing spermatogenetic
  functions to both spermatoblasts               and round cells.
      Semper's     well-known         researches     on the      urinogenital      system    of
  Elasmobranchs included                an important        contribution       on spermato
  genesis.     He   described        an invagination of the germinal epithelium
  or of the primitive         ova into the subjacent stroma, where they form
   a  primitive     follicle,    which       again comes        into    relation    with   the

806                     Proceedings         of   tlie    Royal Society
incipient tubule.         All
                        primitive ampullae exhibit (a) large, granular
cells with round nuclei, and (b) smaller cells with more oval nuclei,
in    regard   to which the possibility is suggested                        that the narrowed
nuclei form the round.               At     a later stage two distinct                    layers are
observed; the narrow nucleated cells form for                                 a    while an outer
epithelium, but afterwards disappear                      ;    this is succeeded by a stage
where the lumen is apparently lined by large conical cells with two
nuclei, of which the inner are long and granular, while the outer are
round and homogeneous.                The inner oval nuclei bud off externally
a large      number of round spermatoblast nuclei, first regularly and
then      irregularly    grouped.       These are enclosed                  within       the conical
mother-cell, and are separated               from the ampulla wall by the large
oval nucleus         of the   " Deckzelle," in            regard      to whose origin, from a
modificat ion of an outer layer of spermatoblast nuclei, or from the
outer narrow-nucleated              cells    of         the     primitive     ampulla,        Semper
remained       undecided.       The sixty or so spermatoblast nuclei, elongate
to form the heads of the spermatozoa,                         which    lie originally       near    the
"cover-cell";        the whole mass forms a bundle filling the greater part of
the mother-cell,        from which they are expelled by the swelling up of
the    " cover-cell."
     The important series of researches                       by Von la Valette St             George
was      meanwhile leading up to a quite different view of spermato
genesis.       In his fifth communication, in                         1875,       he    distinguishes
within      the   seminal     tubule, two kinds of cells — (a) epithelial                          cells,
homologous with primitive ovules, and dividing to form                                      epennato-
goniti  which lie close to the tunica propria ; and (b) small round
cells lying between the spermatogonia, and having no other function
than      that of enveloping          the spermatogonia and their                          successors.
Each       spermatogonium         forms by division                   a multinuclear          cyst or
spermatogemma,          consisting of        a mass           of daughter-cells or          spermato
cytes.       These                may either (a) all develop into
                        spermatocytes

modified as a basilar cell (Plagiostome Fishes), or      number may               (c)
                                                                                   a
form an envelope            round the others (Amphibians                      and Fishes).            In
comparing these divergent results with those of Merkel and Sertoli
on the one hand, and those of                    Von Ebner            on the other, he regards
his      primitive     spermatogonia,        lying            round   the tunica propria,             as
equivalent to        Von Ebner's " Keimnetz " and the                             base of Merkel's

                         of Ediixburgh,     Session 1885-86.                     807
" Stiitzzellen,"      the central part being simply the follicular cells
altered by       reagents.     The spermatoblasts       were  explained away as
misinterpretations        of the temporary union of a number of spermato
cytes originating from the          same parent spermatogonium.
     Helmann (1879) similarly described the division of each primitive
cell into a mass of daughter-cells which are differentiated into
spermatozoa       ;  while Krause referred the origin of the sperms to the
indirect division of the (germinative) follicular              cells,  which form
spermatogemmaB           (or Knauelzellensiiule) of "spermatoblasts,"          while
 the nucleated basal portion forms the "spermatogonium."                       With
this Meyer (1880) also agreed, regarding the follicular cells of Von
la Yalette St George as the earliest stages of the spermatogonia and
 spermatogemmse.           Nussbaum's well-known memoir on the differentia
 tion of the        sex-elements    contained an account of spermatogenesis,
 which substantially        agreed   with that of La Valette.     From the primi
 tive   male ovule, spermatogonium and           follicular cells both   arise, as in
 some cases of oogenesis         ; by indirect division within the spermato
 gonium, cells are formed which become spermatocytes,                 though a few
 peripherally      situated probably form a second enveloping membrane
 —the "Cystenhaut."
     It is most convenient, at this stage, to refer to the spermatogenesis
 of Invertebrates, which           has   also  been    the subject of numerous
 important      researches,    together comprehending almost every group.
 It   is only necessary to allude to a few of these.                In  1877    F. K
 Schulze described the spermatogenesis             of the sponge      Halisarca, in
 which germinal        mesoderm cells, analogous      to those which give rise to
 ova, divide repeatedly to form morula-like masses, composed of about
 thirty   cells, each of which        develops into a spermatozoon.           Round
 the larger clumps, a mesoderm capsule of flat polygonal endothelial
 cells is formed, as round the ova.             An interesting observation on
 the spermatogenesis        of Sycandra raphanus is due to Polejaeff (1882),
 who described the nuclear division of the primitive amoeboid cell,                —
 the smaller half forming a cover cell (Deckzelle),           which embraces the
 sperm-cells resulting from the repeated              division of the larger half
  (the Ursamen-zelle).
     In 1844 Meckel had described the spermatozoa                  of the snail, as
  arising   superficially    from a mother-cell, and this view had been
  confirmed by various authors.           According to Duval, the mother-cell

808                         Proceedings          of    the   Royal Society
exhibits        an        endogenous          formation           of     nuclei,        which,          travelling
outwards,        form the spermatocyte-cells,                     apparently budded out on the
surface.  The mother-cell degenerates, the nucleus alone remaining
to serve as a basis of attachment for the spermatocytes, but finally
also undergoing atrophy.                      With this, Kef erstein's account in                          general
agreed.         M.    v. Brunn,            however, denied the endogenous formation
of nuclei, and maintained the persistence of the basal-cell                                               to form
new generations of spermatocytes.                                 Blomfield             also    described            in
Helix the division of                      the spermatogonia to                  form          morula-niassts
("spurmatospheres") of "spermatoblasts," one of which (the "blasto-
phoral cell," situated next the ampulla-wall)    at an early stage,            is,
marked off from                    the others,        remaining          inactive while              the other
"spermatoblasts"               of the "polyplast" are more or less supported by
it,   in their continued multiplication.                          What Duval              had described in
the snail, Hallez corroborated by the observation of an essentially
similar process               in    some     Planarians      ;     while Graff             found in other
species that no cytophoral remnant survived, but that the whole                                                 of
the       spermatogonium became                   converted into             a      "   spermato-morula
                                                                                                                    "
of spermatocytes.                   The spermatogenesis                  of some          Trematodes         was
described by Lorenz (1878)                       as   consisting in the enlargement of an
epithelial cell, the endogenous                       appearance          of nuclei, and segmenta
tion into       a    morula-like mass of somewhat indistinctly                                 separate cells,
round       a    small central remnant.                      In    1880      Blomfield             investigated
the process          in   the earth-worm, and described                     how     a     "spermatospore"
cell divides into             a    " spermatoblasts," with central mass
                                   number of                                                   a
of    inactive protoplasm, the " blastophore," — the whole result forming
a     "   spermatosphere,"             of which         each       of the "spermatoblasts"                      is
differentiated to form                 a   spermatozoon.               His results       are, on the whole,
more analogous              to those of        Von Ebner than               to those of            La    Valette.
Besides         his subsequent research on the spermatogenesis                                     of   the snail
to which         we have            already alluded, he described that of the                                frog.
In this         case      a    hollow        spermatogemma                arises,       each       of its    cells
elongates        to form           a   spermatozoon      ;    these, while              immature,         arrange
themselves           in bundles round            one of the more superficial cells, which
"become blastophoral corpuscles,"—                            a        view which recalls Merkel's
explanation of Von Ebner's spermatoblasts,                                   mentioned above,                viz.,
that the spermatozoa,                   after completing their development, are                              only
temporarily lodged in the recesses of the former.

                             of Edinburgh, Session 1885-86.                                   809
      Herrmann has described                the spermatogenesis      of certain Crustacea
as     consisting in the division of the nucleus of a male ovule to form
a. group of spermatoblasts,             each      of which    becomes differentiated into
a. spermatozoon.             A   more thorough investigation, however, is due to
Grobben.            The germinal layer of           the Crustacean testes is described
as consisting of (a) large cells with round nuclei (the spermatoblasts
of Von Ebner, &c), and (b) of a nucleated protoplasmic mass between
the bases of the former.   The reserve nucleated masses (Ersatzkeime)
represent, according to Grobben, the earliest stage                       ; the   larger nuclei
 are      changed     into spermatoblast-nuclei, while the former probably
 multiply and grow for the future replacement of                          used-up      spermato
 blasts. Each of these reserve germs (Ersatzkeime) is potentially a
 spermatoblast; the difference between them is secondary.       The
 comparative          spermatogenesis            of Arthropoda      has    lately been          the
 subject of elaborate study by Gilson, who distinguishes primor
 dial " metrocytes," multiplying into direct metrocytes or " mother-
                                   divide up into          " spermatic cells " — each the
 sperm cells," which
 immediate predecessor of a spermatozoon.
    Sabatier (1882) has also described the spermatogenesis of several
 Invertebrates.  Within mother-cells or " spermatospores " nuclear
 multiplication         and superficial budding             occur, resulting      in   a number
 of stalked claviform               cells     or "protospormoblasts."               These       are
 detached, increase           in   size, exhibit     nuclear multiplication         and super
 ficial budding, resulting in the production of                      a second          generation
 of    spermoblaste     — the "deuto-spermoblasts," which form the spermato-
 zoids.      In     regard    to numerous groups,            Nemerteans, Echinoderms,
 Molluscs,        and    Ascidians,         he    maintains     the occurrence           of   two
 generations of cells of which the first become the blastophores of
 the second, the " spermatospores
                                  " of the "
                                             protospermoblasts," and
 the latter in turn of the "deuto-spermoblasts."
      Most nearly related perhaps to Sabatier's account is the divergent
 description given by Bolles-Lee of the spermatogenesis                       of Appendicu-
 laria.      In   the large mother-cells of the testis scattered              nuclei appear,
 originating, however, not from the mother-cell nucleus, but, peripher
                                       further, no " polyplast stage,
                                                     is,       "
 ally, from the protoplasm. There
 but       the    developed        nuclei, i.e.,     the     "spermatoblasts,"           form    a
 " germinative epithelium," and                   are differentiated on the surface into
 spermatozoa.

810                  Proceedings    of the Royal Society
    The researches      of Jensen    on the spermatogenesis       of numerous
invertebrate forms,       were   mainly corroborative of the views        of La
Valette St George.         A  spermatogonium divides into a       mass of sper
matocytes,     or a spermatogemma,      which includes a distinct,    sometimes
nucleated cytophore (sperm          blastopbore).     This   is regarded,    how
ever, not as a separated       off portion of the mother-cell, but         as the
result of the internal destruction of the central spermatocytes, or
of those nearest the ampulla wall.
    In   the  recent   account of the spermatogenesis      of Atscaru wyai'f-
rcphala given by Van Beneden and Julin, primitive male ovules or
"
   spermatomeres,"      form, by direct division, spermatogonia; each of
the latter divides indirectly into four spermatocytes,           which together
form   a spermatogemma.          Each spermatocyte forms a cytophoral por
tion towards the centre of the spermatogemma,          and these four portions
compose      the so-called   cytophore, from which the spermatozoids are
liberated.      This  recent research is of further interest,  though this does
not specially concern us here, for the description of       a process, observed
in   the   formation of the spermatogonia, which exactly corresponds
 with the account of polar cell formation given by Van Beneden.
    One of the clearest       accounts   of invertebrate spermatogenesis          is
 given by Voigt in regard to Branchiobdella,          in which the following
                                   —
 five stages are distinguished        (1) sexual cells, (2) spermatogonia        (or
 Stammsamenzellen), (3) spermatocytes          (or Samenvermehrungszellen),
 (4) spermatides (or Samenausbildungszellen), and (5) spermatozoa
 (or Spermatosomen). The first are the embryonic cells, the second are
 the homologues of the ova and the origin of a sperm-bundle, the
 third form collectively        a spermatogemma,      the fourth    are not yet
 perfectly differentiated sperms, nor freed from the separated-off             por
 tion of the spermatocyte.         The same nomenclature is followed             by
 Platner in his recent account of Pulmonate            spermatogenesis.        The
 spermatogonia       are at an    early stage the   only cells in the      herma
 phrodite gland besides        the ova.     They divide    indirectly    to form
 spermatocytes,      but a large proportion     of them   persist, arranged in
 pillars between the spermatocyte        groups, and subsequently form          not
 only   a new   generation of spermatocytes,      but also  new "   basal cells,"
 after the others have disappeared.          These basal cells appear        at an
 early stage adjacent to the alveolar wall, and resemble               spermato
 gonia, though they never divide, but merely serve as centres,              round

•which      the spermatocytes           are associated.        The spermatocytes divide
indirectly        to form spermatides           or undifferentiated spermatozoa.
     After      this notice of some of the more                     important       accounts       of
invertebrate          spermatogenesis,         it is   necessary     to return to the        much
more complicated and                 debated    spermatogenesis        of vertebrates.
     Renson      (18^2) described         small round granular cells at the periphery
 of the     canal adjacent to the tunica propria, which he regarded                                as
 the germinative cells of Sertoli and Krause,                          the granular cells of
 Von       Ebner's       Keimnetz,        and the follicular           cells of La Valette.

 resulting cells the young               sperms or nematoblasts result.                 The im
 mature       nematoblasts,           however, group         themselves         round    the ex
  tremity      of    certain       large    projecting      epithelial      cells (cellules       de
  soutien), — obviously          the spermatoblasts         of Von Ebner,        — and actually
  sink into their protoplasm               to complete their development.                   When
  fully   developed, the heads of the young spermatozoa                           have attained
  the base of the supporting cell, but this now elongates                             and bears
   them anew in         the lumen of the duct into which they are expelled.

   endogenous formation, preceded, however, by                       a segmentation.
      According        to   Sabatier,       spermatogenesis         always       occurs   in two
   generations of cells.             From     the   nuclear division         and germination
   of mother-cells         or spermatospores,            claviform     stalked cells       (proto
   spermoblasts) arise.             These are detached,           increase     in size, divide,
   and produce on their surface deutospermoblasts, or the spermato
   cytes   of    Von la Valette.             The protospermoblasts thus form the
   blastophore of the deutospermoblasts, from which the spermatozoa
   directly   originate.        In Plagiostome           fishes   Sabatier describes          how
   the epithelial       cells   form cuk-de-sac,          in which        some     of the cells
   increase    in   size, and form spermatospores                or male ovules.           In   the
   peripheral protoplasm of these spermatospores,                     endogenously formed
   nuclei appear     — the protospermoblasts.               The nucleus of each of these
   divides to form numerous                 deutospermoblasts, which               are for      the

812                 Proceedings      of   the  Royal Society
most part differentiated into spermatozoids,              though a few degenerate
into a problematic body.
    The   researches    of Jensen,      to   which    we have already        referred,
extended also to Vertebrates.           Within the       ampullae    of Plagiostome
fishes  two forms of cells occur (a) with large round nuclei — the
future spermatogonia, (b) with narrow smaller nuclei — the follicular
cells.   It  is important to note, however, that he maintains                 that     the
latter also develop into the former.                From the division         of    each
spermatogonium       a  cellular pillar results — a      spermatogemma         of   sper
matocytes     ; while  a  single narrow follicular         nucleus lies at the       base
 of each pillar, forming the Deckzelle of Semper, the Cystenkern of
 Von la Valette,     the   Xoyau basilaire of Herrmann.               The spennato-
 gemmse become eventually, however, hollowed out, and that                       by the
 destruction of some of the internal spermatocytes,                so that the final
 result is that of    a  number of spermatocytes             surrounding     a central
 cavity, while the cytophoral portion at the base, towards which the
 sperms dive down, has a distinctly           follicular origin.
     The researches of Swaen and Masquelin (1883) on Elasmobranchs,
 Amphibians, and Mammals are of importance, as tending towards
 reconciliation.     In the     testes   of Selachians,        when    the   primitive
                        formed, "
                                                       "
 ampullae    are once                 male ovules         (spermatogonia)       and fol
 licular cells, are quite distinct, and the latter do not transform into
 the former.      The male ovules divide indirectly to form spermato
 gemma!, while      the follicular     cells, after having       formed incomplete
 envelopes    to the male ovules, and to the spermatogemmae,                 disappear
 save   one,    which    travels down and insinuates itself              between       the
  ampulla and the spermatogemma,             there constituting      the basilar     cell.
  The fully-developed       spermatogemma         of about sixty spermatocytes
  exhibits a central cavity or " logo caudale," in which the incipient
  spermatozoa     or nematoblasts are embraced,               their tails projecting
  into the lumen of the duct.         The basilar cell, which has also              been
  enlarging, has likewise an influence on their arrangement                ;  its  proto
  plasm fuses    with  the intercellular substance         of the spermatogemma,
  surrounds the heads and bodies of the nematoblasts,               which thus       sink
  down towards the basilar nucleus,            only to be again expelled          by the
  elongation of the latter.        A  similar process occurs in the          spermato
  genesis of the salamander,       where,     however, the follicular cells         form
  a  complete    envelope    round     the male      ovules during        their    whole

segmentation           and subsequent           evolution.      In Mammals         the   true
male ovules are small parietal cells, regarded by La Valette as
follicular. Each divides into a temporarily inert portion (follicular
cells of La Valette, germinative cells of Sertoli) and " an active
male ovule," which multiplies by division                    to form a spermatogemma
of    spermatocytes.          When        the spermatocytes        have     developed into
nematoblasts, neighbouring " supporting cells " (cellules de soutien)
behave like the basilar cells of Selachians, and fuse with the inter
 cellular     substance     connecting the former, thus producing the sper
 matoblasts of Von Ebner.                   The follicular     or supporting      cells  also
 surround inferiorly         the temporarily inert male ovules.
     The    research of Biondi,          which has just been published,           claims to
 have     effected a reconciliation          of preceding discordant           observations
 by attributing        the discrepancies        to the   different stages at which the
 development         has been observed             In his observations, which apply
  mainly to mammals,             he     recognises only one kind of round cell,
  alike in mature and in immature tubules.                       The epithelial cells of
  Sertoli, the Stiitzzellen of Merkel               and Henle, the spermatoblasts of
  Von Ebner,         are   secondary        modifications     arising    from the proto
  plasmic      debris of the round sperm-producing                   cells.     From    each
  primitive-cell (Stammzelle)              a generation     of cells arise, arranged       in
  column fashion, in which                  one   can   distinguish    three zones — the
  single    primitive-cell      at   the base,       two to    three   mother-cells in      a
  second     row, and four to six daughter-cells in an innermost third
  row.      When      the   pillar    is complete,      sperm-formation begins from
  the centre       outwards,       each     nucleus    becomes     a  sperm,     the   pillar
  becomes      a sperm-bundle, and the spermatozoa                 are squeezed      out by
  the pressure of adjacent pillars, while from the primitive-cell                    of one
   of these a new primitive-cell            arises   by tangential division, to begin
   anew the formation of a fresh pillar in place of that which has been
   modified.      The spermatozoa lying embedded                in the debris of unused
   protoplasm and of nuclear remnants, are compacted                         by pressure of
   adjacent pillars to form        a so-called    spermatoblast.       He refers Sertoli's
   Keimzelle to the canal wall, and identifies his seminal cells and nema
   toblasts  with his own mother and daughter cells respectively.                         La
   Valette's spermatogonium, spermatocytes,                  and   cells of the sperma-
   togemmae,     are    equivalent       to   Biondi's    three   stages — stammzellen,
   mother-cells,    daughter-cells.          In  a  similarly bold way he brings the

      Starting from one of the most defensible sot of terms           — that   used by
"Voigt after Semper — with the four or five                 stages of (1) sex-cells,
(2)     spermatogonia, (3) spermatocytes,          (4) spermatides or immature
( 5)    spermatozoa, it will be convenient in the citation and comparison
of     observations by different authorities to distinguish               the different
 stages by the following          simple notation :— (1) The           spermatozoon,
 denoted by S ; (2) the immature sperm or                  the spermatido, by S°       ;
 (3) the     spermatocyte,     by SJ  ; (4) the cell which         gives rise to the
 spermatocytes,        or the spermatogonium, by           S1 ;  (5) its antecedent,
 "by S2    ; and so on.      These symbols can be readily bracketed after
  the    terms   cited,   and all confusion thus obviated without               new or
  dogmatic     nomenclature.
      § 3. Since equally competent observers give most divergent accounts
  of   the nature of spermatogenesis,        it   seems    all but impossible that
  any    one mode      of development prevails.          A   forcible reconciliation
  may indeed       be attempted by a detailed criticism of the observations,
  by pointing       out, as  Biondi  has lately attempted,        how the different
   phenomena       described may occur         as    the various      phases    of one
   developmental       cycle.   The discrepancies are, however, too great for
   any    such  general mode      of reconciliation.       Unless     we attach con
   siderably greater weight to the observations of at least a majority
   of all the     above    workers than     they sometimes          incline   to  grant
   to   those  of each other,      the literature      and iconography        of histo
   logy become of little worth.           Accepting      the results of competent
   authorities,    it   is our object   in this paper to         propose    a possible
   rationale   of the existence of several different modes of develop
   ment, and a consistent method for their classification and com
   parison.
       In  1847   Reichert    pointed out the homology between the ovum
   and the mother sperm cell, and this has been for long recognised
    with   more or less definiteness      in the various attempts which            have
    been made to draw parallels between             the processes     in the develop
    ment of the two elements.        Thus Von la Valette St          George compared
    spermatogonium (S1) with ovum, and the follicular skin of the
    former with the follicular cells of the latter.            Nussbaum, following
    La Valette,    has in his well-known       memoir on the differentiation          of
    sex, drawn a similar more extended parallel, and has maintained that
    in Amphibia       and Tdeostei the spermatogonium and its follicular

cells probably result from a primitive cell           with morula-like        division
of its nucleus, as has been repeatedly observed                  in  oogenesis.         A
more intimate parallelism is suggested by the comparison repeatedly
proposed,     with  a measure     both of morphological and physiological
probability, between the polar cells of the ovum and similar                     bodies
occurring at various stages           in spermatogenesis.*          In   the     use    of
terms     like sperm-morula, sperm-blastula, &c, Balfour                 and      others
have   dimly   suggested     the further   comparison between          the division
of the sperm-mother-cell (S1) and the segmentation of the ovum.
This comparison it is one of the objects of this paper definitely to
formulate, collating various modes of spermatogenesis              with apparently
homologous modes of segmentation.
   The unification       is sought by       comparing      the manifoldness of
spermatogenesis      to the manifoldness of segmentation, for as the seg
mentation of the ovum is varied, the same is not              <i priori  impossible
in the segmentation        of the male ovule.        These two sets of pheno
mena,    in  regard to which our knowledge            has progressed separately
through empirical evolution, seem to have in short the                   same      mor
phological and physiological rationale.             This  comparison       hinted at
in the nomenclature of Balfour and others, has also been                    proposed
by Herrmann (1881): — "The division of the                    male    ovule    into    a
series of generations       of daughter cells forming spermatoblasts, is               a
phenomenon       comparable     to that exhibited       by the ovum in        the for
mation of the blastoderm.           The cellular individualisation         occurs by
segmentation      (in most ova, and for instance in the male                ovules of
Selachians), or by superficial germination (in the ova of Arthropods
and in most male ovules), or by other mechanism, always, however,
fundamentally of the same nature.               It seems   then more       important
to   determine exactly the mechanism of division                   than to      give a
particular name to each stage of segmentation."
    Such suggestions      have,  it seems to us, great value; the comparison
 must, however, be developed          in detail,
                                                    (a)  In such    a simple case of
 spermatogenesis      as  that illustrated     by sponges,      where     a   cell dif
 ferentiated from the mesoderm divides up into                a  regular    sphere of
 uniform cells, each an incipient         spermatozoon,     or where this        occurs

form     a cover cell for the whole, there seems no difficulty                              in regarding
the     term sperm-morula applied to such a case as in the truest way
descriptive, and in regarding the                         process       as distinctly homologous
¦with that which occurs in the regular and total segmentation of the
ovum          (fig.   A', A").
   (6) The division of the mother-sperm cell is not, however, always
equal, hut forms occur, e.g., in Plagiostome fishes, where one cell pre
dominates in            size over the other (B', B"), a phenomenon which admits
of ready comparison with such                        a phase of unequal ovum-segmenta
tion as is represented in fig. B,                    where the morula consists of a large
number of small                cells, and of one somewhat predominant yolk-filled
cell.

 ¦which Blomfield has described in the earthworm, where the incipient
 sperm-cells enclose a more or less large undivided                                      mass, at once
 suggests a comparison with the centrolecithal                                 segmentation      as exhi

 surround the central yolk-mass.                         And just        as    in   cases   of the latter,
 the individual cells                  are sometimes            seen not very well defined off
 from the central nutritive                       mass, so is      it   also    in various forms of
 spermatogenesis               (fig.    C, C").
   (d) Just as it was seen that, in those forms of sperm-segmentation
 which are directly comparable to morulae, one cell might predomi
  nate in size               over      the others       (fig.    B' B") ; so forms occur (see
  Gilson, &c.) where the sperm-cells                            are borne on the surface of a
  large undivided mass (fig. I)', D"), forming as it were a blastodermic
  plate,       as seen       in forms of partial ovum segmentation where the
  formative cells appear round one pole of the large undivided                                       yolk-
  mass (fig. D).
        (e)    Between the last-mentioned case and that described by Von
  Ebner there           is   but   a   step (fig. E',    E").     The nucleated lappets, which
  he has described as crowning the large nutritive blastophore,                                      differ
  but little from the formative cells just referred to, except in the
  indefiniteness             of     their    separation          from     the        nutritive   mass,   a
  phenomenon             which also finds its parallel in stages of partial ovum-
  segmentation            (fig.     E).
      (/) In another form of                      spermatogenesis,             observed      for example
   by   Semper in the Rays, the spermatocytes                             were found          to be sunk

  820                     Proceedings      of  the  Royal Society
  within the hollow of          the nutritive blastophore (fig.     F').     This    cannot,
  indeed, be directly collated with any actual form of ovum segmen
  tation, but' rather with the inversion of such a form of gastrula                      as is
  seen (e.g.)      in Teleostean     ova, where the yolk        protrudes      in  hemioid
  fashion from the endoderm cells of the epibolic gastrula                         (tig. Fi.
  Starting from the uninvaginated              form, we should thus have in             these
  two types of sperm and ovum segmentation what might be regarded
 as   the result of invagination from different sides,            — in the former          the
 nutritive,       normally internal portion becoming the layer enveloping
 the formative         cells,  —just the    reverse of what occurs          in the    latter.
 Of this inverted gastrulation, possibly represented in Elasmobranchs,
 traces may be detected in such a case as that described by Eenson
 in mammals,          where the sperms produced alongside of the large                nutri
 tive cells yet find their way into them, and sinking in are again
 borne up and finally set free (fig. F", " obgastrula " type).
     In  regard      to such a comparison,        which   appears     to us a possible
 method of reconciling, without               discrediting, the discrepant observa
 tions     of    competent       authorities, and of rationalising            the various
 methods         of   spermatogenesis,       by comparing        them with         parallel
 processes       in ovum-segmentation, the writers do not overlook that
 such a theory must wait for absolute verification                 till  more     data are
available      as to the      behaviour of the nuclei in both cases, especially
in   spermatogenesis,          for without this a real similarity of process            can
 only be inferred from the likeness of the result.                   It  must be noted
also that the theory in no way falls               with the failure of any           parti
cular instance.            Further,    if it    be  true that      the multitudinous
details of spermatogenesis             can   be morphologically         rationalised      by
collating them with the details of ovum-segmentation, the physio
logical problem remains of interpreting both in terms of that differ
ence in protoplasmic metabolism on which sex must finally depend.
In     a subsequent        paper*     by one of us, these         sex    differences     are
traced      to   a   preponderance of anabolism in the female                   and   kata-
bolism in the male, and              if this conception      be applied to the pre
ceding,      the physiological rationale of the morphological process may
become no longer           wholly unintelligible.

    The first line,  A-F, exhibits      types of ovum segmentation      :— A, regular morula ;
B,    unequal   segmentation,       e.g., in some Molluscs;      C, centrolecithal type, e.g.,
in   Peneus ; D, partial segmentation ; E, the same, with the cells less markedly
denned off from the yolk; F, inverted gastrula or "obgastrula" form, e.g.,
 in   Teleosteans.
     In  the next two lines various types of spermatogenesis are collated with the
 above to illustrate the parallelism : — A' and A", morula type, as in Sponge, Tur-
 bellarian, Spider, &c. ; B' and B", where the division is unequal, and one large
  nutritive cell is seen (Plagiostome fishes, Von la Valette St George); C and C",
 after    Blomfield,   Jensen, be, showing central cytophoral or blastophoral
 nutritive portion     ;  D' and D", sperm-blastoderm,           with a few formative cells
 on large nutritive blastophore, after Gilson, &c. ; E' and E", the same, with
  the sperm cells less definitely separated off, after Von Ebner and his followers ;
  B" and F", "obgastrula type," in which the nutritive portion has come to sur-
  Tound the formative cells, after Swaen and Masquelin, Kenson,               &c.  (See Text. )

all the    elements         of the last column of an alternant he taken, theii
product is divisible by some power of Q(abc . .     This result,                                  .).                          it
will be seen, rests formally on the fact that the said minors are
themselves         alternants.
      First, let   us consider the case where the indices of the minors are
consecutive,         so that           each      minor             is       the difference-product                       of   the
letters which        it     involves.
      Denoting       throughout                the phrase,                   " Product of complementary
minors of elements       of last column" (in any alternant) by Pw                                                              we
see    that (in the case of three letters, a, c), in the case of              b,

the value of         P„     is    obviously
                                       |       aW        |     or £(abc).
Again, in the case of
                                                |   oW                  |
the factor         (a   -   b)    obviously              occurs             only in the cofactors of                          the
elements c" and <P, and similarly                              with           regard to the other factors                      in
the difference-product of a,                        b,   c,   d.
      Thus we have
                              Pm =         |    a°6W               |2        or        £(abcd).
So, in the case of
since the factor            (a    -   b)   obviously occurs only in the cofactors                                        of   the
elements       c",      d", and e",              and similarly                     with regard                to   the    other
factors in the difference-product of a,                                      b,   c,   d,   e,   we have

While, generally (the number of letters a,                                                  b,   c,   . . .   k,

        The    most      cursory examination of the wind                     records    of the Ben
    Nevis      Observatory shows that there                     is,   even   in fine weather, no
    strongly marked daily variation in their direction;                          nothing compar
    able to       the land and sea breezes                 observed      on our own        coasts    in
    summer.        In order         to see whether there was not some regular daily
    change concealed           in the extremely variable winds actually observed,
   I    reduced, by means             of   a   traverse     table, to north-south and west-

    July, August) of            1884 and 1885, taking account                   of the velocity of
    the    wind   as   well    as   of its direction,       so as to get     the actual mean air
    motion at each hour of the day.                    As    the anemometers         at Ben Nevis

tions a considerable       error is thus introduced, especially      at the higher
velocities.        To  reduce   this error as far   as possible,     I   have   only
taken      those days in summer        in which no wind of over force          3 (21
miles an hour) was recorded.               This practically picks out all the
 tine clays, and on these days the daily variation might be supposed
to be better marked than during stormy weather.                  In   the summer
 of 1884 there were 27 such days, and in that of 1885, 47.                    Along

    with each day was included the observation             of the previous mid
    night,   so as to have   the data for correcting    the residual inequality
    in the means.      For  1 884   the mean air motion for the whole day
    was from about       S.W. by     S.,  and  for 1885    from W.N.W.           The
    mean     winds at each hour, however, differed       much from these, and
    in spite of the difference    between the days' means in the two years,
    the   hourly means agreed substantially with           each    other,   both in
    direction and     velocity.      The    two years   were     therefore     added
    together, the mean     wind for the day then coming out             as W.S.W.,
    and of very small velocity, only          about  1J  miles    per    hour.    By

                                                    the mean          wind         for
day from those of the mean wind at any hour, we get what may
be called the difference wind of that hour ; that is to say, the
wind which must be added to the mean wind of the day to produce
the    wind        of that hour.          The difference winds               thus        got show            a
well-marked               diurnal   variation.        From      3     to 8 A.M.          there is            a
northerly         wind of about 2\ miles                 an hour, and from                1 1    a.m. to
2 p.m. there         is    a    south or S.S.E. wind           of about        3    miles an hour-
At    the other hours the difference winds                     are small and             variable in
direction, except about midnight, when there is an indication of                                             a
moderate          difference      wind in the       same direction         as the mean              daily
wind.        This last may           be   due to the daily variation                     in     velocity
(independent of direction) which is such a well-marked feature on
Tien Xevis.  When sufficient data are collected,  hope to be able          I
to get a clue as to how far this diurnal                     variation in velocity is due
to a horizontal wind and how far to vertical                           currents.          It    may     be
noted in passing,               that the hours at which these difference winds
change their direction have no connection                           with the hours of change
of watch at the Observatory,                 so    they cannot be due to any difference
in the estimation of the wind by different observers.
      The most marked features in the diurnal variation are the northerly
winds shortly after sunrise, and the southerly ones about noon.                                          I
think      the most obvious explanation of their cause is to be found                                   in
the shape of Ben Nevis.                   The ridge of the hill            top runs east and
west ; on the north side is a deep gorge                      with precipitous                sides, into
which the sun only penetrates                       for a few hours after sunrise in
summer        ;    the south side consists          of a steep slope going down into
Glen Nevis at an angle of about 30 degrees.                            In the early morning
the sun's rays slanting down                  the northern valley would warm                          the
air in      it,   while the south side of the                hill    was   still cold from            the
night's radiation, and thus cause                    a   northerly wind across the                   top.
As     soon as the sun swings round to the south the                               northern valley
is    in   shade, while the bare stony slope to southward gets wanned                                   in
 its turn, and        a    reverse or southerly wind           is    set up.
      If   the above explanation             is   correct,   these winds are purely local,
 and not connected                with any general system of land and sea                        breezes.
 To attempt to explain them                   on    the latter hypothesis,           I        believe   it
 would be necessary to assume                       that Ben Nevis was in the back

draught of        the land and sea breezes; that the southerly winds                 of
noon      were the overflow from a          low-lying cyclone occupying central
Scotland, and that the midnight westerly winds were the return
current from the lower night land wind feeding an anticyclone
similarly placed ; while the northerly winds shortly after sunrise
could only be accounted for by supposing the daily cyclone to
originate in the upper atmosphere                 shortly after sunrise, and extend
downwards as the heat of the day increased,                   finally dying out    at a
low     level.
   2.  The Meteorology of Ben Nevis.                     By Alex. Buchan, M.A.
      From the      commencement        of the meteorological researches on Ben
 Nevis, a double set of observations have been carried on — one set on
 the top of the Ben, and the other at a station at Fort William near
 the level of the       sea.    It is not so much from the observations made
 on the top considered           by themselves,      as to  their relations to those
 made at the base, that we may hope to arrive at a better knowledge
 of the atmosphere,          and particularly at a better understanding of the
 principles of weather forecasting.                Accordingly,   both stations were
 from the first fitted up with the best instruments.
      The observations on the top are made hourly, and those at Fort
 William six        times a day ; and to the latter station,           in addition,   a
 barograph and a thermograph have been added, the results of which
 are particularly        valuable as affording        a  ready means     of detecting
 inadvertent        errors of observation or of transcription.              Thus the
 system of observation for Ben Nevis                 yields as trustworthy records
 as can    possibly be obtained.            As   regards the observations     of  tem
 perature       at  the Observatory,        it is absolutely    necessary  that these
 be made       with the eye, owing chiefly to the heavy snow-drifts                and
 incrustations of ice, with which                 everything exposed      to the free
 atmosphere        gets frequently covered.          Owing to the violence of the
 winds which occasionally blow for hours together at                 a mean  velocity
 of about      1 20 miles an hour, maximum and minimum thermometers
  do not give trustworthy          results.
      Mr Omond        and his staff of assistants        went into residence in the
  end of November 1883.              The present paper deals with the two and
  a half years' observations from that date, to May 31, 1886.                    From

844                         Proceedings         of    the   Royal Society
these observations, the hourly variation of atmospheric temperature,
pressure, and wind                velocity have        been      calculated, and the results,
illustrated by diagrams,                were submitted           to the meeting.              From        the
double set of observations, it is seen that the rate of decrease of
temperature with height is                     1°   for every 270 feet of ascent.                       This
result has   a    peculiar value attached                   to   it,   seeing     that both at the
(   (hservatory and at the sea-level                   station, the arrangements carried
out are such           as    to    minimise the effects of solar and                          terrestrial
radiation.
     The corrections to sea-level for the barometric observations at the
Observatory,          4406 feet high, have                  been emphatically                determined
from the double set of observations, for each tenth inch                                           of     the
pressure at sea-level             from       28-500 inches to           30-   600 inches, and for
every 2o-0       of the outside temperature from                          18°     -0   to 60 '0.        The
results are closely accordant with the figures for                            a   sea-level      pressure
of 30-000 inches published                     by General Hagan of the U.S. Signal
Office, and      in   use by the American                   observers.          For    each 2°   0   from
18o-0 to 60J-0, the sea-level                   corrections for Ben Nevis are                      0    020
inch greater than the figures of the Signal Office.
     The sea-level corrections for the Observatory have been worked
out from the formula given by Laplace in his Mechanique                                            Celette
in the form employed by the Meteorological Council.                                     At   an outside
temperature       of 45°, the correction derived from the formula                                  is   the
same as the correction                   calculated directly from the observations.
At lower         temperatures,           the    correction from the formula                      steadily
increases,   and at          a     temperature         of 20°, and sea-level                pressure      of
30 000 inches,          it   is   0    040 inch larger than the empirically deter
mined correction.                 At   temperatures higher than 45°, the empirically
determined correction                  is   the larger one.             The       general      result     is,
while by the formula, the correction for each increase of                                     2° of the
temperature           is    0-018 inch less, by the observations directly                            it   is
only     0-015        inch    less,      or the difference         in the correction                for   a
difference   of    2°      of the outside temperature                  is
                                                                       a        sixth     part     greater
than observations shows                 it   to be.



                       of Edinburgh, Session 1885-86.                           845
       3.   On some Algoid Lake-Balls found in South Uist.
            By G. W. W. Barclay, F.R.S.E.                  (Plate  XXX.)
    In   August of last year          I was in South     Uist on an angling expe
dition, and, while fishing one of the lochs on the island, my attention
was drawn to some very remarkable balls that were lying in great
numbers at the bottom.                I examined a good many of these, and
found that they          were    composed     of innumerable algal filaments so
intertwined       and matted        together   as  to form an outer covering of
an almost felt-like consistency, which could, however, be torn open
without difficulty.        This outer coating varied (speaking very roughly)
from about        a  twentieth to two-twentieths of an inch in thickness,
or even more, and the interior of the balls consisted, so far as the
naked eye could         see,  only of mud         The microscope,   of course, tells
a different story.
   I  made a number of inquiries at the time with a view to discover
ing if    possible   the nature and origin of these balls, but beyond the
fact that they were well known to have existed from time imme
morial in this loch (and, it was confidently asserted, in no other
loch    on    the   island),    I   could ascertain     nothing   about them.      I
brought away some of the balls with me, and, failing to find any
mention of them in any books on the Hebrides to which                      I  could
gain access,     I  wrote    to the principal      inhabitants of the island, and
to any one else whom           I  thought likely to be able to assist me in my
efforts to discover what the balls were and how they originated — but
without result.         I was not at that time aware that lake-balls of this
kind    are found      in   several    European countries, and, after making
that discovery,        I  should scarcely       have   thought them sufficiently
curious to justify my taking up even a very little of the time of the
Society, but that some of my friends who had seen them and who
are learned      in botanical matters         seemed to consider them      rarities,
and to think that some account                 of them might be interesting.       I
venture,     therefore,   to offer a very brief description of the balls (of
which     I  have placed a number on the table for inspection), and to
give an account of the locality in which they were found.
   A microscopic examination of              the balls shows that they are com
posed     of a filamentous alga, Cladophora glomerata,                a variety of

846                           Proceedings              of    the       Royal Society
Cladophora          cegagropila                          pictured in
                                              of Rabenhorst, described and
Hassans Algas, p. 213, in part.   I have had two diagrams prepared
showing (a) the appearance of the alga under the microscope, and
(b) a highly-magnified view of one of the filaments ; and I am able,
by the kindness of Professor Dickson, to show under the microscopes
in the ante-room portions                             of the coverings of                   these   balls         (see
Plate    XXX.,          figs. 4, 5, and 6).                  I   must express my special                thanks to
Dr J. M. Macfarlane,                     to whom         I       am indebted for the            microscopical
preparations, and for much kind assistance                                         in other    ways.       Under
one of the microscopes                    will    be found              a    slide showing a portion             of
the contents        of one of the balls.                          The interior is seen to be                filled
with diatoms            and the decomposed                        remains of the inner ends                of the
radiating filaments.                    Some         of the filaments exhibit                   fructification,
the cell contents             in   several        of them being differentiated into spores
which in time will be set free to propagate the plant.
    The loch in which these balls are found — Lower                                             Kildonan by
name     — is   an irregular sheet of water, less than half a mile across                                         in
any direction.            It       lies near the west coast of the island, and is con
nected    with      the sea by the so-called                            "river" Roglass, which              is,   in
reality, little more than                     a   large ditch some                 8   feet broad and about
three-quarters           of   a    mile in length.                     The whole of the west side                 of
South Uist         is   very flat, and the loch itself lies only                           a   few feet above
the sea-level.           Lower Kildonan                 is   a    fresh-water loch, being connected
with     several       other inland               lochs, as        will      be seen from the Ordnance
Survey map         ;    and its water, except when and where the tide from
the Roglass enters
                                   it,
                                   is       fresh.      It        is,   however, precisely at this part
of the loch where                  the water           is    occasionally rendered               brackish         by
the tide that these balls occur, and this                                   is   interesting in view of the
fact that Cladoplinra                    cegagropila              is    found both in fresh and salt
water.       The loch here               is   quite shallow, and the bottom seems to be
a   mixture      of sand and mud, the former predominating.                                             The balls
lie in   a   depth of         2    to   3   feet, and cover areas of many square yards,
showing conspicuously by their dark colour against the light sandy
bottom.         They lie alongside of one another in great numbers, and
vary in size from about                       a   quarter of an inch to                    3   or   4   inches in
diameter.          In    some           cases     a   complete              small ball    is   found inside       a
larger one, and           a    specimen           of this kind               is   on the table.         Mr Mac-
Lean of Milton told me he had frequently                                               seen balls containing

                           of Edinburgh, Session 1885-86.                             847
more than           one smaller one, but       I  did not come across any case of
this sort. The balls are for               the most part spherical or nearly so,
but a considerable proportion               of them are irregular in shape, as the
specimens exhibited show.                 I heard them described not badly, if in
 a somewhat unscientific way, by one of the islanders as being like
 " a lot of potatoes." The smaller the balls the more spherical do
 they seem to be. I unfortunately made no attempt to secure the
 largest        I  met with, but 1 remember          au angler saying he had seen
 one hall "as big as his hat." As this gentleman was a clergyman
 there could, of course, be no doubt as to the correctness of his
 statement, and the only question is                as to  the size of his head, which
  I stupidly        omitted to measure.         I can  only say that     I saw no balls
  of anything like the           size of my own head.
      There       are three sets of the balls on the table here this evening —
  (1) some of          those which     I took   out of the loch in August last, and
  which have          been   lying untouched ever since ; (2) some which Mr
  Charles MacLean of Milton (whose farm is close to the loch) was
  good enough to get for me during the winter                   ;  (3) some which were
   sent to me last week by              Mr Meams, the obliging hotel-keeper             at
   Lochboisdale, whose            inn — a most comfortable house — is about            7£
   miles from Lower Kildonan.                Illustrations    of two of the balls exhi
   bited are given on the accompanying Plate.                    Figs. 1 and  2 represent
    one of the fresh balls not many days out of the water.                  Fig. 3 shows
    a dried specimen,         taken from the loch nearly a year ago.
       I   have also placed on the table a very interesting             ball of the  same
    description,      which has been lent to me by Professor L. Fischer of the
    Botanical Gardens in Bern, and which comes, he tells me, from Elles-
    mere,     in Shropshire. At a meeting of the Naturforschende Gesell-
    schaft of Bern in 1884, Professor Fischer referred to these algoid
    lake-balls,     of which he says a number of varieties are distinguished
    according to the structure of the filaments and the size of the balls.
    He says they are met with in lakes chiefly in Sweden, Norway,
     Northern Germany, Austria, and Upper                Italy ;  and he adds that they
     are also    found in the   sea  ("auch marine Fundorte werden angegeben").
     I wrote     to Professor Fischer, and received from him this English lake-
     ball.     It will be  seen that the filaments are longer and more silky, and
     of a somewhat       different shade of green from the other balls exhibited.
        I have      mentioned that the people in South Uist, to whom                I  put
     my    first questions regarding the balls, asserted that they were found

848                     Proceedings    of tlie   Royal Society
in  no other loch in the island except             Lower    Kildonan.       But      they
went further than this, and          I found     in the course of my inquiries           a
very persistent and ever-recurring legend,                that only   in one        other
loch in Scotland          were  these   curiosities to be found,       most of         my
informants adding that that other loch was in Orkney.                      Mr    Angus
MacLennan,        for example, Lady Gordon            Cathcart's factor     in    South
Uist, writes — "      I  understand the same kind of balls are to be found
in some other       one  loch only in Scotland."
    Mr Ranald MacDonald, her Ladyship's factor at Cluny Castl>\
says, in reply to a question — I did hear that similar balls were
                                        "
found in a certain place in Orkney, but                I am sorry that     my infor
mation is of     a  very general and indefinite character."
   Mr MacLean           of Milton writes — "       I  believe they are not to be
found in any loch in Scotland.              I   heard some gentlemen, a good
many years ago, make the remark that they were found in one loch
in Orkney, but whether that statement                 was correct   or not,    I  have
no proof of     it."
   And Mr Campbell,             the  oldest Roman          Catholic  priest   in     the
island, writes — " I heard only of         one other loch in which these balls
were     found, but the locality in which it is situated               I  cannot re
 member now."
   I  followed up the hint        as to  Orkney, and communicated with Mr
J.  W. Cursiter of Kirkwall, who is            a  Fellow of   the Society of     Anti
quaries,    and a well-known          authority      on   Orcadian   matters.       He
asserts positively that no such balls have been found in the Orkney

4.     The Duration of                     the Life of Red          Blood     Corpuscles, as
            ascertainable by Transfusion.                      By William Hunter, M.D.
            (Edin.), late President of the Royal                          Medical             Society,
            Edinburgh.
                                               (Abstract.)
      The question            as to   the normal duration of the life of red blood
 corpuscles            has hitherto been considered more as a matter for specu
 lative inquiry than for experimental proof.                            Attempts         have     from
 time to time             been made by various observers                to solve    it experimen
 tally, by injecting the blood of                      one animal into the circulation               of
 another, whose blood                  corpuscles      were    of different   size and shape,
 and then noting how long the foreign blood corpuscles remained
 discoverable in the body of their host. As might have been antici
 pated, the success of such experiments has not been very striking.
        Marfels and Moleschott,               so early as      1856, arrived       in this way        at
     the conclusion          that the normal duration of their life must be a very
     long      one, since even after the lapse of months they could                       still   recog
     nise the corpuscles           of the sheep in the circulation of the frog.
          Brown-Sequard,            also    (1857),     made     some    similar    observations,
     with, it must be confessed, somewhat anomalous results                          ;    for whilst
     the blood corpuscles             of the dog or rabbit were recognisable in the
     blood of fowls a month after injection                        into the    circulation,          on
     the other hand, the blood corpuscles                     of fowls were not to be found
     in   the blood of dogs or rabbits even one hour after injection.
          These results were           not well reconcilable with each other.                       The
     latter observation was probably the more                      correct of the two, since
      as is    now known from the experiments of Panum, Landois, Ponfick,
      and others, such a method               of investigation, implying           as    it   does the
      use of      "dissimilar" blood,          i.e.,   blood derived from an animal of
      another species,            is doomed from the outset to failure, the blood
      corpuscles of such blood when introduced                       into the body of their
      host always breaking             down within a few hours of injection, and in
      larger quantities being directly poisonous to the organism into which
      they are injected.
          It   is,   therefore,   only by transfusion of
                                                                 " similar " blood, i.e., blood
       derived from an animal of the same species, that any results bearing
       on the        question can be arrived at.               That the corpuscles of such

850                     Proceedings      of iht Royal Socidy
blood continue to live, for            a  certain time at least, in      the body       of
their host, was to be assumed from some of the very                  earliest experi
ments      on transfusion       made    by Dr Lower in 1666, in          which       dogs
continued        in good health, after all the blood in their             bodies      had
been replaced        by that obtained from other dogs.
     The first observer,       however, to make direct observations on the
actual duration of the         life of such transplanted or transfused blood
 corpuscles      was  Panum in 1863.
     His method       was crude and inaccurate.         He judged of     the number
 of corpuscles       present   in any quantity of blood by the difference in
 specific gravity between         the blood serum, and the blood        defibrinated.
 In this      way, after withdrawing         blood from a dog and replacing it
 with defibrinated blood,            he was     enabled   to  show that     two days
 later the number of blood corpuscles                 remained almost unaltered,
 and that five days later the majority of them still remained                  within
 the circulation.
     It  was naturally impossible by this rough method to                  determine
 more closely the further fate of the transplanted                corpuscles.     This
 could only be done by actual enumeration of the corpuscles before
 and after the injection,         a method of investigation        at that time un
 known      ;  but even since its introduction, the results obtained have
 not been       so  definite as d   priori might     have   been expected.      They
 serve, however, to throw some             light  on the subject.
     There are two ways in which, by means of transfusion, information
 as    to the duration       of the life of red blood corpuscles          may be ob
 tained, viz., either by transfusion of blood into an animal without
 foregoing depletion, or by transfusion of blood after previous with
 drawal of some of the animal's own blood.
     In   the latter case, the difficulty is to determine afterwards            what
 proportion of the blood corpuscles                found   present   belong to      the
 animal, and what proportion is derived from the transfused blood ;
  since by the withdrawal of blood the standard of comparison, —
  the number of corpuscles             originally present, — has been lost.        The
  difficulty is one which from its very nature it is quite impossible
 for us to overcome.
      It might     be thought that in the former method,           viz., transfusion
  without      any foregoing depletion, we have at hand               a ready  means
 of ascertaining the duration of life of the red blood corpuscles,               since

                            of Edinburgh, Session 1885-86.                             851
the normal            standard is in no way interfered with, and the dura
tion of the           increase    in   the number      of blood corpuscles after the
transfusion will, therefore, represent the extent of their duration
of life.
      This     ia indeed the case,           so far as the tranfused corpuscles         are
 concerned         ; but the question always arises, how far the duration of
 life of      such transplanted blood corpuscles can be taken as               a criterion
 of that of normal red blood corpuscles.                  By transfusion of blood into
  the circulation of a healthy animal, an abnormal condition of the
  blood — a so-called plethora — is for the time being brought aboui,
  which, so far as we know, may very materially influence the duration
   of life of the injected corpuscles.             The excess of blood corpuscles thus
   introduced        can only be got         rid of by   a process of increased      blood
   destruction       on the part       of the organism, and thus the transfused
   blood corpuscles          are not placed under exactly the same conditions
    as those under which they normally run their                 life  course.   In spite,
    however, of these disadvantages,              this method enables us to arrive at
    least at an approximate estimate.
        Worm-Muller found after such transfusions in                   dogs, that two or
     three days afterwards the number of blood corpuscles                  present  in  the
     blood closely corresponded            with the number of       the original plus the
     injected corpuscles,        but that a few days later the blood corpuscles
     began to break down, and by the end of a few weeks at most the
      whole of the injected corpuscles had been removed from the body.
      The greater the quantity            of blood transfused, the longer did this
      process of removal last        ;  for whilst after the transfusion of 20 to 30
      per- cent of blood the whole of the injected corpuscles were removed
      in the course of a few days, after injection              of 60 to 80 per cent,
      their removal      was not complete        till about the end of      the second or
      even the    third week.
          According to these results, therefore, the longest duration of life
       of transplanted     corpuscles     in  dogs would be about 2 to 3 weeks.
          Quincke's      more   recent     observations, also made on dogs, would
       seem to agree      with this     estimate,   the duration of life according to
       him being      at least    2  or   3   weeks.    His method      of investigation,
       however,    is open to the objection that the percentage                amount of
       haemoglobin     in the blood, which he always estimated, does not always
       necessarily   correspond with the number of blood                  corpuscles pre

852                   Proceedings     of the   Royal Society
sent.     With this reservation, his statement may              he accepted       as at
east corroborative of that of        Worm-Muller.
    The result of my own experiments, made on rabbits, go                       in the
main to confirm the accuracy of this estimate              of Worm-Muller and
Quincke.
    The method of transfusion adopted by myself differed somewhat
from that of previous           observers.      Instead    of being       introduced
directly into the circulation through a vein, the blood was injected
into the peritoneal cavity, the absorption              from which, as is well
known,      is so rapid and continuous,          that peritoneal injection         has
claims to be considered as a slow method of intravenous injection.
In    some respects,    indeed, for experimental purposes it offers advan
 tages over the latter, since, apart from the greater              simplicity with
 which the operation can be carried out, the            absorption into the cir
 culation (mainly through the lymphatics of the diaphragm and the
 thoracic duct) is so continuous and steady, prolonged as it is over
 a period of some 24 to 48 hours, that time is given during
 its progress for the removal of the fluid part of the blood, and hence
 little or no distension of the vascular         system is   likely   to occur   after
 the injection of even the largest quantities.
     The method is naturally open          to the objection,     that the fact of
 the blood corpuscles having been extravasated before                   reaching the
 circulation    may possibly affect their vitality, and thus shorten the
 duration of their life.       That  a certain number of them, under such
 circumstances always suffer a local death, is certain ; but this number
 is relatively small, and, as       will   be seen, the results show that the
 vitality of   those   absorbed is not in any way affected by their tem
 porary sojourn in the peritoneal cavity.
     The increase in the number of corpuscles            in the blood        as ascer
 tained by actual enumeration, after reaching a maximum                        on the
 second or    third day,    became    gradually less and less,      till at the   end
 of   a certain time, varying somewhat in the different experiments,
 the number of blood corpuscles had returned to their normal, this
 period of time representing, therefore, the duration of life of the
 injected corpuscles      in that particular    case.
     The experiments        were   made     both with defibrinated          and with
 entire blood.       The duration of the increase         after the injection of
 entire blood was      :— In two experiments          26 days,    in   one 21 days,

                            of Edinburgh, Session 1885-86.                             853
in     one 19         days,   and in one 14 days; average life duration being
thus 21           days.    With defibrinated blood the time varied from              14 to
 21 days, or           an average of 17    J days.
      The        longest duration     of life of transfused blood corpuscles              in
 rabbits          may, therefore, be taken as from        2  to 4 weeks.
       This       applies naturally to only a few of the corpuscles              injected,
  doubtless the youngest and, therefore, the most resistant at the
  time of injection. The great majority become destroyed at a much
  earlier period, oftentimes with great rapidity.
        The quantities of blood injected were very large, varying from
   about 40         to 90 per cent., but after the injection            of smaller quan
   tities the return to          the normal was complete            in a few days   (5-7).
   It     is thus probable that         the above     period   does    not represent    the
   average life duration of transplanted corpuscles.                   On the contrary,
   all the observations         go to show that     it is more    in virtue of   the large
    numbers injected than of any special vitality of the corpuscles, that
    some       of them   succeed  in remaining      so long in the circulation.
          Small quantities of blood are, therefore,            probably removed       from
    the body in a few days, judging                at least   from the rapidity       with
    which large numbers of corpuscles,               e.g., 40   percent,    are destroyed
     in from        14 to 21 days, i.e., a destruction          of blood at a rate of
     some 2 to 3 per cent,          daily, in addition to the normal amount of
     blood destruction going on in the body.
          This consideration is of importance, in view of the value to
      be attached to the operation of transfusion               in   man,  in whom      the
      quantities of blood transfusible are relatively so very small.
           The question    then arises, how far the results obtainable in rabbits
      are applicable     to the case of other animals.           Since the metabolism
      of the body probably varies somewhat             in  each different species, may
      it   not be that the duration of       life of the blood       corpuscles  likewise
       varies 1
           As has     been   seen, the    results obtained in dogs and rabbits
       agree    in a somewhat      striking    manner,    and certainly do not lend
       much      support   to the above view.           They both alike point        to    a
       period of some      two to four weeks         as being the longest duration
        of life of transfused blood corpuscles.
            On the  other hand, from two experiments which               I made   on dogs,
        it would   almost appear as      if in   them the process of blood destruc

 854                Proceedings        of tin Royal Society
tion were in reality more rapid than in rabbits, in one                      case     the
normal being reached          on the sixth, in the other on the eighth              day.
The quantities of blood injected were, however, relatively very small.
    The results of these experiments go to support the                  view      previ
ously expressed,     that the duration of life of transfused              corpuscles
is dependent more         on the activity of the        blood-destroying        organs,
than on the vitality of the blood corpuscles             themselves.      An     excess
of blood corpuscles      is not tolerated by the organism for           any     length
of time.      Hence it is more          natural    to assume     that   the     period
required for the destruction of the injected corpuscles                   is   shorter
than that     of the normal        duration     of life of the     red corpuscles,
than to assume        the    reverse,   viz., that    transfused corpuscles          are
capable    of living longer in the circulation            than the animal's own
blood corpuscles.
   Such are the results obtainable by transfusion without foregoing
depletion.      Although,      as already indicated, they are          more to       be
relied on than those obtained by transfusion after depletion,                    some
very interesting results are still obtainable by the latter method.
Attention    has not before been drawn to these            in this connection.
   Von Ott found in experiments on              dogs, that after injection of an
equal   quantity of    ^  per cent, common salt solution           in place   of   the
blood previously withdrawn              to § of its total quantity), the number
of red corpuscles    remaining in the blood reached their minimum,                 not
on the day of injection, but two or three             days later;    and from this
time onwards a steady and continuous rise took place, reaching                     the
normal from the 16th to the 24th day after the operation.
     If blood serum      instead   of salt solution were injected, the         result
was the same, viz., the normal was reached              in from   17 to 24 days.
    In other words,     the blood behaved         as if  no fluid at  all had been
injected  ;  for Hunerfauth        had previously       shown that under         such
circumstances,     viz., after simple loss         of blood, the return       to the
normal was not complete           till  the  19th to the 23rd day, and Lyon
had similarly found that the time required varied from 19 to 25                 days.
   The time required, therefore,         for  the blood to   return to the   normal
after bleeding, viz.,
                            16-24 days (Von Ott),
                            19-23 days (Hunerfauth),
                            19-25 days (Lyon),—

                           of Edinburgh, Session 1885-86.                         855
is almost         exactly the same as that required      for the removal    of  excess
of    blood     corpuscles,   viz., —
                                  14—21  days (Quincke),
                                  14-21 days (Worm-Miiller),
                                  14-26 days (myself).
      This     similarity in the results is probably more than a mere coin
 cidence, and          can only be explained by assuming that after loss            of
 blood the return to the normal              is effected,  partly by an increased
  formation, but mainly through             a diminished     destruction of blood
  corpuscles       ;  and the time taken for complete         restoration probably
  thus      represents     approximately the average duration of life of the
   newly-formed red corpuscles.
       But Von Ott further found, that             if  after withdrawing      J  to  §
   of the blood         he replaced    this quantity with an equal      quantity of
   defibrinated or entire blood obtained from another dog, the result
   was not, as might have been expected,              that the restoration in the
   number of the animal's blood corpuscles              was from that time com
    plete   ;  on the contrary, from the day of injection a gradual fall in
    their number occurred till          a  minimum     was reached    on the nine
    teenth to the twenty-second day, not on the second,              as  after trans
    fusion of salt solution or serum,           and from that time onward            a
    gradual increase       in their number took   place, reaching the normal two
    to three weeks later.
        If  we assume, therefore, that this period of nineteen to twenty -two
     days represented the time taken for the destruction of the injected cor
     puscles, and      there is no reason to assume     otherwise, since after the
     injection of simple saline solution the minimum was reached on the
     second or    third day, then we must conclude that this period repre
     sented   the duration of life of the injected corpuscles under conditions,
      viz., amemia, the very reverse of that obtaining after the production
      of an artificial plethora.

    The evidence thus obtained in so many different ways all agrees
in pointing to    a  period of some three or four weeks        as  being  the
 longest duration of life of transfused blood corpuscles.
    It  has alroadybeon    seen that the probabilities     are all in favour
 of this life-duration   being shorter, rather than longer, than that of
 the normal red blood      corpuscles,    so much so at least as to   justify
 the assumption, that this period of time represents          approximately
 the average duration      of the life of red blood corpuscles in         the
 rabbit, the dog,  and presumably also in man.

       I will   commence my paper        with   a brief description of the typical
characters of           a reef   in this region, referring particularly         to  the
 distribution        of the     corals.   There   would     appear   to be a large
 number of new specific forms            among the reef-corals     of these islands,
 •whether hydroid or actinoid.             Out of nearly seventy      species that    I
 sent to the British Museum, almost a quarter are new or nndescribed ;*
 and there is every probability that similar success will fall to the
 lot     of other collectors in these         seas.    There is yet much to be
 learned of       the fauna    of  the deeper parts of the reef-coral     zone ; and
  patient dredging will doubtless yield fruitful resulta Here, not
  improbably, will be found the corals of deep-sea genera and the
  Rhyncvnella        that   I  discovered in an upraised barrier-reef in the
   Shortland      Islands,   f   Having only    a small canoe,   I  was not able to
   dredge in these depths; but            I may remark, as a good omen for
   others, that, when sounding off a reef on one occasion,                I   brought
   up from     a depth of 14 fathoms a new and very distinct               species   of
   Distichopora       (D. ochracea), which is described and figured by Mr
   J. J.  Quelch in the Annals and Magazine of Natural History for
   July 1885.
       In describing     a typical reef,  I will begin with    the reef-flat.     This
   portion of     a reef   is generally some 500 or 600 yards across.              Its
   surface, which       is for the most part strewn with sand, is covered at
   low tide by a depth of water of from             a few inches to a foot, with
   here and there a projecting block            of dead coral and an exposed
   bank of sand           Living coral   is comparatively scarce on the reef-
      *
        Owing to ill-health, Mr Stuart Ridley has not hitherto been able to pro
   ceed  with the description of the new species.    I am, however, grently indebted
   to him for a preparatory list of the collection.        A probably new genus is
   represented by one of the specimens.       I sent to the Australian Museum at
   Sydney a collection of large specimens, which probably contains additional
   new species.

flat; but every now and then occurs                       a   bed of      Madrepora having
the living tips of its branches bared by the retreating tide.                                 Small
nobs and bosses of Porites* (P. tenuis, V., and gaimardi, E. & H.)
lie   loose   on the        sand.       Tufts of that fragile coral, Seriat"}>ora
pacifica     (Br.),     are to be       occasionally seen.             Numerous molluscs,
annelids, and echinoids find               a home      in the blocks of partially dead
massive      corals.       Holothurians,          star-fishes, and sea-urchins               lie in
numbers on the sand             ;   while those singular alga?, Halimeda ojntritia
and Carderpa sp., grow on different parts of the flat.
    I  now come to the description of the weather margin of a reef in
these islands.           Traversing       a surface       formed of loose fragments of
dead     corals,     aptly compared            with    a   bed of clinkers,         one stands
within    the wash of the breakers,               which even in the calmest             weather
hurl themselves            with apparently irresistible              fury against the          reef.
 A gradual      slope of comparatively bare rock, furrowed by fissures or
channels and descending to                a   depth of      4  or  5   fathoms, receives the
 wash of the breakers.!                With the exception of               a  tiny clump of         a
 Pocillopora        or   a  Stylophora,        or a large       dome-shaped          mass of        a
 Meandrina        or   a Cceloria,      that may be occasionally exposed                  during
 the recoil of the waves, this sloping surface                    is largely bare of       living
 coral.    It   is only in the fissures            which traverse the slope that the
 corals   may be truly             said   to    thrive.      Here the         Stylophora        (sp.
 mordax, D.) and the Pocillopora% that were just mentioned, attain
 to some size.          Here also flourish small masses of a Porites, and a
  Cietoria, an encrusting Montipora,                  compressed         tufts of Madrepora
 ajipresm (D., var.), and              a  bossy Madrepora             hitherto undescribed.
 As    I  have       already      indicated,      the    large    massive      corals  are only
 occasionally to be seen in the wash of the breakers.                              They    prefer
 t he less accessible        part of the reef, beyond the first line of rollers.
  In truth, it     may be generally stated that corals do not thrive                       in    the
 break of the trade-swell in these regions.                          They are only to             be
 found in luxuriance on the slopes of the declivity                             that is usually
 situated in depths between                 5   and 15 fathoms, a declivity                which
  may be    truly termed       the growing edge of the reef. §                  Now and      then,

however,           as at low-water springs, some large block is torn off by the
rollers       and cast upon the reef: it is at these unusually low con
ditions       of the tide, especially when they follow upon                         a succession      of
gales, that the            greatest destruction is effected on the weather slope.
There        is,
          for instance, very stout species of Pocillopora that seems
                                  a
to flourish just beyond the ordinary position of the first line of
breakers.            When,      however,        at     low-water         springs        the   seas   are
unusually heavy, fragments of its large branches are broken off and
thrown up on the flat. The two algse, Halimeda qpuntia and                                            a
species of Caulerpa,             are often attached             to the rocks in the wash of
 the surf,         and Nulliporce      partially encrust the surface                ;    but the last
 mentioned are of no thickness, and never form those raised margins
 described by             Mr Darwin in the           case    of Keeling Atoll and of other
 reefs.
       The     foregoing       remarks     refer        to      such     reefs     as    receive     the
 brunt of the trade-swell.                 There are other reefs, however, such
 as     the barrier-reef of Choiseul                  Bay,      which are placed in more
 protected situations, where they are not exposed                                  to such heavy
 rollers.          Here the corals      living in the             wash    of the breakers are
  more numerous and             in    greater    variety.         In     addition to the corals
  above      mentioned, there are to be found here                        a      gamboge-coloured
  Parties (P. parvistella, Quelch), growing in flattened nobs, together
  with small masses of that singular-looking coral Hydnophora
  microcona (L.).            Madreporce, such         as    usually prefer the quieter waters
  of the lagoon, here attempt to flourish                   ;   but they are to be frequently
  observed broken             off at their base of attachment.                      There may be
  also noticed,       growing in the wash of the rollers, the vertical plates
  of    the hydrozoan corals, Heliopora                     ccendea* and Millepora platy-

        On the lee sides of small coral               islands, where they are protected
  to   a   great extent from the swell, the massive and branching corals
  coexist     in    great profusion.      Here, on account of the absence of the
  heavy       rollers,      they do not form               a   continuous reef-flat,          but are

860                   Proceedings     of  the   Royal Society
gathered    together in irregular patches or masses, that sometimes rise
with wall-like      sides from depths of 12 or 15 feet of water.                    Such
patches are covered        with   a luxuriant growth of coral, and there is
little or nothing of those sandy flats which              I  have described in the
case of reefs    that are exposed        to the trade-swell.          The following
description of     a  particular locality may be taken as fairly            typical.
    In the shallow depths of         a fathom and under at low             tide, there
flourished both massive and branching species of Pontes                    (P. tenuis,
V., and P.lcevis, D.), three species        of Millepora (M. intrieata, E. & H.,
and gonagra, E. & H., together with an unnamed flat branching
species), the singular Rhodorrh<ea*          lagren<ei(E. &     H.), and Seriatopora
pacifica (Br.)   and hystrix (D.).       Less frequent, though still abundant
in this shallow water,          were  the massive        corals,    Cceloria dirdalea
(E. & S.), and another unnamed species of the same genus;                         Favia
rohdosa    (E   & S.), with another species also unidentified; Solenastraa
sarcinida     (E. & H.); and undescribed species of Goniastrcea and
Rhodorrhma.          With these were associated Mussa multilobata (D.),
and other species of the same genus, Siylophora pulrnata (BL), and
different forms of Pocillopora and Madrepora.                 Rhodorrhcea     lagrtnai
occurred    in level tufted beds of a dark-brown colour, which were
traversed     by single vertical plates          of the undescribed species            of
Millepora,     above referred to.       I frequently      observed the association
of these two corals in this region.                 In depths of from           2  to   8
fathoms, there existed thickets of the branching Porites                     (P.  Icevis,
1).), which also lived, but in less profusion,             in the shallower water,
being associated       in depths of from         2 to  3  fathoms, with extensive
beds    of Rlwdorrlwa          lagrenad.        The   stout columns of IsojM/ra
 (Aladrepora)     lalrrosa (D.) were occasionally to be seen at different
depths.      Now and then a huge castellated pile of a massive Pontes
 rose up from a depth of 12 or 15 feet to                 within half    a fathom       of
the surface.       Beds of Alcyonarians         encrusting the dead corals were
interspersed amongst the living corals.                  A    species   of Anthelia^
 occurred   most    frequently, its stoloniferous base often investing the
 dead branches      of Porites Iwvis.       A    pretty Xenia was less common,
 being attached       to the same      species     of Porites,      and often to the

of     other Alcyonarians, resembling, but on a much more extensive
scale, our      common       British Alcyonium.
      It   will  have    been     observed   in   the   foregoing description that
tliickets of Porites           Icevis principally    usurped the depths between
2 and       8 fathoms.        Such, however, was not my usual experience               in
these localities,          these depths     on the     lee sides    of islands     being
generally occupied by arborescent               and  other branching Madreporte.
 In    Selwyn Bay, on the lee side of Ugi Islands,                  these Madreporce
 throve in the shallower portion of the reef-coral zone in depths less
 than 10 fathoms ; whilst Seriatoporce * seemed to prefer the deeper
 parts of the zone in depths of 20 fathoms.                     This accords  with Mr
  Darwin's       experience       on the   leeward side of Mauritius.!             It   is
  manifest, however, that we have little or no acquaintance with the
  causes that favour or prevent the growth                  of particular   species    of
  corals in any one locality         ; and thus we often meet with unexpected
  facts.     For   instance,     the stout coral, Isqpora labrosa      (D.) is  able   to
  adapt itself to any situation, whether on the weather slopes of reefs
  in depths beyond          5  fathoms, or on the dark muddy bottom of man
  grove-skirted channels,          or in the clearer water of lagoons.         I  might
  mention several other examples              of the same kind amongst certain
  species of Porites         and MUlepora.        A   species    of Madrepora,\ that
  commonly        came      up in my soundings from depths of                8   to    12
   fathoms on the weather slopes of reefs, appeared in one locality to
   flourish at similar depths on the lee or protected side of an island.§
       I  come now to refer to the corals that grow in the interior of
   lagoons and lagoon-channels.            A   large   extent is occupied by sand
   and chalky mud         ;  but in the shallower portions, and especially in
   those situations which are near the breaks              in  the reef, corals   thrive
   in great profusion.          These quiet waters are more particularly              the
   home of the foliaceous and branching corals.                  Amongst the former
   may be observed          Turbinaria frondens (D.), Mendina ampliata (E.
    &   S.),   Oxypora       contorta (Quelch),       and    species   of  Pachyseris,
      *
         Probably a new species, as Mr Ridley informs me.

      + This coral, according to Mr Quelch, closely resembles M. cerealis of the
    West Indies.     Its range of depth appears to be 2 to 13 fathoms.

Halomitra tiara (V.), and               a    species     of Podabacia               not yet deter
mined.       The     massive        corals here        found         are    species       of Porite*
usually possessing         flat dead summits, and often                     8   to 10 feet across          ;

lagoons and lagoon-channels occur Heliopora coerulea,* and Ieopora

openings in the reef, and all places where    can be exposed to  it                                    a
plentiful supply of sea-water.         This hydroid coral, together with                               a
massive species         of R/todorrhwa, with which        associated, covers
                                                                       it   is
a   considerable portion of the bottom of                      a       small boat-harbour             in
Oima Atoll.          Isopora labrosa often attaches                     itself      to and partly
invests Millepora gonagra (E.    H.). Alcyonarians also flourish
                                              &
in the quiet waters of the lagoon amongst them are species of

Alnjonium, Xenia,              and Anthelia.            The       Xenia           may       occur     in
extensive    beds encrusting           and concealing the unsightly patches of
the dead     branching corals.           A       huge empty Tridacna shell, which
was covered        on    the   outer surfaces          of its valves with this                  pretty
Alcyonarian,       formed quite          a   picture in Oima Atoll.                       Occasional
masses of the Alcyonarian coral,             T    ubipora sp., are also to be observed.
Amongst the        algae      that thrive in lagoons,            is     an edible         species     of
Caulerpa, which          is   distinct from the non-edible species that grows
on the reef-flatand in the wash of the surf (vide                            p.   859).
    The observing naturalist will find abundant                                  material      for   the
study of the complex relations that exist between the multitudes                                      of
creatures    that frequent coral reefs.                The protective colouring of                   the
small crabs that live among the branching corals often attracted my
attention.   I     recall in particular the instance of                     a     small crab that
finds its home amongst              the branches        of   a   Pocillopora.              The light
purple colour of its carapace                    corresponds with                 the    hue of the

coral at         the base of the branches, where          it lives  ;   whilst   the light-
red, colour of            the big claws, as they are held up in their usual
attitude,         similarly imitates the colour of the branches                themselves.
 To      make the        guise more complete,      both carapace and claws possess
 rude hexagonal markings which correspond exactly both                               in  size
 and appearance with the polyp-cells of the coral. Another                            species
 of     crab, that climbs about the blue-tipped branches of                 a Madrepora,
  has the        points of its pincer-claws similarly coloured.             It  is interest
  ing      to note that      these two crabs are adapted to live each on its own
   species of        coral.     Had   I   caused   them to exchange          their homes,
   their     borrowed hues and markings would have at once made them
   conspicuous objects for their             enemies.
         The Inter-Tidal Exposure of Living Corals. — A short exposure to
    the air is generally stated to be fatal to living corals. The state
    ment of Mr Beete Jukes that an exposure of two or three hours to
    the air, sun, (and rain), will not kill many of the coral polyps as long
     as they are left in their position of growth and thus retain their
     moisture,      has not often been          quoted, but    it nevertheless       accords
     with my experience.*
          Different kinds of       reef-corals,  however, bear different degrees of
      inter-tidal exposure.         The minimum       amount is to be seen in the
      case of many of the massive            and branching      species, which       at low
       tide, and especially at         " low water springs,"       are bared for a few
       seconds twice or three times         in the minute,     as the larger waves roll
       past them.        To this group belong species of Porites, Meandrina,
        Seriatopora      (hystrix, D., and pacifica Br.), and Millepora, &c.
        Then, there are corals which can sustain exposure to the extent of
        from 5 to 10 inches for an hour          with impunity,      as long as they are
        washed over by a wave every three or four minutes.                 Such corals are
        Heliopwa eamdea, Millepora platyphylla (Ehr.), and intricata(E. &
         H.), Stylophora mordax (D.), Pocillopora sp., and several species
         of Madrepora.        Lastly, we come to the corals           that can withstand
         continuous exposure       for from one to two hours without              injury.    I
         have seen   the nobs of Porites tenuis (V.), which are so common on
         the reef-flats,  uncovered for nearly three-quarters of an hour.                The
         living margin of     a- boss of   a Symphyllia    I have seen exposed to the
          extent of 6  inches for about an hour.         Some of the      Madrepora        are
                           *

  particularly     hardy in this respect.           At "low water springs" the
  extensive beds of a species of Madrepora, that thrives on reef- flats, are
  uncovered to the extent of       5 or  6  inches for an hour and a       half ; and
  other species, such as M. hyacinthus (D.), will bear exposure equally
  welL      Of all the corals in these islands, however, those belonging
  to the genus Cceloria appear to be best able to withstand prolonged
  exposure.       I have seen living blocks of these massive corals bare to
  the extent of from 12 to 18 inches at the lowest tides.                A lump of
  Cceloria dtedalea (E. & S.), that          I   observed on one      reef, had its
 upper surface exposed for almost two hours ; and                I have  frequently
 noticed the living margin of another species of the same genus to
 be uncovered to the extent of several inches for about an hour.
 On one occasion, five hours after I had taken two lumps of this
 last species out of the water,      I placed      them with some other corals      in
 a closed perforated      tin that was kept       in  the sea, a foot or two   below
 the surface,     for a couple of days.      On opening the tin,       I  found    all
 the specimens       of coral decomposed,        with the exception of one of
 the lumps of Cceloria, which was quite fresh and apparently                     still
alive.
     The soft beds of Alcyonarians         are sometimes       completely exposed
for    5 or 6  inches at the lowest tides.         The Xenice, however,     I rarely,
if    ever, saw bared.      Many other organisms living on the reefs are
able to     withstand inter-tidal exposure.           Thus, in Oima Atoll      I saw
tufts of Sertularians and the common blue star-fish (Ophidiasier                   ? )
uncovered at        "low water springs."          At the   same time two of the
large Tridacnce       (T. gigas), that lay on their hinge-borders upon the
sand, were       partially exposed.     One of them was half out of the
water, and must have been uncovered for at least an hour.
     Coral Reefs and Shoals. — The earliest condition of the coral reefs
in this group is to be found in that of the numerous detached sub
merged      reefs   or shoals lying below the limit of the constructive
power* of the breakers,        which in the sheltered waters between the
larger islands rise up to within 4 or          5   fathoms from the surface, and
in the    more open waters, where they are exposed              to the trade-swell,
are covered by a depth of from 7 to 10 fathoms.
       By this expression I mean that the reefs had not reached that level at
    *
which the breakers would be able to tear off and heap up fragments of the
corals.

   Lark Shoal,              a submerged     reef which rises between the islands of
TJlaua         and the Three Sisters from a depth of 200 fathoms, is
covered by             a   minimum     depth of      7   fathoms.       It   is exposed to the
full     force of the trade-swell, and its position is often marked by a
dangerous tide-rip.               As limited by the          20 fathom line, this shoal
measures          1 by 1£ miles.    The numerous soundings obtained by
               Oldham and the officers of the " Lark gave no indication of

a central hollow on its surface. On the contrary, they showed that
the shoal possesses a comparatively level summit covered by from 7
to 10 fathoms of water. From the ship's side the dome-shaped
 massive         corals     could be discerned;          and the paucity of branching
 corals       was evidenced by the absence of fragments                          in   the armings of
 the     lead.        In most of the soundings the armings                        were   clean ;   but
 occasionally portions of the joints of the calcareous alga, Halimeda
 ojmntia, together with            coral sand and gravel, were brought up.                         Out
 of twenty casts taken by myself on both sides of the ship in a depth
 of 9 fathoms, all but three showed clean impressions, and in five of
 them the nature of the coral could be recognised.                           Two similar       shoals,
 lying to the south of Eddystone Island,                      are described on page 876.
 Other         detached      coral patches, covered         by from      5 to         10 fathoms of
 water, lie close off the south coast of St Christoval (vide page 870).
   The numerous submerged reefs of Bougainville Strait occur just
 within the           edge of the submarine platform, or submerged                         extension
 of Bougainville             Island, which is delineated by the 100 fathom line
 in the        recent      Admiralty   chart.       They are generally covered by from
  4 to 8 fathoms of water, and have very level surfaces, over one of
  which the ship dragged               her anchor without           a   check for about half
  a mile.        On one of them         I brought        up with a grapnel from a depth
  of     8    fathoms a portion            of   a   Pocillopora with stout expanded
  branches,       which appeared to be the prevailing coral.                           On another    I
  found Psammocora planipora (E. & H.) in considerable quantity in 6
  fathoms, this being the only occasion on which   found this coral.         I
  From the same depth of               6   fathoms on this shoal,                I brought   up two

  foot    in   size, was a fragment of Porites tenuis               (V.), for the most part
  dead,      and covered by Nullipara, and extensively bored by molluscs
  and annelids.             Small specimens of other living corals were attached

 merged reefs, covered by from 6 to 7 fathoms of water,                    was  marked

     With reference to the character of the bottom in the deeper parts
of Bougainville        Strait, I should      remark that in depths         of from      20
to 40 fathoms calcareous           sand     and gravel        usually occur.       These
materials are largely composed             of the tests of Orbitolites, and the
joints of    the calcareous    alga   Halimeda opuidia.f            Small unattached
corals    of the genus      Heteropsammia          here flourish.   J   Fragments       of
Nulliporce were frequently brought up from all depths down to 86
fathoms, where Lieut.           Leeper      obtained     a   small    nob   apparently
alive.     The foraminifer,      Polytrema        ruhra, was occasionally         found
attached    to these fragments.
    In the sheltered       waters    of this strait there        is no   intermediate
condition     between the submerged             reefs covered by 4 to 8 fathoms
of water and those which are marked on the surface                      by a reef-flat
with its accompanying islet, or by a sand-key.                  From the manner in
which the channel was studded with submerged                        or sunken     reefs,
it  was at first thought that the survey would be attended                  with   some
risk to the ship       ; but Lieut. Oldham          subsequently found that,          on
account of her small draught, H.M.S. " Lark could sail with

flats or sand-keys.        When     I  had examined these submerged            reefs,   I
was led by their characters           to conclude that they had reached the
limit of their upward growth, and that they                have since been extend
ing laterally,    so as to  form long and narrow platforms, some of which
are more than 10 miles         in length, and      are  in fact submerged      barrier-

reefs (vide          p. 877.        That they      have   remained    at much the same
depth from           the surface for a considerable number of years, is shown
by      the circumstance that in 1768 a shoal covered by                   5  fathoms was
found         near the middle of the strait by the " Etoile,"             one of Bougain
 ville's vessels.*           During the        116 years    that have elapsed between
 the visit of the          French navigator and the recent survey of this strait
 by      Lieut. Oldham, neither the upward growth of the coral nor any
 movement           of elevation have been sufficient to raise the surface of
 this       shoal  within the limit of constructive breaker-action                 ; and in
 consequence          it is still   submerged.
       It    is certainly a remarkable circumstance that in this group we
  found no        detached       sunken reefs which would render the navigation
  of     these seas dangerous          for  a vessel   of light draught (9 or 10 feet).
  All     detached       reefs that had not reached the surface were below the
  limit      of constructive breaker-action, their depth varying between                    4
  and       10 fathoms,      according to the sheltered          or exposed    character   of
   their situation.           It  therefore appeared        to me that a movement of
   elevation was first necessary to bring these submerged                      reefs within
   the power of the breakers,                since   the   upward growth of the corals
   was arrested a little below their limit of constructive action.
        Wo     may thus find a partial explanation of the submerged                   condi
    tion of the leeward sides of many atolls, and of the total submergence
    of    a few other reefs belonging to the same class,                in the  inability of
    detached      submerged        reefs  to  raise themselves icithin the constructive
   power of the breakers                witlwut     the  assistance   of a   movement      of
    elevation.       It   may appear somewhat bold to suggest that atolls owe
    their appearance          at the surface to such a movement;                but  it is  a
    singular circumstance            that   I found     this to be the case with Oima
    Atoll (vide      p. 879) ;     and thisis the very movement           which Professor
     Dana and      Mr Couthouy          have shown to be        in operation  amongst    the
     numerous      atolls of the Low             Archipelago,     many    of which     have
     experienced      elevations varying between             2  or 3 and   250 feet.t     In
     the   Fiji  and Pelew Groups, upraised reefs having the characters of
     atolls coexist      with    reefs of the same class that have           been formed
     at the    present     sea-level.      However this        suggestion   may   apply to

atolls,    it readily     accounts    for the existence         of the numerous sub
merged reefs       in   the Solomon Group, which lie at a constant distance
below the surface.            Another     circumstance favouring          the view that
detached sunken reefs cannot raise themselves                   to within  the construc
tive power of the breakers             is to be found in the fact that             on the
weather      sides of reefs     in this group     corals do not thrive      in the wash
of the breakers       ;  there is here a gradual slope descending to a depth
of   4  or  5 fathoms,      which is largely bare of living coral (vide           p. 858).
    The formation of the reef-flat is worthy of             a  passing remark.      I have
often observed that on the lee sides of islands, especially of                   those of
small size, the corals grew in irregular patches at the sea-border,                     and
did not form a reef-flat            such as existed on the weather side which
was exposed to the trade-swell.               Professor Semper would apparently
attribute the absence of the reef-flat on the lee side of an island                        to
the circumstance of the corals not being exposed to strong impinging
currents ; but in these islands, however, it is evidently due to the
 corals not being subjected to the action of the breakers.
     I  have    now come to the description                of the reefs which          have
 reached the surface.            The three principal classes are to be found               in
 this region, but of these            the   fringing     and barrier-reefs     are     more
 commonly distributed,             whilst   the   atolls are comparatively few             in
 number and of small size.                A line of barrier-reef, probably               not
 much under 60 miles in length, and bearing innumerable islets                            on
its surface, fronts the east coasts of the islands of New Georgia                       at a
 distance     of from     1 to 3 miles from the           shore.     Extensive    reefs of
 the same class, having a broad deep-water                    channel inside    them, lit
 off the north side of the large              island of Isabel, and off the           south
 coast of Choiseul.           Similar    reefs   of smaller extent skirt         the west
 end of Guadalcanar           ;  and existing and elevated           barrier-reefs    occur
 in Bougainville          Strait.    Of this    class   of reef    I  was only able        to
 examine those of the last locality           : they will be subsequently         referred
 to in my general description of the reefs of this strait.
      I will now         proceed    with   the   description of the reefs of             the
 islands we visited.*

                         of Ecliiiburgh, Session 1885—86.                            869
that      skirt at intervals this coast belong to the fringing class.               They
are marked here and there by wooded islets, and in some parts
they have experienced an upheaval of a few feet They attain
 their greatest breadth of nearly a mile in the vicinity of Cape
 Suxville and Star Harbour, but usually their breadth                    does not exceed
 a quarter of       a mile.      The 100 fathom line lies generally about 1200
 yards from the        edge of the reef-flat,       and from this fact the angle of
 the submarine         slope      may be computed to be about 10 degrees.
 "Where the land rises precipitously               from the    sea, as on   the east side
  of Cape Keibeck, there               are scarcely any reefs.         They are absent
  usually from the        shores      of the wide bays which receive the waters
 of the      large streams    :   here   the beaches are of dark sand, which is
  composed partly of volcanic and partly of calcareous materials.
       The north     coast of the peninsula included between Star Harbour
  and Cape Surville is low, and fringed with                     mangroves    ; and  it is
  often a difficult matter to distinguish              where the reef ends and the
  land-surface begins,           since the mangroves         push forward their lines
  on the flat whilst        it is yet      covered   by the sea at high water.         By
  the agency of these trees, unassisted by any elevation, much land is
  reclaimed from the waves.                 One may walk for a distance of 100
  yards from the margin of the vegetation                      on a recently formed
  wooded tract raised           but a couple feet and less above the sea-level,
  which is composed almost entirely of coarse calcareous sand mixed
   with fragments of        corals and shells belonging to familiar reef species
  of the genera Cyprma, Stromhis,                  Turbo, Trochus, Tellina,        Tapes,
   Hemieardium,        Cytherea,       &c.    These shells have lost most of their
   colour      and   have     an      ancient    appearance.       A    species   of the
   Auriculidae,      Pythia       scardbceus    (Lin.),   lives   commonly      on  these
   recently formed tracts throughout these islands, and its empty shells
   occur     mingled with those            of the marine genera just mentioned.
   Pumice pebbles may usually be traced                  amongst     the trees for some
   15 or 20 paces, and         in some places they are very numerous.
       The north coast of St Christoval,             to the west of Cape Keibeck,
   is often bordered by a recently elevated              flat of coral rock, which, at
   the sea margin where            it has been worn back by the waves into low
    cliffs, is raised from 4 to 6 feet above           the high water leveL         These
    flats rise gradually, as one          proceeds    inland    among     the trees, to a
    height     of from 12 to 15 feet.            They are frequently traversed         by

870                      Proceedings      of  the  Royal Society
deep fissures        and narrow gulleys, running              at  right angles to         the
coast, which are being constantly widened by the                       action of the      sea,
and are often of considerable length.                   Frequently, when following
a coast path,       I   have    come    unexpectedly, within the margin of the
trees, upon the termination              of one of these narrow gulleys, at the
bottom of which, 10 or 12 feet below                   me, the water was        rushing      to
and fro with each advancing and receding wave.                        The coral rock of
these    flats   is    much honeycombed             on the surface,        and    its sharp
cutting edges soon destroy a stout pair of boots.                       It  is extensively
undermined by the            sea, and, as    might be expected, blow-holes are of
common occurrence.               They vary in size from the mere               bubbling of
air and water through a small hole in the rock to the grand spout
which sends its foam              20   feet   into the air.       On this coast of St
 Chris to val   I   have had my helmet blown               off my head,       while stand
ing without          knowing      it over     one    of these holes.         They    are of
frequent occurrence           on the coral limestone coasts of these islands.
     Besides the solvent action of rain on the elevated                       coral flats of
the coast, numerous other agencies assist in the removal of the rock.
 On the raised          coral flats of the         north coasts of         St Christoval,
Nvrita marmorata (Homb. & Jacq.) thrives in numbers just                              above
the high water level.             The calcareous       excretions of these molluscs
 were to be observed           in nearly    every hole and crevice of the rock in
this situation       ;  and it was evident to me that in this manner they
 increased    in size the cavities into which they crept.
     On the south side of St Christoval                   I  only became acquainted
 with the coast to the westward of the entrance of Makira Harbour.
 Here the sea border is of a different                  character.       Lofty hills    rise
direct from the         sea to a   height of from 1000 to 1500 feet, and tall
cliffs of ancient volcanic rocks start up perpendicularly                        from the
 deep   water     at their base.         Lines of     shore-reefs    and elevated reef-
 flats, such as are found          on the north side of the island, are not                to
 be found      here.       In their     place    there   are   off-lying    isolated coral
patches lying from 5 to              10 fathoms below the surface,              and rising
with wall-like         sides   from deep water.          On p. 867       I have given      an
explanation of the submerged                condition     of these and other similar
sunken reefs.
    The Three Sisters.        — Off   the north      coast   of St Christoval lie        the
three small islands thus named.                  They may be briefly described             as

                        of Edinburgh,         Session.   1885-86.                     871
coral islands which       commenced        their growth as submerged flat-topped
reefs resembling in their character the present condition of the
neighbouring Lark Shoal. These reefs were subsequently elevated
about       70 feet above the sea, and the islands have since assumed an
atoll structure.        From     their arrangement         and from the depth           of
water separating       them from the adjacent islands,*             it may be inferred
that these coral islands are based on three submerged peaks which
lie at some unknown distance below the surface. They are included
within the same 100 fathom line. On the weather or eastern sides
the submarine slope is gradual for the first few fathoms                       ;  it then
descends to the depth of 100 fathoms at an angle rather in excess of
20°.        On the lee sides the submarine slope descends                   usually at   a
smaller angle.
      Malaupaina, the southernmost of these islands, is about 3£ miles
in    length and rather over half a mile in breadth                  Its lee or western
half, which is mostly         occupied      by mangrove        swamps that are over
 flown by the sea at high            water, contains two lagoons            opening by
 narrow entrances on the west coast.                A  low bank, raised      2  to  3 feet
 above      the high   tide level and from            20    to   100   paces  in width,
 intervenes between the         sea    and   the mangrove swamps within, and
 forms the western margin of the island                : it is  composed,    sometimes
 of sand, at other times of shells and loose                    coral fragments,      and
 occasionally of coral rock          ;  whilst its    surface    supports such trees
 as    the casuarine, pandanus, and cocoa-nut              palm.      The weather or
 eastern portion of the island may be described as a broad wooded
 tract elevated between        10 and 15 feet above the sea.               Between the
 tide marks on this coast, there              is an extensive flat of coral rock
 traversed      by deep fissures        and narrow gulleys, running             at right
  angles to the trend of the coast,         in which rushes       to and fro the wash
  of each roller that breaks on the edge of the reef.                Situated towards
  the interior of the island, and separated            by the northern lagoon, are
  two low     hills of coral limestone,! the level summits of which                    are
  elevated from 50 to 70 feet above the sea.                 Of the two    lagoons, the
  southern     is the deepest  :  it   has a depth of 9 fathoms, and is shut            in

by  a  bar over which at low water neaps there is less than a fathom
of water    ; in the northern lagoon              there is only a depth of              3 or 4
feet at low tide.          Outside the entrance of each lagoon, there is                         a
second    lagoon-like basin of more                recent   origin  :   the southern            of
these basins has a depth of from 20 to 26 fathoms, and                     affords      a very
sheltered anchorage           ;  while     the northern      is shallower,        and     more
obstructed.       Both the inner lagoons are lined by mangroves, and
they communicate with the extensive mangrove swamps in their
vicinity.      Some of these            swamps,      when exposed         at    low     water,
present extensive tracts            of a white chalk-like mud dotted here and
there  with clumps of            mangroves.         On the surface lie shells and
coral fragments,        and large masses of Meandrina and Cceloria occur
as they grew, their summits being at present raised                           1   to 2 feet
above high water.
   In remarking on the history of                   the formation      of this island,          I
will first refer       to its condition at        high tide.      If  a  bird's-eye view
could then be obtained, the larger portion of its surface                              would
present    the appearance         of an    expanse    of water in which, were          it   not
for the mangroves,          the eye would be unable to distinguish                  between
the swamps temporarily overflown                    by the sea and the permanent
inner lagoons.         The two low hills would stand out from the water
nearly surrounding them              as imperfect islands; and such a panoramic
view    would carry us back to the time when they existed                             as two
submerged       reefs lying,      like Lark Shoal,       a few fathoms beneath the
surface.      Then ensued a period of upheaval, during the latter                        part
of which the permanent land surface was formed on the eastern                                or
weather side, and the island                 assumed     the   character of       a   double
atoll.    After    a   pause    in this     movement,     there   was a more modern
elevation of     a   few feet, since         which the outer lagoons have               been
formed,     and the inner lagoons have been gradually filling up.                        The
interesting point in connection with the formation of this island                            is
one which is of importance in connection with the early history of
small atolls;* for it is evident that it commenced                   as two flat-topped
submerged      reefs, and that           the   atoll form has been assumed              since
these    reefs    have      been      upheaved.       In    the   neighbouring          Lark
Shoal we have the first stage in the production of an atoll                       ;  but   the
characteristic form,          as   I   hold, will not be assumed             until it      has
                         *

Teached          the  surface.      Further on in this      paper    I shall  show that
large atolls probably              assume    their characteristic form below the
surface,        as pointed out by      Mr Murray.
      I was not       able to visit the other two islands.            They have, how
 ever, the         same general      appearance     and about the same elevation.
 Lieut. Malan, who              coasted   round     both of them and landed on
 Malaulalla, tells         me that they are counterparts of Malaupaina, the
 southern island which             I have  above described     at length.      In Malau
 lalla he found           a lagoon shut off apparently from the sea, but he
 did not notice          one   in the northern island of Alita.          On the north
 east coast of the island last mentioned, he observed                    a line of cliff
 of coral limestone 30 to 40 feet in height.
       Santa Anna. — The shore-reefs, which skirt the             coast of the upraised
 atoll of Santa Anna, vary in width from                 150 to 600 yards, according
  to the steepness of the land; and the average submarine slope to the
  100 fathom line ranges from               6  degrees    to rather over 20 degrees.
  The     reef-flats    between      the tidal    levels are traversed       by fissures
  2 to 5 feet broad,         which extend far beyond the breakers, and may
  usually      be traced     from the surface         by the white sand         that has
  collected in them.             On the west coast the shore-reefs enclose a
   remarkable circular lagoon, 700 to 800 yards in width, which has                     a
  depth of 16 to 17 fathoms, and affords a snug anchorage for ships.
   It  is known as       Port Mary.
       On the south shore of this lagoon, a dark red compact                    rock has
   been exposed        at the bottom of some holes, a foot            in depth, which
   have been        excavated     for water by     the natives    in the rock of      the
   reef-flat.      The same rock occurs as embedded             masses   in  the surface
   of the reef-flat      on the east coast, where          it contains   enclosures    of
   coral rock and other debris.             I also   found it lining    the sides of a
   vertical    fissure  in  a coral limestone cliff, where        it  was from    1  to 2
   inches thick.        This rock      effervesces    with  an acid; but, as     I  learn
   from   Mr Murray, it is mainly          composed     of a red ochreous material,
   probably       deposited    from water that has found its way through
   fissures   and cavities in the coral limestone.              Its  exposure    on the
   surface   of the reef-flat (near its inner edge) may probably be due to
   the  solvent action of the sea water which overflows the flat towards
   high tide.       The circumstance of its lining the sides of a fissure in
   a coral   limestone cliff is very suggestive            of its origin.      Professor

874                    Proceedings       of  the  Royal Society
Liveraidge*        has described       a similar    rock brought by Commodore
Goodenough from the New Hebrides.                      It  contained small fragments
of coral and shell, which gave it the appearance                    of  a   bone     breccia
from a cave deposit          ;  but the mode of its occurrence             is not    stated.
I  should add that in one locality small patches of a fibrous calcite
about an inch in thickness               encrusted the surface of            the reef-flat
near the base of the cliff.
     Ugi Island.     — This island        is fringed      by shore-reefs       of varying
 width, which        are most     extensive on the north-west             coast, and are
absent     or broken up in             Selwyn     Bay.      Broad    belts    of   recently
formed land, strewn with coral and shells, edge the reef-tlaU.                           On
the east coast, the shore-reef            encloses a long narrow lagoon, a mile
in length, and possessing           a  depth of 10 fathoms and under.                In  the
shore-reef      on the      south     coast   there   is a small circular         basin or
lagoon,    about 100 yards across and               6   fathoms in depth, which            is
approached        by    a narrow entrance,        and would make a good boat-
harbour, f        It  is  worthy      of remark       that this island has a rude
crescentic    shape, which       it  has only assumed during the last hundred
feet or so of elevation.            The small coral island of Biu, which lies
about    2   miles to the northward, and is included                  within the       same
 100 fathom line, is fringed by shore-reefs.                  It is about     li miles in
length, and may be briefly described as                  a patch   of coral reef which
has been upheaved           about 100 feet above the sea, and is still girt by
 living    reefs.     In its central        elevated     portion   I  found      a chalky
 coral limestone.
     Ran Sara        Atoll.  — This small atoll, which lies 2i miles                off the
 north coast of Guadalcanar, has an elongated shape, and is about
 3  miles in length.         Three wooded islets have been                formed on its
 south side    ;   but the remainder of the circumference of this atoll                   is
 either just awash at low tide, or is covered by less than a fathom of
 water.      The actual depth           of the lagoon was not ascertained;               its
 depth, however, must be considerable, since                     casts of as much         as
 37 fathoms failed         to reach     the bottom.        The soundings taken          out-

    t These "holes" in the shore-reefs are not uncommonly found in other
 islands of this group.       They are often termed
                                                          " boat-harbours," when access

 under.

side      this atoll      were  not sufficiently numerous to enable               me to
estimate the angle of the submarine slope.
      The largest of the three islets that have been formed on the reef
is   half    a mile across, and rather more than a mile            in length.      In  its
interior, which is thickly           wooded,     the soil is made up       in varying
proportion of           humus     and     calcareous     sand.     Numerous       shells,
 belonging       to familiar reef species, and large massive corals occur on
tlie    surface in the centre of the island and all over its area.              Pumice
pebbles        are commonly found on the surface near                  the coast   ;  and
 they may be often seen to largely compose the miniature cliffs of
 sand which have been worn back into the beach by unusually
 high     tides.    This islet is   elevated   in its interior    some 15 or 20 feet
 above the       sea.     On its south coast occur low cliffs of coral rock,
  4 to   5   feet in height, which betoken a recent             elevation of    a   small
 amount.         The other two islets are evidently             of similar character,
 though        of more     modern formation.         On the south coast of the
 larger islet occur a number of rounded blocks of volcanic rocks,*
  pebbles of which are to be found embedded                 in the rock of the reef-
 flat.     The largest of these blocks must have weighed, according to
 its   measurement,       about  2  cwt.  ;  but the majority of them were con
  siderably less than 30 lbs. in weight.               Some    of  them, which were
  raised     2 to  3 feet above     high water mark, had apparently reached
  their   present     position before the last upheaval.            All  of them had
  evidently been        transported by floating trees, which are very com
  monly met with among these islands              : they were probably originally
  derived from the adjacent portion of Guadalcanar.                 I have  frequently
  found blocks and pebbles of volcanic                rocks in the roots of trees
  which have been thrown up on the reefs of this group.                        In    some
  cases they were so firmly embedded              that they could only have been
  set free by the final decay        of  the tree.
     Florida Islands. — Fringing           reefs, varying    in width from       150 to
  600 yards,      skirt  the coasts   with which      I am   acquainted on the east
  and south sides of this sub-group.              They  present nothing of special
  interest.

876                   Proceedings      of  the    Royal Society
elevation of an intervening coral reef.                 The northern       part, in which
no traces of volcanic activity came under my observation,                         is entirely
surrounded by fringing-reefs, with the exception of the                        north point,
where the land terminates in a bold precipice.                       Off the east coast
there is a very steep submarine slope to the 100 fathom line of
from 30 to 35 degrees.             In the midst of the reef on the west side
there     is a large hole, 18 fathoms in depth and about 150 yards
across, which may mark an old crater cavity.                       In  the southern half
of the island, where the subterranean fires are not yet                        extinct      and
where many fumaroles exist, no reefs occur on the west and south
coasts.       On the east side, however, there is an elevated barrier-reef,
which attains       a  height of rather under 200 feet, and is known                          as
 Simbo Islet.       Off the    west side of the low connecting                 neck, which
 is formed by an elevated          coral reef, there is       a  short barrier-reef that
 by its protection forms the harbour.                  Just within its inner margin,
 this    reef encloses     a   remarkable         hole, 14      fathoms       deep,    which
 resembles      the one on the north-west coast of the island.
     Two     shoals or submerged        coral patches lie        1  and    2   miles to the
 southward of the island, rising on all sides from deep water where
 casts    of 100 fathoms did not reach the bottom.                      They have        level
 summits       covered    by    from     5   to    10 fathoms        of water;        and    as
 delineated by the 10 fathom line, they measure, each of them, about
 half a mile in length.          In their     characters     they are counterparts of
  Lark Shoal, which       is described on p. 865, and, as              I hold, they      have
  probably reached the upward limit of their growth.
     Bougainville      Strait. — This strait, which previous                to the survey
  by   H.M.S.      "Lark"      was    little known,         separates     the two        large
 islands of Bougainville          and   Choiseul, and is about 25 miles                across.
  On examining the chart of the strait,* it will be observed that                             a
 broad      submarine plateau, about           15   miles in width and covered              by
  from 30 to 50 fathoms of water, forms the submerged                          extension     of
  the east extremity of Bougainville                Island.     At its outer        edge this
  plateau     terminates abruptly         in    a  steep   slope     of from 15         to 25
  degrees, which is sharply delineated on the chart by the 100 fathom
  line, and descends to considerable depths.                  Its   surface is uniformly
  level, but a deep hole occurs                towards the middle            of    the   strait

                               of Edinburgh, Session 1885-86.                                877
(outside Masamasa Island), where a depth of 80 fathoms was found;
and another, in which 100 fathoms of line did not reach the bottom,
lies off Cyprian Bridge Island. This plateau is connected with a
similar but              very much smaller submerged                  extension of Choiseul
 Island by a             narrow neck rather over            2  miles in width.         The sub
 marine           contour of this strait is well shown by the 100 fathom line
 in the          chart.     It will    be there      seen that the two large islands of
  Bougainville and Choiseul                 are connected       by   a submerged      ridge, and
  that       an elevation of some 350 feet would join them together.
        Broken lines of barrier-reef (sometimes elevated) and elongated
  coral shoals covered by from 4 to 10 fathoms of water, which may
  be regarded as incipient barrier-reefs, mark the edge of the
   Bougainville           plateau within      a  few hundred yards of the 100 fathom
   line.         Thus, commencing to the west of the Shortland Islands, we
   find        a   broken     line of     barrier-reef.       Following the         edge  of the
    plateau         eastward,      we   come     to the south side          of the     Shortland
    Islands, where           elevated     lines of barrier reefs, removed            from 20 to
     100 feet and more above the                  sea,  form the coasts.*          Further   east
     ward,       a broken       line   of barrier-reef follows           the contour      of the
     southern         coasts   of the island of Fauro             where    they approach the
     edge of the plateau,           f    Linear     submerged       patches    of reef, covered
     by from         4 to 10    fathoms of water, prolong this line of barrier-reef
     to the eastward           for  a few   miles, and subsequently follow the curve
     of the edge of the plateau                as   it  sweeps     northward      to the mouth
     of the        strait      Besides     the islands already mentioned, numerous
     smaller        islands     and rocky       islets of      volcanic     formation,     which
      preserve       in some instances         their volcanic        profile, rise out of the
      waters in the interior              expanse      of the    plateau,     and other larger
      islands of a similar character,              such as Ovau, Oima, Masamasa,              and
      Piedu, lie around the northern end of Fauro. J
          *
             In my     paper on the recent Calcareous      Formations, I have shown that Alu,
      the main island, has been formed            by the upheaval of a succession of barrier-
      reefs that have grown outwards on a bottom of foraminiferous volcanic muds
      from a nucleus of volcanic rock.
          + I visited several portions of this line of reef.            A detailed description is,
      however,      unnecessary.
          t  The island of Fauro is of volcanic formation. The rocks composing it are
       mostly andesites,        together with altered       dolerites,   diorites, quartz-felsites,
       dacites, &c.       Similar rocks are found in the other islands and islets of the
       straits.     No traces of activity came under my notice in any of the volcanic
       islands that I visited.

 this line of barrier-reef five wooded islets have been formed.                         They
 are made, for the most part, of materials thrown up by the waves at
 the present sea-level;          but the presence in some of the larger islets of
 elevated     coral    rock in mass affords           evidence of the whole line of
 reef having been recently upheaved some                    6 feet or more.        An     islet
 of coral      limestone, which           rises    up in the midst       of the lagoon-
 channel between           20 and 25 feet above           the high tide level, affords
 testimony of previous               upheaval;       and the hills     near the       coast,
 composed as they are of foraminiferous and pteropod muds incrusted
 by coral limestone, have been antecedently upheaved.                         Here,    then,
as    in  the    Shortland       Islands,    a   barrier-reef has been formed in              a
region which has             been     undergoing elevation during           a   prolonged
period               I should have added that this barrier-reef of Choiseul
Bay meets the coast at the head of the bay where it joins the                        shore-
reef   : to the southward           it  is continued as a submerged          line   of reef
covered     by    5   or 6 fathoms of water with a channel, 30 fathoms
deep, inside      it
     Before concluding my remarks on this strait                  I will  refer to    Oima
Atoll («'(7«plan),asingular atoll of small size which lies in the northern
entrance     about     1 i miles within        the edge of the submerged plateau.
It    measures      nearly    2  miles in its longest diameter and rises                from
depths of 40 to 50 fathoms with a submarine slope varying between
 12   and 26 degrees.           This atoll      has been formed around a group of
rocky islets which are composed of hornblende — andesite and                          range
in height from 20 to 100 feet above the                   sea.   The variation of         the
texture of the rock in different islets, and other facts, show                           that
there were four volcanic necks here represented.                    This atoll    encloses

two       basins,   20 fathoms deep, which           are separated    by  a  bank that
is only partially         exposed    at "low water springs."         H.M.S.    "Lark"
 found a sheltered anchorage in the western                  basin.     The bottom in
 the deeper parts is formed of a chalky mud.                    In the interior of the
  lagoon,      corals thrive    most on the banks that face the breaks in the
  reef    and on the sides     of the  entrances.     There are, however, extensive
  sandy      tracts covered by less than a fathom           of water at low tide, on
   ¦which     may be observed         very large fiat- topped      masses   of Pontes,
   Oima Atoll, adapted from a SJcetch of my own,                 assisted by the  Plan
                               in the Admiralty Chart.
    The white portion represents the reef above the sea level bearing the six
         volcanic islets.   The inner shaded space is the lagoon, of which the
         lighter tint represents depths less than a fathom, and the darker tint the
         deeper part, which has a depth of 20 fathoms.
    10 to 16 feet across, completely             dead, and only projecting       a few
    inches above the sand.          These huge corals had evidently been killed
    by the accumulation         of   sand ; and    it   was  apparent that through
    this agency     the lagoon was      filling  up.    This atoll   does not seem to
    have    experienced      any upheaval        since the    commencement       of its
    growth, although it       is situated     in an area of elevation.       However,
    the existence     of old erosion lines, with their accompanying caverns,
    on  two of the volcanic islets affords            evidence   of a  prior upheaval
    to the    extent   of  some    four or Jive feet.*        I  should observe    that
    numerous full-grown         Tridacnat (T. gigas), which occur alive in the

    The Formation of Barrier-Reefs. — During my lengthened stay in
these islands,        I   devoted considerable attention to the subject of the
formation        of barrier-reefs      as  well    as  to the growth       of coral       reefs
in general.          In    the course     of my investigations        I took about 300
soundings, ranging between               4  and 50 fathoms,       off the weather        side s
of reefs, and       I  obtained in several instances the submarine profiles.*
 As typical of other reefs in this group,                I  will briefly describe           the
seaward       slopes of the following         reefs   :—
    (a) Onua Reef (vide section 2).
                                                 — This is   a   fragment of a barrier-
reef on the south-east side of the Shortland                   Islands.     For the       first
 80 or 90 yards from the edge of the reef-flat,                     there   is a gradual
slope     down to       a  depth of about       5 fathoms.      There is then a rapid
fall of about 10 fathoms; at the foot of this declivity there lies                             a
narrow ledge, and beyond there is                  a moderate      slope   of 13° to the
 100 fathom line.            Judging from my soundings,             corals  thrive down
to depths of 15 fathoms,             where the sand commences            and covers       the
slopes below.          This depth, it will         be noted, corresponds with the
base of the submarine declivity,               a situation where, as indicated by
the cross in the section,           we should expect the sand to collect.
    (It) The     Barrier-Reef of Choi-tad Bay. — As shown in                section 3 the
submarine portion of this reef at first slopes gradually for the                        first
 70 or 80 yards from the edge of the reef-flat to a depth of 4 or                            5
fathoms,       when it plunges down by a steep declivity another                        9 or
 10 fathoms,       from the foot of which there is            a  rapid talus-like     slope
to a depth        of about      20 fathoms from the surface.              Beyond,     there
extends      a  broad ledge, covered by from 23 to 25 fathoms of                     water,
which terminates in            a slope  of about 10° to     a  depth of 100      fathoms,
which is the limit of the section.                  An inspection of this          section
 would lead one to expect that an accumulation of sand and                          gravel,
preventing the growth of reef-corals, would be found at the foot of                      the
declivity, viz., in depths of from              15 to 20   fathoms, and that in          the
level region       beyond, from the absence of such accumulations,                    there

 coraL       On carrying the soundings further                seaward   on the broad
 ledge beyond,          I found that the sand and gravel began to disappear
  and that the armings            in the   greater proportion   of  the casts made in
  depths of from 23 to 40 fathoms showed the presence of living

breaking on the                      edge       of       the       reef-flat, would           naturally          tend      to
collect at the foot of the first declivity                                           in depths of 15 to 20
fathoms;                in such           a     situation           living         coral would he scarcely
expected                to thrive;         but in the more                   level region beyond,                  as the
sand       and gravel thinned away, conditions more                                               suitable for           the
growth of coral would be found, and this is the conclusion towards
which          my soundings pointed.                                There would           thus appear to exist
on      the outer submarine                              slope       of this         barrier-reef,          in    depths
of      15         to    20     fathoms,             a   belt        of     detritus         dividing        into       two
portions the zone in which                                    the        reef-building        corals     thrive.             (I
have       marked the position of this belt in the section by a cross.)
Had my soundings                          been confined to                   the    upper of these two                  sub-
zones,         I   should have been justified                             to a great         extent, on reaching
the        belt of sand                   and gravel, in concluding                          that coral did not
thrive             in     depths          beyond              15     fathoms;           but by         subsequently
extending such soundings seaward across this band of detritus into
the lower or outer sub- zone,                             I       should      have exposed             the fallacious
character of such                    a   conclusion.
            Port Mary                Reef, Santa              Anna (vide           section     1).— My      soundings
     (c)
were taken off the                         outer edge of the reef enclosing the harbour.
The seaward                   profile of the                  reef may be thus                described.          For        a
short distance from                           the edge of the reef-flat there                          is   a gradual
descent.                This    is   followed by              a    rapid slope until          a      depth of about
16     fathoms             is   reached,         when within                 a     distance       of   a    couple        of
boats' lengths, there                      is   a    drop of another                 16      fathoms.       From        the
foot of this declivity there                             is   an easy descent             for about 450 yards,
with       a   fall of        some        9   or 10 fathoms, which terminates in                            a    precipi
tous       slope where there                              drop of about               25 fathoms.            The sub
                                                is
                                                a
marine slope beyond descends                                       at an angle of 18° or 19° to con
siderable depths.                        Corals thrive down to                      a   depth of 30 fathoms.
Beyond this depth sand and gravel more frequently come up in                                                            the
armings.                 It will     be       noticed that the lower limit of the coral                               zone
apparently corresponds            with the base of the first declivity (marked
with       a       cross in the section), as in the cases of the two reefs pre
viously described,                       and that the deeper extension of the zone                                in   this
instance           is    evidently due to the deeper situation                                of the declivity           in
question.                Sand and gravel cover the more level tract beyond                                        ;    but
there      were           indications           given          by my soundings                 of      the thinning

some of          the armings showed clean impressions.
     (d)     Oima Atoll. — On the other slopes of this atoll, for the first 70
or    80 yards from the              edge of the reef-flat, there is a gradual descent
down to a depth                     of   4 fathoms.            Beyond         this the reef         slopes
rapidly away at an                  angle varying            between 12 and 26 degrees on
different sides of the atoll, to depths of from 45 to 50 fathoms, the
general level of the surrounding bottom. There appears to be no
sudden break or declivity on the seaward slope of the reef, such as
 came under my notice in the                      cases      of most other         reefs.     The corals
 flourish down to depths of 25 fathoms.       The slopes beyond are for
 the most part covered with sand and graveL
     I will now sum up the principal characters of the seaward slopes
  of reefs in this group, as exemplified by those I have just described,
  and it should be observed that, although these remarks apply to
 reefs of any of the three classes,                      I    have    more        particularly in view
  at present the reefs belonging to the barrier class.                                      For the first
  70 or 80 yards from the edge of the reef-flat there is usually                                          a
  gradual slope to          a   depth of from 4 to             5   fathoms.         This gentle     slope,
  which is largely bare of living coral {vide page 858), is traversed by
  prolongations of the fissures or channels that cross the outer
  portion of the reef-flat               between the tide levels.                  These fissures may
  sometimes         be traced        by means of the white sand that collects in
  them, to a distance of 100 yards from the edge of the reef-flat.                                        I
     have    observed       them on the seaward                    slopes     of some reefs to be
     placed at regular intervals              of from 25 to 30 feet.                        They vary in
     width between          2   and 5 feet.          In      the depths less than 5 fathoms
     the corals prefer the sides of these                     fissures, and are not, as             I have
     already stated,    in any quantity on the intervening spaces.
        Beyond      this gentle slope, which terminates as observed                                 above,
     in depths of from 4 to 5 fathoms, there is generally a rapid descent
     to a depth       varying between 12 and 18 fathoms,                            which is usually
     sufficiently       steep   to be      pronounced          a     declivity.       In     some    reefs,
     however,     as at     Port Mary,            this declivity         may be         situated      at a
     somewhat       greater      depth.      It    is,
                                             however, on the face of this pre
     cipitous    slope that the corals flourish. This     in fact, the growing
                                                                            is,
     edge   of   the reef.*   The sand and gravel, produced by the action of

      noticed,   when    diving on the outer sides of the reefs, that at the baso of                      a

884                      Proceedings      of    the   Royal Society
the breakers at the margin                of the reef, collect at the foot of                  this
declivity in depths generally of from 15 to 20 fathoms, but                                   sona-
times in rather greater depths as at Port Mary.    However,                                   since
the growth of coral is suppressed                 by this accumulation          of sand and
gravel that        collects at      the   foot    of the declivity,            which I have
termed     the growing        edge of the reef,      have already
                                                        it follows,   as   I
pointed out in the instances of the Onua, Choiseul Bay, and Port
Mary reefs, that the apparent lower limit of the zone of corals
will be determined in the case of each reef by the depth at which
the base of the declivity lies.                The "raison d'etre" of the declivity
is to be found in the circumstances that the corals flourish only                                 on
the outer slopes of reefs, in depths beyond the first line                       of   breakers,
i.e., below a depth of 4 or 5 fathoms.                      Here they are exposed                 to
the strength            of the tidal      currents,      and, as clearly            shown        by
Professor Semper,           they would tend to form precipitous or wall-like
declivities growing outwards,              as    Mr Murray holds,          each on      its   own
talus.
   With      regard       to the disposition          of the sand and gravel on the
slopes below the growing              edge of the reef, my soundings                   showed
that where the descent              is at all rapid (i.e., more than 10° or 12°),
as is    generally the      case,   this detritus extends down far beyond                      the
depths in which corals thrive, but that where the slope is gradual
(i.e., less than 5°), as       in the instance of the barrier-reef of                 Choiseul
Bay, the lower           limit of the sand and gravel lies within                     the coral
zone which        is,   in point of fact, divided into two sub-zones by                  a    belt
of detritus.
   The results of my examination                      of the seaward        slopes     of reefs
have supplied me with an explanation                     of the formation of barrier-
reefs,    whichI        will briefly review in the light of numerous                   observa
tions   I   have        made in this group, both on existing and                       elevated
coral reefs.*
precipitous slope in depths of 15 to 20 fathoms, the rock overhung to such an
extent that he was able to get underneath the projecting portion.         This was
evidently due to the outward growth of the corals on the face of the declivity.
   *
   I   first described this view of the formation of barrier-reefs in short paper,
                                                                                a
                                                               "
entitled "Suggestions as to the Formation of Barrier Reefs, &c., which was read
before the Linnean Society, New South Wales, in October 1884 (Proe., toL
ix. part 4).    At that time was in ignorance of the fact that substantially the
                                I
same explanation had been proposed many years before by Professor Joseph
Le Conte in the instance of the Florida barrier-reefs.  In 1856 Professor Le Conte

                           of Edinburgh, Session 1885-86.                                    885
      If  we    imagine an island,          originally     formed from the materials
ejected from         some volcanic vent and bare of coral-reefs,                     to afford,
after     the     extinction of the subterranean                fires,   the   conditions of
growth on its coasts for reef-building corals, a fringing reef of
varying width according to the degree of inclination of the sub
marine slope will ultimately invest its shores. In course of time,
the detritus of the corals will collect in a band of calcareous sand
and gravel on the outer slope of the reef, marking the apparenc
limit     of the depths in which the reef-corals                    are usually stated         to
thrive.       But the vertical and horizontal extension of                       such a band
of     detritus     will   be mainly       determined,        as my observations            have
shown, by          the presence       and position of submarine declivities and
 by    the degree of inclination         of the slope.           In  such    a zone of sand
and gravel        corals   will not thrive     ;  but   if   the submarine slope           has a
 very gradual inclination,              as   in   the    case     of the barrier-reef of
 Choiseul       Bay, the lower limit of this zone of detritus                          may lie
 ¦within the depths in which reef-building corals                      flourish, and a line
 of barrier-reef begin lying parallel with                       the   fringing      reef,   but
 separated     by    a deep    channel.*
     On the other hand, should the submarine                          slope   have     a   more
 rapid descent, the lower limit of the belt of detritus may extend
 far beyond the depths              in which       reef-corals      can    thrive  ;   in such
 a   case    no     barrier-reef will     form, and the original               fringing      reef
 will continue         to grow outwards on its own talus.                     On this view
 the occurrence          of barrier-reefs and of fringing-reefs on different
 parts     of the coast of the same island may be readily                           explained
  as due     to the different degrees of inclination                     of the submarine
  slope.
  pointed    out   that the     explanation    of   the   circumstance      that the     Florida
  peninsula   had been formed        by a succession of barrier-reefs,        instead of by a
  continuous    fringing-reef,   was to be found in the fact that, since corals will not
  grow on muddy shores           or in water upon the bottom of which sediment is
  collected, the favourable      conditions can only be obtained some distance from
  the shore.     There, as he remarked, a barrier-reef would be formed, limited on
  one tide by the muddinesa,         and on the other by the depth of the water (vide
  American Journal of Science, 2nd series, vol. xxiii. p. 46, and Nature,
  October 14, 1880).       This view seems to have attracted scarcely any attention
  since it was first proposed ; but the circumstance           that I arrived independently
  at the same conclusion with reference to the barrier-reefs of the Solomon Group
  is one that lends it very powerful support.

        Such a reef covered by 5 fathoms of water lies south of Choiseul Bay.

886                  Proceedings      of the Royal Society
    Keeping in view the foregoing explanation               of the      formation of
a  barrier-reef in   a district which may for a         long period have experi
enced no change       in the relative positions of land and sea, we can
perceive     how in an area of elevation line after line of barrier-reef
will   be formed as from time to time fresh portions of the sea-bottom,
previously      below the reef-coral        zone, are brought         up    within    the
depths in which reefs commence               their growth     ;  line upon        line of
barrier-reef will be thus advanced,           each growing up along           the lower
limit of the belt of detritus derived from the line of reef inside
it     In   process  of time the       elevating movement assisted              by the
accumulation of sediment, the growth of branching corals, and the
reclaiming agency of the mangrove, will bring about the filling up
of the passages or lagoon-channels             between the lines of reef, until
at length a tract of land is produced rising             gradually from the sea-
border to the       interior but with the ancient           lines of        barrier-reef
still indicated by     ridges  of coral-limestone on its surface.              Such in
fact is in my mind the history            of the formation of the Shortland
Islands, and     I opine  of the western extremity of the Choiseul Island.
In the former locality          we    have the original island            of   volcanic
formation in the north-west corner, from which, as from a nucleus,
line after line of barrier-reef has been advanced               in a south-easterly
direction, forming ultimately, during the continuance of the eleva
tion, the large island of Alu.           Should this elevating movement               be
at present suspended,       as  would appear to be indicated by the great
 width of the reef-flats       still overflowed by the        sea    on the weather
coasts     of the outlying      islands, there      yet remains       a considerable
 addition to be made to the sea-border of              Alu by      the  filling up    of
the passages between        the lines of islands which           represent     elevated
barrier-reefs on its weather coasts.              Such    a process      is  in actual
 operation     at the present      time in the passages, the encroachment
 of the mangrove        on either side and the upward growth of coral
in   the channels being the agencies at present effecting              this operation.
These     remarks may be made             more    clear   by a reference         to the
sections     of the Shortland       Islands, which are given            in my paper
on the recent calcareous         formations (Trans. Edin. Roy. Soc, vol.
xxxii. part iii.), and in vol. ix. part 4, of the Proceedings of the
Linnean Society, N.S.       W.
    It  follows from this view of the formation of barrier-reefs that

                             of Edinburgh, Session 1885—86.                                    887
the      lagoon channels should never be deeper than the zone in which
 reef-corals       flourish      ;   but,   as   a matter of fact,          the depths inside
 barrier-reefs       as    well as atolls not unfrequently exceed those in which
 reef-corals are believed to thrive.                   For   instance,    to take the       case   of
 "barrier-reefs,      with which we are at present concerned, depths of from
 40     to 50 fathoms occur inside the line of barrier-reef that skirts the
  eastern end of Bougainville Island in the Solomon Group.                                 Sound
  ings of     between        50 and 60 fathoms have               been obtained inside the
  Vanikoro       reef    in   the Santa Cruz Group.               Depths of 40 fathoms are
  found within            the barrier-reef       lying     west of the       Fiji Islands, and
  inside     the great         Australian      barrier-reef the depth increases              to 60
  fathoms.        It    is the depths of from 35 to 60 fathoms which                             are
  found occasionally within both                     barrier-reefs      and atolls that lend
   the greatest support to the theory of subsidence.                          However       I have
   found a simpler explanation of the difficulty.
       In  the Solomon Group the                 depth of the reef-coral           zone on the
   outer slopes of reefs varies greately in different localities.                        In   most
   plases its lower        limit    is 12 to 15 fathoms ;          in  others again    it  is from
   20 to 25 fathoms            ;   whilst off the reef of Choiseul Bay                I   did not
   seem to have reached this lower                  limit in soundings of         40 fathoms.*
    This variation          I  found      to depend        upon the disposition             of the
   sand    and detritus on the seaward                   face    of the reef, and this was
   itself determined by the degree of inclination of the slope and by
   the presence and position of submarine declivities.                             In   the    pro
   tected waters        of lagoons        and lagoon-channels, the main determin
   ing condition is to be sought in the degree of clearness                                 of the
    water.     The      estimates        of observers       in other      regions    have     been
    equally varied.           MM. Quoy and Gaimard                   placed   the lower limit
    of the zone in the Pacific                at   5  or  6 fathoms.       Ehrenberg formed
    a   similar    estimate         with    reference      to   the    Ked    Sea   corals.       In
    the  Florida    Seas, Professor          A. Agassiz      has ascertained      it  to be less
    than 10 and usually not more than 6 or                    7  fathoms.      Professor Dane
    would place      it   at 20 fathoms         in   the Pacific.        Mr Darwin's limit is
    20 to 30 fathoms for             all reef-regions.       In   the Eed Sea, again, large
    beds of   living     coral were found         in depths of        25 fathoms by Captain
      *
        These depths       and other particulars are to be found in my paper in the
    Ann.  <k Mag.   Nat. Hist., June 1884.           More recent data have led nie to change
    some  of tho views there expressed.

888                     Proceedings       of   the    Royal Society
Moresby and Lieutenant               Wellstead.*            This   great   variation is,      as    I
hold, and as        Mr Darwin       also held, to be attributed to             the difference
in the local conditions in the various localities in which the observa
tions were made.            In the       case    of the Red Sea, Captain Moresby
himself attributed the less depth at which Ehrenberg                             found living
corals     to     the great     amount        of sediment.           In the       majority        of
instances,       the observers      were     led to consider that in passing from
the   living    corals to the sand beyond they had necessarily passed the
lower limit of the reef-coral              zone ; but        I have    already shown          that
if  the submarine slope           is gradual,      living coral may        be   found in        the
depths beyond the sand.                 If, however,          as is usually the case, the
slope is somewhat steep, the sand                 will extend        to depths     far beyond
the zone of        living  coral.     It   was the        limited depth at which reef-
cor ils thrive       in the Florida       seas    as compared         with depths       of     the
zone in other regions         that led Professor A. Agassiz to infer that the
vertical distribution          of reef-corals         is    determined by local          causes
rather than by the general                  influence of depth.               "There      seems
to be,"      thus he goes on to remark,                     "no simpler explanation of
 the limited        bathymetrical range than that of the baneful action of
 the silt held in suspense             near     all reefs     "t    The local causes that
 confine      the    reef-building      corals     to such shallow depths              in     the
 Florida    seas are     to be found,         as  Professor Agassiz implies,            in the
 unusually large quantities of calcareous                     sediment contained in the
 water    in   the   vicinity of the     reefs and       in  the gradual character of the
 submarine slope of the rapidly advancing Florida Bank, the muddy
 surface of which is being constantly disturbed by the action of the
 waves and of the tides.
     From the foregoing remarks wo may with confidence                              infer    that
 the lower      limit of the     reef-coral      zone is determined rather            by    local
 conditions than by the general influence of depth.                       If this  be granted,
 there can be but little           hesitation in allowing that under favourable
 circumstances,        such as a moderate submarine slope and unusually clear
  water, reef-corals       may commence            to build      in depths beyond          those
  generally assigned, as for instance,               in    those   of 50 and 60 fathoms.
  We    have here, then, a ready explanation of the exceptional                         depths

                          of Edinburgh, Session 1885-86.                                 889
of     eomo     lagoons      and   lagoon-channels.        I  should        add that       Mr
Darwin also arrived at the conclusion that local conditions, such as
the degree of clearness of the water and the extent of inclined slope,
might partly determine the depth of the coral zone,* but he did
not attribute the same importance to such causes that I have done,
and thus he came to seek for other explanations of the anomalous
depths within          some atolls and barrier-reefs.
     My    observations        on the recent      calcareous       formations        of   the
 Solomon Groupf enable me to approach this subject by another
road.      These investigations have shown that coral-reefs are based
 usually on       a   partially    consolidated     volcanic mud           or   ooze   often
 foraminiferous,         generally abounding with recent shells, and now
 and then laden with pteropod-shells in considerable numbers, the
 thickness of the overlying coral-rock rarely exceeding a hundred
 feet.    That the reef-corals commence to grow on such a bottom, and
 not on a layer of detritus of sand and gravel, is shown by the fact
 of my finding        at Santa    Anna two    massive      corals    of the Astra;id;e,
 the largest     4 feet    in diameter,    imbedded in the position of growth,
  at  a height     of 40 feet above the        sea,  in the base of           a coral-lime
 stone    cliff  where      they almost rested        on   the    subjacent       partially
 consolidated       ooze.     It is a    noteworthy circumstance that in my
  numerous soundings off the outer edge of reefs in this group, which
 extended to fifty fathoms, the armings never brought up any other
 indication of      the nature of tho bottom, outside the              usually accepted
 coral-zone, than that of calcareous sand and graveL                         In truth, my
 soundings      down to depths of 50 fathoms failed to reach the ooze.
 It  would therefore        appear that such reefs as those of the Shortland
 Islands   commenced          to build in depths       greater    than fifty fathoms.
  If elevation had brought the ooze within these depths uncovered by
 the calcareous       detritus, the armings would probably have                   recorded
  such an occurrence         amongst some of my numerous soundings.
     An   apparent objection           here presents    itself.     If   reefs    begin to
 build their       foundations       in depths greater       than those which are
  generally assigned         to  them,    the thickness      of   the      elevated     reef-
  formation discovered by me in the Solomon Group should have been
  much   greater than 150 feet, the actual          limit of their thickness.              It

890                   Proceedings       of  the   Royal Society
will, however, have        been   gathered       from the previous remarks that
local conditions will usually confine reef-corals                to depths less than
25 or 30 fathoms, and that            it will  be only under occasional            circum
stances      that reefs    will  commence         to be formed       in deeper       water.
Fringing-reefs       themselves     are at    first restricted to shallow           waters
around the coast, and their seaward                  extension in localities          where
the submarine slope is at all steep, as is generally the case, must be
extremely slow.           Again,   in   a area of elevation, such as              that in
which the Solomon Islands are included, barrier-reefs, which may
have begun to grow in depths not less than 50 fathoms, might owe
their approach,       towards the surface         as  much to the elevating move
ment     as to the    very slow upward growth of the corals.                   It   should
also be borne in mind that the rapid subrenal denudation,                       to which
these regions of heavy         rainfall   are subjected, would be an important
agency in the thinning          away of the raised coral formations.
     The Evidence of the Outward Growth of Barrier-Beefs and
Atolls. — * (a) Whilst examining Oima Atoll,                      I  was particularly
struck with the difference in size between the massive corals
 in   the interior of       the lagoon and those            which occurred        near or
 at the    outer border of the reef.            In the lagoon, the        large masses
 of Porites ranged from 10 to 16                   feet   in diameter;      whilst       the
 largest    masses     that   I  found     in the wash of the              breakers        at
 the outer edge of the reef, which belonged to species                      of Ca'loria
 and Meandrina,         measured     only   5 feet    across.   I   have also noticed,
 in the case of barrier-reefs in this strait, that the massive corals                     are
 largest near the inner edge of the flat and diminish                   in   size as one
 approaches      the outer edge of the reef.            Thus, in case of one of          the
 Shortland reefs,       I found masses of Porites at the inner edge of                    the
 flat which measured from           6   to   10    feet  across; whilst the         largest
 massive      corals  (referable to the genera, Coeloria and Meandrina),
  that  I  found near the outer edge of the reef, measured from 3 to 4
  feet.    These facts are of importance, since, according to the                    theory
  of subsidence,     the central portion of the lagoon of an atoll and                    the
  inner portion       of the    lagoon-channel          of  a barrier-reef      are     more
  recently produced than any other portion of the area of such                         reefs.
  Here, then, the massive corals ought to be much smaller than                         those
    *
      This mode of growth is one of the chief points on which Mr Murray dwells.
 My   observations   go to support his view.

situated towards          the margin of the reef.    On the contrary,          I   found
them       much larger and belonging to species           of Porites     (P.       tenuis,
J3, gaimardi, P.          &c.) which must be of slow growth as
                           aspera,
compared with the species of the two genera, above mentioned, that
are commonly found at the outer edge of reefs in these seas. Such
facts are only to be explained on the hypothesis that the reef has
gradually grown outwards             as from a centre and quite independently
of any      movements of subsidence.
  (b) In the cases of those partially elevated lines of barrier-reefs,
which occur on the weather side of the principal island of the
 Shortland Islands, the present reef-flats are backed by a line of low
 coral limestone cliffs at the base of which is an old line of erosion.
 This mark might easily          be taken as evidence of an upheaval, since
 the water coming over the reef-flat at high tide scarcely reaches it ;
 but, as shown in the accompanying diagram, it is only necessary in

  imagination to remove the reef-flat in order to picture to oneself the
  Tollers breaking at the base of the         cliff and   to perceive        that this
  line of erosion has been formed at the present              sea   level.     By the
  advancing     growth of the outer margin of the reef, the cliffs have
  been cut    off from the action of the waves.           Such lines of erosion
  may be      partially    concealed   by sand.     They are commonly to be
  observed    in cliff-girt coral islands, like Santa Anna, which                   have
  narrow shore-reefs       extending seaward from the foot of the cliffs.
     (c)   The characters of the wooded islets, that have been formed on

892                      Proceedings         of   the    Royal Society
the barrier-reefs of Bougainville                 Strait and of other localities in the
group by the action of the waves at the present                            sea       level, can only
be explained on the assumption of the outward growth of the reefs.
They are situated on the leeward side of the reef-flat and border the
lagoon- channel.          At their weather margins facing                       the weather edge
of the reef, they are but scantily vegetated.                           Here, on a soil com
posed almost entirely of calcareous                     sand, broken shells,            coral debris,
and pumice pebbles, the Pandanus and Casuarina                                  with such          shrubs
as   ScaevoJa      Koenigii        alone     can flourish.         It     is    at    their    weather
margins that these islets are constantly receiving accessions.                                            In
one place      it will    be observed        that the mangroves                push forward their
lines on the reef-flat whilst it is yet covered                           by the sea at high
water.        In another       place       it will   be noticed that during                    the pre
valence of strong winds at spring tides the waves have                                 thrown        up     a
bank of sand       a     little above the ordinary high water mark.                                Under
cover of this bank, various hardy creeping plants and binding weeds,
such     as   Ipomaea pes caprae                  and Triumphetta              procumbent, push
forward from the edge of the vegetation and invading                                      the newly
acquired strip prepare the soil for the Casuarina, Pandanus, and                                         the
different shrubs that rapidly follow in their rear.
     On crossing the islet to its lee side, where it borders the lagoon-
channel, we find the soil contains                       a   larger proportion            of humus.
Here the vegetation is much denser and of a different character.                                    Such
trees as      Barringtonia         speciosa,      Calophyllum           inophyllum,           Thespetia
popidnea, &c, form             a   thick belt, with their             branches         overspreading
the water.
     From the       foregoing remarks                it will     be     evident        that the          lee
side of an islet is its oldest portion,                      and that its weather side                    is
 the     growing       margin.       Such      islets,       therefore,        extend     themselves
 seaward towards the weather edge of the reef.                                 They would, in            the
 course of time, occupy the whole area of the reef-flat,                              were    it   not for
 one     counteracting circumstance, the more rapid outgrowth                                      of    the
 reef.     Mr Murray attributes              the position        of the islets on the               inner
 side of the reef-flat to the gradual removal,                          by solution and             other
 agencies, of the lagoon-edge                of the reef as it grows outward                        at    its
 seaward       edge.*

                           of Edinburgh, Session 1885-86.                             893
upheaved coral rocks thin away                 as one ascends     the slopes of these
islands,      an idea may be formed of the rapidity with which dead
coral may        bo removed in solution by the carbonic acid             in rain   water.
The extensive deposits of               calcareous   tufa, that incrust the sides of
the    streams        and form step-like ledges in their courses, have been
derived originally from the solution of these                   rocks.    The surfaces
of the     elevated reef-flats     of St Christoval     and other islands are honey
combed in a remarkable manner by the atmospheric agencies                       ; and in
places where the rock is exposed to the dripping                   from overhanging
cliffs,  it  is worn into holes,         12 to 18 inches deep, containing water.
     In   a   similar manner the carbonic acid contained in sea-water
 acts on dead coral; but               of the extent      of its action and of its
ultimate effect         I  was unable to obtain the same direct evidence.               It
is to this      agency that     Mr Murray mainly attributes the formation of
lagoons and lagoon-channels.                 As bearing on this subject, I append
 the following remarks           : —
     In  the interior of Oinia atoll         I noticed   some large masses of      living
 coral which presented the characters of miniature atolls.                    One large
 circular mass of Madrepora (with short branches), which measured
 18 feet across and 2 feet in height, possessed a dead centre that was
 depressed       9  or 10 inches below the level of its living margin. In
 this basin at " low water springs there were a few inches of water
                                                "
 forming      a  miniature lagoon        ;  whilst the  living margin     was exposed
 for   several       inches above       the surface.     In the lagoon      sea-urchins,
 star-fish,    sea-anemones,        stalked mushroom-corals, and cowries were
  to be seen       in  the crevices ;     tiny fish darted about from        one side to
 the other       ;  while a beautiful        blue Botryllian     and pink Nulliporai
 partially concealed the unsighthness of the dead coral.                      From the
  manner in which             the dead       branches of the Madrepora             in its
  central basin were blunted and rounded off, it was evident that, as
  the   mass       grew outwards, it had died and been subsequently dis
  solved away         in its centre.     An adjacent flat-topped      mass of Pontes,
  measuring        13  feet across, at the same condition of the tide presented
  an example of another               miniature    atolL     Its central portion      was
  dead and hollowed out into a basin, which was occupied by a small
  pool of water ; whilst its          living border    was exposed    for  a few   inches
  above the surface.           In   the pool grew      tiny lumps of     a   Pocillopora
   and some Alcyonarians.

dead coral.       On two occasions,             whilst wading       at   mid-day in          water
ankle-deep (3 to            4  inches),    I  found     its temperature         to be about
15 degrees      (Fahr.), above that of the surface of the                  sea.   Where the
water was a foot in depth, the increase                     in temperature was               about
8 degrees.

tide, and are exposed             to the rays of the noon-day sun.                In     a pool
an inch     in depth, and frequented by small fish and hermit-crabs,                           the
water was heated             up to 106° (Fahr.).           In another pool, 4 inches
deep, the temperature was 99°.                    The temperature of the sea at the
time of these            observations was          83°.    After the sky had                 been
clouded over for an hour, the shallower pool had lost                         7 or  8 degrees
of heat   ;   whilst      the temperature        of the deeper pool had only fallen
about   3 degrees,        and still remained about 13 degrees above that of
the surface of the sea.
    The Organic Degradation of Coral Reefs. — It was a singular mis
conception respecting the habits of holothurians that led me to the
consideration of the degradation of reefs by the numerous organisms
living upon them.              It  was stated by      Mr Darwin,* on the            authority
of Dr Allan, that           these animals subsist on           living coral         Professor
Dana,t however, pointed out that this habit was not warranted                                  by
the   evidence      ;   and Professor A. Agassiz,J               in his memoir         on the
Florida      reefs,    expressly states         that holothurians          do not     feed     on
the   living     coral ;      Professor      Semper §     evidently        holds   the      same
view.        During         my     lengthened       stay    in    the    Solomon       Group,
I   never     observed        a single instance        of this habit, and           I  arrived
somewhat        reluctantly at        a  conclusion which compelled me to                    give

                             of Edinburgh, Session 1885-86.                            895
up a theory I had formed on the subject.* Mr Saville Kent and
other observers f have come to the same opinion. This negative
fact may therefore be considered as established.
      The sand and gravel that I found in the intestines of these
animals were composed of dead coral, fragments of molluscan shells,
 small entire univalve and bivalve shells, foraminiferous tests,
 including the large Orbitolites, the joints of the calcareous alga,
  Halimeda opuntia, and other materials. Professor Semper, Professor
  Agassiz, and Mr Saville Kent have pointed out that the nutriment
 is chiefly obtained from the organic particles, diatoms, and foramini-
  fera,     associated       with the sand and gravel. Holothurians avoid
  these materials in enormous quantities.                  After several observations
  on one of the           commonest      species   of the reef-flat,   I  arrived at the
   conclusion      that each individual daily discharged not less than two-
   fifths of    a pound (av.) of sand and gravel, and that              in  the course of
   a year fifteen or sixteen of these animals would                  discharge   a  ton of
   these materials, which would tend through this continual process of
   trituration and attrition         to be reduced    to the finest mud.      Multitudes
    of other     creatures      take   part in this operation of degradation, the
    first stage of which is to be seen in the destructive effect of the
    boring-molluscs, annelids, echinoids, sponges, &c, on the masses of
    dead corals.        In the later    stages, not only the holothurians, but all
    echinoderms        (echinoids, asteroids,       ophiuroids),    together with fish,
     molluscs,    and crustaceans          are   actively   engaged.      Thus by       the
     process of organic degradation coral masses are reduced                to fragments,
     and these again to sand          and gravel,    which in their turn are ground
     down into mud.             Mr Darwin held that by this             agency    the fine
     sands and muds of the coral reefs are produced.                 His misconception
     respecting    the habits of holothurians          does not materially affect his
      conclusion.      Of the importance of this            agency    I  feel convinced.
      Professor   A.   Agassiz,    however, contends that,       as  in the   case of the
      Florida   reefs,   it  is very slight    as compared    with    the action of the
      breakers.    These reefs,     I would    point out, are somewhat exceptionally
      situated.   Here the rollers pass over the muddy slopes of a submarine
      bank   before they reach the reefs, and           in  consequence,     after storms,
      the sea is  discoloured with chalky sediment for miles around.                  Such

a   phenomenon is unusual in the Pacific, where,"on account                           of    the
greater      rapidity    of the submarine slope,           the rollers dash at once
against the face of the reef.                  Professor Dana, who           regards       this
process      of organic degradation          as   inadequate, would         attribute       the
formation        of the chalky        mud      of lagoons     and     reef- flats   to    self-
trituration of the gentlest kind possible.
    Very     fine sand may bo distributed            over the bottom of lagoons and
lagoon-channels in the following                 manner :—    I  have often observed
this material floating in the shallower places on the calm surface of
the water, the particles being connected together and coated                       by   some
oily film, such       as invests the pellets of sand voided by holothurians
and other animals that frequent coral reefs.                    A  touch of the finger,
by wetting the upper surfaces of the particles, causes them to sink.
This material        appears to be taken up by the water as             it runs gently      off
the sandy flats that are exposed            by the ebbing tide.           In  this manner,
during      a  calm day, sand may be transported on the surface of the
water from the margin to the centre of a lagoon, when some slight
disturbance, such          as a cat's paw      of wind, will send it to the bottom.
     I   may here     refer to the important           part which     echinoids take in
the degradation of coral rock.               On every reef it will        be noticed that
 the blocks of dead coral, and especially the flattened                     dead summits
 of the massive corals, such             as  Porites, display singular narrow            and
 somewhat tortuous grooves,             8 to 12     inches long,    1  to 2 inches wide,
 and     3  to 4 inches deep.*             The sides of these grooves             are worn
 smooth and are lined by a pink nullipore.                     Nestled at the        bottom
 of each is to be found           a  solitary echinoid belonging to a species               of
 Echinometra, the size of which exactly corresponds with its furrow,
 so    that it is difficult      to dislodge       it without injuring the          animal.
 That these grooves           are the permanent homes            of these echinoids          is
 shown in the character             and arrangement of the spines on the                 two
 sides of the tests, which are in close apposition with the walls of                      the
 furrow.        The spines are here small and partially                  stunted,   and no
longer radiate from the animal, but are pressed                        back against       the
 test.     These grooves are evidently produced by the occupant,                       for it
 is well     known that echinoids are able to gouge holes for                   themselves
 in the solid rock.           According       to Professor     A. Agassiz,       species    of
    *
        These   grooves  are often   preserved   on flats  of coral rock that have       been
recently elevated      a few feet  or more above the    sea.

 The calcareous sand and gravel that strew the outer slopes below
 the zone of living corals in depths between 20 and 100 fathoms and
 beyond,        are largely composed        of reef-debris,   the tests of two species
 of Orbitolites (Orbitolites complanata and                 heterostegina),   the joints
  of the      calcareous alga,    Halimeda opuntia, and of Ntdliporm.             I have
  found the two          species of the Foraminifera        just mentioned living       at
  all depths       between    a couple of feet and 75 fathoms         ; and frequently
  when       I have   been using a lead having a broad cup 3£ inches across,
  ten or twelve of their tests have been brought up together on the
   arming.        Their   bleached    tests, for when alive or recently dead these
   Foraminifera       are of a sea-green colour, are equally numerous              in the
   chalk-like mud         exposed    inside the reefs by the retreating tide, and
   together with the joints of the Halimeda              they may be said to largely
   compose        many beaches.*         I  have   only found this      calcareous   alga
   living on reef-flats and in the wash of the breakers on the outer
   borders of reefs and among the troubled waters caused by tide-rips
   on coral shoals, which are covered by less than 10 fathoms of water.
   In     my soundings on the outer slopes of reefs            I only brought up the
    dead joints.       It  may be truly said that next to coral debris the tests
    of Orbitolites,     fragments of Ntdliporas, and the joints of Halimeda
    opuntia are the most important rock-forming materials in depths of
    from 20 to 100 fathoms on the outer slopes of reefs                 in  these seas.f
        * The
                Foraminifer, Tinoporus baculatus, is also commonly found in the
    sand of the Solomon Island beaches.
        + Similar deposits of Orbitolites are forming off the Australian shore between
    the inner reefs of the great barrier-reef.    Mr Beete Jukes found that the dredge,
     from depths of 15 or 20 fathoms, was sometimes filled with Orbitolites : these
     organisms seemed in some places to make up the whole sand of a beach
     of a coral island (Student's        Manual of Geology, 1862, p. 131).             The
     important part taken by Halimedce and Nulliporoe in the composition of
     deposits of coral reefs attracted the attention of Mr Darwin.       We are informed
      by him that joints of a Halimeda and small fragments of Nullipara, all dead,
      thickly strew the bottom in depths greater than 90 fathoms, off Keeling Atoll ;
      »nd also that Capt. Allen, B. N. , in his survey of the West Indies, found that in
      depths   between 10 and 200 fathoms the armings very generally came up
      covered with the dead joints of a Halimeda [Coral Beefs, 1842, p. 86).

genus Heteropsammia came up frequently in the sand                                       and gravel,
 from depths between                 20 and 40 fathoms off reefs.
         The composition of this deposit on the outer slopes                            of reefs and
the depths to which                   it extends          are    points       of importance.               Its
materials would form a white compact limestone, such as                                            I   have
described in my paper on the calcareous                                formations (p.         574)*        as
the commonest                 type of the so-called coral limestones in the Solomon
Group.           A rock of this description might                      be formed at          any depth
between         20 and 100 fathoms             in    places where the submarine                        slope
is steep;        but where the slope is moderately rapid, i.e., less than 20°,
as       it usually     is,   these deposits   will   be probably restricted to depths
considerably within the 100 fathom line.
 I        should here observe that these remarks apply only to the deposits
forming off coral reefs.                 On coasts, such as those of St Christoval,
and in harbours, such as Treasury Harbour, where numerous streams
carry down          a   quantity of sediment into the                 sea,   this material    is   mixed
in varying proportions with the calcareous                            sand and mud.
         Of   the nature of the           deposits forming              off the coasts of these
islands in depths beyond 100 fathoms,                           I     have    been     able to judge
from the character of the soundings made by Lieutenant Oldham in
H.M.S. "Lark"                  between    the north coast            of St Christoval          and      the
adjacent islands of Ugi and the Three Sisters.                                There appears to           be
a    maximum depth here of rather over 400 fathoms.                                    In    depths of
100 to 200 fathoms the nature of the bottom varies according to the
locality.           Thus, off the St Christoval                      coast, where the sediment
brought down by the numerous large streams                               is   in   great part derived
from volcanic rocks, the deposits forming in these depths consists                                       of
a    dark calcareous             mud sometimes            foraminiferous           and mixed with
coarser volcanic detritus;                while off the coasts of the small                      islands
of Ugi and the Three Sisters, the bottom between                                    these depths         of
100 and 200 fathoms                  is   formed for the               most    part of       calcareous
sand          mingled         with    macroscopic          foraminifera.       f       The     material

brought        up from depths between 200 and 400 fathoms were usually

         here append a few of the soundings which appear to be of special
 interest : —
      420 fathoms. — Gravel (size \ of an inch) formed of a somewhat
              decomposed        volcanic rock.          A single valve of a delicate
              shell (Leda, sp.) was also brought up.
       370 fathoms.      — An almost impalpable dark-coloured                non-calcareous
              mud or clay, of which             a large     portion    appeared     to  be   of
              vegetable     orign,   a   low plant-growth           or alga investing the
              minute siliceous grains.
       350 fathoms. — A subangular fragment                   (J an inch across) of some
              calcareous    rock, with     a portion of the shell of one of          a species
              of the Balanidns      apparently recently fractured.
       230 fathoms. — A single subangular                 pebble,    almost an inch long,
              of  a  finely crystalline      basic volcanic rock (spec. grav.           2 '85).
               No accompanying mud or               sand.
       170 fathoms. — Small angular, probably crushed, fragments (\ of
               an inch) of a dark compact             calcareous    rock.
       From the       several soundings that were made between                 100 and 400
   fathoms in this locality,         I   came to the       conclusion that the volcanic
   muds, which form the bulk of such islands                     as  Ugi and many others
   in the Solomon Group,               are   at   present forming off the coasts of
   reef-girt islands in depths greater                than 100 fathoms.          In the    case
   of those portions of the coasts of the large islands, such                           as   St
   Christoval,       which     on account of          the  sediment brought down by
   the streams         are bare of      reefs,   the    soundings of the survey have
   shown that these volcanic muds are forming at all depths from                               a
   few feet beneath          the low tide level to         a  depth of some hundreds of
    fathoms.
        Some of the principal points of this paper                I will  briefly summarise
    as  follows    : —
        1.  That fringing-reefs, barrier-reefs, and atolls exist in this group.
    They arrange          themselves into two             classes    (a), those    formed     at
     the   present sea-level,       and (b) those         that have      been   upheaved to

  900                    Proceedings         of the   Royal Society
 heights varying from a few feet to several hundred feet above the
 sea,   which    I have already        treated in a previous paper.
    2.   That    the numerous detached               submerged      coral shoals    in these
 seas,   which     represent     in fact the early condition of            a coral reef, are
 not able, without the aid of a movement of elevation, to raise them
selves     to within the constructive                power of the breakers.            Being
 arrested    in their upward growth               at depths varying between 5 and
 10 fathoms, according to the exposed                   or protected character      of their
 situation, they form flat shoals of no great size.
    3.   That atolls of small size, i.e.,         a   mile or so across, do not assume
 their characteristic form until they have reached                       the surface.       A
small flat-topped shoal is first brought by upheaval                          to or above
the sea-level.        Lateral extensions or wings grow out on either side,
so as to    ultimately form a horse-shoe               reef.   Such a reef presents its
convexity against          the prevailing       surface-currents, to which         in truth
it  owes     its shape.       The southern island of the Three Sisters was
evidently       produced in this manner (vide p. 16).                     In some atolls,
as   in the instance of Oima Atoll (p. 21), one or more islets of
volcanic rock have served               as points from which           the reef begins to
grow, guided in its direction                 by the prevailing          surface-currents.
The foregoing remarks do not refer to large atolls.                         On account of
their large       extent they would            probably have        assumed     their   form
beneath     the surface,       since, according         to the principle laid down by
Mr Murray, they would then have                    a  relatively smaller periphery for
the supply         of  food and sediment to the interior                   than would be
possessed by the small submerged                 shoals above described.*
    4.   That the       characters      of the seaward          slope   of a reef     are  as
follows : — For the first          70 or 80 yards from the margin of the reef-
flat there is usually a gradual slope,                   largely bare of living coral,
which      terminates at        a   depth of from 4 to            5 fathoms in a rapid
descent     to a depth varying           generally between 12 and 18 fathoms.
It   is this declivity that constitutes the growing edge of the reef,
and the sand and gravel, produced by the constant action of the
breakers,      collect at its base.
    5.   That where there is           a  rapid submarine slope, i.e., more than
10°    or  12°,   as is usually the case, the sand and gravel,                produced in
the manner just referred to, will extend far beyond the depths in
                       *

                           of Edinburgh,       Session 1885—86.                  901
•which reef-corals         thrive  ; but that in the     case of reefs possessing   a
gradual       seaward      slope, i.e., less than 5°, the lower      margin of this
band of detritus -will lie within the zone of reef-building corals,
and in consequence a line of barrier-reef will be ultimately formed
beyond this band with             a deep water channel inside.
      6. That where the area is undergoing elevation,               a succession   of
concentric        lines of barrier reefs would thus originate, line after line
 being      advanced,      as  fresh portions     of  the sea bottom are brought
 towards the          surface,   each    line growing     upward along the lower
 margin of the band of detritus derived from the line of reef inside
 it.      In  such a manner have the Shortland Islands been formed.
       7.  That the forgoing explanation of           the formation of barrier-reefs
 in     these   islands is substantially the same as that proposed             thirty
  years ago by Professor Joseph Le Conte in the instance of the
  Florida     reefs.     He then pointed out that since corals will not grow
  on muddy shores or in water upon the bottom of which sediment is
  collected, the favourable conditions can only be obtained at some
  distance from the shore, where               a  barrier-reef would ultimately    be
  formed limited on          one side by the    mvddiness and on the other by the
  depth     of the   water.
       Since    I was    not acquainted with Professor Le Conte's view, my
   explanation has all the more value.              The independent agreement of
   the two views is itself a           third argument in favour of this mode of
   formation of barrier-reefs,          which may now be briefly stated.
       These    reefs  will only grow       on gradual submarine slopes, i.e., on
   those less than 5° ; and since corals cannot thrive             in the shallower
   depths on account of the accumulation of sand and the presence                  of
   sediment      in  the water, a reef can only be formed          in the depths at
   some distance        from the shore where these unfavourable conditions
    do not   exist      If   such depths are within the reef-coral      zono, then a
    barrier-reef     will   be  produced.      The foregoing conditions      may be
    described as the determining causes of a barrier-reef.            After the reef
    has been formed,       other agencies, such as solution, organic degradation,
    and the     scouring action of tidal currents, will keep             the lagoon-
    channel open.
        The circumstance that            barrier-reefs often exist   at   the margin
    of a submarine plateau,           beyond which the slopes descend         rapidly
     to great depths,      has hitherto     not been satisfactorily explained.       I

 902                  Proceedings     of    the Royal Society
 may cite the instances          of the great       Australian     barrier-reef    and
of     the   barrier-reef    of Bougainville         Strait    described      in   this
 paper    (page 20).     Such plateaux have a very gradual slope, and,
provided that their outer margins are within the limits of the reef-
coral zone, they would afford             the most favourable        conditions     for
reef-   growth.
    This explanation of the origin of barrier-reefs in no way affects
the views at present          held by       Mr Murray, Professor A. Agassiz,
 Professor Semper,       and others,       concerning the formation of atolls.
Atolls of small      size may be produced         in the manner referred to in
paragraph three on page 41.           Those of large size would assume their
form, whilst still submerged,             on account of the condition           of the
food-supply       favouring    the growth of coral at the circumference.
When such       a reef has reached       the  limits of breaker-action, the sand
and detritus accumulating in its centre would repress in                    a  greater
degree the growth of the coral         ;  and finally, after the reef has reached
the surface,     the lagoon would be further           deepened     by the solvent
action of sea-water       and by the organic degradation of the dead
coral.*
     Nor   is my view of the origin of barrier-reefs inconsistent                 with
that held by Mr Murray and other naturalists.                  The chief point of
difference    is that   I do not consider        that the agencies of solution,
diminished      food-supply, organic degradation, and tidal scour, are
 the determining causes of the formation of the lagoon-channel, but
 that they are auxiliary causes which come into play after the reef
 has begun to grow at that distance from the shore where the suitable
 conditions for reef-growth exist.
     On the formation of fringing-reefs, my observations throw no
 additional light.     These reefs, when occurring alone, often characterise
 steep submarine slopes, but they may accompany                     barrier-reefs on
 coasts where the slope is more gradual.
     8.  The   statement     that lagoons       and lagoon-channels are some
 times deeper than the zone in which               reef-corals  thrive, is founded
    *   Mr H. 0. Forbes, in his recent account of Keeling Atoll, refers to the
welling up of dark sulphureous water in the lagoon, by which the corals,
molluscs, fish, and other organisms were killed over a large area of the basin
(A Naturalist's Wanderings in the Eastern Archipelago, 1885, p. 22). Such
an agency can scarcely    be  exceptional, and probably takes    a part in the forma
tion of lagoons.

on a         misconception of the conditions that limit the depth of this
zo ne. All            observations      go to show that the depths at which                        reef-
corals thrive vary greatly in different localities, the variation being
due      to differences of local conditions, such as the degree of inclina
tion         of the submarine slope, the presence                    of submarine declivities,
the amount of sediment held in suspension, the force of the                                breakers,
and other influences. The main determining condition                                           is to be
found in the injurious effect of sand and sediment rather than in
the general influence of depth, and the distribution of these
materials           is dependent on the local conditions above referred                              to.
 Local conditions will usually restrict                      the reef-coral       zone to depths
less than 30 fathoms; hut                       I    have   shown that where there                 is a
 gradual submarine                 slope,   reef-corals       are to      be    found    in depths
 beyond the sand and gravel.*                        Since most observers, however, have
 regarded these materials as necessarily limiting the zone, they did
 not push their inquiries beyond. Under favourable conditions,
 reef-corals may thrive in depths of 50 or 60 fathoms, and thus we
 can readily explain                the apparently abnormal depths inside some
 atolls and barrier reefs.               The fact that        I    came upon some upraised
 massive corals resting in their position of growth on a partially
 consolidated ooze, which                   I   never found in depths less than 50
 fathoms, goes to support this view.
    9.       That proofs of the outward growth of barrier and other                                reefs
 on their own talus,               a point       to which          Mr Murray      attaches       much
 importance,          are to be     found —
    (a)       In the    circumstance            that massive        corals     may be commonly
               observed to increase             in   size as one       approaches        the    lagoon
               from the outer margin of the reef-flat
    (b)       In the    presence     of old lines of         erosion which        have    evidently
               been produced at the sea-level, but which have been cut off
               from the action of the waves by the advancing edge of the
               reef-flat.
      (c)     In    the characters      and position of the wooded                   islets, situated

               reef-flat,   were   it   not for one counteracting circumstance,                     the
               outward growth of the reef.

                                    By Patrick Geddes.
   To    appreciate         the present position of biological          science,    it is
necessary       to   have a clear conception            of the history.        For this,
abundant historical materials are indeed available, and reach                        their
highest level in the standard works of Sachs* and Carus.f                           Such
detailed histories, however, produce, by their very completeness, a
measure        of embarrassment.            Moreover, the existence of numerous
distinct lines of research, often equally prominent at the same time
and   in   the same work, is apt to obscure the fact that the science has
really     had    a   simple and natural evolution.               What the       student
demands        is not so       much any detailed chronological            survey,      but
rather    a  sketch which will show how the whole system of modern
biology,      with      its increasingly       exhaustive analysis     of detail,      lies
within     a few     essential     lines of research,    as  laid down by      a definite
succession       of original       thinkers.     This  has already     been done for
the morphological              aspect    of   the science     in the author's      article
" Morphology,"            in the EncycloiJcedia Britannica, and for the              phy
siological side        more recently in Dr Michael Foster's article "                Phy-

sketches, it is       the object of this paper, after (1) briefly recapitulating
the      main lines of progress in each        case,  (2) to make clear the essential
parallelism in the evolution of these two aspects of biology, and (3)
to    make practical application of the synthetic outline thus reached.
      § 1.  Morphology.     — (a) We must regard Buffon           as neither distinctly
 a morphologist nor physiologist, but                as a general    natural historian,
 whose wide and brilliant survey of all that                was known of the forms
 and habits of organisms gave a semblance of order and method to
 the chaotic accumulations of the mediaeval or " encyclopaedist "
 school, which found in his famous Histoire Naturette                 at once its monu
 ment       and grave.      Without forgetting        the labours    of Ray and other
 early     systematists,    we may     fairly  say that the modern period opens
 with     Linnaeus.      He   is to be noted here, not so much for his detailed
 labours,    — for his introduction of binomial nomenclature, definition
 of   the successively higher categories of species and genus, order and
 class, precision of descriptive terminology, and the like,                 — but   more
 generally for that isolation of the conception of form from that of
  function, in which         he laid the basis of the future            science of pure
  morphology.          The   exhaustive      catalogue     of natural     forms which
  Linnaeus began was continued by his pupils and intellectual beire.
  It  is  still in  progress, as the recent     "Challenger" expedition         testifies.
  Each new         species  described    means      a leaf added to the Systema
  Naturw, and the whole work               has thus, as     it  were, been under con
  tinual revision and perfection by             a constant succession       of sectional
  Bub-editors.
     (I) The transition from         the study of the general form to that of its
  component organs was made by Jussieu, and thence introduced into
  zoology by Cuvier.           A new school of morphology              arose,  in which
  superficial description         was   supplemented        by    detailed   anatomical
  research, and this line       of advance has been followed up by a series of
  brilliant Cuvierians.         The school is thus an unending one, to which
  every new descriptive anatomical research                  belongs as clearly     as   if
  it were published as an appendix to the Rkgne                  Animal itself.
     (c) The next step is due to Bichat, who penetrated below the study
  of organs, and analysed the body into              a series   of simple tissues with
  definite structural characters.           Here, again,      a  new movement — the
  histological — found its beginning,            and thus, under         the Anatomie

906                       Proceedings        of   the    Royal Society
Generate,        may be grouped not only the labours of his immediate
school,      but    researches      on embryonic           layers and tissue            structure,
which form so large a proportion of recent literature.
   (d) Histology had not, however, found in the study of tissues its
ultimate basis.   Yet a deeper mine of morphological inquiry was
opened up when Schwann referred all plant and animal                               structure     to
its cellular        type and origin.              The    tissue was       analysed       to a cell
aggregate,         and that study of cells in their form and structure, in
their development and modifications, which still mainly occupies
histologists, was thus fairly initiated.
      (e)   Finally,     the researches of        Dujardin, von Mohl, Schultze, and
others       directed attention from the cell as such to its all important
component protoplasm.                  With this         began   a   new epoch, in which          a
fundamental basis for the study of organic structure                               is   sought in
the investigation of protoplasm.
   The history of morphology                 is   thus that of       a   progressive analysis;
the study of form, so well expressed                      in the labours of Linnaeus,            is
succeeded          by the study of organs               in the comparative anatomy of
Cuvier      ;   while the histological movement inaugurated by Bichat's
analysis of organs              into tissues      is    developed in the study of cells
which Schwann suggested, and finally in the investigation of pro
toplasm,        which affords        the latest and deepest              problem of morpho
logical research.              No   deeper     analysis     is   possible, without passing
out of morphology altogether into chemistry and physics, and we
 are thus warranted               in regarding our analysis as practically ulti
 mate.          Along     these    five great lines of inquiry our morphological
 researches        are    still progressing towards              exhaustiveness,        and while
 all, or at least most, of these are combined in any exhaustive mono
                                  of the Naples Station or of the " Challenger
                                                                                                 "

   §    3.    Physiology.      — (a) The early physiology, which had not                   shaken
 itself free from mystical interpretations of the processes of the body,
 but still clung to the hypotheses of animal and vital spirits and                             the
 like, was little more than             a    superficial study of habit and tempera

merit.              Of this non-analytic line of study Haller, though somewhat
in  advance of contemporary research, may                       be taken as a convenient
representative.*  It is still represented, of                   course, by many physio
logical naturalists, and such recent explanations as that of the origin
of sex in terms of parental temperament, " superiority," &c, may
be named              as convenient instances.
      (b) The progress of anatomical              research could not, however, fail to
show that many vital                 processes were associated       with definite   organs,
and here begins that study of the functions of each organ taken as a
whole, which formed for so long the sole problem of physiology.
 As      a typical          representative of this school we may perhaps               name
 Johannes Miiller.
      (c) Bichat was, however, physiologist as well as morphologist, and
 in the physiological   side of his Anatomie Generale function was re
 ferred below the mechanism of an organ to the fundamental pro
 perties of its component tissues.                   Bichat thus not only deepened
 both morphology and physiology by                        a new analysis, but showed
 them             to coincide in the study of tissue.             The   plane of contact
 between the two                  subsciences   being demonstrated,          we can     thus
 understand how Bichat was the first thinker who clearly formulated
  the conception of a united biology.
       (rf)       With the advent of      the cell theory, function, which had been
  referred           from    organ to tissue,     had now to receive         a yet    deeper
  interpretation in terms of cell-structure.                   Such a cellular physiology
  was soon suggested              by Goodsir, and developed by Virchow and his
  schooL
            (e)   The interpretation of function in terms of organisation, which
  had thus been               attempted    at different    levels,   began   even    here    to
     break down, and as attention was                 directed to the nature of pro
     toplasm, physiology began to undergo what Foster well describes as
  a    change        of front     The physiologist must begin to read the riddle,
     alike of function          and structure, in terms of the molecular changes
     (metabolism)           within the protoplasm.   These are distinguished as
                   constructive, assimilative, synthetic, or " anabolic
                                                                        "

              lines of inquiry                       are thus accurately parallel.                         The two sides of the

        If we suppose         the diagram rolled              into  a  cylinder, the meeting of
 the        two edges will          readily     illustrate        how, in the study of pro
 toplasm,         morphology          and physiology             come    into ultimate       contact.
  Again, if the diagram be folded along the middle perpendicular
  lines, a gradual unfolding from the centre outwards will, as column
  after column is exposed, illustrate the historic evolution of the
   science.       The same facts are expressed in another way by the second

   which morphological or physiological                          research has arisen and must

plane, and must be traced through the pile of accumulated                       concrete
facts   at right   angles.     Evolution      bears,   in  fact,   the same relation
to morphology and physiology as history to statistics.*
   § 3. Application.
                         — The preceding summary, if indeed just                      and
accurate,   will (a)   enable   the student to recognise the historic evolu
tion in its naturalness and unity, and             (J) afford    a ready   and orderly
method of passing beyond the limits of his own immediate specialty
towards the unravelment,            nay, even the mastery, not indeed                    of
the entire quantity, but of the whole essential literature                  of biology.
But (c) a yet more important practical result is forcibly suggested
by this bird's-eye view.          If, as has been shown, morphology and
physiology have alike found not only a deeper, but an ultimate con
tact, in the study of protoplasm, then we have travelled to the very
limits of empirical research,         and, qualitatively       speaking, can go no
further.     As Foster     suggests,     a new departure becomes,             however,
possible.     Without, of course, checking the detailed labours of mor-
phologist and physiologist           in developing any of the five inductive
lines of inquiry, it is now incumbent on the biologist to interpret
the results deductively        in  terms of their fundamental             secret,   nay,
even    to verify   them by prediction.             It  is no longer sufficient        to
accumulate additional         empirical detail, however interesting              ; what
has been already gained must also be appreciated and rationalised.
It  is necessary,    in short,   to retrace       the  progress of the science, to
interpret structure and function at all their levels, in terms of pro
toplasm, and thus furnish          the deductive rationale of each hitherto
merely empirical order of observed              fact and connecting theory.            If
the waves of inductive research            have reached      their utmost (qualita
tive) limit, the possibility of returning on the reverse wave is now
at least open, great though may be the risks.                        But a concrete
example    of this is still required.          In   the author's recent Encyclo
pedia Britannica articles,        the phenomena of Reproduction                and  Sex

(l-v.)      have been discussed         inductively; while the following         paper
applies the           result gained to the deductive interpretation of organ,
tissue, and          cell in their connection with the reproductive function.
In    other words,         these  two attempts at the treatment of these sub
jects,       traversing as they do the whole field of morphology                   and
physiology, both             vegetable  and animal, affords      a crucial test alike
 of the justice of the above historical outline, and of the practicability
 of its deductive application. In the Britannica articles, the facts
 of outward form and habit, the reproductive organs, tissues, and
 cells,     are respectively described       in the conventional      (i.e., inductive
 or    empirical)      order, and the required rationale of the           whole series
  of    phenomena (the theory of sex and reproduction) is finally reached
  (see "Sex," Ency. Brit.) in terms of the metabolism of proto
  plasm.        The following       paper   attempts the reverse, i.e., unconven
  tional and deductive, yet rational method, the applicability of
  which has just been argued for ; it postulates merely the simple and
   ordinary conception of protoplasmic metabolism, and successively
   deduces from this the form and essential functions                    of the repro
   ductive cells, tissues, and organs, and even the external characters and
   temperament of the sexes.
         7.  Theory of Growth, Reproduction, Sex, and Heredity.
                                  By Patrick Geddes.
        From    the synthetic outline of the history of biology contained in
   a  previous paper,         the  practical corollary was deduced,        that it was
   now legitimate,         if not indeed urgent, for the biologist to reverse the
   usual order of investigation,           and instead   of merely adding induc
   tively to the         categories  (therein enumerated) of accumulated fact,
   boldly to set about interpreting these in terms of their fundamental
   secret,*      that    of   constructive    and   destructive    metabolism — ana-
   bolism and katabolism.           Selecting  a set of problems at once peculiarly
   comprehensive and peculiarly difficult, which the author has in recent
       *
         As already noted in the previous paper, the physiologist no longer seeks
    to explain function in terms of organisation, but rather both in terms of pro
    toplasm.      It is thus necessary to postulate an acquaintance with the modern
    conception of protoplasm, for which reference may be made to M. Foster's
    Eney. Brit, article on "Physiology," and the writer's article on "Proto
    plasm."      The general theory may be summarised           in the accompanying

912                       Proceedings      of   tJie   Royal Society
essays* discussed           inductively,   it is the object of the present                           paper      to
apply the modern conceptionof protoplasmic anabol ism and katabolism
to the phenomena of growth, reproduction, sex, and                              heredity. At                   dif
ferent levels of analysis, attempts have indeed been made to rationalise
these phenomena,            the theories of sex alone being said to                       number           hun
dreds, but       it has   been already pointed out that an interpretation                            of    func
tion in terms of protoplasmic changes                  is,   in its nature at least, ultimate.
     §    1.   Growth. — The first    adequate         discussion of growth                     is due           to
Spencer,       f   who pointed out that in the growth of similarly shaped
bodies, the mass increases as the cube of the dimensions,                                      the    surface
only       as    the square.        Thus    in the growing                 cell          the    nutritive
necessities        of the increasing mass are ever less adequately supplied
by the less rapidly increasing absorbing surface.                                The early excess
of repair over waste secures the growth of the cell, but the neces-
diagram.         Protoplasm     regarded as an exceedingly complex and unstable

sarily      disproportionate increase      of surface implies less opportunity
for     nutrition, respiration, and excretion, and waste thus overtakes,
balances, and threatens to exceed repair. Three alternatives are
then possible ; (a) a temporary equilibrium may be established, and
growth ceases, or (6) the increase of waste may bring about dissolution
and death, or still more frequently (c) the balance of mass and surface
may be restored by the division of the cell.
      iNow, these facts may be expressed            in lower and more definite
terms.        The early growth of the cell, the increasing bulk of con
tained protoplasm, the accumulation of nutritive                   material, corre
 spond to        a predominance of processes         which are constructive      or
 anabolic.        The growing     disproportion     between mass and surface
 implies      a   relative  decrease   of anabolism, while the simple con
 tinuance       of life or metabolism entails a gradually increasing pre
 ponderance of destructive processes or katabolism.                 While growth
  continues, the algebraic sum of the protoplasmic process is of course
   + on the side      of anabolism,   and growth may thus be defined as the
  preponderance of an anabolic tendency, rhythm, or diathesis.                The
  limit of growth, when       waste has overtaken and begun to exceed the
  income or repair, corresponds in the same way to the maximum of
  katabolic     preponderance    consistent with life, in other words, to the
  climax of the katabolic diathesis.           It  is well known, for instance,
  that cell division occurs especially at night, when nutrition is at a
  standstill, and when there        is therefore a relative katabolic prepon
  derance.
      2\or does this definition      of the limit of growth apply only to
  cells,   but also, of course,     to cell-aggregates.      The phenomena of
  growth in the history of        tissue   and organ, of organism and stock
  alike are expressible in terms of the anabolic and katabolic balance
   above referred to.      The average size of the species, the length of its
  life, the advent of the reproduction which marks the beginning of
   death,   must submit      to be similarly      rationalised.    The palaeonto
   logist, even,     may be enabled     to understand     the rationale of that
   attainment of great     bulk exhibited by     so many    of  the highest types
   of ancient     as  well as of modern faunas,       and also of the constant
   tendency of such gigantic forms to extinction.

Spencer) the origin of discontinuous growth or asexual reproduction.
Budding, simple-division, and spore-formation like continuous                  cell-
division, are simply different forms of the necessary separation which
must occur at the    limit of growth, if the continuity of life is to     be pre
served.     Like continuous cell-division,       asexual   reproduction occurs
when waste or katabolic processes are in the ascendant.               But    what
holds true in the growth of the individual cell, is valid also in regard
to the aggregate.      There, too, a limit of growth must eventually             be
reached,    when discontinuous growth in some form becomes inevit
able.    The essential    difference is simply that at first in the uni
cellular   individual the disintegration          and reintegration      entirely
exhaust the organism and conclude its individual existence, while                in
higher forms the process becomes more and more localised.
   (b) Sexual Reproduction : Phylogenetie Evolution.
                                                               — Turning      now
to the connection between        asexual and sexual reproduction, it will
be convenient,    in the first   place, to resume the facts of the phylo
genetie evolution, and then to interpret these physiologically.               The
clear morphological account given by           Vines   (see  his discussion     of
"
  Reproduction — Vegetable," Ency. Brit.) may be taken as a                 basis.
(1) A simple protophytic alga like Protococcus usually exhibits            a per
fectly continuous asexual cycle, in which the cell divides into a       number
of equal spores which come to rest and develop to the normal                 size.
A hint of incipient differentiation       appears  in the occasional    division

                        of Edinburgh,        Session 1885-86.                         915
of the cell into     a larger number of smaller spores, which settle down,
however,       and develop just like their more richly dowered neigh
bours.      (2) In Ulothrix, again, both large and small spores may ho
formed by division, and both may simply come to rest and germi
nate.      In   such a    case,  however, the macrospores             seem to form        a
weakly plant, unless they have previously uniled in pairs in                          con-
jugatioa         (3) The reproduction of Ectocarpus is also effected by
 macro- and microspores, and in this case the latter generally though
not invariably        conjugate.       Between the conjugating            forms, more
 over, a certain physiological          difference can be detected         ; some    soon
 come to rest and settle         down, and it is with these that their more
 energetic      neighbours      by-and-by       conjugate.        There    is   thus   the
 beginning of a distinction          between       male and female elements.            (4)
 Further, and       more    markedly, in Cutleria            the two kinds of spores
 result from perfectly distinct           sporangia, and the larger, less mobile
 macrospores,      which soon come to rest, are fertilised              by the smaller,
 more active microspores.             Both the dimorphism            and the fertilisa
 tion characteristic of sexual reproduction                  have  thus become,       in  a
 measure,     defined.
     Let  us now review these morphological                 facts in the light of pro
 toplasmic processes.          We    see   in  Protococc-us how spores of smaller
 size, that is to say, less predominantly                  anabolic, are yet able to
 develop      independently      ;   and that        this    also  happens with the
 microspores of         Ulothrix,     resulting,     however, in a weaker plant,
 while    a more    successful development may be ensured by a process
 comparable to mutual nutrition.                  Individually they       are too kata-
 bolic for anything but weak independent development                        ;  in uniting,
 however, they are strong.               The     case   of Ectocarpus is peculiarly
 instructive, not only in the association of more marked microspores
  with the almost constant          occurrence      of fertilisation, but also in the
  presence     of two      distinct    conjugating        types, — the comparatively
  sluggish, more nutritive,          preponderatingly          anabolic (female) cells,
  which soon        settle    down,     and     the     more mobile, finally more
  exhausted and emphatically             katabolic      (male) spores.        In Cutleria
  too the less mobile and more anabolic macrospores                    are fertilised by
  the more active and more katabolic microspores,                     which have now
  gone too far for the possibility          of independent development.
     In  the Protozoa, also, amid the general occurrence                 of continuous

916                         Proceedings          of   the    Royal Society
cycles of asexual reproduction, we find hints of sexual dimorphism
and     fertilisation.           Both     among Radiolarians                   and Infusorians                  the
conjugating elements may differ in size                            ;   in   the        Volvocinece      especi
ally macro- and microspores                      occur, which            may conjugate               with       one
another,        though the process is usually restricted to the latter.
   The almost mechanical flowing together of exhausted                                                cells,        as
illustrated        in plasmodia, is             connected        through the known surviving
cases      of multiple                     with normal conjugation, and we
                                 conjugation
have      just   seen     how gradually the dimorphism appears which marks
the transition             from    conjugation           to      fertilisation,           and      makes        the
latter indispensable.                   Enough         has       been       said         to    indicate        this
extremely gradual differentiation of asexual into sexual reproduction.
The very gentleness                of the gradation leads one to regard the two
processes        as   analogous         responses       to the same physiological                       neces
sities.     The same disturbance of the balance between anabolism and
katabolism which results in the occurrence                               of asexual reproduction,
when continuous growth or continuous cell-division was no longer
possible,        leads,    in more developed                 forms,      to the separation of the
dimorphic and mutually dependent elements of sexual reproduction.
As     asexual reproduction               occurs      at the limit of growth, so                      a check
to the asexual            process involves the appearance                      of the sexual, which
is thus     still further        associated       with katabolic             preponderance.
   The familiar history of the Aphides                            may serve              as an illustration.
During          the   summer months, with favourable                                     temperature         anil
abundant food, the Aphides produce parthenogenetically, generation
after generation             of females.               The advent of autumn,                         with      its
attendant cold and scarcity of food, brings about the birth of                                         males,
and the consequent                recurrence          of strictly sexual reproduction.                         In
artificial environment, equivalent to                        a   perpetual summer, the                asexual
process         may       be prolonged           for years,            while       a     lowering      of     the
temperature           and diminution             of the food at once reintroduce                       sexual
reproduction.              The     occurrence          of the latter               is,    in other     word?,
associated        with the setting in of conditions which make for kata
bolism.
     This opposition             between        nutrition and reproduction, which,                          after
life      and      death,     is    the        most    obvious antithesis                     in   nature,     is
often taken advantage                     of    for    practical         purposes.             The   removal
of the reproductive organs,                      in    flowers,        for instance,           increases     the

vigour of        vegetative   growth; while in         the well-known       expedient of
root-pruning,         nutrition   is checked in order to favour sexual repro
duction. Again we note the connection between the latter and
katabolic ascendency, and thus the familiar generalisation that nutri
 tion     varies inversely     as  reproduction (perhaps most familiarly            illus
 trated in      the contrast between       the leafy and spore-bearing portions of
 many ferns — Osmunda, Botrychium, &c.) admits of being                        more pre
 cisely    restated    in the thesis, that    as a  continued surplus of anabolism
  involves growth,         so a relative preponderance of katabolism necessi
  tates reproduction.
      It  is again on the present           view readily intelligible        why in the
   exceptionally        favourable     anabolic     environment       of   bacteria and
   many parasitic fungi sexual reproduction should not                     occur,    liar-
   shall Ward* has pointed out that the more intimate                      the degree of
   parasitism      or saprophytism, the more degenerate the sexual repro
   duction.       The    greater   the anabolism,        in other words, the         more
   growth, and the less sexuality.             That such comparatively complex
   organisms can continue their asexual                 reproduction,    dispensing al
   together      with     the  acknowledged        stimulus      of fertilisation,    may
   probably be, at least partially, explained by the presence of abundant
   waste products acting as extrinsic stimuli.
      The relation of sexual          to asexual     reproduction, which has been
   already referred to in its phylogenetic history (p. 914), is sometimes
   beautifully illustrated in        the life of the      individual.     There are, for
   instance, frequent reversions from the sexual to the asexual process,
   and from the latter to vegetative            growth.        Among cryptogams the
   sexual reproduction is sometimes suppressed               ;  thus the fern plant, for
   instance, may spring from the prothallium                     asexually.    Nor   is it
   uncommon for the asexual reproduction by spores to be replaced by                     a
   continuous      vegetative    growth.      In the flower-head of          an  Allium,
   again, we constantly find that some of the flowers have degenerated
   into asexual buds.         A still  more beautiful illustration        of the condi
   tions of genesis is afforded        by the tiger lily.         In this form growth
   at first tends to remain continuous, and the base of the bulb bears
   simple    vegetative buds.          Further     up,    however, where nutrition
   reaches its maximum, the axils             of the     leaves   contain buds, which
   are separable     though still asexual.        Finally, further up still,       where

nutrition       is relatively      lese active and               katabolism      is maximised,
the formation of flowers indicates the appearance                               of sexual repro
duction.
  (c) Alternation         of       — The alternation between tape
                                 Generations.
worm head and proglottides, between fixed hydroid and swimming
bell, between leafy fern plant and inconspicuous prothallus, and the
like, are familiar        facts, which            have, however, been            studied almost
exclusively on their morphological                       side.        Even on superficial          in
spection, however,          of any           of those       numerous          cases,   where        an
asexual     form alternates        with one or more dimorphic sexual genera
tions, it is evident that we have here to do in two generations                                with
what is often so obvious in one — the familiar                              antithesis between
nutrition       and reproduction.             A     consideration of the physiological
distinctions between the asexual and sexual generations,                               shows     that
the former        is   the expression of favourable                        nutritive conditions
resulting in vegetative growth, or at most in asexual multiplication,
while     the    latter is conditioned              by less propitious           circumstances.
Just    as a well-nourished           plant may continue propagating itself                       by
shoots and runners, and               just   as    an Aphis in artificial summer may
for years reproduce             parthenogetically, so             a   hydroid with abundant
food and otherwise favourable environment                              may be retained       for     a
prolonged period vegetative                  and asexual, while dearth of food and
otherwise altered conditions                 evoke       the appearance          of the sexual
generation.        That   the tapeworm head, or the encysted scolex before
it,   should in   a    plethora of nutriment remain asexual,                      while the pro
glottides, further        from the sources               of supply, &c, exhibit sexual
reproduction, conforms to what we have already seen in regard to
the relation      of the two processes                  to one another and to the condi
tions favouring anabolism or katabolism.                           The contrast between the
deeply-rooted,         well-expanded           fern      plant        and the    weakly-rooted,
slightly-exposed         prothallus,     is       obviously that between           an organism
in conditions favourable to the continuance and preponderance of
anabolic processes,         and that of an organism in an                          environment
where katabolism          is,   at an early stage,         likely      to gain the ascendant,
the former therefore             is   asexual,      the latter sexual.            A    survey,     in
fact, of the conditions and characteristics of the two sets                             of   forms
inevitably      leads us to regard the asexual generation as the expression
of predominant anabolism, and the sexual                              as   equally emphatically

kat-a"bolic.         Alternation       of generations           is indeed but       a   rhythm
between         a relatively anabolic          and      katabolic preponderance.             The
conception         must be applied, however, not only to the general facts,
but       to specially difficult        cases.      Thus the peculiarity in the life-
 history of mosses, where            the naturally vegetative            or asexual genera
 tion      is not independent, but grows,                 as  it  were,  parasitically upon
 the sexual, explains the comparative failure                       of that line of evolu
 tion, and the more successful development of                      those other cryptogams
  in     which     the   asexual     generation,         developing      its predominantly
  anabolic tendency, finds sufficient foothold in                    the struggle for exist
  ence.        So  phenomena,        like apogamy            and apospory in       ferns, the
   shortening of       the sexual      generation        in   phanerogams,     and     the like,
   must     be analysed.     In short, all      the modifications of form, floral and
   other, in    one or in two generations,             must be explained — not in terms
   of    "spontaneous       variation,"      i.e.,    by unaccountable variations               in
    each special     case,  with natural         selection      varying also with circum
    stances for each special          case,    as    has     been   usually    believed and
    maintained — but in         terms     of the fundamental             protoplasmic        pro
    cesses, by reference to the rhythm of anabolism and katabolism.
       § 3. Nature      of Sex.      A. Inductive. — In what has been already
    noted in regard      to incipient sex,         it  was the object to indicate how
    sexual reproduction        was related          to the     asexual   process,    and     how
    both    were   associated    with     a preponderance          of katabolism.          There
    remains, however,       the further problem of the real nature of sex, or
    the rationale of sexual dimorphism.                    In attempting      to define       the
    distinctive characteristics of male and female, it is necessary to begin
    with   the sexual elements themselves.                 The difference     between male
    and female is there exhibited in its fundamental and most concen
    trated expression.        It  is   in the      sexual     elements,    indeed,    that the
    continuity of organic life is secured, the vegetative                  organisms       being
    but appendages       to the direct immortal chain of sex-cells.                    In   com
    paring ovum and spermatozoon                it   is necessary,    in  the first place, to
    refer briefly to the possible phases of cellular life.
       Starting     from an undifferentiated                and amoeboid       cell,    it  is   a
    simple fact of observation that the continuance of life in varying
    environment opens          up the       possibility       of great     variation in the
    protoplasmic metabolism,            so that the         algebraic sum of anabolism
     and katabolism       must vary within               the   widest limits.         Suppose,

  920                Proceedings      of  the    Royal Society
  then,   a  continued    surplus     of   anabolism         over katabolism,      — the
  result is necessarily  a  growth in size,       a   reduction of      kinetic energy
  and movement,     an increase     in potential energy           and reserve      food-
  material.   Irregularities     thus   tend to        disappear    ;  surface-tension,
  too, may aid, and the cell acquires        a  spheroidal form.         The   result —
 a large and quiescent ovum — is thus               intelligible    enough.      Again,
 starting from the amoeboid         cell, if katabolism          be   in growing pre
 ponderance,    the increasing liberation of kinetic            energy thus     implied
 must find its outward expression          in increased activity of         movement
 and in diminished size ; the more active cell becomes modified in form
 by passage through its fluid environment, and the natural result is the
 flagellate sperm-cell.   The morphological characters of the sexual ele
 ments are thus expressible as the results of preponderant                   anabolism

 in the female and katabolism in the male.                It  would lead us too far
 at present from our direct argument to show how this applies to the
 Protozoa, which exhibit a practical coincidence of cell and organism,
 and which should be defined not so much as "organisms devoid
of sexual reproduction," but rather as " undifferentiated reproductive
cells (protosperms or protova, as they may in fact be
                                                                        called) which
have not built round themselves a body." Not only do the Protozoa
illustrate, in the great lines of their differentiation, and in the phases
of their life-histories, the outcome of preponderant or equated ana
bolism and katabolism        ;  but in the incipient            dimorphism     of two
conjugating individuals        or the macro-         and microspores of higher

                          of Edinburgh, Session 1885-86.                                    921
forms,       we find the primitive           expression and fundamental secret of
that difference which afterwards comes to saturate the whole body,
and to effect what we know as sexual dimorphism. Without enter
ing into detailed illustration, it will be instructive to select the
case of Volvox.   In this colonial organism, which is best regarded
as      a   multicellular      protist,     the component          cells are at first all
alike.        They are united by protoplasmic bridges, and simply form
a vegetative colony. In favourable environmental conditions this
state of affairs may persist, or be interrupted only by partheno-
genetic        multiplication.        When           nutrition    is   checked, however,
sexual reproduction               makes     its appearance,       and that in   a   manner
which illustrates           most    instructively       the differentiation     of the two
sets of elements.             Some of the cells are seen differentiating at the
expense of others, accumulating capital from their neighbours                          ;    and
if their area     of exploitation be sufficiently large, emphatically anabolic
cells or      ova result ; while,         if their   area is reduced by the presence of
numerous competitors struggling                      to become     ova, the result is the
formation of smaller, more katabolic, and ultimately male cells.                                 In
 some       species    distinct    colonies may, in the same way, becomo pre
 dominantly           anabolic or katabolic, and be distinguishable                 as com
 pletely female          or male colonies.            Again     we reach   the conclusion
 of a predominant anabolism effecting the differentiation of female
 elements,      and of katabolism as characteristic of the male.
    (2) Another illustration may be selected. In the cells of a develop
 ing anther an enormous number of crystals may be often observed
 to occur.       Crystals are, however, usually regarded                 as accumulations
 of waste products.               These anther crystals are, in fact, comparable
 to urinary       deposits.        Such accumulations do not, however, occur
 in   the embryo-sac        or in the female organs             in spite of the homology
 in male       and female         development.          They     occur as signs of kata
 bolism where we would naturally expect them — in the tissue of the
 male organs.
      (3) Or, again,      in the structure of Chora or Nitella,                there       is,   as
 is   well known, an alternation               between nodal and internodal cells.
 The internodal cells are actively vegetative,                   and go on increasing in
 size ;     they do not divide, and may be justly regarded as emphatically
 anabolic.       The nodal cells, on the other hand, are much smaller,
 and    do divide.       They are to be regarded           as   relatively more katabolic.

A crucial    test of the present theory thus suggests             itself.    Since the
reproductive       organs   are    simply,     as   every morphologist          knows,
shortened hranch-structures, we should predict                   that the    cell from
the segmentation of which            the antheridium        is derived    must corre
spond in position to a nodal cell (i.e., be based              upon an internode),
while   the corresponding essentially female               cell or ovum       must be
internodal or apical in origin (i.e., based upon a node).                 It is there
fore not a little noteworthy that an examination alike of                     classical
figures  and fresh specimens        will show that this imperfect homology,
but perfect physiological correspondence,             is invariably the fact.
    (4) Similarly over a larger area, if we take a general survey of
male and female forms, noting the distinctions of their form, func
tion, and general habit of life, it      will   be seen that the males are       upon
the whole smaller,        more  active,    with higher temperature, shorter
life,  &c, than the        more     vegetative,     nutritive,    and conservative
females  — the apparent exceptions presented among the higher
animals being readily explained when we bear in mind the larger
development of the male muscular system necessitated                    by the excep
tional stress of external activities thrown on the male during the
period    of   incubation     or pregnancy,         &c.     Rejecting     theories  of
" inherent "     maleness   or femaleness,        it is yet evident that there
must be some cause giving        a   bias to  the general life, — some influence
saturating the whole organism,— in fact, some predominant                       proto
plasmic     diathesis.      An    analysis      of   the    differences    in   detail
suggests    the previous conclusion          that the female         is the outcome
of preponderant        anabolism,      and    the    male    of equally     emphatic
kata holism.
    (5) An induction over another wide series of observations also
confirms the result already reached.               I  refer to the researches on
the determination of sex,* which, though incomplete, and                    in many
cases divergent, have        yet led to a few results which may be con
sidered   as  fairly well established.        Thus, when the male parent is
older than the female, when it is in its physiological prime, when
the sperms      meeting the ova are young and fresh, when the con
ditions of nutrition and environment               both for parent and offspring
are defective or unfavourable, the offspring is            likely   to be male.    On

¦when     the female is at its physiological prime, when the ova fertilised
are young         and fresh, when food is abundant             and environment
 favourable,      the ehauces are distinctly in favour of the offspring
 being female.        A few well-known        cases may be briefly referred to.
 Thus old       branches     of conifers, overgrown and shaded by younger
 ones, produce only male inflorescences,            and some fern prothallia in
 unfavourable       conditions can still produce antheridia, but not arche-
 gonia.      Male plants of hazel grow more actively in heat than the
 female, and Stratiotes aloides bears only female flowers north of 52°
 lat., and from 50° southwards only male ones.                Caterpillars starved
 before entering the chrysalis state produce males, while others of the
 same brood       highly nourished      come out females.      In his well-known
 tadpole experiments, Yung raised the percentages                  of   females   in
 one brood from 56 in those unfed, to 78 in those fed with beef, and
 in another from          61  to 81 per cent,      by feeding with fish; while,
 when the especially nutritious           flesh of frogs was supplied, the per
 centage rose from 54 to 92.
     Now such conditions          as deficient or abnormal food, high tempera
  ture, deficient light, moisture, and the like, are obviously              such  as
  would     tend to induce a preponderance of waste               over repair, — a
  lcatabolic    diathesis, — and we have just seen that these conditions
  tend to result in the production of males.            Similarly, the    second set
  of factors, such     as  abundant and rich nutrition,       abundant light and
  moisture, must be allowed to be such as favour constructive pro
  cesses, and make for anabolism, and we have              just   seen that theso
  conditions result in the production             of females.    The explanation
  has thus been reached, that in the determination of sex, influences
  inducing katabolism tend to result in production of males, as those
  favouring anabolism similarly to increase the probability              of females.
      B. Sex — Deductive Interpretation. — The theory may be confirmed,
  moreover, deductively as well as inductively, in proportion to the
  success    of its interpretation      of the various orders of phenomena,
  from the reproductive elements themselves to the sexual dimorphism
  of the entire       organisms.      Of this deductive      rationale,    however,
  only a few illustrative       examples can here be given.
     (1)   In  regard   to the reproductive      elements,   numerous empirical
  results,   hitherto little more than curiosities of observation, admit

924                     Proceedings     of  the  Royal Society
of being rationalised.           Thus,     if the ovum         be  a   predominantly
anabolic cell, in an environment tending towards the increase of
anabolism, the occurrence in so many groups of degenerate ova which
are wholly nutritive becomes intelligible.              They have passed       the limit
of normal anabolism, and have become too anabolic to divide.                             So
the various kinds of spermatozoa,             from the ordinary ciliated         type to
the sluggish amoeboid          form of many Arthropods, may be                arranged
according to the degree in which katabolism diminishes.                      The amoe
boid forms partly equipped with nutriment persist,                  as is well   known,
for a prolonged period, which would be quite impossible for the
rapidly moribund ordinary types.                    Experimental researches like
those     of Zacharias and others on the action of reagents,                    &c,     on
 sperms,     such facts as the artificial       reversion to the amoeboid          type,
the attraction of sperms most powerfully to the most                    nutritive solu
tions, and      so on,  acquire a new meaning and importance.
    (2) So, too, in the phenomena               of maturation, the formation             of
polar vesicles seems rightly interpreted           as an  extrusion of the katabolic
 or male elements        from the preponderatingly            anabolic ovum.        The
 close parallelism between        spermatogenesis         and oogenesis, which has
 been elsewhere       insisted upon,* holds good here also.              The extrusion
 of protoplasmic elements          at various stages        in  spermatogenesis,     but
                                   especially in the sperm mother-cell or sper
                                   matogonium, which             is homologous with
                                   the ovum,         may    be similarly      expressed
                                   as   a    separation     of predominantly        ana
                                   bolic material.         In this connection it         is
                                                                                   Julin

 similar      staining reactions of polar vesicles in ova, and the blasto
 phore      remnant in spermatogenesis.              Further, in the differentiation
 of the reproductive elements in most                 plants, certain elements are
 observed       to be separated    off,   and     these admit      of being similarly

rationalised.      In the history of the pollen grain Strastmrger dis
tinguishes the vegetative,        apparently non-functional, from the gene
rative or essential nucleus.         On the present       view, the latter would
be regarded      as  emphatically      katabolic,   the other half as less so.
Similarly, the      basal portion of the zoospore-forming cell             in certain
Alga;, the unused remnant in the antheridium of Salvinia and other
forms, the " Bauchcanalzelle " separated in the differentiation of
Conifers and Archegoniates, and other cases noted by Strasburger
and others, admit of being interpreted             as  separations of anabolic or
katabolic portions,      as the case   may be.      That such     a separation may
take place in cell division         is illustrated    on the present view, for
instance, in the primitive          reproductive      cell of a Sagitta,        which
divides into two portions, afterwards developing to form ovary and
testis respectively.
    (3)  In   regard   to fertilisation,   which forms, indeed, the central
problem of sex, numerous theories have been proposed                 ; some authors,
e.g., Strasburger, asserting the absence of any essential               physiological
difference   ;  while, according to others, like De Bary, the difference
is indeed profound.          Sachs suggested the analogy between ferment
ation   and fertilisation,       while   Rolph     regarded     the process in its
nature and origin          as distinctly    nutritive.      It  has    been   already
noted,    in   regard    to the origin      of   fertilisation,    that the almost
mechanical flowing together of exhausted cells is connected                    by the
stages of multiple conjugation          with the ordinary form of the latter,
while the respective        differentiation of the two elements effects the
transition to fertilisation proper.         Historically,    then, fertilisation     is
comparable to mutual digestion, and the reproductive process has
arisen from a nutritive want.            With the differentiation of the           ele
ments along anabolic and katabolic lines, the nature of the fertilising
act   becomes     more    definite.    The    essentially katabolic        male   cell,
 getting rid of all accessory nutritive material contained in the sperm-
 cap   and the like, brings to the ovum a supply of characteristic
katastates,     which stimulate the latter to division.               The profound
 chemical differences       surmised by some are intelligible             as the out
 come   of the predominant          anabolism and katabolism             in the two
 elements.      The   union     of the two      sets    of products restores       the
 normal balance and rhythm of cellular life.               Rolph's     suggestion    is
 thus included and defined.

  926                 Proceedings      of  the. Royal Society
     Just  as some zoospores may sometimes           dispense with conjugation
 and germinate independently,            so may ova develop        parthenogeneti-
 cally.    These are to be regarded as        incompletely differentiated forms
 ¦which   retain  a measure     of katabolic (male) products, and thus do
 not need fertilisation.      Such a successful balance between anabolism
 and katabolism is indeed the ideal of all organic life.                   That the
 extrusion of polar globules has been observed in some instances,
 only shows that some katabolic products are still expelled.                 J ust as
 in the disappearance      of sexual reproduction in parasitic fungi,          where
 surrounding     waste   products presumably          serve   the purpose other
 wise effected by means of sexual organs, so peculiarities          in the develop
 ment of parthenogenetic ova may explain the retention of the normal
 balance   which makes      division     possible without     the usual     stimulus
 afforded by fertilisation.
     (5) The deductive interpretation must, however, be extended from
 the elements themselves to the associated tissues.                In the present
 state   of our knowledge,       it   is sufficient   to  suggest     the  interpre
 tation of the phenomena of segmentation, or of the resemblances
 and divergences     between that of the ovum and that of the spermato
 gonium.      That the different modes of segmentation, in regard to
 which we barely know the morphological                  facts,  must ultimately
 depend    upon variations in the anabolic and katabolic rhythm is evi
 dent, though the nature of these variations is obscure.             Nor in regard
 to later development can we do more than note that the physiological
importance of the embryonic layers may be essentially expressed                    in
 te rms of their respective predominance of anabolism and katabolism.
     (6) In reference to the tissues of ovary and testis, tempting appli
cations might be suggested.               Hermaphroditism,       for instance, is
common in the undifferentiated embryonic stages, when the cell-
diathesis is still to some extent undecided.                 Whether      it  occurs
thus, or with casual       or constant persistence       in the adult, it is     due
to the local preponderance        of anabolism and katabolism in one set of
reproductive cells or in one period of their life.             Van Beneden and
others have     suggested    that the yolk-bodies (vitellaria) of the com
plex generative     organs of many Platyhelminthes            are to be regarded
as degenerate     ovaries.    On the present       view this 6eems extremely
probable, and is expressible       as   the result of an over-nutrition result
ing in   a too  completely anabolic preponderance.             Other pathological

                             of Edinburgh, Session 1885-86.                                  927
degenerations of            the ovary    will doubtless admit of similar description,
while        the     abnormal regions in amphibian testes may be similarly
referred         to restriction of the area of predominant katabolism.
      (7) The application of             the   conception       of anabolic and katabolic
rhythm           to    organs    and functions,         sheds    a  new    light    on   several
familiar         processes.       If  the female      sex be indeed preponderatingly
anabolic,         we should expect this to show itself in distinctive functions,
 and     so   it  is.   Menstruation is thus explained as the means of getting
 rid    of the anabolic surplus in absence of the foetal consumption.                       Just
 as it    is intelligible       that the process should stop after fertilisation,
 when       replaced      by the demands         of the foetal parasite, so the occur
  rence of lactation         as the outcome        of   a still preponderant        anabolism,
  and the final return of menstruation,                    become lucid and reasonable.
  So in      a widely different region the distinctly                 anabolic overflow of
   nectar ceases at fertilisation,             and the surplus of continued pre
   ponderant         anabolism is drafted into the growing fruit.                       In   the
   male,     too, similar expression          is given       to    preponderant katabolic
   diathesis.         Even associated organs may be influenced by the general
   tendency.           Thus the kidneys of the stickleback, greatly affected
   by mature testes, are known to produce                       special waste or katabolic
   elements in the          form of mucous          threads,     which instinct has sub
   sequently utilised in the familiar nest-building.                        So,  too,   various
   peculiar sexual functions, such              as   those    frequently associated with
   the maturation of the sexes, will doubtless admit of being explained
   not merely (and more or less metaphysically) as the result of sexual
   selection, but really and ultimately as the outcome of anabolic or
   katabolic preponderance.
      (8) The general average difference in form and habit between
  male and female has been already referred to as an inductive argu
  ment in support of the theory that the males are predominantly
  katabolic, and the females              as   emphatically anabolic.             Conversely,
  the    fundamental           conception      of    protoplasm,       i.e.,  life,   may     be
  applied       to    the interpretation       of the       details both       of form      and
  habit.       Thus,      every one is familiar           with cases such        as  Bonellia,
  Rotifers,       and     Cirripedes,      where       the    males      are  mere     pigmies
  in comparison           with    the   females.         Here    a   long continuance of
  predominant katabolism has brought its peculiar nemesis.                              Where

 and in reference              also   to secondary sexual characters,                   it is no longer
 sufficient to explain these teleologically in reference to sexual selec
 tion   ;   both essential            and secondary peculiarities must be                      explained
as the results of preponderant anabolic or katabolic diathesis                                      in    the
 two sexes.
     § 4.    Heredity. — Since the theories                       of heredity will be discussed
in a future paper                by my friend             Mr Arthur Thomson, the subject
shall be referred              to here only          in briefest outline.             To explain the
likeness of offspring to parent numerous hypotheses,                                    both   physiolo
gical and physical, have been suggested, which, though perhaps too
mystical in their present                    forms, will yet,           to some extent at           least,
admit of being re-expressed                         in   the     more   real    and definite terms
of protoplasmic changes.
     An important line of investigation, first noted by Jiiger, but
recently followed up and corroborated by Nussbaum, and especially
by Weismann, emphasises                          the fact that,     in many      cases at least,     the
future reproductive elements                       are isolated from the germ at an early
stage       in    the development, and, in some cases,                         before     the differen
tiation          of the body-cells.               In the direct continuity                between    the
rudimentary             reproductive organs               of the embryo and the parent
ovum,        there       is    a continuity         of protoplasm, which                is in itself a
partial explanation of the continuity in history.
     Now, if           the    reproductive elements               start with      a     specific proto
plasm       continuous with that of the combined mother ovum and
fertilising           sperm,    that       is,    with    a     concentrated      accumulation           of
characteristic anastates                   and katastates,          the simple fact            that the
products of protoplasmic change                           must be fixed, definite, and con
tinuous,         as   in all chemical processes, gives us at once                     a   protoplasmic
basis from which               to explain          the constant and necessary symmetry
of segmentation and development.
     On the other hand,               if   there be cases where the superficial                 charac
ters acquired by the individual                          parent are transmitted to the off
spring, apart from the result of similar environment and experience,
it must not be forgotten that all the organs of the body do to                                           a

certain       extent share mutually in nutriment                      and in waste products,
and     that thus,          besides the characteristic specific          protoplasm acquired
through         direct continuity, both germinal cells and developing embryo
may     accumulate a proportion of characteristic anastates and katastates,
acquired        as    it   were "pangenetically"            from the organs of the body.
   § 5. Much of the above interpretation may                              be summed up         in
reference to the genealogical tree. Starting from                         one of the familiar
diagrams             (a)         expressing the
genetic         relationships             of    the
 various forms, the accompany
 ing     figures           represent       magni
 fied fragments of                the tree.     The
 second figure (b) expresses the
 continuous alternate series of
 sex-cell and organism,                   the lat
 ter becoming              less and less dis
 tinguished          from its parent cell
 until    the two practically                  coin
 cide     in     the Protozoa.                  The
  parallel one             (c)   shows how the
  continuous immortal stream of
  protozoan           life,       which       Weis-
  mann has so well described,                     is
  continued by that of the re
  productive cells among higher
  animals.       The gradually enlarg
  ing leaves of the tree, which
  represent          individuals,          express
  in their relation              to the base the
  gradual       differentiation            of the
  reproductive             process, which         is
  at    first    coincident            with the
  disintegration and reintegration
  of   the entire organism,                but be

 apposed another similar figure, yet divergent                          enough to express                the
difference between the sexes.                  The      mode of representing                 the   process
of "alternation of generations," already explained at p.                                       918, will
readily suggest itself.
   In short, then, when the genealogical                       tree has thus been magnified
until     we can study the succession                 of organisms which compose                       it,   we
find that the explanation                 of the morphological                 and physiological
phenomena which this succession                       presents      and involves (i.e., those
of growth, reproduction, sex, and heredity) becomes raised from the
plane     of detailed, un-coordinated, and empirical observations                                       and
hypotheses,         to that of   a    generalised         and verified rationale or law, by
the deductive application (which the historic survey of the preceding
paper     showed to be at once legitimate, urgent, and profitable)                                           of
that simple principle which               is   fundamental in biology.
  We thus           come    to understand             the phenomena of heredity and
growth, of reproduction and sex,                 as   a   continuous series of expressions
of whole activities           ,of     the organism         ;   and      thus       the marvellous
phenomena of sex are seen to be no isolated ones, but, in animal or
plant alike, the highest outcome,                         the literal blossoming,              of the
individual life.
  At this point the present exposition naturally                                   closes,    since its
obvious        applications      to    the problems               of human life cannot                   be
entered on        within the present           paper.       Yet    a   new and vaster              deduc
tive application of the same principle must be indicated.                                    For   if   the
details of the genealogical              tree be thus explained, so also may the

i.e., the problem of those variations which we know as sexual, leads
us to the         problem of variations in general                 ;   it   enables      us to look
forward to the solution of the problem of aetiology in deeper terms
than those of " natural selection

        (P. 917.)      A    thoroughly          parallel instance of the association
between       a   specially anabolic environment and the non-occurrence                                  of
sexual reproduction           is      afforded by           the    recent      observations              of

Ja-worowski on " Chironomus " (Archives Slaves                   de Biologie,  1886).
He       finds that by rupture of the ovarian membrane the ova fall into
 the      body-cavity, and there develop rapidly           to form larvse without
 fertilisation.         " The  great abundance of nutritive        material replaces
 the     effect of fertilisation."
      2.    My attention     has recently been      called by Mr H. B. Brady to
 the phenomenon of Dimorphism   "                 "   exhibited by certain Fora-
 minifera, and which has been hypothetically interpreted as possibly
 of   sexual nature by De la Harpe.            An inspection of De la Harpe's
 figures      seems to me to render      it  clear   that this explanation is just
 (the objection of Munier-Chalmas               that sex is unknown in Protozoa
 notwithstanding).            The form named          Nummidites     Lamarckii,    as
 "better grown and less modified, with fewer partitions, and a grand
 loge central, seems to me distinctly the anabolic or female                   ; the
 other, N. laevigata, since smaller and more modified, the male.
      3.   I have    finally to record my obligations for much help, both in
  the discussion and preparation of the present               paper,  to my friend
  Mr J. Arthur Thomson.

Curven vom tof alogisch          en* Gesichtspunct aus zu studiren und zu
classificiren (Müncheuer Dissertation, in Commission hei               Mayer und
Müller in Berlin).
    Zunächst boten sich die rationalen ebenen Curven dar,               und unter
ihnen wiederum           diejenigen vierter      und fünfter Ordnung,        welche
lauter reelle Doppelpuncte mit reellen Zweigen besitzen.               Nicht    bloss
die    von H. Tait aufgestellten Eintheilungsprincipien              der Knoten,
sondern auch seine Schemata             waren dabei für mich von      Nutzen.
     Seitdem sind die topologischen Untersuchungen von Herrn Tait
(loc. cit., 1884, 1886), Kirkman (loc. cit., 1884, 1886), und Little
 (Trans, of the Connecticut Academy, 1885) fortgesetzt,              indem    ebene
Knoten mit 8, 9, 10 crossings hereingezogen wurden.                   Von anderer
 Seite her haben namentlich Simony (Mathein. Annal-en, von Klein
u. Mayer, xix., sowie eine fortlaufende Reihe von Publicationen
in den Wiener          Sitzungsberichten)       und Koller    (Wiener Berichte,
 1885)      neue   topologische      Gesichtspuncte    entwickelt.      Auch die
 Arbeit von Weith (Züricher Dissertation, 1876) brachte einige neue
 Bemerkungen.          Endlich hat Brill (Mathem. Annalen, von Klein u.
 Mayer,      xviii.)   einen topologisch-algebraischen         Beitrag   zur   Ver-
 schlingung von Raumcurven geliefert.
     Wenn      diese   Arbeiten     auch keinen directen Bezug          auf meine
 damalige Studie hatten,          so   zeigen  sie doch, wie das Interesse       für
 dieses    Gebiet der Anschauungs-Mathematik             seitdem gewachsen ist.
 Sie boten daher die Veranlassung, meine              damals mehr auf empir-
 iscliem     Wege     gefundenen       Resultate einer sorgfältigen       Neubear
 beitung zu unterziehen.          Diese lieferte einmal einige Berichtigungen
 und nicht unwesentliche Ergänzungen (über welche weiter unten),
 vor Allem aber eine strengere, algebraische Begründung.
      Im Folgenden         erlaube ich mir, einen kurzen Auszug              meiner
  Untersuchungen          vorzulegen.      Um aber die ursprüngliche topolo
  gische Natur       derselben   nicht zu sehr zu verwischen, habe ich mich
  in den algebraischen       Zugaben auf das Notwendigste beschränkt.
      In  §  1 findet man      eine   gedrängte   Zusammenstellung der topolo-
  gischen Sätze und Methoden, die bei Behandlung algebraischer Knoten
  zu Grunde zu legen sind.            Es folgt sofort die Anwendung         auf  die

 Erbringung            der Beweise für die Existenz der vorher aufgestellten
 Typen.           Dies geschieht einmal mit Hülfe von quadratischen Trans
 formationen           (§   5).     Zweitens aber— und dies ist der Weg, auf dem
 die     gezeichneten Curventypen                     erhalten worden sind — unter Anwend
 ung eines einfachen Deformationsprocesses, welcher lehrt, wie man
 von zerfallenden rationalen Curven zu eigentlichen in continuirlicher
  Weise       gelangt.            Diese Deformationen               lassen     sich, gerade          für den
  Fall der Curven vierter und fünfter Ordnung, wiederum auf quad-
  ratisclie       Transformationen                 (§     6)    stützen, in     allgemeinerer            und
  durchsichtigerer            Art jedoch auf ein Projectionsverfahren                         (§   7).
      Die Combination beider Methoden liefert in                             §8   eine dritte, welche
    zu den Resultaten des            §   4    führt
      Zum Schluss werden gewisse                           algelrrawche   Relationen entwickelt,
    welche den inneren Grund dafür enthalten, dass bei den rationalen
    Curven fünfter Ordnung                        eine ziemliche Anzahl von Typen nicht
    existiren können.

 2 l) von Knotenpuncten.                   Streicht man daher im Stellenschema
 der endlichen (variirten) Curve C diejenigen Buchstaben, welche
 den aus       0   hervorgegangenen          Knotenpuncten     zugehören,   so bleibt
 es  ein  reducible*1    (q.e.d.).
     Läuft     dagegen     die Curve C eine gerade         Anzahl, Sm, von Malen

 nach obiger Methode invertirten und variirten Curve.
       In    beiden fallen setzen wir das Schema in der reducirten Form
 voraus.             Treten           K   Knotenpuncte im reducirten Schema auf, so kann

 in vier verschiedenen Richtungen                           längs     der Curve fortgehen.           Da

    !Nach der von H. Klein * aufgestellten allgemeinen Formel besitzt
die R4 entweder zwei reelle           Wendepuncte, oder keinen (und dann
eine isolirte Doppeltangente).
     Mittelst der im zweiten Abschnitt entwickelten algebraischen
 Methoden lasst zieh zeigen, in welchen Fällen zwei reelle Wende
 puncte auftreten können, und auf welchen Zweigen der B4 sie sich
 dann befinden.
     So z. B. kann der eine der beiden Wendepuncte im Typus (3)
 auf einer Schleife liegen, oder auf einem der übrigen (passend
 gewählten) Verbindungszweige.
      Dadurch wird es möglich alle Lagen einer Oeraden, die vier             reelle
  Schnittpuncte      mit der Ä4 gemein haben soll, einer Ä4 gegenüber zu
  bestimmen d.h. man kann genau angeben, welche Zweige der Rv und
  wie oft jeder einzelne, von einer Geraden getroffen werden können.
      Nur dadurch gelingt es, (die Typen der E5 mit Hülfe des (unten
  erörterten) Auflösungsprocesses aus den R4 herzuleiten.
           § 3.  Die Typen der Rb     (cf. die Figuren   auf Blatt L, IL).
      Eine   R5 hat eine oder drei Asymptoten.        In beiden Fällen sind die
   Stellenschemata der sechs Doppelpuncte von vorn herein reducirte.
   Man     hat daher alle reducirten        Schemata für sechs      Buchstaben
   aufzustellen, und nachzuweisen, welche von ihnen realisirbar, und
   welche es nicht sind.      Das Letztere wird öfters eintreten, da (c/. § 9)
   zwischen      den   sechs Argumentenpaaren          der Doppelpuncte drei
   Eelationen herrschen.
       Die Zahl der Schemata ohne Schleifen (c/. Tabelle II.) ist 80, wie
   auch H. Tait angiebt.         Diese ziehen sich aber auf nur 9 wirklich
   verschiedene     zusammen    (die in der Tabelle durch einen Stern markirt
   sind).     Von diesen sind 4 die Schemata der von H. Tait auf
    gestellten endlichen Curven, nemlich No. 121, 130, 133, 135.            Diese
    führen zu     E5 mit einer Asymptote, während aus vier weiteren,
    nemlich     No. 122, 128, 140, 149 E5 mit drei Asymptoten hervor
    gehen.
       Nur ein einziges Schema No. 127 ist nicht realisirbar:           dieses ist
    in der That nicht einmal als endliche Curve, die noch ausserdem
    einen  dreifachen Funct besitzt, zu construiren.

    Diese ziehen sich auf 44 wirklich verschiedene                  zusammen.        Von
diesen sind      25* realisirbar, davon          3 durch R5 mit drei Asymptoten.
In der That sind die              letzteren,   No. 65, 69, 116 überhaupt nicht
realisirbar durch endliche Knoten.
     Kein realisirbares          Schema      (von den 33, die es thun)             füdtrt
gleichzeitig zu einer i?5 mit einer und drei Asymptoten.
     (Dies gilt nicht mehr für K„, wo n>5).
     Die   33 Stellentypen der Rb besitzen auch 33 verschiedene                 Felder
schemata        (die    in dieser       kurzen    Mittheilung unterdrückt          sind).
Umgekehrt         aber kommt         es  häufig vor, dass einem einzigen Stellen
typus mehrere Felderschemata zugehören.
     So  z.  B. kann       der Stellentypus        No. 12 (26) t durch drei ver
schiedene Felderschemata repräsentirt werden (cf. Blatt IL).

logische (endliche) Knoten zurückgeführt : jetzt soll das Umgekehrte
geschehen.         Wir können nemlich nach solchen endlichen alge
braischen Knoten            fragen, welche die gleiche Verschlingung                auf
weisen,     wie ein gegebener topologischer (endlicher) Knoten. Diese
Aufgabe ist für die (von H. Tait aufgestellten) Knoten mit 3, 4, 5,
G,    7   Knotenpuncten           mit Hülfe       des   weiter unten     geschilderten
Auflösungsprocesses unschwer lösbar.
     Und zwar sind jene Knoten (die mit T3, T4, Ts, T3, T- % bezeichnet
seien) sämmtlick noch als endliche R6 (die T3 noch als R4) darstellbar,
wobei natürlich die letzteren ausser dem reellen Curvenzug noch eine
Anzahl       isolirter    resp.     imaginärer      Doppelpuncte      besitzen.      Die
 Figuren     (auf Blatt       II.)  zeigen   jene Knoten gerade in der Gestalt,
wie sie aus einer, in eine B4 und einen Kegelschnitt                   Rä z>>rfallend'>n
    * Diese sind
                   gleichfalls (in Tabelle I.) durch einen Stern ausgezeichnet.

      Damit ist auch, wie der zweite Abschnitt lehrt, eine Darstellung
jener Knoten durch algebraische Gleichungen ermöglicht.

     § 5. Beweis    für   Existenz der Typen der Ä4 und R& mittelst quad
                              ratischer Transformation.
      Es erübrigt noch, für die Richtigkeit der in           I aufgestellten   alge
 braischen      Knoten, sowie des in den Figuren vorgenommenen De-
 formationsprocesses die strengen algebraischen Beweise nachzuholen.
      Die  5  Typen der R4 bedürfen, wie schon in § 2 bemerkt, keines
 weiteren      Existenzbeweises (soweit es nur auf ihre Verschling-
 ung ankommt)          ;  will man sich jedoch          von   ihrer   Entstehung
 genauere     Rechenschaft geben, so unterwerfe man die Puncte in der
 Ebene der R4 einer quadratischen, involutorischen Venvandschaft *
 T9 deren drei Fundaraentalpuncte in die Doppelpuncte der R4 fallen.
 Dann geht die          R4   über in eine     R, d.h. einen Kegelschnitt, und
 umgekehrt erhält man vermöge               passender   T2 aus einer beliebigen
 Rj    z. B. einem Kreise, ohne Weiteres alle Typen der R4.
      Gehen wir zu den Typen der R5 über, so handelt                   es  sich um
 zweierlei,     einmal     um die Existenz       der aufgestellten    33    Typen,
 andererseits     um die Nichtrealisirburkeit        der 20 noch verbleibenden
 Stellenschemata (cf. § 3).          Beides ist mittelst der Transformationen
 T2 ausführbar.
     Nimmt man nemlich drei Doppelpuncte               der R6 zu Fundamental-
 puneten     einer T2, so transformirt        sich die R6 in eine R4, von der
 diese drei Puncte einfache Puncte sind.              Umgekehrt lassen sich für
jeden der 33 Typen der Rb          2Z4
                                       mit drei auf ihr gelegenen Fundamental-
 puneten     einer T2 so icühlen dass die Ri in die verlangte Rb übergeht.
 (§ 6   weist nach, wie dies am einfachsten ausführbar ist.)
     Versucht man nunmehr dasselbe Verfaliren für die 20 restirenden
 Schemata, so erweist sich jedesmal die          Ausführung als unmöglich.       So
 z.B. zeigt die Figur der            R4 mit    dem  Schema:     ABE (Blatt II.)
    *
      Diese ist z. B. ausführlich behandelt in Salmon's Higher plane curves.    Am
 einfachsten   wird sie repräsentirt durch die Verwandtschaft zwischen          den
 beiden Brennpuncten der einem Dreiecke einbeschriebenen       Kegelschnitte.   Die
 Ecken des Dreiecks sind die Fuudamentalpuncte der Verwandtschaft.

die R6 mit dem Schema :             ABFCED           (No(20)) überführe.         Die
entsprechende        Durchführung für die 19 weiteren Schemata unter
bleibe hier     : sie stützt sich auf die genaue    (in  § 3 erörterte)  Kenntnis*
aller möglichen Lagen einer Geraden zu einer R4.
    Die Methode dieses § genügt so zwar völlig dem Zwecke                        der
Auffindung aller Typen der R5 : behufs einer wirklichen Anschauung
derselben ist sie indessen viel zu zeitraubend.                Wir bedienen uns
daher eines andern Processes, der auch sonst in der Lehre von den
Gestalten algebraischer Curven eine Rolle spielt, nemlich des stetigen
 Uebergange«       zerfallender Curven in nicht-ztrfcdlende, oder des sog.
" Auftügungsjirucessen."

    Sei wieder das Fundamentaldreieck                einer T2 einer R4 einbe
schrieben.        A   sei einer der Eckpuncte, a die gegenüberliegende
Seite, die noch die reellen Puncte           Aj,  A2 aus der R4 ausschneide.
    Jetzt    bewege     sich  A auf    der R4, bis er mit einem      Doppelpuncte
der E4 zusammenfällt.             In   diesem    Augenblick      zerfällt die (sich
mit    A   bewegende)      R5 in eine R'4 und die Gerade        a.
    Verlassen wir umgekehrt             den Doppelpunct,      indem der Punct     A
längs     eines   der vier vom Doppelpuncte           auslaufenden Zweige fort
 schreitet,    so vereinigt     sich die R'4 mit der Geraden a zu einer B6,
und zwar "         löst sich," jenen vier Richtungen entsprechend,               ent
 weder der Punct Av oder der Punct A2, je in einem                    der beiden   *
möglichen Sinne, "auf."
     Soll sich daher eine gegebene B4 mit einer Geraden Rx so zu einer
 R5 vereinigen, dass sich ein bestimmter der vier reellen Sehnittpuncte
 von R4 und R, auflöst, so verfahre man, wie folgt :
     " Man nehme zwei der weiteren
                                             Schnittpuncte von R4 und Rj nebst
 einem Doppelpuncte A der R4 zu Fundamentalpnncten                         einer TV
 Vermöge der T2 geht die E4 über in eine R'4 mit Doppelpunct in A.
 Variirt man nunmehr die T2 dadurch in eine T'2, dass an die Stelle
 des     Fundamentalpunctes          A   ein in passender       Richtung    auf  R'4
 benachbarter Punct          A' tritt,  so verwandelt sich die R'4 vermöge T"2
 in   eine   R5, die die vorgegebenen        Redingungen erfüllt"
    *
       Diese beiden Sinne der Auflösung erhellen unmittelbar aus der Anschauung
einer, aus einem Geradenpnar       hervorgehenden   Hyperbel.

     Auf      diese       Weise       haben    sich die Figuren              für       die Typen der            JZ5

R'4       vorwärts          bewegen           können,          ohne      dass         die     successive         so
entstehenden R5 ihre Verschlingung geändert hätten.   Man ersieht
daraus, wie sich der in   geschilderte Uebergang einer

R5 in mannigfaltigster Weise bewerkstelligen lässt.
  Es kann sich freilich ereignen, dass, wie z. B. Figur a auf Blatt
L     lehrt, von den drei Fundamentalpuncten                                    der    T2   keiner längs der
R4 in die Lage eines Doppelpunctes rücken kann, ohne dass nicht
inzwischen die R5 ihren Typus gewechselt hätte. Dagegen zeigt Figur

 daher noch ein anderes                        Verfahren         mit, das allgemein                     für   ebene

   so  gelangt man zu einer Rn+i, die durch Auflösung des Punde^              X= a
  aus der R„ und derjenigen Geraden hervorgeht, welche von der durch
  t und P' gelegten Ebene aus der Ebene der R„ ausgeschnitten wird.
      Dies ist geometrisch evident. Daraus folgt umgekehrt die Regel :
  " Soll eine
                   R„ und eine Rj durch Auflösung eines ihrer reellen
  Schnittpuncte A continuirlich in eine R„+1 übergehen, so fasse man
  die R„ auf als Projection      einer räumlichen        C„+i,  von einem    ihrer
  Puncte, P, aus. Deren Tangente        t in  P    geht nothwendig      durch    A.
  Ist dann Q ein beliebiger Punct auf Rj, und schreitet man                 von P
  aus in einer der beiden Richtungen PQ um ein beliebig kleines
  Stück    zu einem     Puncte P', so ist die Projection        der C^i von P'
  aus eine R„+J der gewünschten Art, die zudem noch die Gerade
  Rj im Puncte Q berührt."
      Wir unterlassen    die genauere algebraische Verfolgung         dieses Pro-
 jectionsprocesses,     und gehen sogleich über zu der in § 4 benützten

Aj, Aj, A3 ; die R2 dagegen in eine durch den Punct A laufende Rr
     Löst man jetzt nach der Regel des § 7 den Punct A auf, so dass
aus dem Aggregat B^„.3 & Rx eine          R.^ hervorgeht,        so besitzt diese
gleichfalls drei (n     - 2) fache Puncte in der Nähe der früheren, wir
wollen sagen, in A\, A'2, A'3.

liche R„t2, die, wie verlangt wurde, der R„ + R2 benachbart ist.
     Wir bemerken      am Schlüsse dieser Betrachtungen nur noch            kurz,
dass man       ganz  allgemein algebraische      Processe   angeben    kann, die
das Aggregat aus einer R„ und Rm continuirlich               in eine R   +„ über

   Electro-Chemical      Reactions   between     Metals    in fused Salts. — The
present communication contains some results of a furthur study of
electrical reactions at high temperatures in fused salts.
   The interchanges of electro-chemical position between such metals
as  platinum     and copper and platinum             and iron in fusing salts,
noticed by the author, led to an investigation               as to the effect     on
the metals of varied intensified temperature in different parts of the
same fusing salt.
   A   number of repeated experiments were conducted as follow                 : —
   A salt  was maintained at its      f using-point in     a state of quiet lique
faction in   a large  flat-bottomed platinum         crucible, the ends of two
platinum    wires    A and B (0-063 inch diam.) cut from the                  same
piece, were immersed        in the fusing   salt, and the other extremities
 were   connected    with   an astatic galvanometer         of known    resistance
and constants.       Whilst the salt    was  in this condition of     even fusion
no current was produced.           On increasing the temperature of              one
                                        To Galvanometer

 wire A, the following             reactions were obtained        ;    the platinum wire
A (in      the part of the salt having the highest temperature), becoming
metal       positive.         On    reversing    the    action    and     increasing       the
temperature in the same way adjacent to the other wire                          B   (fig. !So.
 1), the exact reverse result occurred             in every experiment.
      When        a copper wire was substituted             for one of the platinum
wires, the copper was metal positive during the quiet fusion                            of the
salt at one even temperature                  but on locally intensifying
                                           throughout   ;
the heat      as above, under the platinum wire only, that metal at once
assumed        the positive position compared with the copper, and by
thus varying the conditions                 of temperature       alternate interchanges
of electro-chemical position between                the metals         could be produced
at pleasure        in the    same fusing salt.
      The results of numerous repeated experiments are summarised                             in
table A.
                                        General Remarks.

      Potassium                                 — This experiment1).
was six times repeated, giving same results, and on equalising the
temperature         throughout          the fusing salt,    alternating    currents con
tinued      for    a   few moments until thermal equilibrium                    was again
restored.
  Potassium Carbonate (Table A, Divisions                    2   and 3). — This experi
ment was thrice repeated with same results.                      The positive position
of platinum and E. M. F. was maintained steadily for ten minutes,
or as long         as the    extra heat was      applied under the platinum             wire.
During equalisation of the temperature throughout the fusing salt,
alternating electro-chemical positions between the metals occurred
for   a   short time.
   Potassium Nitrate (Table A, Division 3). — This experiment was
six times repeated with the same result each time.   On equalising
the temperature         throughout the fusing salt, the metals resumed their
original positions, copper being positive.
   These experiments indicate that, by apportioning the heat applied
to two dissimilar elements, such as platinum and copper,                       in the   same
fusing salt,      it   is   possible to produce equipotential            in an electrical
sense between          them, and by pursuing this            still further,    a   complete
abnormal       interchange         of    electro-chemical    position     is   obtainable,

character.       An explanation is doubtless found in the fact that the
metallic element whose molecules acquired the greater activity owing
to the increased temperature (consequently becoming more liable to
attack from oxidation and corrosion), would, under the continuance
of such       circumstances,       be  likely   to   remain   the positive       metal.

rigidity     increased,    compared      with that of the other element,              an
interchange of electro-chemical position might be expected                   to occur.
This     cause appears sufficient at these high          temperatures     to  produce
complete interchanges and reversals between metals of such                   apparent
general     stability   as    platinum    and copper or platinum           and    iron
during the continuance of abnormal and unequal thermal                    conditions.
The great difference of temperature which obtained in different
 parts of the same fusing salt would also cause it to act on the metals
 after the manner of two dissimilar              solutions.    Thermo-electric     and
 inversion effects at these very high temperatures are probably                    also
 in vol veil in the explanation.
       6.  The Hygrometry of Ben Nevis.                   By H. N. Dickson.
     The observations tabulated in the present                paper were taken      at
  Ben Nevis Observatory, chiefly during August                   1885.     In  a note
  communicated to the Society at the end of last session, a description
  was given of some observations of air-temperatures and humidities
  at  Granton Marine          Station, and it was stated that the work was to
  be continued at Ben Nevis.             At  present   we confine ourselves to the
  hygrometrical work        :  it is hoped that the results of      the temperature
  observations     will be communicated to the Society early next session.
     The extreme        dryness of the atmosphere           which prevails at Ben
  Nevis     during    anticyclones,      makes     the  Observatory an unusually
  favourable station for such investigations, and it is believed that the
   appended     tables afford exceptionally good material for rediscussing
   the whole question of the hygrometry of the atmosphere.
      The observations here given were for the most part taken during
   an   anticyclone     which     lasted   from     18th to 28th August.          They
   include all the regular hourly observations taken during that time,
   except when the air was saturated,            besides   a large number      of extra
   observations, given at the end of the table of hourlies.                   Through

the kindness of Mr Omond and his assistant Mr Rankin,             I was  able
to make the observations continuous, and          also to add a considerable
number of observations at low temperature, taken during the past
winter.
     The readings of wet and dry bulb thermometers given were
 taken with the instruments in daily use at the Observatory.           These
thermometers       are   by  Messrs   Adie     and   Wedderburn,    and    are
sufficiently delicate for all the purposes of the investigation.          The
 diameter of the spherical bulbs was 0'40 inches.          The wet bulb was
 covered with thin muslin, as served out by the Scottish Meteorological
 Society,    and every care was taken to ensure           its being properly
 moistened.      The thermometer screen was an ordinary double-louvred
 Stevenson, open below, and of the usual size.           The observed read
 ings have been corrected in accordance           with the Kew certificates
 attached to the instruments, and checked by comparison with the
 readings of one of Aitken's screens.
     The direct hygrometer     used was Professor Chrystal's, described in
 the note referred to (Proc. R. S. E., vol. xiii. p. 199). After a little
  practice this instrument can be made to give very satisfactory
  result*, deposits having     been   obtained on the silvered surface at
  temperatures as low as l°-5 F., by using mixtures of salt and snow.
     The dew-point was in each case taken to be the temperature at
  which   a uniform    coating of moisture was deposited on the silvered
 surface, when its temperature was being reduced.              The box con
 taining the thermometer was first cooled quickly to within a few
 degrees    of the point where deposition was expected         to take place,
  then its temperature was allowed to fall slowly        till moisture  began
 to appear and disappear in irregular patches, when the cooling was
 still further checked.       Almost immediately after, and at a quite
 definite point, a uniform       deposition made its appearance,      varying
 slightly at its outer edges   ;  the reading was then taken.       Headings
  taken from the clearing off of the deposit were of course unsatis
 factory, as the moisture deposited may take some time to evaporate,
 during which the thermometer may          rise considerably.
     The deposit appearing and disappearing in patches may have been
  due to the unequal temperature of the mixture in the box of the
  hygrometer, but as this took place even when the temperature was
  allowed to fall with great slowness,       I  am disposed to think it was

952                  Proceedings       of  the   Royal Society
 caused by incessant small fluctuations             of the actual   dew-point.        If
 the temperature of the hygrometer is kept constant                 for a   time near
 the   dew-point,    evaporation       and condensation        take place      on the
 surface  in quick     succession,     and the dew-point may vary            within    a
 considerable range in a very short time.                This obviously increases
 the difficulty of making accurate comparative observations.
    The hygrometer, with         it  reservoirs,   tubes,  &c,  was  mounted on a
 stand about six feet away from the thermometer screen,                      and the
 thermometers       were    read   immediately       after checking     the   rate of
 cooling of the hygrometer,         as described.
    Considerable difficulty was at first experienced in finding                a suit
able method of comparing the observations of dew-points                       by the
 direct hygrometer with tho readings of wet and dry bulbs.                      After
 several   trials,  the following        graphic     method     was   found    to be
 satisfactory.
    Taking rectangular coordinates,           temperatures   were measured      along
 the x axis, and vapour pressures           in inches of mercury (taken from
                              given in
                                          "
 Regnault's Tables,       as                 Glaisher's Hygrometrical Tables,*'
 Gth edition, 1876) along        they   axis.     Each observation with wet and
 dry, and the corresponding hygrometer observation, was then treated
separately.      First   a   point was taken whose abscissa corresponded
 to  the temperature         of the wet bulb and ordinate to the vapour
 pressure at that temperature.           Another      point was then taken with
abscissa     corresponding      to the temperature         of the dry bulb and
 ordinate to the vapour pressure at the temperature              of the dew-point,
 as  given by the direct hygrometer.               These two points were then
joined by     a straight line.
    Plotting all the observations        we get a diagram formed         of straight
 lines, and by taking the general           trend of these lines we are able to
 see the  relations existing between            the wet and dry bulb readings
 and the dew-point obtained from direct observation.
    First  we note that on the whole the lines near                 each other are
 almost parallel, from which it at once appears that with a given
 reading of the wet bulb the excess of the air temperature above that
 of the wet bulb is not proportional to the excess of the temperature
 of the wet bulb over that of the dew-point, but to the vapour
 pressure   corresponding to those temperatures.             That is   to say, given
the temperatures       of the dry and wet bulbs, their difference             is pro

                             of Edinburgh, Session 1885-86.                                       953
portional         not to the difference between the temperatures                         of the   -wet
"bulb and the dew-point, but to the difference between the vapour
pressures corresponding to these temperatures.
      The fact that          as a whole the lines near each other                  in the diagram
are nearly parallel, whatever their length, justifies their being drawn
straight lines, and in addition there are at least six cases of observa
tions with the          same temperature of wet bulb where the lines exactly
coincide, although their length,                i.e., the differences           between wet and
dry,       are very different.
      It    is of course      to bo observed that a very large number of the
lines in the diagram                are      quite       irregular        in direction.     This    is
obviously due to errors of observation, which are necessarily large
both in the working of the wet and dry, and in the direct hygro
meter.           On the whole, however, the irregularities                         are    fairly well
¦distributed        on both sides of the mean direction of the lines, except
in    cases where the air was nearly saturated.                            Under     these circum
stances the action of the wet bulb is extremely sluggish, and the
actual dew-point is below that to be expected from the wet and dry.
This is further shown by observations taken when,                                  as occasionally
happens, the wet bulb reads above the dry, as in dry fog.                                   The dry
bulb thermometer then               acts as the more perfect wet bulb, the hygro
meter showing that the dew-point                         temperature is really below that
of     the air.       This is of      course      apart from cases where a sudden
change of temperature has just taken place,                          as    the wet bulb covering
 prevents its adapting              itself     to changes        as rapidly          as the other.
 Sometimes the wet bulb thermometer continues to read above the
 dry for a considerable time, but                    I   have   invariably         found    that in
 these cases the so-called dry bulb                      was being kept wet, either by
 water dripping from the screen, or by                    driving fog depositing moisture
¦on    it,   the air being all the time slightly dry.
      Comparing observations extending over                      a        large range of temper
 ature of wet bulb,             we find that the lines in the diagram are not
 really parallel, but that they tend to become slightly steeper as the
 temperature        of the wet bulb       is   lower.       From this        it   appears   that the
 factor by       which   we must     multiply the difference of the temperatures
 of the wet and              dry to obtain the difference between the vapour
 pressures at the temperatures               of the wet bulb and of the dew-point,
 is   not    a   constant,     but tends      to increase       as the temperature falls.

054                   Proceedings       of  the   Royal Society
Again, at     a wet   bulb temperature        of 32° F., we find a sudden change
in direction, the lines          becoming        much steeper.        This   change         is
apparently discontinuous, but as the wet bulb temperature continues
to  fall the slow     increase   in   steepness continues as before.
    These results lead to the linear equation
                                /' -/" = (<- A', A',
where     f   is pressure     of vapour at temperature            of wet   bulb,       f"    is
pressure     of vapour at temperature of dew-point, t temperature of
air, t' temperature       of wet bulb, and         K the   factor before   referred       to,
vvhosi values are to be determined.
    It is certainly premature to attempt to give any definite                 values of
A',  but by drawing lines in the diagram at those temperatures                       of wet
bulb at which any considerable number of observations appear,                             as
nearly as possible in the mean direction                    indicated by the obser
vations,    the     following      roughly       approximate      values   have        been

 Until   more continuous observations are made these values must not
be taken as more         than   a    first approximation.         Below 32° they        are
probably too small.
    The next step was to compare the dew-points given by the hygro
 meter   with    those calculated from the wet and dry bulb thermometer
 readings    by the two methods in most common                       use.    Glaisher's

   difference   of temperature between the wet and dry bulbs is mul
   tiplied by the factor corresponding to the temperature              of   the   dry
   bulb, and the result subtracted from the dry bulb temperature gives
   the temperature of the dew-point.          This obviously gives us         in   the
  diagram a line involving the curve           connecting temperature with
   vapour pressure.       Taking the wet bulb temperature      as  constant, and
   gradually raising that of the dry bulb, we have at first         a  part of the
   curve   closely approximating to a straight line, and the           higher     the
   temperature    taken for the wet bulb the closer is this approximation,
  and the longer is the part of the curve.           As  we continue       to raise
  the temperature of the dry bulb the curve becomes less steep,                  and
  eventually we have a point of inflection, after which,        as the   dry bulb
  rises, the dew-point given also rises,     until another point of inflection
  is reached.
      The only part of the curve which has to be looked at, however,
  is that first mentioned.       We find this to be nearly straight, starting
  in a direction steeper than the hygrometer lines, gradually lessening
  in steepness    till it  crosses them, and then going on above them.
  Hence it appears      that the dew-points given by these tables are at
 first lower than those found by the hygrometer, the difference               first
 increasing to    a  maximum, and then diminishing         to zero.     After the
 point of coincidence the calculated dew-points are above those got
 directly, and the differences       go on increasing rapidly.          The   first
 differences referred to, where the calculated dew-points are the lower,
 are smaller the higher the temperatures        concerned,    and the points at
 which the lines cross are further from the commencement                   of  the
curve.      Hence Glaisher's tables are practically nearly accurate until
 the point of the crossing of the lines is reached,          and this is rarely
done at the temperatures and with the humidities                 ordinarily    ex
 perienced at low levels in this country, although it is often passed
at Ben     Nevis Observatory.
     It  is to be remarked that the results deduced from Glaisher's
tables, used     within the limits above mentioned, do not on the          whole
agree so well     with direct observations at high levels         as  with  those
low down.        In observations at Granton^Marine Station it was          found
that in most cases the dew-point derived from both sources agreed

almost perfectly        ;  while   at Ben    Nevis the hygrometer tended to give
higher   results.      As    a rule the differences   do not exceed the limits      of
errors of observation, and             are only shown by the general        direction
of   the lines in the diagram.
    The expression given by Dr Apjohn is of the form
where    f
the dew-point,
              is the vapour pressure corresponding to the temperature
                       /'   that to the temperature of the wet bulb,             8

                                                                                     is
difference of temperature between wet and dry,                   P  the atmospheric
pressure at the time of observation, 30 being mean sea-level pressure,
and m     a  coefficient depending on the specific heat of air and the
latent    heat     of aqueous vapour.            Dr Apjohn communicated the
 details of the investigation which led him to the above formula to
the Royal Irish Academy, and the paper was published in the
 Transactions in 1834.             He afterwards verified his results by experi
 mental investigations {Trans. R. I. A. ; Phil. Mag., 1835, vii. p.
 266   ; Brit.    Assoc. Rep     , 1843,   p. 36).   In  the course     of these, by
 heating air, of which the point of saturation was known, he obtained
 very great differences         of wet and dry, and found his formula to give
 accurate results.
    Without discussing objections              to  Apjohn's methods (for which
 see his     original      paper,    also  Clerk-Maxwell in Ency. Brit., art.
 " Diffusion,"      9th edition), we may simply take the form given with
 the value      ¥XT  for m.       Putting into the diagram lines formed by
 taking     fixed values of        /',  and increasing  8,  the value of     P  being
 as 25"300 throughout, being the mean                barometric pressure      for the
 time over which the observations extend, we get a system of parallel
 straight     lines.      Comparing these, as before,         with the hygrometer
 lines, we find that at high             temperature of wet bulb the dew-points
 ascertained       by Apjohn's formula are on the whole too low, i.e., the
 lines representing them are slightly steeper than the hygrometer lines.
 As the wet bulb temperature is lowered the                differences   between the
 two results diminish, and with wet bulb readings between 35° F. and
  40°  F. Apjohn's formula            agrees  with the hygrometer within limits
  of observational error, even with differences           of wet and dry amount
  ing to over 10° F.          When      we come    to temperatures below 32°        F.,

the results deduced from            Apjohn's formula             are too high,          there        being
no change in the direction of the lines.                       In most works on                Meteor
ology we find that for temperatures                      below 32° F. the value                      ^     is
given for m, but         I have                       origin of this,

and it is not stated whether the change is to be made with reference
to the temperature of the dry bulb or of the wet bulb.    Using this
value we get dew-point differing still further from my own observa
tions, and also from Glaisher's tables.
    The empirical formula deduced from the diagram is                               simply            that

          By John B. Haycraft, M.B., B.Sc, &c, Professor of
          Physiology in the Mason Science College and the Queen's
          College Medical School, Birmingham.
     Much knowledge            has already been gained regarding the nature of
 light and      sound,    and much is known as to the functions of both the
 eye and the ear.           Little, however,       has been   learnt concerning the
 production        of smell and taste, which is not the intellectual property
 of every       educated     man.      The views of Hobbes and Hartley have
 been during late years rendered more acceptable                  by the remarkable
  discovery that the end-organs              of special  senses are all  built up  on
  the   same      plan.    Developed       as   they are on the same lines from
  simpler, practically         identical, ectodermic     cells, we are forced    with
  Herbert Spencer          to    look   for similarities   in the    agencies  which
  develop them.          In  the case of sight and hearing, it is already known
  that the quality of the sensation            produced depends upon the nature
  — rapidity,       complexity — of the vibrating         stimulus.    The particles
  of a  liquid,    as well    as   particles dissolved in water, are in constant
  and characteristic vibration.            It  has been my endeavour to discover
  whether in the case of taste also it will not be possible to connect
  the quality of the sensation with the nature or character                   of the
  vibration of the sapid particle.
     In the first       place,    it may    be well   to determine whether or no
  there    is any relationship         between     taste sensation   and the    gross
  molecular weight of a sapid particle.
     If  we take the molecular weights of acid substances,             we shall find
     VOL.    XIII.                                                        3 B

962                 Proceedings     of the  Royal Society
in the    case of hydrochloric      acid a weight of 36 '5, in the          case of
 sulphuric    acid 98.     Lithium chloride, molecular weight 4 2 "5, and
 potassium sulphate, molecular weight 14*4, are saline.              Many      other
 examples     might he adduced from hitter and sweet compounds to
 demonstrate     that we cannot tell by the molecular weight alone any
 thing about the taste of a substance.          In  the above example      an acid
 may have     a lower or a higher molecular weight than a salt.
    We shall    see  hereafter that molecular weight is not          without its
 importance, and even at this stage of our inquiry           it  may be    well to
 allude to a series of facts in this relationship.          Bodies which have
 the greatest     molecular weight of any, such as albumens, albumen-
 oids, starches,   gums,   &c,  are totally without     taste ; nor need      it  be
 urged that a ready explanation of this is at hand.            No doubt many
 of these substances are not readily miscible in water, and in conse
 quence    they   will not readily    permeate     the viscous layer of      saliva
 covering the tongue and the surface             of the gustatory end-organs.
 Some albumens, such as serum          and egg-albumen,      are  fairly soluble,
and they may all be converted by appropriate ferments into allied
products called peptones,       which are soluble and readily diffusible,
and nevertheless        devoid of taste.     In like manner      starch   may be
converted into dextrine, a substance readily diffusible in water, and
tasteless.
    We find    also among the    list of  tasteless  bodies all those of very
small molecular weight.        Water, molecular weight 18, is an example.
The     simple gases dissolved in water are tasteless,           but when we
 examine    a substance with a molecular weight over 30, we find that
when dissolved in water it is capable            of producing some taste         or
other.     Sulphuretted hydrogen, molecular weight 34, is very slightly
acid to the taste     ;  hydrochloric  acid, molecular weight 36'5, is very
acid  ;  and nitrogen monoxide, molecular weight 46, is sweet                    It
is true that the monatomic alcohols, such as ordinary                commercial
alcohol, have molecular weights over 34, and are tasteless, so that
the same rule does not apply to all the carbon compounds              ; but   even
here we are struck       with the fact that     these alcohols are the lowest
of a series, all the polyatomic and more complex alcohols being
sapid and sweet in character.
    There seems then to be some analogy between taste on the one
hand and sight and hearing on the other.             The substances     of lowest

                       of Edinburgh,      Session 1885-86.                      963
molecular     weight, and therefore of most rapid vibration            — like the
ultra-violet rays of the spectrum — are incapable of producing sensa
tion. In like manner there are substances of very great molecular
¦weight,  and of the most sluggish molecular vibration, like the vibra
tions of the ultra-red,     also incapable    of effecting the   sensorium.
    Let us turn again to our study of sapid substances,                 restricting
ourselves in the first case to the investigation              of inorganic     com
pounds.      A   large number, perhaps the greater         number of inorganic
compounds, are insoluble in water, and are therefore              tasteless, so we
are confined to those which are soluble, which are chiefly the salts
of certain    metals.
    Many    elements    are so closely related that they may be classed to
gether.     New and curious relationships have recently            been discover
ed by Newlands, Lothar Meyer, Mendelejeff, and Carnelley.                    In the
groups of elements shortly to be mentioned we find the presence of
common physical and chemical properties.                It   has been shown      by
Dr Lauder Brunton that            elements   with similar physical properties
have similar actions on protoplasm generally.              It will  be my endea
vour to show that they are capable in the same way of stimulating the
end-organs of the gustatory nerve, and producing similar sensations.
   The nature of the Periodic          Law  is now so   well known, thanks        to
the many recent publications           of Professor    Carnelley, that it would
be superfluous to attempt more than roughly to sketch its main
features.     If  we arrange    the elements     in the order of their atomic
weights, beginning with that which has the lowest, and passing to
that which has the highest, we shall find that there is a periodical
recurrence of function        or property in the series.       The first element
is a monad, the second        a dyad, the     third  a  triad, and the fourth a
tetrad.    Then we find the fifth a triad, the sixth a dyad, and the
seventh once more        a monad.      Then follows a second series of seven
elements,    showing the same variation in atomicity, and this repeats
itself right through the list of elements.            This periodic recurrence
is seen  not only with the atomicity, but with the atomic volume,
the fueibility,     the electrical and other properties of the elements.
There is then a general resemblance           in physical properties between
the first, eighth, fifteenth, &o.    ;  between the second, ninth, sixteenth,
&c, and     so on.     Mendelejeff has arranged the elements             in a  very
convenient tabular form, which brings out these and some other
important facts.

     Those elements,           which resemble        one another aDd which we can
pick    out, taking every eighth one from that one we start with, from
-what       he calls a group (see table).         In vertical        series are arranged               the
f/roups of similar elements, and                the series,     each of seven elements,
are seen on the horizontal lines.               There is one other point of import
ance    ;    it is that the       elements of a group which are                in    an even series
are especially related            one to another     in   these properties.                 So,   in like
manner, elements belonging to the same group of odd series are espe
cially      related.     Thus     Li, Na, K, Cu, Kb, Ag, Cs, Au                         have all of
them properties in common               ;   but in this group, Na, Cu, Ag,                        Au   are
most alike, and          Li, K, Eb, Cs          also,     in like    manner,          are specially
related.
   By far the greater number of sapid substances contain elements
found in Groups L, II., and VII., and these     accordingly studied. I
The salts of Group I. and II. most easily obtained are the chlorides
and sulphates,          and of Group        VII. I   selected the combinations these
elements        form with sodium and potassium.                       As it      was very neces
 sary to use salts as pure as possible, many were prepared                                        for me
 with       great    care by      Mr Harris the           chemist,       but     for the greater
 number       I have    to thank my colleague             Dr Nicol, who              placed at my
 disposal a large collection of very pure salts prepared by himself for
his own well-known investigations on solubilities.                             In    the subjoined
tables are the results of an investigation of Groups                           I.,   II.,    and    VII.
We have then to             see   whether the same taste sensations are produced
by   the chlorides,         &c, of   elements    having similar physical properties.

     It will     be seen that all the soluble chlorides are salt                             like table
 salt, although         with   the higher numbers we have the taste becoming
 more saline,           A   very slight bitter taste also develops.                         Some salts

9G6                   Proceedings      of  the   Royal Society
are astringent, as      will  be seen   in a study of this and of          other groups.
I do not    think this astringency          is generally looked upon             as a taste
at all, depending, as it does, upon the formation of insoluble                     albumi
nates.    It   is purely a local action on the mucous               membrane of the
tongue,   and will not be again discussed.
   The sulphates are saline, not salt at all, and in addition                     they    are
distinctly bitter.       I  have not been able to obtain             the    sulphates      of
caesium and rubidium.

    In Group II.       the chlorides are       all bitter   salines,    with in nearly
every   case a    warm pungent flavour.            They are very disagreeable            to
 taste, and   it  is long before the flavour leaves the mouth.                 Beryllium
 chloride with the sulphate is described             as sweet.      I have     not tasted
 the chloride ; the sulphate is distinctly             acid and astringent as well.
 Beryllium      salts  then come out as         a  well-marked exception to the
 other salts, giving,      as they do, such constant taste sensations.                 The
 atomic weight of beryllium was long an open question.                            I am  in
formed on competent            authority that there is now no doubt on this
 head, and     I   am at a loss therefore to explain             its action as a sapid
 substance.       The soluble sulphates are saline and bitter.

                           of Edinburgh, Session 1885-86.                                 967
      In   Group      VII.   we have       tastes produced which are in the main
salt.        In   the   case   of both the sodium and potassium                compounds
there      is a tendency to the production of the saline and bitter among
the      higher members of the group, and this is sooner seen in the case
of     potassium — itself       a  higher member        — than in  the case of sodium,
 a   lower member of Group L
      From      a  study of these groups we may learn many important facts.
 It    will   be seen that much depends               upon the electro-negative        group
 with which          the element        is combined.       Thus sodium      combined to
 form      a chloride has a different taste from the sulphate of the same
  element.
      With       the   same     electro-negative        group similar    elements        give
  similar tastes, but with            a   curious and very uniform change,             as we
  pass from an element of low to one of high atomic weight.                          As    we
  shall soon      see, a change      in physical property may, in like manner, be
  seen as we pass from a lower to a higher member of a group.
      So far then we have reduced               taste to a function    of elements and
  then compounds,           and we see that        it  obeys laws which are the same
  for so-called       physical properties of these elements; just                as  from    a
  knowledge of the components                   of  a compound     we can account          for
  its physical properties,           so we have to take       to pieces the sapid        sub
  stance      before    we get the clue         to relationship    between     its nature,
  as   indicated by its chemical and physical properties and the sensation
  it  produces.
      This is much already to learn, but can we go a                  step further, and
  ask " in what essentials are elements alike that                     produce      similar
  tastes."       We turn naturally          to the question with which we started,
  and ask, Do these elements vibrate in any way that is similar                      1
      Rapid      advances     are being made in the more exact and extended
  inquiry, How do the ultimate particles of matter move                      1    In  a  few
  years, no doubt, the investigations into the ultra-red and ultra-violet
  spectrum       will  shed a flood of light on this question,          and    will  enable
  us    to come       to  more     definite conclusions        than at present.         Still
  much      is known, and         it  may not be premature          even now to make
  use of this incomplete knowledge.
      No     one would       expect     to   find very closely allied spectra when
  comparing elements            even     of the same group, and for this reason.
  Suppose potassium and lithium to have each                  a fundamental tone and

968                   Proceedings      of the  Royal Society
a  series    of upper partials each in an exactly similar inharmonic
ascending scale, the tones of the heavier — potassium               — would all be
of lower pitch than the lighter — lithium.                An absorption line of
potassium in the visible spectrum will correspond                  in this case to
one of    lithium in     the ultra-violet.     Thus all attempts       to establish
exact mathematical relationships between the wave lengths of                 similar
metals are for the present out of the question.               We can but hope to
find rough points of similarity,            and these are forthcoming.           The
chloride of the alkaline earths are nearly related.              The   lithium and
sodium spectra have some points of similarity, especially in                    their
extreme      simplicity;    also potassium and rubidium,           each  with their
five groups of lines.        Then again the chlorides, bromides, and iodides
of calcium and barium are nearly related, the lines shifting towards
the red end       of the spectrum in      a way which is nearly        proportional
with   the increase      of atomic weight.
    Many      salts  absorb   light of different      wave   lengths, and are      in
consequence        of a definite colour.       The colour is an index to this
absorption and to the state of molecular vitiation of the salt mole
cules.     In   a paper on the colour of chemical compounds, recently
published in the Philosphical             Magazine,*     Professor Carnelley de
monstrated       a relationship between      salts of metals of the same       group
in  respect to colour.         The salts, say the chlorides, of a group            of
metals are much of the same colour, except that as you pass to                    the
higher members           of a  group this changes       somewhat, shifting uni
formly towards the end of the spectrum.                 This is illustrated by the
following diagrams taken from his paper, in which only these metals
 of a group are given in alternate series          : —
   Metal.            CI.              I.          Metal.        Cr04.         As04.

    The striking       analogy   between    the above tables and those of taste
 already alluded to needs scarcely to be pointed out; it is obvious.             Rut
 what does this shifting towards the red end of the spectrum indicate

                         of Edinburgh, Session 1885-83.                                 969
in    the case of these coloured salts            ?   Probably the colourless           ones
have vibrations of high pitch in the ultra-violet;                        with    a higher
atomic weight and slower vibration they gradually                       absorb    the rays
of the visible       spectrum.       The blue rays are first absorbed, and the
salt appears yellow          ;  then the green giving orange, and then the
yellow and orange              rays,   all  also    absorbed,     giving red.       In the
 case of tellerium chloride all             are absorbed,      and the salt is black.
 Carnelley      has therefore demonstrated that the salts              of   a  group have
 molecular vibrations, which are similar, which absorb                    light   and give
 rise to colour        sensations,     which are       similar, changing uniformly,
 however, with increasing atomic weight.                    If  a curve be constructed
 in   which the ordinates represent the atomic weights of the positive
 elements, and the        abscissae    a chromatic scale rising from blue, green,
 &c,    to black, we shall obtain a curve, indicating that the colours of
 the compounds         are a periodic function          of the elements       arranged    in
 atomic series.        This is    best seen    in the    case of the normal iodides.
  Upon the pitch of the vibration                depends      the colour sensation,       as
  every one would admit j we find in the                 case   of taste a result which
  in every way is the same.
     This has been an induction from the study of the inorganic com
  pounds, but a whole field of inquiry has been untouched.                           As yet
  no allusion has been made to the carbon compounds, many of which
  are sapid.
     One of the most important and interesting facts in connection
  with the chemistry of the carbon compounds is that they have what
  may be termed        a structure.       Thus the formula for common alcohol
  is CjHgO, but       one of the hydrogen atoms             is found to be especially
  related to the oxygen,         and    it is written      C2H5   . OH.      In this   case,
  then, there      is one group (compound radical),                 C2H6,     united with
  another group, OH.             Now     those   groups    play the same part that
  elements    do in inorganic compounds, and it is necessary                      to know
  this   so-called structural formula,         in order   to understand the property
  of an organic substance.            Just    as we can replace       the hydrogen in
  water with potassium and form another substance                      of different pro
  perties depending upon the nature of the substance                     you add,     so, in
  like manner,      we can replace        the C2H5, or the OH, by other com
  pound radicles or even elements,               and produce        a  substance     whose
   properties will    depend upon the nature of the radical added.

970                 Proceedings      of the  Royal Society
   There are then two points for investigation.                     In      the first       case,
can we find    in sapid    substances    having, say a sweet or                a   sour taste,
compound radicals always present,            and from            whose presence               we
may    say  that the taste-sensations       result?        Just, in          fact,       as  the
chemist associates    certain properties with the presence of a certain
radical in a substance,      can we find     similar associations                 with taste
sensation  1
   In  the second place,     do we find that a compound radical, in the
various combinations which it may form, preserves the character of
its vibration, as shown by the spectroscope,           unaltered in any marked
degree  1
   The answer to the first question can be readily given, for it will
be sufficient to obtain a     list of substances    giving a definite                taste, and
to search for some common          or similar radical.          If a   radical common
to all be found, we may safely answer          it in the      affirmative.

"be seen to have         in all  cases a common         group of elements.          This

cases with a different molecule.              We have then the same right to
impute to this radical the capacity of producing a given taste sensa

 physical properties of the compounds in which it may be found.

 rational formulae         of the last three, and other nearly related sub
 stances, such as levulose, maltose,           etc., are   not at present      definitely

 contain a radical CH2 . OH found in the first three substances.

     We   see here again          that, with          a   definite molecular structure, with
the presence of certain groups of elements, a definite taste sensation
is produced.      A chemist examining the rational formula of a                                        sub
stance    will predict its properties to an extent which will vary                                     with
the extent of his knowledge.                      We        too can predict a property,                that
of producing        a   particular sensation,               when applied to the tongue.
     There is     a large       number of organic compounds having a bitter
taste.     Such is quinine, quassia,                      strychnia,      &c, but inasmuch                as
so little is known as to the chemical nature                            of   these substances their
investigation would be of little use.
     We    have     seen     that in the inorganic                   compounds the physical,
chemical, and taste properties vary with the nature of the elements
in the sapid substance              ;   with similar          elements       similar properties         are
associated.        So, too, we have seen among                           the     carbon       compounds
that the physical, chemical, and taste properties vary with the com
pound radicals present in the sapid substance.                                   The question now
to be determined            is,   whether or no the compound radicals behave
as    elements,     vibrating           in   a   characteristic         and      definite      way, not
materially        disturbed        by altering the              combination.          This may           be
determined by the eye, with or without the aid of the spectroscope.
We know that chromic acid has an orange-red                                      colour   ;   combine    it
with metallic elements to form chromates, and we find that these                                        are
coloured,     the colour varying very slightly                      with the       metal.
     Picric acid    is  a   coloured solid, and               it   probably owes its colour,             at
any rate in part, to the presence of radical (N02).  Its salts,

are coloured, the absorption shifting towards the red end of                                           the
spectrum.         In his interesting             researches        into the spectra of colour
less fluids, observed             through    a    considerable length of tube,                 Dr W.    J.
Russell finds that ammonia gives certain well marked absorption

here we may recall the colour experiments of Professor Carnelley)
as    if    we     took an instrument,                    say a violin,      and kept loading its
strings.          The notes would be heard deeper and deeper in tone, but
it would           be   still    recognised          as   having the tone or quality of the
violin.
     I    have mentioned the above instance,                         though many others might
have been adduced,                to demonstrate               the same fact.            We   have every
reason       then to believe that the radical

of the acid and sweet substances are both in constant and characteristic
vibration,           although this vibration                  does not affect           the rays of the
visible spectrum.                 Not only           so, but we know               that this vibration
will not be altered in character (from the analogy with the ammonia
radical in methylamine) being merely shifted to a small extent in
pitch, when its combinations are changed.
     This    is,     however,      the analogy which                we have         sought        Both in
the case of sight, hearing, taste, and, as                         I     hope afterwards to prove,
in the      case     of smell, we have these analogous                       phenomena.           On the
side of sensation              we have variations in what we may call quality, on
the objective side               we have        matter         in vibration, — these vibrations
vary in character, and               it    is   possible to connect                the quality     of the
sensation         with the character            of the vibration.
     It    may be urged that, inasmuch as an acid like hydrochloric acid
produces         much the same taste                 as   oxalic acid, there       is   no such definite

974                       Proceedings               of      the    Royal Society
connection between vibration                               and sensation.            There are, too, some
sweet substances              having no relationship                     to an alcohol.                  We    know,
however, that one can get the same colour sensations from a solution
of either a picrate or a chromate, two substances                                              absolutely dis
similar in chemical properties                         ;    the reason        is,   that they both give                   a
group of vibrations in the                         same           part of the solar spectrum.                          It
would then be reasonable                      to expect that instances would be forth
coming of substances                    of dissimilar nature and chemical composition
with similar           tastes.      It    would seem probable, then, that there is                                         a
scale of vibrations which                     may stimulate the taste                     organs         analogous
to the visible spectrum.                      If   a   substance        vibrates in        a   definite       part of
this scale,        a   definite taste         will         be produced.
     One must always remember that the tongue has, like the eye and
unlike the ear, no power of analysis.                                    It     may be that just                    as a
colour,       say orange, may be produced                          by either        a   simple vibration, or
a    combination of vibrations, some higher and some lower in pitch
than that of the simple one, so the same taste may, in like manner,
be produced by             a     simple vibration or                a   compound one made up of
simple vibrations of higher and lower pitch.
     In conclusion,            it   will      be       necessary        to state very emphatically
that   it     is   analogy that this paper proves,                       — analogy in the produc
tion of the senses.                 It       would be premature definitely to say how
the vibrations            of common salt produce irritation                               of the gustatory
nerve.         Is   it   by setting up             a       sympathetic vibration,              as    in the         ear,
where       the sonorous            waves           set      in motion the               end-organs           of the
labyrinth?             Upon such         a    question       I      have no wish to hazard what
could only be an opinion.                     In the         eye vibrations stimulate the cones.
How      is   this done    ?       It   is   quite conceivable that this                   is   by setting up
sympathetic vibrations, but many suppose                                 it    to be a chemical action.
If    we ask what             is   a    chemical action, no adequate                            reply        will    be
forthcoming, though many would hesitatingly affirm that even so-
called    chemical actions may have                           a   vibratory and mechanical inter
pretation.          When         we say that we understand the manner                                    in which
the    end-organs          of the         ear are stimulated, we mean                           that we can
prove an analogy between                           the      sympathetic vibration                   of   a   tuning
fork, and of the organ of Corte, when effected by the same wave
motion.         This     is   nothing, however, but an analogy.                                  The produc
tion, on the other hand, of end-organ irritation by light or molecular

     All   that        I   claim to have proved                is,   that the body             is   surrounded
by vibrating               matter,      stimulating      its sensitive surface.                     That in all
cases the process of stimulation with the production                                       of   a   consequent
sensation            is   the same to this extent, that the quality of the sensation
is    dependent upon the character (pitch and                                        complexity)          of   the
vibrating matter, just as                   a    certain class of salts of allied chemical
and physical properties vibrate in                          a        similar way, and stimulating
the eye, produce the same colour sensation                                ;   just   as certain strings of
definite length and consistency vibrate in                                a   similar way and produce
the same sound               ;   so,    in like manner, the similar sapid compounds
(containing similar elements or the same compound radicals) vibrate
in similar way and produce the same taste.

  Concluding Address by Eobert Gray, Esq., Vice-President.
     In reviewing for               a   moment the business of the Session now about
to be closed,         I      think        we may     fairly congratulate ourselves on the
satisfactory results               ;    indeed, I   may venture to say that at no period
of its history              has the Society shown so much vitality,                                  or such    a
capacity             for solid scientific work.                Since the opening meeting in
December last, ninety-one communications have been submitted at
the ordinary meetings,                     the number being nineteen higher than last
Session, and greatly in excess of the average                                         of previous years.

     Thirty-six            Fellows        have     joined      the Society               during       the past
Session, and four deaths                     have       taken place.             The total number of
Fellows          on the      roll   at present     is   462.         With      regard to the deceased
Fellows they will                receive due mention by competent writers                                 in our
Obituary Notices               ;    but I   may meanwhile be permitted to say that in
Bishop           Cotterill, whose           deeply affecting message to his clergy and
his      people, when ho learned the nature of his last illness,                                      will not
soon be              forgotten, the         Diocese of Edinburgh has lost an able
administrator,             a   learned      theologian, and an earnest teacher                        ;   in Dr

 976                 Proceedings       of   the Royal Society
 Angus     Macdonald,      one     of the most distinguished           of the     many
 celebrated     physicians     of this city, a gentleman whose               skill  and
 conscientiousness marked him as one of the most able and                      devoted
 of the profession to which he belonged              ;  while in    Dr Williamson,
 Leith   has lost one of its most eminent men,                who discharged with
universal      acceptance     the important        duties     connected    with      the
various medical offices which he held.
    It  would not be easy for me, nor would                it  be desirable,  to enter
into a critical      estimate      of the     value    of the papers      that     have
been submitted        to us during       the Session that is past,         and     their
bearings upon the progress             of science   in this country ; yet it may
not be out of place to say that they will contrast favourably with
those issued by kindred societies in other parts of the world, and
quite justify the impression that under the present                  administration
of the Society's affairs         still greater   results in the future        will    be
obtained.
    Those who have taken part in our proceedings                 cannot fail to have
observed      that some of our physicists have dealt, and successf ally
dealt,    with problems of surpassing difficulty,               requiring   for their
solution the utmost resources              of mathematical analysis, and the
results thus obtained with so much thought and labour constitute
real advances     in the progress      of  science, which     will at once facilitate
the work and guide the steps of future inquirers.                  Others, again, of
our physicists have preferred to investigate the causes of some                      of
the    grandest phenomena           of nature by the aid of experiments of
extreme    simplicity, but not on that account less fruitful in results,
and have       shown    to  us that costly and           elaborate   apparatus and
laboratories filled with mechanical resources                are not indispensable
for lifting the veil from the secrets of nature, when the investigator
is  guided by the zeal which              animates     and the disinterestedness
which pursues truth        as  its own highest reward.
    With   regard to the biological papers of this and past               Sessions —
many of which are of considerable value and interest, coming from
what     I may venture to call a distinguished school of biology which
has grown up among us —           I may   remind the Society of the services of
Dr John Murray,          Director of the " Challenger " Expedition Com
mission,     through     whom,      directly    and indirectly,      much valuable
material has been contributed to our publications.                  From my own

                         of Edinburgh, Session 1885-86.                                   977
 point of view this        has been very gratifying,         because     it has happened
 ¦within my recollection as a            Fellow of the Society that, owing to the
 entire absence of such papers one of the Society's important                           prizes
 (the Neill Prize) could not               be awarded ; while         now the Council
 sometimes experience a difficulty               in selecting one, or         a series,    out
 of many     papers    of  great excellence      for this distinction.
     It is particularly     gratifying       to remark on an occasion            like this,
the excellent work now being                done by the younger Fellows               of the
 Society,    who are rising          into notice, and        I  cannot but think             it
 fortunate      for   science    in Scotland, not only that               we have        such
 workers     amongst      us,   but that our Society           has    the    command        of
 funds that      have enabled      it  to publish     Proceedings and Transaction*
 with   a liberality,    and wealth of illustration,         which has probably not
 been exceeded         by any scientific Society throughout                 these    realms.
 But, gentlemen,         we    have     in our midst original thinkers engaged
 in   active research,       which can only be carried on at considerable
 personal     cost,   but which it is quite beyond the                 province of this
 Society    to meet,      or even to mitigate ; and in mentioning this,                       I
 cannot but regret that a Society holding the position of the Royal
 Society of Edinburgh, should not be entrusted with a share of the
 Government annual grant for the prosecution of scientific research
 in this country. The distribution of even a small share by this
Society among local applicants, or those residing in other parts of
Scotland, whose claims could be better considered hero than by
 the judges of      a  distant tribunal, would,          I feel assured,      lead    to the
best    results.     Hitherto the difficulty            may have       been a want of
information       on the part of          the London       Committee in charge              of
the fund,       as to the applicants          from Scotland, and the nature of
their work, and hence, no doubt, their refusal in many cases to give
grants in aid of investigations which would have been of real service.
But there would be little or no difficulty were a committee of this
Society     empowered        to deal      with   such applications        ;   and   I   trust
that    a strong effort      will   be made       in   the proper quarter to bring
about an arrangement so desirable,               as  I am   satisfied   it would confer
a positive benefit upon science at large.
    As   an office-bearer     and member          of Council, now of some years'
standing,    1   have taken but a very small personal share in the work
of   the Society,      and on that account            I  am,   perhaps, all the more

078              Proceedings    of  the  Royal Society
privileged to refer to the services       of others.    There    never was   a
time probably     in the   history of the Society when there          -was  so
much activity in the executive Council, the members             of which   are
carrying on the Society's affairs with     a zeal and discrimination   which
it is not the lot of all     societies   to experience.     But beyond      all
question, the recent and present prosperity of the Royal Society            of
Edinburgh is mainly     due to the distinguished services of our much-
esteemed    General Secretary, Professor       Tait.    Besides   giving   the
Society the fruits of his own brilliant research       in the many papers
contributed by himself during every Session, he has by his great
tact   and  administrative    ability,  gathered   around him a band         of
fellow   labourers, well chosen and effective;        and so long as such
services are given, so long the Society's influence      will continue to   be
felt both at home and abroad.
