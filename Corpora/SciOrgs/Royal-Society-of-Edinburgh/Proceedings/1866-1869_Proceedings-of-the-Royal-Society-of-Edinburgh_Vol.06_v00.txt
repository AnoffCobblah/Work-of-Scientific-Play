                   Proceedings of the Royal Society
                      Monday, 3d December, 1866.
Sir David Brewster, the President, delivered the following
                           Opening Address : —
    Gentlemen, — Of all the agencies which are at work in the mate
rial universe, the light of the sun is doubtless the most remarkable,
whether we study it in its sanitary,           its scientific, or its aesthetical
relations      In the language of metaphor,          it is the very life-blood of
nature, without which everything material              would fade and perish     ;
the fountain of all our knowledge of the external universe              ; and the
historiographer of the visible creation, recording and transmitting
to future ages all that is beautiful and sublime in organic and in
organic nature,      and stamping on perennial tablets             the hallowed
scenes of domestic life, the ever-varying phases of social intercourse
and the more exciting         scenes of bloodshed        and war, which Chris
tians still struggle to reconcile       with the obligations of their faith.
   The influence of light      on   physical life is    a subject   of which   we
know little    ; but the science of light, which has been studied for
nearly two centuries by the brightest intellects in the civilised
world, consists of a body of facts and laws of the most extraordinary
kind — rich in knowledge,         popular and profound, and affording to
educated students simple and lucid explanations of that boundless
and   brilliant array of phenomena which light creates, and mani
fests, and developes. While it has given to astronomy and naviga
tion their telescopes and instruments of discovery, and to the bota
nist, the naturalist, and the physiologist, their microscopes, simple,
compound,      and polarising, — it has shown to the student of nature
how the juices of plants and animals, and the integuments and fila
ments of organic life, elicit from         the pure sunbeam its prismatic
elements— clothing       fruit and     flower    with their gorgeous attire,
bathing every aspect of nature            in the rich hues of spring and
autumn, giving to the sky its azure, and to the clouds their gold.
   In treating of   the influence    of light   as a  sanitary agent, we enter
upon a subject     almost   entirely new     ;  but admitting the existence
of the    influence   itself,  as  partially established       by analogy    and

                     of Edinburgh, Session 1866-67.                          3
  observation,   and asserting the vast importance of the subject in its
 social aspects, we venture       to say that science     furnishes us with
 principles and methods by which the light of day may be thrown
 into apartments which a sunbeam has never reached, and where the
 poisons and the malaria of darkness have been undermining sound
 constitutions, and carrying thousands prematurely to the grave.
    The influence of light upon vegetable life has been long and suc
cessfully studied by the chemist and the botanist.           The researches
of Priestley, Iugenhousz, Sennebier, and Decandolle, and the more
 recent    ones   of Carradori,    Payen,      Macaire,  Draper,    Gratiolet,
Gardner, Daubeny, and Hunt, have placed it beyond                a doubt  that
sunlight     exerts   the most marked      influence   upon  the respiration,
the absorption,      and   the exhalation of plants,     and, consequently,
on their general       and local  nutrition.    Draper and Gardner deter
mined the influence of the differently coloured rays in the germi
nation of plants and in the decomposition of carbonic acid, and they
found that the yellow rays were particularly active in producing the
green colour of the leaves. Mr Hunt has shown that the germination
of seeds is more rapid under the influence of the chemical rays than
in the dark or even under white light — a result confirmed by the
observations,     on a large scale, of the       Messrs  Lawson and Sons.
The curious fact of plants bending towards the light, as if to catch
its influence, must have been frequently observed. Mr Hunt found
that this influence, which is strikingly shown by the potato, is due
to the action      of the yellow rays, and, what is very remarkable,
 that in red light the plant bends from it.
    If light,  then, is so essential to the life of plants, we may reason
 ably suppose that it is necessary, though to a less extent, to the
 development     and growth of animals       ; and many observations     have
 been   recently made in confirmation of this important fact.              Dr
 Edwards     found that all the eggs of frogs exposed to light were
 developed in succession, but that none of those kept in the dark
 were  well developed.      Employing the tadpoles of the Rana obstetri-
 cans,  he found that the action of light developes the different parts
 of the body in that just proportion         which characterises    the adult
 — the type of the species.
    In papers communicated        to the Imperial Academy        of Sciences,
  M. Moleschoff of Heidelberg has shown           that the quantity of car

i                   Proceedings of the Royal Society
boaic acid exhaled by frogs (the Rana esculenta) is much greater in
light that in darkness ;* but the most important researches on the
subject were communicated to the same Society by M. Beclard in
1858. From a series of experiments, continued for four years in the
Laboratory of the Faculty of Medicine, he obtained the following
results   : —f
    1. That the nutrition and development of animals that breathe
by the skin experience         remarkable        modifications under the influ
ence of the differently-coloured rays of the spectrum.                  The eggs of
the fly (Musca carnaria), placed           in six bell glasses, violet,    blue, red,
yellow, transparent,     and green,      produced worms which, at the            end
of four or five days, were very differently developed.                  Those deve
loped in the violet glass were triple           in size and length to those in
the green glass, the influence of the other colours                diminishing     in
the above order.
    2. That the same weight of frogs produced more than twice the
quantity of carbonic acid, in respiration,              in the  green than    in the
red glass.     When the same frogs were skinned, the carbonic acid
 was greater in the red than in the green rays.                 No difference was
 observed with birds, and the small mammalia, such as mice, owing
 to their being covered with hair and feathers.
    3.  That the cutaneous exhalation of the vapour of water is one-
 half or one- third less in the dark than in ordinary daylight, or in
 violet light, in which the exhalation is the same.
    Few and imperfect       as these observations          are,  they entitle us to
 inquire into the influence of light upon the human frame, physical
 and mental, in health and disease, in developing the perfect form of
 the adult, and in preserving       it from premature decay. In the absence
 of researches which might have been made in our hospitals, prisons,
 and madhouses, we must grope our way among general speculations
 and insulated     facts, and we have no doubt that the direct influence
 of light over the phenomena of life will not be found limited to
 the lower races of the animal world.
    Man, in his most perfect type, is doubtless to be found in the
 temperate regions of the globe, where the solar influences of light,
 heat, and actinism, are      so    nicely balanced.         Under the scorching

The calorific rays are all-powerful there, aud lassitude of body and
immaturity of mind are their necessary results ; while in the dark
ness   of the polar regions, the distinctive characters of our species
almost disappear in the absence of those genial influences which
are so powerful in the organic        world.
    It is well known to all who seek for health in a southern climate,
that an ample share of light           is considered     necessary for its re
covery.      In  the hotels of France and         Italy, the apartments with
a south exposure       are   earnestly sought     for, and, under the advice
of his physican, the patient strives to fix himself in these bright
localities.     The salutary effect, however, thus ascribed to light is
supposed to arise from the greater warmth              of the solar rays ; but
 this can hardly    be the case   in mild climates, or indeed in any climate
 where    a fixed    artificial  temperature     can   be   easily  maintained.
 Something,      too, is due to the cheering          effect  of light upon   an
 invalid   ;  but this influence     is not excluded      from   apartments   so
 situated that from a western or even northern window we may enjoy
 the finest scenery illuminated by the full'blaze of a meridian sun.
     While our distinguished countryman,              Sir James Wylie, late
 physician to the Emperor of Russia, resided in St Petersburg, he
 studied the effects of light as a curative agent.           In the hospitals of
 that city there were apartments without light, and upon comparing
  the number of patients who left these apartments cured, he found
  that they were only one-fourth the number of those who went out
  cured from properly lighted rooms.               In this case the curative
  agency could      uot   reasonably    be   ascribed either    to the superior
  warmth     or ventilation     of the well-lighted rooms, because in all
  such hospitals     the introduction of fresh air is a special object of
  attention,    and the heating of wards without windows            is not diffi
  cult  to accomplish.
     But though the records of our great hospitals may not assist us
  in our present inquiry, yet facts sufficiently authentic may be
  gathered from various quarters.          In the years of cholera, when this
  frightful disease nearly decimated the population of some of the
  principal cities in the world, it was invariably found that the
  deaths were more numerous in narrow streets and northern ex
   posures, where the salutary beams of light           and actinism    had sel

6                Proceedings of the Royal Society
dom shed their beneficial influence.         The resistless epidemic found
an easy prey among a people whose physical organisation had not
been matured      under   those benign      influences   of solar    radiation
which shed health and happiness over our fertile plains, our open
valleys, and those mountain sides and elevated plateaus where man
breathes in the brighter regions of the atmosphere.
   Could   we investigate   the history of dungeon life of those noble
martyrs whom ecclesiastical       or political tyranny have immured          in
darkness, or of those felons whom law and justice have driven from
society, we should find many examples of the terrible effects which
have been engendered       by the exclusion of those influences         which
are   necessary  for the nutrition       and development      of the     lower
animals.
   Dr Edwards applies to man the principles which he deduced from
his experiments on animals      ;  and he maintains that, " in climates
in  which nudity is not       incompatible with health, the exposure
of the whole    surface of the body to       light will  be very   favourable
to   the regular conformation        of the body."      In  support    of this
opinion he quotes       a statement      by    Humboldt, that among the
people called Chaymas,      who live under the Equator, both men and
women are very muscular and have fleshy and rounded               forms, and
that he had not seen a single individual with a natural deformity."
" I can
          say the same," he adds, "of many thousands of Caribs,
Muyscas, and Mexican and Peruvian Indians, whom                  I   have ob
served during five years.      Deformities and deviations        are exceed
ingly rare in certain races of men, especially those which have the
skin strongly coloured."
   If  light thus developes in certain races the perfect type of the
adult who has grown under its influence, we can hardly avoid the
conclusion drawn by Dr Edwards, " that the want of sufficient light
must constitute one of the external causes which              produce     those
deviations in form which are observed in children affected with
scrofula, — an opinion supported by the fact that this disease is most
prevalent in poor children living in confined and dark streets."
   Following out the same principle, Dr Edwards infers, " that
when these deformities do         not appear incurable, exposure to the
sun is one of the means tending to restore a good conformation."
" It is true,"
               he adds, "that the light which falls upon our clothes

                      of Edinburgh, Session 186U-67.                            7
 acts only     by its    heat, but the exposed parts receive the peculiar
 influence of the      light."    "                                         "
                                    Among these parts," he continues,         we
 must   certainly regard the eyes as not merely designed for the per
ception of colour and form.              Their exquisite sensibility to light
fits them peculiarly for transmitting it throughout the system, and
we   know that even        a moderate   light on the retina produces in    seve
ral diseases a general exacerbation          of symptoms."
    If  the   light of day, then, contributes to the development               of
the human        form, and lends its aid to art and nature in the cure         of
disease,    it becomes       a personal    and   national duty to construct
our dwelling-houses, our schools, our workshops,             our factories, our
churches, our villages, towns, and cities upon            such principles and
in such styles of architecture as         will allow the life-giving element
to have the fullest and the freest entrance, and to chase from every
crypt, and cell, and corner the elements of uncleanness and corrup
tion which have a vested interest in darkness.
    Although      we have not    visited the prisons and lazarettos of foreign
countries,     to describe    the dungeons     and caverns in which the vic
tims of despotism and crime are perishing without light and air,
yet we have seen enough in our own country — in private houses,
in the most magnificent of our castles, and in the most gorgeous of
our palaces — to establish the fact that there is hardly a house in
town or country without dark apartments which it is in the power
of science       to   illuminate.      In  most of    the  principal cities of
Europe, and in many of the finest towns of Italy, where external
nature wears her brightest attire, there are streets and lanes in
which the houses on one side are             so  near those on the other, that
hundreds of thousands of human              beings are neither supplied with
light nor air, and carry on their trades in almost total darkness.
Providence — more beneficent            than   man — has provided the means
of  lighting up to       a certain  extent the workman's home, by the ex
 panding power of the pupil of his eye, and by an increasing sen
 sibility of his retina ; but the very exercise of such powers is pain
 ful, and every attempt to see when seeing is an effort, or to read
 and   work with     a   straining eye and an erring hand, is injurious to
 the organ      of vision, and sooner or later must impair its powers.
 Thus, deprived of the light of day, thousands are compelled to carry
 on their trades principally by artificial light — by the consumption

 8                   Proceedings       of the Royal Society
 of tallow, oil, or    gas, thus  inhaling from morning till midnight the
 offensive odours and polluted           effluvia which are more or less the
 products of artificial illumination.
     It is in vain to expect that such evils, shortening           and rendering
 miserable the life of man, can be removed by legislation or arbitrary
 power.      In  various great cities attempts are making to replace their
 densely congregated         streets and dwellings by structures           at once
 ornamental and salutary; and Europe               is now admiring that great
 renovation     in a neighbouring metropolis,            by which hundreds       of
 streets and thousands of dwellings, once the seat of poverty and
 crime, are replaced by architectural combinations              the most beauti
 ful, and by hotels and palaces which vie with the finest edifices of
 Greek or of Roman art.
    These     great improvements,       'however, are     necessarily   local and
 partial, and centuries must         pass away before we can expect those
 revolutions     in our domestic and city architecture under which the
 masses    of the people    will find    a cheerful     and well-lighted home.
 We must, therefore,         attack the evil as        it exists, and call upon
 science to give us such a remedy as she can supply.
    There can      be no doubt that science does possess such           a remedy
 — a remedy, too, easily understood and easily applied.                   Like all
 other remedies, however, it has its limits, but within these limits
the principles and methods which science dictates are unquestion
able and efficacious.
    With rare exceptions, apartments             are lighted with vertical win
 dows, which admit the light of the sun, either directly or when re
flected from the sky, or from adjacent surfaces.               In  narrow streets
and lanes, the light which enters the window comes chiefly from
a portion     of the sky, and the value of this portion          as an illuminat
ing agent depends on its magnitude or area, and on its varying dis
tance from the sun in his daily path ; but whether the area be
large or small, bright or obscure,         it is the only source of light which
the window can command             ;  and the problem which science pre
tends to solve is to throw into the dark apartment as much light                as
possible — all the light, indeed, which is visible from the window,
excepting that which is necessarily lost in the process.
    In  lanes or closes shut up at both            ends by lofty houses, or by
projecting buildings, it is sometimes only from              a small   portion of

                           of Edinburgh, Session 1866-67.                                       9
 the sky towards the zenith                that the light can         be obtained, and      in
 this case part of it might be advantageously thrown into a window
 by expensive reflectors ; but in streets and lanes open at both ends,
where a narrow strip of the sky is visible                        from one point of the
horizon       to the opposite point,              no aid whatever           can be obtained
from reflectors,           and in such cases            the method          we are about    to
describe is peculiarly effective.
   If in     a very narrow street or lane, we look out                  of   a window    with
the eye       in the same plane            as the outer face       of the wall in which
the window is placed, we                  shall   see the whole     of the sky by which
the apartment can be                 illuminated.       If   we   now withdraw the eye
inwards,      we shall gradually              lose sight of the sky           till it wholly
disappears, which may take place when the eye is only six or eight
inches from its first                position.     In   such a case the apartment           is
illuminated only by the light reflected from the opposite wall, or
the sides of the stones which form the window ; because, if the
glass of the window                  is six or eight inches within the wall, as it
generally      is,   not   a   ray of light can fall upon it.
  If    we now remove our window and substitute                        another       in which
all the panes of glass are roughly ground on the outside, and flush
with the outer wall, the light from the whole of the visible sky
and from the remotest parts                 of the opposite wall, will        be introduced
into the apartment, reflected from the innumerable                           faces or facets
which the rough grinding of the glass has produced.                              The whole
window       will appear        as   if   the sky were       beyond   it,   and from every
point of this luminous                surface light     will radiate into all parts of
the room.            In    order to explain          the superior      effect of roughly
ground glass, let us suppose that the ordinary window                           is   replaced
with    a   single sheet of the best glass inserted flush with the outer
wall.       The whole of the light from the visible portions of the sky
will fall upon its surface, but at such an obliquity that four or five
sixths of     will be reflected outwards, and the other two or one
              it
sixth, which         is   transmitted,      will fall on the floor or on the shutters,
and be of no value.
  In    aid of this method of distributing light, the opposite sides of
the street or lane should be kept white-washed                        with lime, and for
the same reason the ceilings and walls of the apartment should be
as white as possible,            and all the furniture of the lightest colours.

Having seen such effects produced by imperfect means, we feel as
if we had introduced our poor workman or needle-woman from a
dungeon     into a summer-house,          where  the aged    can read   their
Bible, — where the inmates can          see each other,  and carry on their
work in facility and comfort.             By pushing out the window we
have increased      by a few cubic        feet the  quantity   of air to be
breathed,    and we have enabled the housemaid            to look into dark
corners where there had hitherto nestled           all the elements of cor
ruption.     To these inmates the winter twilight has been shortened,
the sun has risen sooner and set later, and the midnight lamp is no
longer lighted when all nature is smiling with the blessed influences
of day.
   But it is not merely to the poor man's home that these processes
are applicable.     In all great towns, where neither houses nor palaces
can be insulated, there are almost in every edifice dark and gloomy
crypts thirsting     for light   ;  and in the city of London there are
places of business     where the     light of day never enters, and where
the precious    light which the sky sends down between chimney tops
is allowed     to fall useless     on the ground.      On visiting   a friend
whose duty confined him to his desk during the official part           of the
day, we found him with bleared eyes struggling against the feeble
light which the opposite wall threw into his window.               We coun
selled him to extend a blind of fine white muslin on the outside of
his window and flush with the wall.              The experiment was soon
made.     The light of the sky above was caught by the fibres of the
linen, and thrown straight upon his writing table, as if it had been
reflected from an equal surface of ground glass.           We may mention
another case     equally illustrative of our process. A party visiting
the mausoleum       of  a Scottish nobleman       wished to see the gilded
 receptacles   of the dead which occupied its interior. There was
 only one small window through which the light entered, but it did
 not fall upon     the objects      to be examined.      Upon stretching     a
 muslin handkerchief from its four corners, it threw such          a quantity
 of light into the crypt as to display fully its contents.
    But while our method           of illuminating    dark apartments     is a
 great utilitarian    agent,   it is also an 83sthetical power of some
 value, enabling the architect to give the full effect of his design
 to the external facade of his building,         without exhibiting to the

public       eye     the vulgar arrangements which are required in its
interior.          Our National Picture Gallery on the Mound, from the
beautiful designs of              Mr Playfair, is lighted from above ; but there
are certain         small apartments on the west side of it which cannot
be thus        lighted, and these being very useful, the architect was
obliged       to light them by little windows in the western facade.
These windows               are   dark and unseemly gashes in the wall, about
two feet high and one foot broad                      ;   and being unfortunately placed
near the fine           Ionic portico, — the principal feature in the building,
— they greatly interfere                 with     the symmefry              and beauty of the
western           facade.     Had there          been      no    science       in Edinburgh to
give counsel on this occasion, the architect                              should      have left his
little apartments under the patronage of gas or oil; but science
had a complete remedy for the evil, and in the hope that it may
yet be applied, we offer it to those who have the charge of this
noble building.  Take sheets of thick plate glass the exact size of
the present windows, and of such a colour, that when one side is
roughly ground it will have the same colour as the freestone.
When the openings            with these plates, having the ground
                                  are filled
side outwards, the dark gashes will disappear, the apartments will
be better lighted, and the building will assume its true architec
tural character.              The plates of glass thus                     inserted      among    the
stones       may, when            viewed     at a short          distance,      show their true
outline, but this could not have happened     during the building    if,
of the wall, some of the stones had been left out and replaced by
plates of glass of the same size.                     This method of illumination will
enable architects to light the interior of their buildings by invisible
windows, and thus give to its exterior facade the                                  full aesthetical
effect of their design.
   If   it   is   important to obtain        a   proper illumination of our apartments
when the sun            is   above the horizon,           it   is   not less so when he has
left us to          a   short-lived twilight, or consigned                     us to the tender
mercies of the moon.                    In     the one case          it   is   chiefly    in ill-con
structed dwelling-houses,                and in large towns and cities, where                       a
dense population,             crowded into        a   limited       area, occupy         streets and
lanes in almost total darkness, that science                          is   called upon for her
aid;     but in the other,             we      demand from her the best system of
artificial illumination, under which                        we      must spend           nearly   one

third of our lives, whether they           are passed    in the cottage or in the
palace, in the open village, or the crowded city.
    When     we pass from the       flickering flame of      a wood fire to rods       of
pine wood charged with turpentine               — from     the cylinder of tallow
to    the    vase   filled with     oil — from wax       lights    to the     flame of
 gas, and from       the latter to the electric light, — we see the vast and
rapid stride which          art and science have taken in the illumination
of our houses and streets.                We have now obtained               sufficient
sources of light        ; we   require only to use it safely, economically,
and salubriously.           The method which        we mean not      only to recom
mend, but to press upon the public attention,                     unites    the three
qualities which are          essential   in house illumination        ; but     till our
legislators    and architects,       and the leaders of public opinion, shall
be more alive to the importance            of scientific truths, in their practical
phase, we can have no hope of its general adoption.                      True know
ledge,     however,       advances     with time.        Vulgar      prejudices      are
gradually worn down, and in less than                a century,   whether we have
the electric light or not, we shall have our artificial suns shedding
their beneficial rays under the guidance of science.
    The present method of lighting our houses by burning the lights
within its apartments, is attended with many evils. The intoler
able increase of temperature            in well lighted rooms, whether they
are occupied       with small or large parties — the rapid consumption
of the oxygen which our respiratory                     system requires to be
                   —
undiminished the offensive smell of the unconsumed gas — the
Stench of the oleaginous products of combustion                — the damage done
to    gilded   furniture       and   picture     frames, — the      positive     injury
 inflicted upon the        eye by the action     of a number     of scattered lights
upon      the retina, — and        the    risks    of fire    and   explosion,    — are
strong objections         to the system of internal illumination.                 About
half     a  century       ago   I  proposed     to illuminate       our   houses      by
burning the gas externally, or placing it within the walls
of the house, or in' any other way by which the products of
combustion should not vitiate the air of the apartment.                     The plan
was received      with    a smile.     It  bad not even       the honour of being
ridiculed.      It  was too     Quixotic    to endanger      existing interests, or
tread upon vested rights.               Owing to the extended            use    of  gas,
however, its evils became more generally felt, especially when large

                    of Edinburgh, Session 1866-67.                      13
assemblages     of persons were for many hours exposed to them ; but
no attempt was made to alter the existing system till 1839, when
a Committee of the House of Commons was appointed to inquire
into the best method of lighting the house.           Many eminent indi
viduals were examined        ; and in consequence of the report     of the
Committee, the new system was adopted of lighting from without,
or, in which the air breathed by the members is entirely separated
from the air which supplies the burners.            A similar change has
been made in lighting many other public halls ; but the new system,
in its   most    general   aspect, has been carried     out in one of the
principal apartments      in Buckingham Palace, where the light radi
ates from the roof, as if from the sky above, without any of the
sources of light being visible.         This method, of course, can be
adopted only in halls, or apartments with        an  external roof.  In all
other cases difficulties must     be encountered  in houses already built ;
but   we have no    doubt that the ingenuity of the engineer and archi
tect will overcome them, whether the method is to be accommodated
to old buildings, or applied in its most perfect           state to houses
 erected on purpose to receive it.       But, however great may be these
difficulties, it is fortunate that, whether we are to have the advan
 tage of the electric light, or of a purer form of carburetted hydrogen
gas, the mode of distributing it will be, generally speaking, the
same,    and we therefore      need not hesitate    to introduce the new
 method on the ground that it may         be superseded by another.
    Having    so recently escaped from the inhumanity of a tax which
 prohibited the light and air of heaven from entering our dwellings,
 we trust that the governments         of Europe will freely throw these
 precious influences    into the dark abodes of their overcrowded cities,
 and that wealthy and philanthropic individuals will promote the
 same object in more limited spheres, and set the example of light
 ing, heating, and ventilating, according to the principles of science.
 Dr Arnott has already taught us how to heat our apartments with
 coal fires, without breathing either the gases or the dust which
 they diffuse.     Why should we delay to light them also without
 breathing   a  noxious gas, and overlaying the organs of respiration
 with   the nameless poisons generated in the combustion of the
 animal and vegetable substances employed in the furnishing of our
 apartments.

  I     cannot conclude             these observations             without referring to the
use which may be made of them in our own city, notorious for the
number   of its dark and narrow lanes, and for the thousands of
unlighted and unventilated dwellings which they contain.    The
devoted men who venture daily into these abodes of malaria and
uncleanness,            can alone describe to us the cimmerian darkness                       and
the tainted atmosphere                   in which their pallid occupants                 live, and
move, and have their being.They alone can paint the harrowing
scenes which disease and destitution present to them in these
joyless homes.   To what extent evils like these can be remedied
it is a sacred duty to inquire. To what extent they will be re
medied by the large and expensive sanitary measures now contem
plated, we do not venture                   to predict      ;    but it is very obvious, that
the upper and lower ends of the offensive lanes, which are to be
intersected by the new streets, can derive                          little benefit from them
in respect of ventilation, and none whatever                            in giving additional
light to the houses which remain.
     The only effectual mode of ventilating and lighting                             a   dark and
crowded apartment                 is,   to strike out   a       large opening in the wall for
the fresh admission              of air, and to construct the window which                   is   to
close          so as to    give the most copious entrance to the light of the
        A it
sky.           process so cheap, so easily executed, and so obviously effec
tual, ought to be the very first step in any measure of sanitary
reform    ;     and   it   is   clearly one which,        if      not effected by the philan
thropy of the public, ought to be enjoined by Act of Parliament upon
the house proprietors     individually, or upon the citizens at large.
     In   giving expression to these opinions did not expect to have
                                                                  I

seems the extent of misery and degradation                              to be grappled with,
and the more are we convinced                      that any sanitary scheme which
does not contemplate                    the internal improvement             of the dwelling-
houses as one of its chief objects,                     will never go to the root of the

 evil.    The opening of new streets will not alone          be   sufficient; the
 houses    that remain must       be so altered    that they will admit light
 and fresh air, which, in many cases, are at present almost entirely
 excluded.      We have visited dwellings in the Grassmarket and West
 Port, situated in airy localities, but which, by simply being out of
 repair and not having sufficient ventilation, are really uninhabitable.
 We cannot insist too strongly on the absolute               necessity there is
for the authorities directing their attention to this point.               Where
proprietors      receive  a sufficient return, they must be compelled to
do   their duty in this respect      ;  and in  cases where   they can on good
ground plead inability, the work must be done for them.                The labour
is so formidable that        it will task the whole energies of the civic
authorities, and yet leave much to be done by private benevolence."
    In proceeding to give you a brief notice of the Fellows of the
Society who have died during the present                year,   I  regret   to say
that    their number is greater than usual, and that we have to lament
the loss of some of our most distinguished members.
    Davxd Craiqib, an eminent Physician, was born in Leith on the
6th    June    1793.    He entered the University of Edinburgh in 1809,
where he was distinguished by his classical acquirements                   and by
his successful study of several of the Eastern languages, especially
Hebrew and Persian.            In  1816 he took the degree       of M.D. in the
University — the subject of his thesis being De Vita Animali.
In 1818 he became a Member, and in 1819 one of the Presidents
of the Royal Medical Society.            Soon after this he gave two courses
of lectures on Anatomy.                Between 1820 and 1827 he assisted
 Dr Andrew         Duncan in the editorship of the " The Edinburgh
 Medical and Surgical Journal," which Dr Duncan had founded in
 1805.      In   1827  Dr Christison joined Dr Craigie in editing this
important journal, and this joint editorship continued till 1832,
 when Dr Christison was appointed to the Chair of Materia Medica,
 and from that time till 1855 Dr Craigie was its sole proprietor and
 editor.     In   1832   Dr Craigie was elected       a  Fellow of the Royal
 College of Physicians,        and in the following     year a Fellow       of the
 Royal Society, to whose Transactions he does not seem to have con
 tributed.      In  1833 he succeeded      Dr James Gregory       as physician to
 the    Royal Infirmary    ;  and while he lectured on Practical Medicine,

  16                 Proceedings of the Royal Society
  he gave a course of Clinical         Medicine, and published for several
  years Clinical Reports, which contain much valuable information.
      For  a number    of years from 1846 Dr Craigie was prevented by
  ill  health from carrying on the active duties of his profession, but
  he had so far recovered      in 1858 that he was appointed one of the
  Examiners of the College of Physicians,           a duty which on several
  occasions he performed for the University of St Andrews, who gave
  Degrees to candidates who had not studied at the United College.
      In  December 1861 he was elected President of the Royal College
  of Physicians, and he was able to preside at the dinner given on
 the     12th October    1863 to the Social Science Congress, at which
 Prince Alfred, Lord Brougham, and other eminent individuals were
 present.      His health now began to give way             ; but though he
 regained it after a journey to Devonshire, symptoms             of a serious
 disease appeared, and he died on the 17th May 1866, when he had
 nearly completed his seventy-third year.
      Dr Craigie's principal works are his '' Elements of General and
 Pathological Anatomy," and his " Elements of the Practice of
 Medicine,"      both   of which     have  been   much    esteemed    by    the
 medical profession.       The first of these was published in 1828, and
 was republished      in 1848 in   a second    and enlarged    edition.    The
 second appeared in 1836, and displayed great erudition and pro
 fessional    knowledge,    but owing to the high price at which        it was
 published it had     a comparatively limited circulation.
     Sir John Hepburn        Stuart Forbes was born at Dean House,
 Edinburgh, on the 25th September 1804. He was the second son
of Sir William Forbes, who was a Fellow of this Society from 1804
till his death, and who was frequently a Member of Council. Sir
 William was an early friend of Sir Walter Scott, who in the fourth
canto of Marmion, inscribed to his brother-in-law,            Mr Skene, thus
justly describes him : —
                     And thou and I and dear loved R — (Rae),
                     And one whose name I may not say,
                     For not Mimosa's tender tree
                     Shrinks sooner from the touch than he.
Sir William, the grandfather of Sir John, and the author of the
life of Dr Beattie (who became in 1783 an original Member of the
Royal Society), was in the same poem thus truly characterised : —

After   a complete course       of study at the University of Edinburgh,
Sir John passed as        Advocate in 1826, and he would have pursued
the profession of the law, but for the death of his elder brother
in 1826,    and of his       father    in 1828, when      he succeeded to the
baronetcy.      In 1833 he     was elected a Member      of this Society, and in
1834 he    married Lady Harriet Kerr, the third daughter of the sixth
Marquis    of Lothian.       Soon after this event he left Edinburgh, where
his father and grandfather          had resided, and lived almost wholly at
Fettercairn House, where          he occupied    himself nearly exclusively in
the management of his              estates, and in the discharge of those
numerous      duties of patriotism and charity, which are so cheerfully
and   nobly performed by our Scottish landholders.             Sir John was for
many years an active member of the Highland and Agricultural
Society of Scotland, and, for some time acted as its Treasurer.              He
was   particularly interested in the advancement of agriculture as a
science as well as an art, and he exerted himself in vain against
the   miserable     parsimony      of the Government        to obtain a better
endowment for the Agricultural Chair in our University.
   In   1857 Sir    John    was   appointed    Convener    of Kincardineshire,
the duties       of which he discharged with exemplary diligence,
devoting himself to the business of the county with a zeal and
self- sacrifice which the public did not fail to appreciate.              At all
hours and in all weathers            he was found at his post, even        while
labouring under attacks of what proved to be a mortal disease.

at largo."    See Marmion, canto iv. note ii.

   Sir John acquired      at the University    of Edinburgh    a taste for
scientific pursuits.    He was particularly     attached   to geology   and
meteorology,    and he was one     of the founders of the Meteorological
Society of Scotland,      which   under    his vice-presidency and      the
presidency    of the Marquis of Tweeddale       was doing valuable     work
for that important branch of scientific research.
    After  an   illness of some months' duration,          Sir John died
in London on the 28th May 1866, in the sixty-second year of
his   age, and was succeeded in the baronetcy          by his nephew,    Mr
William Forbes.        He left an only daughter, who was married in
1858 to the Hon. C. B. Trefusis, M.P., now Lord Clinton.
   The Rev. James Macfarlane            was the son     of the Rev. John
Macfarlane, Bridgton,        Glasgow,    and  was    born  at  Waterbeck,
Dumfriesshire,      on  the  27th    April 1808.      After receiving his
elementary education       at the High School of Glasgow, he entered
the University there, and distinguished himself both as a classical
scholar and      as  a student    of Divinity.    While    at  College he
obtained   the degree of Master of Arts, and subsequently          that   of
Doctor of Divinity, and in 1865 he was appointed Moderator of the
General Assembly of the Church of Scotland.            He was licensed by
the Presbytery of Glasgow in 1830, and ordained in 1831 as pastor
of the East Church in Stirling.        In  1832 he was translated     to St
Bernard's Church in Edinburgh, and in 1840 he was presented to the
living of Duddingston, where he continued to discharge his duties
as a parish minister faithfully and efficiently till his death, which
took place on the 6th of February 1866, in the 58th year of his age.
   James Duncan, M.D., an eminent physician, was born at Perth
on the 2d November 1810, and was the only son of            Mr Duncan, of
the well-known firm of Duncan, Flockhart, and Co. After receiving
his early education at Perth, and at the High School of Edinburgh,
 he entered the University, and took the degree of M.D. in 1834.
In   the same year, he became a Fellow of the Royal College of Sur
geons in London, and in 1835 a Fellow of the Royal College of Sur
geons in Edinburgh.        He spent about two years on the Continent,
and prosecuted      the study of anatomy and surgery at the medical
schools of France, Germany, Austria,          and  Italy.   On his return

Mr Liston, in the Infirmary of Edinburgh, and in the hospital of
University College, London.        In   1837 Dr Duncan settled in Edin
burgh as a medical     practitioner,   where he rose to great eminence,
and enjoyed the largest     general    practice.   He    was surgeon to the
Royal Infirmary for many years, and in that capacity delivered
lectures on clinical surgery. He was elected a Fellow of this Society
in 1858  ; but though he was the author of many              valuable  papers
in the medical journals, he did not contribute to our Transactions.
   Dr Duncan    was   in the habit of spending         a few weeks in the
country every autumn, as a relaxation from the duties of his exten
sive practice.    In July   1866 he went to the Continent with his
wife and family, committing to his son the charge of his patients
in Edinburgh.      During    a few days' residence      in Paris, when the
cholera prevailed, he seems to have imbibed the germs of that fatal
disease.    On the 12th of August he was attacked with diarrhoea,
which so completely yielded        to its usual treatment that he went
next day to Orleans.      From Orleans       he went to Tours, where, on
the 15th, he was attacked with cholera, which proved fatal on the
16th August, in the 56th year of his age.
   John Cay, of North Charlton, in the county of Northumber
land, was born in Edinburgh          on the 31st August 1790, and was
the eldest son of     Mr Robert Hodshon          Kay, of North Charlton,
Judge Admiral of Scotland.         He    was educated at the     High School
and University of Edinburgh, and was admitted               into the Faculty
of Advocates in 1812.       In   1822 he was appointed         Sheriff of the
county   of Linlithgow,     an   office which     he held     for forty-three
years, and the duties of which,       as a sound lawyer and a       judicious
judge, he discharged with great credit to himself and great satis
faction to the public.     Mr Cay took a great interest in the literary
and scientific institutions of Edinburgh.         He was elected a Fellow
of the Royal Society in 1821, and contributed          to its Transactions  a
short notice    of  a bronze    spear-head     found   on his property in
 Northumberland.       He was also a Member         of the Royal Scottish
 Society of Arts, and was one of the annual          Presidents   of that im
                         Mr Cay         the author of               " The Re
 portant institution.             was                   a work  on
                                               — one       "
 form Act," and of two small pamphlets                an      Analysis of the

20                  Proceedings of the Royal Society
                                                            " Outlines of the
Burgh Begistration Act," and the other entitled,
Procedure at Elections for Members of Parliament."                  When Mr
Cay was residing at Burntisland            in August 1865, he accidentally
fell, and received    a severe fracture   of the thigh-bone.    His naturally
robust constitution at first gave hopes of his recovery           ;  but these
hopes were disappointed,        and after much suffering,    born with great
Christian     resignation and patience,       he died in December 1865, in
the 75th year of his age.
   John Archibald Campbell, Clerk to the Signet, and Sheriff-
Clerk of Mid-Lothian, was born in the year 1788, and was the son
of John Campbell, Esq. of The Citadel, Leith. In 1813, he was
admitted     into the Society of Writers to the Signet.             From that
year to 1816, he was       joint Crown Agent      ; and from 1843 to 1859,
when he retired        into private life, he was Sheriff-Clerk        of Mid-
Lothian.      Mr Campbell was the founder or joint-founder of some
of the most thriving          institutions in Edinburgh, and he took an
active part in those municipal changes in which the public were
so deeply interested.
   Mr Campbell took a great interest in archaeological researches.
He was    a   Member of the Antiquarian Society,           and of the Royal
Society of Arts, and        he was elected     a Fellow of this Society in
1837.     He died in Edinburgh on the 7th September 1866, in the
78th year of his age.
   James Ivory, one of the Lords of Session, was born at Dundee
on the 29th       February 1792, and was the son of an engraver             of
 great mechanical       skill, and superior literary attainments.       He was
educated at the       Dundee     Academy, and acquired there a taste for
mathematics,       which he afterwards cultivated, and found an agree
able relaxation during the rest of his life.         His devotion to mathe
matics was no doubt         encouraged    by his uncle, James Ivory,     K.H.,
who was one of the most eminent of our Scottish              mathematicians.
Mr Ivory was educated at the University of Edinburgh, where he
was    distinguished      by   his literary   as well  as  his mathematical
acquirements.        In  1816 he was called to the Scottish Bar, where he
soon   rose    to great    eminence     in his profession.    In  1830, Lord
Jeffrey   appointed      him one of his depute-advocates,        and   in 1832

                   of Edinburgh, Session 1866-67.                            21
he was appointed      Sheriff of Caithness.        In  the following year he
was transferred to the Sheriffdom         of Bute, and in 1839, he       was ap
pointed Solicitor-General for Scotland.            In  the following year he
was appointed one      of the Lords of Session, and in 1849 one of the
Judges in the Court of Justiciary.              In   the same     year he was
elected   a  Fellow of this Society.        In these various legal offices
which Lord Ivory filled his judgments were distinguished by their
great soundness, as well as by the elegant diction in which they
were expressed.
   Before he was called to the Bar, Lord Ivory published a treatise
ou the    Form of Process, and in 1827, the first volume of his
edition of Erskine's Institutes, the second volume of which ap
peared some years afterwards.           In consequence of     ill  health, Lord
Ivory resigned his seat on the bench in 1862.                Since that time,
his health    gradually declined, and he         was carried   off by a stroke
of paralysis on the 17th October 1866, in the 74th year of his age.
   Lord Ivory was married, in 1817, to the daughter of Mr Lawrie,
Deputy-Gazette      Writer for Scotland.        His eldest  son,    Mr Thomas
Ivory, is counsel to the Commissioners          of Woods and Forests; and
his  third son, Mr William Ivory, Sheriff of Inverness-shire.
   John Frederick Louis Haosmann,             a distinguished     geologist and
mineralogist,    was born at Hanover on            the 22d February 1782.
After completing his studies at Brunswick and Gottingen, he was
appointed in 1803 to a situation in the administration of the Mines
at  Brunswick, and in      1805 he made a geological tour through          Nor
way and Sweden.         In   1809   he was appointed      by the government
Inspector General      of the Mines and Saltworks of Westphalia, but
he soon resigned     this  office in order to devote himself       to the study
of Mineralogy.      In   1811 he was appointed Professor        of Mineralogy
 and Geology     in the University of Gottingen, and while he filled
 this important   chair, he devoted himself to the examination            of the
 Harz Mountains, and made many geological excursions in Sweden,
 Holland,   France, Spain, and England. He was councillor of state
 in Hanover, an active member of the Royal Society of Gottingen,
 and a Corresponding       Member of the Academy of Sciences, in the
 Imperial Institute of France.
    Professor   Hausmann        was   the author of various Articles and

22                  Proceedings of tlte Royal Society
Memoirs in the German          Journals, and in the Transactions of the
Royal Society       of Gottingen, and of several separate works on
Chemistry, Geology, and the Mines of Germany                   ;   but his chief
productions are his
                        " Travels in various
                                                 parts of Scandinavia," pub
lished in five volumes between 1811 and 1818, and his "Manual of
Mineralogy," published in 1813, and reprinted in 1828 and 1847.
   Henry Darwin Rogrrs,             LL.D., F.R.S.,      and F.G.S.,       a distin
guished American Geologist, Professor of Geology in the University
of Glasgow, and one of the Foreign Members of this Society, was
born in Philadelphia on the 1st of August 1808, and was the third
of four brothers, all of whom have been devoted to the cultivation
and teaching of Physical          Science,   their father Dr Patrick Kerr
Rogers, having himself been Professor of Natural                Philosophy and
Chemistry in the College of           "William     and    Mary"      in   Virginia.
At the early age of twenty-two he was elected Professor of Natural
History     and   Physics    in Dickinson      College,    Carlisle,    but being
desirous   of improvement, he resigned his chair, and spent above             a year
in England, where he studied Analytical Chemistry in the laboratory
of Dr Edward Turner, and had the privilege of accompanying Sir
Henry De la Beche in his geological excursions.
   On    his return to Philadelphia       he was appointed       to the chair of
Geology in the University of that city, and while discharging its
duties, which he did for many years, he carried on many important
scientific researches.      Along with Professor A. D. Bache, he made
an extensive     series of Experiments        on the Ashes of Coal, and in
conjunction with his brother W. B. Rogers, he made experiments
on " The Laws of the Elementary Voltaic Battery."
   The first fruits of his geological labours was his Report of the
Survey of the state of New Jersey, which he published in 1835
with   a   large   geological   map.      While engaged in that survey
he was      employed    by the     legislature to make        a survey       of the
great state of Pennsylvania,         and   to this herculean        task    he de
voted    many     years  of his life.       It  commenced         in   1836,    and
with the aid of       a staff of able coadjutors,        it was completed in
1855, and published        in three volumes, under the title of " The
Geology     of Pennsylvania,     a  Government Survey, with             a  General
Survey of the Geology         of the United States,        Essay on the Coal

                    of Edinburgh,     Session 1866-67.                     2'6
 Formation and its Fossils, and a description           of the Coal Fields
of North America and Great Britain."           This great work, which was
printed and published        in Edinburgh, appeared in 1858, and is
illustrated with an immense number of maps, geological sections,
sketches    of scenery, and fossils, executed by Messrs W. and A. K.
Johnston.*
    It  was  during the progress of this great survey that Professor
Rogers and his brother already mentioned, who was in charge of the
survey of the state of     Virginia produced their remarkable Memoir
" On the
            Physical structure of the Appalachian Chain, as exempli
fying the laws which have regulated the Elevation of Mountain
Chains, &c."       This Memoir excited a deep interest when read at
the meeting     of the association of geologists and naturalists which
was    held at Boston in 1842, and it has been published in its memoirs
for that year.      Professor   Rogers    was one of the founders of the
association which was expanded into the Association              for the Ad
vancement of Science.
    After having given to the world the results of his geological
researches, he took up his residence at Boston, devoting himself to
his favourite studies, and occasionally delivering courses of lectures
in the Lowell Institute, which he did with a readiness and felicity
of diction rarely exhibited by the cultivators of physical science.
    While in Edinburgh, engaged in the publication of his great work,
a vacancy took place      in the Regius Professorship of Natural History
in the University of Glasgow, and through the influence, we believe,
of the Duke of     Argyll, he  was appointed to that    chair in 1857.    The
lectures which he delivered          in this new position       were  greatly
admired, and he might have looked forward             to many years of rest
from the toils of his early life   ; but in the severe exposures which he
endured in his geological surveys, his constitution was so enfeebled,
and    in the composition and superintendence of his great work he
had    so overworked his mind, that his colleagues observed for two
or three years a gradual failure of health, which terminated fatally
at Glasgow on the 29th of May 1866, in the 58th year of his age.
    Alan Stevenson, an eminent engineer, was born in Edinburgh,
    * About the  same time Professor Rogers published an elaborate paper " On
 the Origin of the Appalachian  Coal Strata, Bituminous  and Anthracite."

24                Proceedings of the Royal Society
in 1807, and was the eldest       son of Mr Robert Stevenson,       engineer
to the Scottish Lighthouse        Board.    He was educated at the      High
School and     University      of Edinburgh,     where   he   obtained    the
Felloes' Prize     as   an  advanced    student   of Natural   Philosophy.
In  1826 he took the degree of       M.A., and in 1840 the University of
Glasgow conferred on him the degree of          LL.B.
   Although   he had     himself desired to study for the Church, yet he
was afterwards led to adopt the profession of a civil engineer, for
which he was     so   highly qualified by his previous    education.     For
many    years he was Clerk        of Works to the Scottish      Lighthouse
Board, and on the death       of his father in 1842 he succeeded him as
their engineer in chief.
   During the comparatively short time that his health enabled him
to discharge    its duties,    he erected   several  Lighthouses      on the
Scottish coast, the most important of which is that at Skerry vore, a
magnificent work, which is not surpassed by any similar structure
in the world. It was began in 1838, and completed in 1844.
The Eddystone Lighthouse, by the celebrated             Smeaton, and that
on the Bell Rock, by     Mr Robert Stevenson, lose their grandeur when
placed in comparison with the gigantic tower at Skerry vore.              An
interesting account of this great work was published by Mr Steven
son in 1848, under the title of " Account of the Skerryvore Light
house, with notes on the Illumination        of Lighthouses."
   In                                                             "  A Rudi
       1850 he published a very valuable         work, entitled
mentary Treatise on the History, Construction, and         Illumination -of
Lighthouses."
   To his great accomplishments        as a civil engineer, Mr Stevenson
added classical acquirements of no ordinary kind.         He had mastered
the languages of Greece and Rome, and acquired a critical knowledge
of Italian and Spanish.
   In  1852, when a severe nervous affection had unfitted him for the
duties  of his office, he beguiled his hours of suffering by translating
into English    verse the ten hymns of Synesius,        Bishop of Cyrene.
These translations,     with some pieces of his own, were printed in the
present year for private circulation, and have been much admired.
   Mr Stevenson was elected a Fellow of this Society in 1838.
He was a Member of the Institution of Civil Engineers, and he
had   the   honour     of receiving complimentary        medals    from the

                      of Edinburgh, Session 1866-67.                                   25
Emperor of Russia, and from the                 Kings of Prussia and Holland,
as acknowledged         merits       as    a lighthouse     engineer.     When         his
health prevented him from attending the meetings of this Society,
he gave    in his resignation, but the Council declined                  to accept      it,
and   continued to him all the privileges of Fellow.   a
  The long illness of Mr Stevenson, produced no doubt by the
severity of his exposures at Skerryvore, and the responsibilities and
anxieties attaching to so great and difficult              a   work, was borne with
exemplary        patience and resignation, and he died at Portobello, as                a
Christian should die, on the 23d December 1865, in the 58th year of
his age.
  Robert         Kaye Greville,       a    distinguished     botanist,   was    born at
Bishop Auckland, on the 13th December 1794, and was the son of
the Rev. Robert Greville, Rector of Wyaston in Derbyshire.                          While
he was  receiving his education under his father's roof, he spent his
leisure hours in the study of plants; and so rapid was his progress,
that before he was nineteen he had made careful coloured drawings
of between one and two hundred native plants.                    Being intended for
the medical profession, he went through                    the usual curriculum of
four years in London and Edinburgh                 ;   but circumstances            having
rendered        him independent,          he resolved to devote himself to his
favourite study.
  In 1816 he married        a    daughter of Sir       John Eden, Bart, of Win-
dleston, and in the same yearhe came to Edinburgh, where he studied
human and comparative anatomy under                    Dr Barclay.
  In    1816 he joined the Wernerian Society, to which he communi
cated   a   series of papers on Algae, which are published in the Trans
actions of the Society.  In 1823 he published the first volume of
his great work, entitled "Scottish Cryptogamic Flora," which he
completed in six volumes, in 1828. His
                                          " Flora Edinensis," con
taining     a                                           of Edin
                description of the plants in the neighbourhood

description of the marine and other inarticulated plants in the
British Islands, belonging to the Order Algae. In conjunction with
Dr Hooker he published the " Icones Filicum,"       splendid work, a
containing drawings        and descriptions         of ferns, either very rare or
which had been incorrectly figured.
  VOL    VI.                                                                   I,

    After he had completed these great works, Dr Greville made           a
 special study of the Diatomaceae, of which he formed a most valuable
collection, all the specimens being put upon slides and finely
labelled.     He wrote upwards of twelve papers descriptive of these
 minute organisms.      For these papers, and also for his contributions
to Cryptogamic Botany, the Council of this Society awarded to him,
in 1862, the medal founded by his friend,       Dr Patrick Neill.
   In  the brief space to which these biographical notices are neces
sarily limited, it would    be impossible  to enumerate   even the large
number     of important papers which Dr Greville published in the
Wernerian Transactions, and in the various scientific periodicals of
the day, and to give an intelligible     account of the important facts
which they contain.       We must notice, however, his collections of
natural history, which are extremely valuable, and not less impor
tant to science than the works in which they are described.
   His fine collection of Phanerogamic plants, and of Ferns, Mosses,
Fungi, and Algae, increased by subsequent purchases, and consisting
of about 50,000 species, constitutes our University Herbarium in
the Botanic Garden.        His collection of Insects, purchased also by
the University, is now deposited in the Museum of Science and Art.
His great collection of Diatoms has been purchased by the British
Museum     ;  and his collection of land and fresh water Mollusca has
been purchased for the Museum of Science and         Art in Edinburgh.
   The value of Dr Greville's works has been greatly enhanced by
the beauty and accuracy of his drawings.        His pencil was that of an
accomplished artist   ; and at one time he took up landscape painting
as a profession, and contributed several paintings to the    Exhibitions
of the Scottish Academy.
   The works of Dr Greville were      as  highly appreciated  in foreign
countries    as they were in his own.       In  1821  he was elected    a
Fellow of this Society.       In 1825 he was chosen a Member      of the
Royal Irish Academy, and in 1826 the University of Glasgow con
ferred upon him the degree of Doctor of Laws.            He was also a
Fellow of the Linnean Society, and either a corresponding or an
honorary member of a great number of Natural History Societies in
Europe and America.
   In his latter  years  Dr Greville lived happily at his beautiful villa
of Ormelie, near Edinburgh, where, with some exceptions, his health

                     of Edinburgh,      Session 186G-67.                     27
  was generally     good.    Towards    the end of last May, however, he
  imprudently    fell asleep on the damp grass, and brought upon him
  self an attack of inflammation of the lungs, which, in the course of
  a week, terminated fatally on the 4th of June 1866, in the 72d year
  of bis age.
     Dr Greville was a man of rare accomplishments,         and of no ordinary
  virtues.    His studies  were not confined to science, nor      his ambition
 limited to the honours which it merits, and the fame which it brings.
 His large heart embraced every measure of philanthropy^ whether
 national or local,   — whether originating in vicious legislation, in the
 necessary inequalities     of social life, or bearing upon the victims of
 ignorance, intemperance, and crime.          Nor did he take a less interest
 in those higher questions which disquiet the inner and nobler life
of man,      stretching beyond that bourne from which no traveller
returns, and affecting interests which time cannot measure nor space
define.      He had pondered in the lesser world over mysteries which
 he failed to comprehend, — over marvels of life which startled science
and rebuked reason       ; and he submitted.with the same reverence to
those     deeper mysteries     which human         instruments   had   equally
revealed.      Faith, and science falsely    so called, had to him, and has,
I hope,    to many of us, two opposite horizons — the one where the sun
rises, and the other where he sets.          In   the auroral   and meridian
light of the one     he studied, and lived, and died      ; and in the murky
twilight and midnight darkness of the other, he wept over the fallen
stars of science, — the Sappers and Miners of our Faith.
    Charles Macxaren,       an eminent geologist,      was born in Ormiston,
East Lothian, on the 7th October 1782, and            was the  only son of his
father, who was a small farmer.         His  uncle by the mother's side was
a smith in the household        of George     III.,  and his nephew would
have been broughtup to the same profession, had it notprovedincom-
patible with the delicacy of his constitution.         After acquiring a good
education at different      parochial  schools, and acquiring at home a
knowledge of modern languages            and of some branches of science,
he spent some years as      clerk and book-keeper to several Edinburgh
firms.
    In  the year 1816    Mr Maclaren, in conjunction with Mr William
Ritchie, established the Scotsman,       a newspaper which, though perse

28                    Proceedings       of the Royal Society
cuted in its early life, has acquired a greater popularity, and reached
a   higher circulation than any of our Scottish journals.               The first
number        was published on the 25th          January 1817, and, speaking
generally, Mr Maclaren had the honour of being its Editor till the
year 1847, when he resigned it into the hands of its present able
conductor.        Thus freed from the labours and anxieties of            a public
journalist, Mr Maclaren was able to devote his whole time to his
favourite studies.          He made numerous geological excursions to
different parts of Scotland, acquiring that accurate knowledge              of the
science which he displayed in his later works.
    Having taken        a great   interest in the speculations     respecting the
 Plain of Troy         as described    in the Iliad, he published in 1822         a
dissertation      on its topography; and in 1847 he visited the locality
 itself, and acquired that thorough knowledge of the subject, which
 he communicated to the public in 1863, under the title of " The
 Plain of Troy Described, and the identity of the Ilium of Homer,
 with the new Ilium of Strabo proved, by comparing the poet's nar
 rative with its present        Topography."        The views contained in this
 able and interesting work            have been     fully adopted by the most
 distinguished scholars in this country and on the continent.
     Among his numerous geological writings which have appeared in
 the Scotsman and in other journals, the most important is his
 " Geology of Fife        and the Lothians,"       which appeared in 1839.       It
 contains     a description    of the wide valley stretching from the Ochils
 on the North to the Lammermuirs on the South, and                    fully estab
 lished Mr Maclaren's reputation            as a  geologist.*
     Among the more prominent points in Mr Maclaren's character,
 was his remarkable sagacity, and his faith in the power and progress
  of science,    a  quality not often possessed by its cultivators.            His
 sagacity was strikingly displayed in predicting the great destiny of
  the American Republic, a sentiment which he drew from his know
  ledge of the politics and statistics of that great              and prosperous
  nation.     The article on America, in the " Encyclopaedia Britannica,"
  was from his pen, and also the article on Troy, in which he describes
  the interesting results to which we have already referred.
     II is  sagacity was no less displayed,        and his faith in science too,

when, so    early  as 1824, he predicted      the great success    of railway
travelling, and spoke of locomotion at the rate of twenty-four miles
an hour, or quicker than a race-horse, as a very probable event.
Science, however, has outstripped        the tardy estimate    of our author,
and the   still tardier one of George Stephenson.           A flight of sixty
miles an hour with a cargo heavier then a ship          of war, which many
of us have     made, would have        shaken    the nerves    even of these
sanguine speculators.      When we learn that        a distinguished man of
science announced in the " Edinburgh Review" the impossibility of
navigating the Atlantic by steam, we need not wonder at the slow
coach convictions of the uneducated          world.
    Mr Maclaren was elected      a  Fellow of this Society in 1837, and of
the Geological      Society of London in 1846.            He was an active
member     of the British Association, and for the two last years he
was   President of the Geological Society of Edinburgh.
    After resigning the editorship of the Scotsman, he retired to his
villa of Moreland Cottage,         near Edinburgh, where he spent           the
rest of his life.     His health was generally good, and his mental
powers unimpared, when         on the morning of the 27th August he
experienced a stroke of paralysis, which carried him off without
suffering on the 10th of September 1866, in the 84th year of his
age.
    WnxiAM Whewbll,          D.D.,    F.R.S.,    a  distinguished writer on
 almost every branch of science, was born at Lancaster on the 24th
 of May 1794.       He was the son of      a house   carpenter,   whose   little
 library supplied the first books which excited the literary ambition
 of his son.    From the Grammar School of Lancaster he went to
 Hevenham, in order to      be  qualified for holding an Exhibition at
 Trinity College, Cambridge.         After gaining this Exhibition of £50
 a-year,   he commenced     residence at Cambridge, and distinguished
  himself so much that in his first year he gained          a scholarship and
  a Foundation Sizarship.       In   the mathematical tripos of 1816 he
  graduated as second wrangler.         In  1817 he was elected Fellow         of
  Trinity, and soon after this he began to lecture on mathematics             as
  assistant tutor, at the salary of £75 per annum.            He was elected
  a Fellow of the Royal Society of London in 1820, and he enriched
  their Transactions from    1833 to 1840 with twelve papers, entitled

 30                 Proceedings of the Royal Society
" Researches on the Tides."            In  1837, after the publication of the
 ninth series, the Royal         Society    conferred      upon    him the Royal
Medal, in recognition of the great value of his Researches.*
    In 1821 he published his " Syllabus of an Elementary Treatise
on Mechanics," and in 1823 his          " Treatise on Dynamics."              In  1823
he became Tutor of       Trinity,   an office   which he held        till  1839.
    In   1828 he was appointed        Professor of Mineralogy           ;  and   if we
desired an example of the unrivalled power with which he mastered
a subject    with which his previous studies had but little connection,
it will be found in the admirable report " On the Progress and
Present State of Mineralogy," which he communicated to the
British Association in 1832. f In 1833 Dr Whewell published his
Bridgewater Treatise, entitled " Astronomy and General Physics,
considered in reference to Natural Theology."
    In  1837 he published his principal work, entitled the                  " History
of the Inductive Sciences, from the Earliest to the Present Times."
In appreciating the value of this noble record of physical truth,
and admiring the capacity and vast acquirements                   of its author, we
must at the same time           regret    the numerous        deficiencies      in the
work, and its doubtful decisions            in the controversies          of science.
As                                                                               " The
     a necessary    sequel to this work he published, in 1841,
Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences,"            a work    of able and ingenious
speculation,    which the public did not        so  gratefully receive.
    In  1837 he  preached before the University four sermons on the
foundation of morals, and having been thus led to the study of this
branch of knowledge, he accepted, in 1838, the Chair of " Moral
Philosophy      and   Casuistry,"    as   he called    it.    While he occupied
this   chair he composed          " Lectures      on the History of Moral
                                "
Philosophy in England,"           Lectures on Systematic Morality," and
" Elements of Morality and Polity," which appeared in 1845. His

    In 1841 he married Miss Marshall, and a few months afterwards
 he was, on the resignation of Dr Wordsworth, made Master of
Trinity.     The domestic happiness which he enjoyed in this new
 position was marred by a long and painful illness of Mrs Whewell,
and his grief on this occasion is said to have been so profound
that, in order to occupy his mind in this season of affliction, he
composed      his work of " The        Plurality of Worlds," which was
published in 1853.         A  more probable      opinion is, that the book
was   written to quiet certain doubts which had arisen in the mind
of his wife respecting the doctrine of redemption, on the ground
of the comparative insignificance of our planet, and of the race in
whose behalf the Deity interposed.           But whatever was the motive
or state   of mind under which this singular work         was composed, we
can   hardly admit that     a mind   so  richly endowed, and    so strong in
its religious conviction, could      have believed in the assertions that
the nebulae are      "  dots and lumps of light ;" that " the distant
stars are sparks    struck off from the potter's wheel in the formation
of the universe ;" that Jupiter is " a mere sphere of water with a
few cinders in its centre ;" that the ninety asteroids         are  " bits of
 a planet that had failed in the making;" and that the nineteen
 satellites of the solar           " are           of                  wound
                           system          pieces     vapour  neatly

    But, however sternly posterity may denounce the paradox,
 our earth is the oasis in the desert of the solar system," "the
 really largest planetary body" it contains, and "the only world
 in the universe," they will forgive its author on account of the
 noble sentiments,     the lofty aspirations,   and the suggestions    almost
 divine, which mark       his closing chapter on the future of the uni
 verse.    In  the bright noon of his intellectual life,   Dr Whewell had
 hazarded the sentiment,
                              " that science was its own reward," requir
 ing neither patronage for its extension, nor liberality to its cultiva
 tors; but when a high position rewarded his own acquirements and
 stimulated     his own labours, he turned with sympathy to his less

 fortunate fellow-workmen, and looked for their reward to
 versal and perpetual peace,"      in which the advancement of human
  knowledge     should be the great object of every social and national
                                                                               /"

employ      for the promotion              of human knowledge          a small   fraction
only of the means, the wealth, the ingenuity, the energy, the com
bination which they have employed in every age for the destruction
of human life and human means of enjoyment, we might soon
find that what we hitherto knew is little compared with what man
has the power of knowing."    Would that these words were placed
in letters of gold above the portal of every college in the empire,
and pondered by every student to whom the name of statesman, and
patriot, and Christian, is dear.
   Though          happy     in his domestic         relations,   they were to Dr
Whewell the cause of the deepest sorrow.                       The ill health of Mrs
Whewell had for several years been a source of great anxiety and
care, and in December 1855 he mourned her loss in a volume of
elegiac verses, printed for private circulation.                  In   1858 he married
Lady Affleck, the widow of Sir Archibald Affleck, and after eight
years of uninterrupted happiness, he had again, in 1865, to resign
himself to another domestic bereavement.
  After               of sorrow and seclusion, Dr Whewell was so
            some months
far able to resume his studies, as to write the article on " Comte
and Positivism," which appeared in " Macmillan's Magazine
                                                              " for

  On the 24th February 1865, when taking a ride, he met his own
carriage with ladies who were his guests, and turned to follow them
home.       His horse became excited and ran off, and losing all                     con
trol over    it,   owing    to   a   weakness in his left arm from      a   previous fall
from horseback, he fell upon his horse's neck and then to the ground
upon his head.         A    concussion of the brain, which had previously
been   in   a   shrunk state, terminated           fatally   on the 6th   March 1866,
in the 72d year of his            age.
  The great talents and acquirements                     of Dr Whewell           were as

 Perth, on the 5th December 1816,         and was the son of Alexander
 Macduff     of Bonhard.     He received the rudiments of his education
at the Grammar       School of Perth, and also at the Perth Academy,
 where he obtained the first prize     for general proficiency during the
session 1831-2.       He entered the University of Edinburgh in 1832,
and, after    attending the usual course of instruction, he began the
study of law in 1835. He passed as writer to the Signet in 1839,
and continued in the profession in partnership with Mr Welsh of
Collin   till 1845, when he retired to Perthshire, where he lived upon
his estate from 1847 to 1860, discharging the various            important
duties which our landed proprietors are called upon to perform.          In
1859 he acted as Secretary to the       Royal Commission on Roads and
Bridges    in Scotland.     In 1860 he took up his residence in Edin
burgh,    and was appointed       Vice-Convener and Secretary        of the
Church     Endowment Scheme.          In  1865 he was elected Secretary
to the  Highland and Agricultural Society of Scotland, and he had
hardly entered upon the duties of his office when be was attacked
with pleurisy, and died at Edinburgh on the 21st March 1866, in
the 50th year of his age.
   William Bonar was born in Edinburgh on the                 3d   January
1798, and was the      third son of Andrew Bonar of Kimmerghame and
Warriston, banker        in Edinburgh.      After receiving   his classical
education at the     High School of Edinburgh, he went through the
usual course of study at the University.
   In 1817 he       was   admitted   a partner   of the bank    of Messrs
Ramsay, Bonar, & Co., and he continued to discharge its duties          till
it was merged in the Bank of Scotland.
   Mr Bonar was one of a body of excellent men in Edinburgh who
employ their wealth and their leisure in promoting and managing
the many religious      and charitable institutions by which Edinburgh
is distinguished.       He was a man of fervent piety, and along with
his brother,     Mr Andrew Bonar, now the only survivor of four
brothers, he employed        a missionary to look after the ignorant and
neglected poor.       In  the same good cause,    Mr Bonar wrote several
religious tracts during his residence in Edinburgh.

he lived there with his family,          till   the   interference   of railways
with its amenity drove him to Babbicombe,                in Devonshire, where
he continued those benevolent          labours which he had so zealously
prosecuted during his residence in Edinburgh.
   Mr Bonar was elected a Fellow of this Society in 1822.                     He
took a great interest in matters of science, but specially in the
great inventions which were in his time bearing such noble                fruit.
   Mr Bonar died at Malvern, where he had gone for the recovery
of his health, on the 9th of November 1866, at the age of 68.
   James Stevenson        was born at Paisley on the 28th            April 1786,
and was the son of        Mr Stevenson,       a  silk-gauze manufacturer in
that town.     He was educated at the Grammar School there, and
afterwards   went to Glasgow, where he remained                 for thirty years
in business    as   a merchant and cotton-spinner.              In  1844 he re
moved to South        Shields, where he became senior partner in the
Jarrow Chemical Works,            the importance and           extent of which
were greatly increased by his energy and talents for business.
   At  South   Shields he took       a deep   interest in the welfare of the
working classes, founding excellent schools for their children, and
reducing,   as    far  as  practicable, the work usually done on the
Sabbath.     He established the " North and South Shields Gazette,"
a newspaper      by   which     the public interests of these two           large
towns were greatly advanced.              Mr Stevenson was likewise the
most active promoter of a company for supplying South Shields
with water, which previously had been chiefly derived from surface
wells.   He was an elder in the Free Church, and an active and
liberal friend of the Presbyterian Church in England.
   In  1854 he retired       from active business, and spent the rest of
his life in Edinburgh.          He was elected a Fellow of this Society
in 1865, and he died in his house, in Randolph Crescent, on the
13th June 1866, in the 81st year of his age.
    William    Thomas      Brandb, an eminent           chemist, was born in
 1786, and was the grandson        of a physician who came from Hanover
with one of the Georges.           After being educated at
                                                                   Westminster
School,   he went to complete         his education in Hanover but
                                                                               on
account of the disturbed state of Germany, he returned to England

                   of Edinburgh, Session 1866-67.                               35
in 1803, and entered St George's Hospital, attending                 the lectures
and dissecting room of that institution.           At this time he communi
cated several papers to Nicholson's Journal : one On Benzoin in
1805 ;* one on The Theory of Respiration in 1805 ;t and another On
the  Enamel of the      Teeth   in 18064      In   1806 he communicated          to
the Royal Society      a paper On      Guaiacum,      which was published in
their Transactions.       In  1808 he examined the calculi in the Hun-
terian Museum, and gave lectures on Chemistry in                Dr Hooper's in
Cork Street.    At this time he became a member of the New Medical
School in   Windmill Street, and began his career as a Teacher and
Demonstrator      in Chemistry, publishing many important papers in
the " Philosophical Journals,"           and in the " Transactions of the
Royal Society." In 1809 he             was elected a Fellow of the Royal
Society.    In 1813 he received        the Copley Medal for his communi
cations to the Society      ; and on the death of         Dr Wollaston, in the
same year, he succeeded him as Principal               Secretary to that body,
an office which he held       till 1826.    In   1812 he was elected Professor
of Chemistry and Materia Medica to the Apothecaries' Company, of
which he became Master in 1851. On Sir Humphry Davy's recom
 mendation, he was elected Professor of Chemistry              to the   Royal In
 stitution ; and he occupied that position for many years, in conjunc
 tion with Dr Faraday. He was elected an Ordinary Fellow of this
 Society in 1815, but made no contributions to our Transactions.
 In  1816 he began, in conjunction with Dr Faraday, to publish
 " The Journal of Science and the Arts, edited at the Royal Institu
 tion," which was continued in sixteen volumes till 1825, when he
 was appointed Superintendent          of the Die department in the Mint.
 In  1836 he was appointed          Fellow, and in 1846 Examiner in the
 London University.        In    1853 he received the honorary degree of
 D.C.L. from the University of Oxford. In 1823 he published his
 his " Manual of Pharmacy," and in 1842 his
                                                            "
                                                              Dictionary of Art
 and Science."
    He took an active interest in the establishment of the University
 of London, and was one of Ub Senate. Mr Brande was particu
 larly distinguished as an expositor of science, as is testified by the
 success of his
                   " Manual of Chemistry," which has passed
                                                                           through
 six editions,    and has been        translated    into the leading        foreign
      « Vol. x. p. 89.         t Vol. xi. p. 79.        I  Vol. xiii. p. 214.

languages.       He   was one    of the eminent galaxy of chemists that
has rendered the Royal Institution so illustrious. The successor
of Davy and colleague of Faraday could not have failed to have had
a marked influence on the progress          of chemistry   ; and though he has
 not left behind him many original memoirs, he has certainly done
much to diffuse a knowledge of that science, and to render its study
attractive by the clearness of his exposition         of its leading truths.

   I. Influence of Marriage on the Death-Rates of Men and
        Women in Scotland. By James Stark, M.D., &c.
    The object of this paper was to show the different death-rates
which prevailed among the married and unmarried men and women
in Scotland.
    It was   pointed out that the mortality among the unmarried men
was, at   all ages, very much higher than among the married       ; that,
in fact,  the mortality of the unmarried was thrice as high at the
age 20 to 25 years     ;  and only slowly approximated    to that of the
married man at 85 years of age.
    The difference in the death-rates of the married and unmarried
men was rendered       more striking by calculating their mean age at
death, when     it was found that from 20 years to the close of life
the   mean age at death of the married man was 59£ years, that of
the   unmarried man only 40 years — giving a difference in favour of
the   married man of 19£ years of life. When the mean age at
death was calculated from the 25th year, it was found to give a
mean age     of 60^sths years to the married, but only 47-^ths years to
the   unmarried, or a difference of 12J years in favour of married
life.

      It was pointed out that this appeared to be a special provision      of
  nature to protect the father of a family, so that he might provide
  for his offspring,    and superintend     their rearing  ; but that it was
  also capable of being      so far   explained by natural causes.      The
  married    man was in one sense a selected life      ; because the weak,
  the diseased, the intemperate,      and the licentious, did not marry     ;
 so   that all this unhealthy class of persons remained bachelors, and
  it was a known fact that their mortality was high.
     It  was then pointed    out that summarising the tables — that is,
 comparing the total deaths at all      ages with the total number living,
 led to a conclusion     the very opposite    of the truth, inasmuch as it
 seemed to prove that unmarried men had the healthiest lives, for
 it showed that in every 100,000 unmarried men only 1723 died
 annually, in a like number of married           men 2338 died    ; and the
 natural conclusion from such       a fact would be, that the death-rate of
 the unmarried was much lower than that of the married man.
     It  was explained how this paradoxical result was produced       ;  and
the     English Registrar-General's tables of the mortality of men
 following different occupations was referred to, showing the fallacy
 of summarising the facts in these tables, at the same time pointing
 out how the true comparative        healthiness of each occupation could
 be ascertained.
     The death-rates of the married and unmarried women were then
 explained.      It was shown that at each quinquennial age, from 15 to
 30 years, the death-rates of the married        women slightly exceeded
 that of the unmarried, being greatest at the junior age, but ap
 proximating and becoming identical at 30. From 30 to 40 years
 the mortality of the married women was slightly lower than that
 of the unmarried, but from 40 to 45 it was very slightly higher.
 From 45 years to the close of life, however, the death-rates of the
 married women were lower than those of the unmarried. The dif
 ference, however, was comparatively trifling        at every age, as com
 pared with the mortality of the married and unmarried men.
     It  was explained that these variations in the death-rates of the
 married and unmarried women were explicable.             The higher mor
 tality among the married under 30 years was caused by the addi
tional dangers which attended the birth of the first child, and just
in proportion     to the number of mothers who bore their first child

  was the    mortality at each quinquennial period of life. The slightly
  higher mortality, again, in the married between 40 and 45 years of
 age, at which time the change of life occurs among the women of
 Scotland, was attributed to their constitutions having been some
 what weakened by this childbearing, lactation, and the extra labours
 and   fatigues attending the rearing of their children.
2.    On the Physiological           Action of the Calabar Bean (Phy-
   sostigma venenosum, Balf.) By Thomas R. Fraser, M.D.
    Although many able observers have, within the last few years,
investigated the physiological action of the Calabar bean,            a  singular
amount       of discordance    has characterised  the results arrived at.     An
intention, in the first place, of adding proofs in confirmation of the
views advanced in an investigation published in 1862, has induced
the   author to reconsider the subject.         The result has been that the
actions of this substance have been found to be much more compli
cated than was at first supposed, and this may be understood when
 it is stated that it acts on the spinal cord and on the motor nerves,
 and also on the sympathetic system, and that, in this manner,                  it
 directly influences       nearly all the vital functions.      It  is not pro
 posed,     at this time, to examine what must      be regarded    as the most
 curious     action of Fhysostigma, that, namely, on the pupil, which
 results from its topical application to the eyeball or to the mucous
 membranes which are anatomically connected with it.              The theories
 of this action, though some of them have been advanced                  by men
 of such eminence         as Donders,  Graefe, Rosenthal and Bowman, are
 extremely       unsatisfactory.    It is hoped that a distinct conception
 of the general physiological effects        will suggest  a correct    explana
 tion of the myositic action, and there can be no doubt           it will assist
 in arriving at this conclusion.
     In   the following experiments,      an  extract prepared by acting on
 the    finely pulverised     kernel with boiling alcohol has been used.
 This preparation       contains a considerable proportion of fatty matter,
 which      prevents   its perfect solution in water; and, as the division
 into separate doses of a mere watery suspension would lead to many
 inaccuracies,     it was found necessary to weigh the requisite quantity

52                   Proceedings of the Boyal Society
of extract, separately, for each experiment. This extract is hygro
scopic, which further required that it should be dried and kept in
vacuo over sulphuric acid.           The greatest number of the experi
ments were made with the common              frog (Rana temporaria), birds,
and various mammals.            It was found that fatal results were pro
duced with the smallest          quantity on birds, and that the largest
doses,  in proportion to weight, were required by amphibia.            A dose
of one-sixteenth of       a grain proved rapidly fatal to  a pigeon, whereas
three grains have been recovered from by a frog — a quantity suffi
cient to produce death in a dog of average size.
   The immediate causes of death in birds and mammalia                   were
found to be syncope and asphyxia, or             a  combination of the two   ;
and a marked         connection   was observed between      the dose and its
rate of absorption,      and the preponderance       of one or other of these
effects.    In   frogs, the cardiac and respiratory functions were rapidly
affected, but complete        destruction  of all the vital functions of the
animal never occurred for many hours.              This slowness in the pro
gress of the effects from one system            to another,  constituted the
peculiar advantage         of employing this animal in the research, as,
thereby,    it was possible distinctly to determine the sequence of the
phenomena.          In animals of a higher type, the implication of one
system so rapidly influences the others, that symptoms            follow each
other with such speed        as to increase  very greatly the difficulties of
a clear apprehension.
   The following are the conclusions of the investigation.
                         A. Action through    the  Blood.
   1.  Physostigma proved fatal to every animal hitherto examined,
with the single exception of the Esfire" moth. Death is most rapidly
caused    in birds and mammals by the injection of the poison into
the circulation, or when it is brought in contact with a wounded
surface.      It   follows nearly   as  quickly when Calabar bean is in
troduced     into a serous cavity, and much less rapidly when intro
duced    by the mucous         membrane     of the digestive    system.    In
rabbits,   death has been caused by its application to the Schnei-
derian,    auditory, and conjunctival mucous membranes.              The skin
of frogs resists its effects for a long time, but, if applied for a suffi
cient period and with proper precautions, distinct evidence of its

                      of Edinburgh,       Session 1866-67.                   53
absorption      may be obtained, though         death has never been     caused
by such application.
    2. The contact of the extract of Calabar            bean with the gastric
juice of    a dog   for twenty-four hours, at a temperature a little above
95°    F., did not, in the slightest degree, modify its energy.
    3.  A   large dose, injected       into the abdominal     cavity of  a frog,
affects nearly simultaneously           the heart and spinal cord,*    and very
rapidly destroys the vitality of both organs. With such a dose, the
motor nerves are unaffected, and retain their conductivity for at
least thirty hours.        Evidence of the activity of the afferent nerves
may be obtained         so long   as the retained   vitality of the spinal cord
permits of its diastaltic function being examined.
     4. An average dose, in the first place, impairs the function of the
spinal cord and diminishes the rate of the cardiac contractions and
of the respiratory movements, and, soon after, these latter cease.
 In periods varying from one and a-half to four hours afterwards,
 the   motor nerves are paralysed, this paralysis first implicating the
 endorgans       of these nerves, and afterwards the nerve trunks.
 From this it must not be inferred that the nerve is paralysed by a
 centripetal     progression of the poison, the only fact which was de
 monstrated       being that a direct      ratio existed between subdivision
 of nerve substance and facility of contact of poison, on the one
 hand, and, on the other, rapidity of paralysing effect. Indeed,
 division of the nerve trunk, previous to the administration of
  Calabar bean, delayed the paralysis of its endorgans.            The afferent
  nerves retain their activity so long, at -least, as the functions of the
  spinal cord    are not lost, and    this generally happens about the same
  time as the motor paralysis.
     5. When       a small   but still fatal dose of Calabar       bean is ad
  ministered to a frog, the effects are the same as those in the previous
  conclusion, until they arrive at the stage of paralysis of the motor
  nerves, and, after this, an interval of several hours may elapse
  before the functions       of the spinal cord     are completely   suspended.
  During this interval the tactile sensibility of the afferent nerves is
  increased ; so that, if the ischiadic artery and vein of one limb were
  tied before the exhibition of the poison, an ordinary excitant, such
     * The  effects on the spinal cord were determined by frequent measurements
  of the reflex activity by means of the Metronome.

54                Proceedings of the Royal Society
as  sulphuric acid, will show everywhere a marked diminution, as
measured by the metronome, in the diastaltic activity; while a
slight touch of the skin in the poisoned region, which before the
administration of the poison caused no effect, will now produce
faint twitches of the limb whose vessels are tied.
   6. A frog  may have its cardiac contractions reduced from seventy
to eight  or ten   per  minute,  its respiratory movements        completely
stopped,  and  the endorgans  of its motor     nerves  paralysed,   by a  still
smaller dose, and afterwards    completely recover.      This has occurred
when two grains were injected into the abdominal            cavity of a frog
weighing seven hundred and thirty grains.
   7. In  frogs, the voluntary muscles are unaffected by the poison,
and may continue to respond to galvanic stimulation during three
or four days after its administration. The contrast and indepen
dence in the effects of Calabar bean on the motor nerves and on
the muscles    may be well shown by ligaturing the ischiadic vessels
of one limb before injecting the poison.           If, when strong stimu
lation causes no reflex movement,         the two gastrocnemii muscles
with their attached nerves are        so placed  that an interrupted cur
rent, from one Daniell's     cell and Du Bois Reymond's induction
apparatus, may be transmitted simultaneously, either through both
muscles, or both nerve-trunks,      it will  be found,   in the  case  of the
muscles, that when the secondary coil is slowly advanced, contrac
tions will occur with the same current in both muscles, or with a
weaker current in the case of the poisoned than of the non -poisoned
muscle,   this varying with the length of time which has elapsed
since the limb was deprived      of blood    ; when the current is trans
mitted   through both nerves, contractions will be simultaneously
produced, or with a weaker current       in the non-poisoned, or contrac
tions will occur in the non-poisoned       muscle only, this varying with
the length   of time which has elapsed since the exhibition of the
poison.
   8. In  mammals and in birds the voluntary muscles are affected
in a very remarkable     manner.     At  an early stage    of the poisoning
faint twitches occur, which gradually extend over the body, and,
at the same time, increase in vigour, so as to interfere with the
respiratory movements.       Shortly before death, they again become
mere successive     twitches, often requiring the hand to be placed

                    of Edinburgh,      Session 1866-67.                      55
  over the part in order to distinguish their existence.           After death,
  if a muscular surface     be exposed, these       twitches will be observed
  to  rarely involve the whole of one muscle, but at different times
  different   muscular fasciculi  ;   and they may persist for more than
 thirty minutes after death.         They    are caused by a    direct effect of
 Calabar bean on the muscular substance.               This is shown by their
 occurring in muscles after paralysis of the motor nerves, by their per
 sisting in a muscle cut out of the body, and by their non-occurrence
 in parts which have been separated by ligature from the circulation.
     9.  The heart's action is rapidly slowered and then stopped, in
birds and mammals, by a large dose.              In dogs it may diminish to
one-half in three minutes and         cease  in ten.     A large dose injected
into the abdominal cavity of       a  frog causes rapid and complete para
lysis.     A  smaller dose causes either a gradual cessation and then
a   renewal at   a diminished rate, or    a gradual slowering from sixty or
seventy to four or six beats per minute, followed by a gradual acceler
ation to a diminished rate varying from eight to twenty per minute.
At this stage, and for many hours afterwards,                the only signs of
vitality are the diminished cardiac           action   and the power of the
voluntary muscles to respond to galvanic and other stimulation.
In the frog, where alone this diminution without stoppage, suc
ceeded by partial acceleration,         has been observed, the heart may
continue     so to contract for three, and for even five days, provided
the temperature      of the apartment      be as  low  as 50°  F.   After stop
page, galvanic stimulation       may cause a renewal          of its rythmical
contraction; but this is usually lost, and unrythmical              and partial
contractions can be only excited.           The heart    ceases to contract   in
diastole with all its chambers       full.
     10.  The pneumogastric     nerves retain their inhibitory        power on
the heart during the whole time from the diminution to the partial
recovery    of its action.  Soon after this, however, they are paralysed        ;
and this occurs at nearly the same time as the affection                 of the
motor nerves.
     11. Division of the pneumogastric         nerves, or destruction    of the
medulla oblongata       and medulla spinalis, does not protect the heart
from the action     of Physostigma.
     12.  The lymphatic hearts of frogs poisoned by Calabar bean soon
cease to contract.

  56                 Proceedings     of the Royal Society
     13.  A   large dose paralyses     the cervical sympathetic nerves in
 rabbits   before    the death    of the animal.       A smaller fatal       dose
 diminishes, without destroying, their activity.
     14. Before the stoppage of the heart, proofs          may be obtained     of
 the   vitality of its sympathetic ganglia, and,        as striped     muscle is
 not affected by Calabar bean conveyed by the blood, we are obliged
 to infer that the cardiac      sympathetic system may be destroyed by
 a large dose, and its activity lessened by a smaller one.
     15.  The animal temperature,        both   external and internal, has
 been invariably observed to rise           in rabbits  and dogs, but only
 slightly.
     16. The condition of the capillary circulation was examined               in
 the web of the frog.         Soon after the exhibition of the poison, the
 smaller arteries and veins contracted slightly; after a short interval,
 this contraction was succeeded by        a rapid and permanent       dilatation,
 in which the calibre of the vessels was considerably above their
 maximum previous to the poisoning. This dilatation of the capil
 laries appears to occur universally over the body, as is shown             by a
peculiar blue coloration of the voluntary muscles and of the heart,
a similar coloration of the serous and fibro-serous             tissues, and a
congestion      of the blood-vessels in the conjunctiva and iris.          These
changes      occur,    also,  in a less    marked    manner,     in birds and
mammals.
    17. The general results of experiments         in which the arterial and
venous tensions were examined were, that almost immediately after
the administration of Calabar bean the arterial tension rose slightly,
attained its maximum when the number of cardiac contractions                 had
diminished to at least one-half, and then rapidly fell              ;  and that
the venous tension        rose less quickly, attained    its maximum when
the arterial tension had diminished considerably,            and, in its turn,
fell, though more gradually than that of the arterial system. The
number of the cardiac contractions, when the venous tension had
attained    its maximum, was about one-third of the average before
the poisoning;        the respirations    were rather less frequent than
before, and the temperature        had risen a few tenths of a degree.
    18. Physostigma causes extreme diffusion in the pigment cells
of the frog's skin, and so a very marked change occurs in the colour
of the animal during the progress of the symptoms.

                     of Edinburgh, Session 1866-67.                       57
     19.   The peristaltic action of the intestines is usually destroyed at
death    ;  it may, however, continue a short time afterwards.
    20.    The pupil contracts in all cases of rapid poisoning in mam
 malia and in birds.       When the dose is small, in place of contrac
tion, dilatation is sometimes observed       ; but this is extremely rare.
In frogs the pupil has been generally observed to contract, but no
connection could be determined between the dose and this symptom.
    21. Calabar bean acts as an excitant of the secretory system,
increasing the action of the alimentary mucous, of the lachrymal,
and   of the salivary glands.
    22. The symptoms of poisoning are not materially altered, in the
frog, by the removal of the brain or by division of the cervical por
tion of the spinal cord.
    23. Artificial respiration does not prevent death in mammals
after the exhibition of a poisonous dose. This is a necessary result
of the effects of Physostigma on both the cerebro-spinal and sym
pathetic systems.
    24. Congestion of internal organs        occasionally occurs, but this
is by no means an invariable consequence of a fatal dose.
    25.    The blood is dark after death, but becomes arterialised on
exposure to the air; it usually clots loosely and imperfectly; and,
when examined with the spectroscope, the bands of scarlet crurine
are   found unchanged.        A microscopic examination       demonstrates,
in the rabbit and dog, an invariable change            in the coloured cor
puscles, which have their outlines distinctly crenated.         This change
 is  not observed in the blood of birds or amphibia.         The white cor
puscles remain unaltered.
                               B. Topical Effects.
     1.  When applied to the surface of the brain of        a frog, no effect
 was produced     ; but when the poison was brought in contact with
 the spinal cord, a few twitches occurred in the extremities, followed
 by paralysis    of the portion of cord acted on.
     2.  When Calabar bean is applied to a mixed nerve, in         a concen
  trated form    and with proper precautions     to prevent absorption,   the
  afferent nerve-fibres are first paralysed, and afterwards the efferent.
  This is readily demonstrated      by acting on the sciatic nerve of the
  frog and, after some time, administering a small dose of strychnia.

 58                  Proceedings of the Royal Society
    3.   Topical application destroys the contractility of striped and
of unstriped muscular fibre.              The heart's action is stopped by
repeated application to the pericardium            or to its external surface.
If a sufficient quantity       be injected into one of its chambers, para
 lysis nearly immediately follows.
    4.   The effects of the application of Calabar           bean to the eyeball
are a somewhat painful sensation            of tension   in the ciliary region,

3.    On some Phenomena             of Indistinct Vision.           By Edward
                                    Sang, Esq.
    If   an exceedingly small luminous object            be placed    in front of
the eye, but out of the range of distinct vision,              it appears to  be a
roundish bright disc traversed by various              markings, and most of
these markings are found to be permanent                 for the same eye, but
different for the two eyes.          The subject of the present paper is            a
modification of this appearance.
    Instead of a luminous point let us take           a very narrow     luminous
line, such    as a  small slit in the window-shutter, or the reflection of
the    light of  a fire from a polished      metallic rod, and let us put this
out of focus by means of a pair of convex spectacles.                 On regard
ing    the  luminous line, without any attempt to adjust the eye to
distinct vision,      we   perceive   a long luminous band, the breadth           of
which varies with the distance             of the line.    When the luminous
line is brought into focus, the apparent breadth becomes zero                  ;   it
increases     as the    line is moved beyond or within the distance              for
distinct vision.
    If,   having removed the shining line to           a considerable    distance,
so as to obtain       a  pretty broad band, we take        a  thin ring, such     as
that used for keys, in the hand, and pass it close to the eye so as
to intercept part of the light, we shall perceive that the bright
band is traversed for its whole length by a dark line, and that this
line moves across it in the direction of the motion of the ring.
    On removing the ring to a        little distance, the black line produced
by   it is seen to   be curved    in the same direction with the curvature

                   of Edinburgh,      Session 1866-67.                     59
of the ring; and    an attentive   examination shows that its curvature
is much less than that belonging        to the projection      of the ring to
the same distance.        As the curved wire is farther removed, the
appearance of the dark line becomes that of an elliptic arc taken
from near the end of its shorter axis ; and when the ring is taken
to the distance    proper for distinct vision, the dark band becomes
circular, becomes, in fact, the true image of the ring itself.
   If we  continue to remove the ring to a greater distance from the
eye, the curvature     of the dark band is increased, and presents the
appearance of a portion of an ellipse taken from near the end of
the major axis.     Its motion across the luminous band is evidently
greater than that due to the movement of the ring.
   Let us now bring the luminous slit within the distance for dis
tinct vision, or, better, let us remove the optical focus to beyond
the luminous slit, by wearing a pair of deep concave glasses, and
we shall find that the motion of the dark line is opposite in direc
tion to that of the ring, and that the curvature          is also turned  the
other way.
   It was this reversion which drew my attention to the phenomena             ;
and, not recollecting of having seen       it noticed,  I  thought   it worth
 while to bring  it before the Royal Society.
4.  Note on Determinants of the Third Order.                  By Professor
                                    Tait.
   Hamilton long ago showed that        if we have
                            o = ix + jy +        kz,
                            y =   *«s + jys +    Az2.
then
                   S   . a8y = —           *   y     «

                                           X2  ?2    S
   This opens up      an   exceedingly   simple    quaternion    path to the
 proof of various     properties   of determinants     of the third order.
 Several of those   I   subjoin  have long been known, some, however,

tJO                   Proceedings          of the Royal            Society
 appear to be new, and our methods                           indicate     how    to obtain    an
 unlimited number           of new ones;             but      all  are proved much          more
 simply than by the usual processes.
    (1.) We have at once, by quaternions,

 In its algebraic form this is

This is the well-known property of the Reciproeal, or determinant
formed from the minors of the original determinant.
   (3.) Since we have
                               1 y  z        +   j    \   z   X   l+k         * y

(whose application        to (2) is obvious), we may also write
                       YaB =              t           *

   (4.)   But,  if we put
                                A =          x y       z
                                             xi yi      \

which         is easily seen to agree with (3).                         From this many well-known
theorems may be deduced at once.

      (6.) Similarly,                 if   we put

we have

    Such theorems                         may be multiplied                 indefinitely;         but we    have
already         reached               a    stage          in which the algebraic                  form   is very
unwieldy.

   The Hon. Lord         NEAVES,       Vice-President,    in the Chair.
    Dr Hughes Bennett, at the request of the Council, performed
 several experiments with a view of showing how, in modern times,
 physiology was successfully investigated by means of newly in
 vented instruments.       He noticed especially the subject of animal
 electricity, stating, that a specimen of the Melapterurus beninensis
 which had been forwarded to him from Old Calabar in Africa, had
 been preserved for eighteen months in one of the hot-houses of the
 Botanic Garden      of this city.    Unfortunately,   it died only that
 afternoon.    He regretted that the arrangements he had made for
 showing the electrical currents in muscles and nerves had failed, in
 consequence    of the injury which had been inflicted on two of the
 delicate galvanometers, recently invented by Sir W. Thomson, in
their transit from the University to the Society's Rooms.         He pro
ceeded, however, to show the influence of continued and interrupted
streams of electricity, on muscles and nerves.       The law of contrac
tion in muscles, as determined by Pfluger, was clearly demonstrated,
and the variations    in the influence of the continued stream, accord
ing to its amount       and direction, were  fully exhibited.   The phe
nomena of electrotouus       and the excitability of nerves were next
illustrated by experiments.       He then explained and performed the
experiment     of Helmholz, demonstrating how the time which the
nervous influence    occupied  in traversing  a  given distance of nerve
might be determined with exactitude, and noticed the more recent
experiments    of Schelzke, and De Jaeger,       as to the  rapidity with
which volition and sensation were produced.           Lastly, he alluded
to the action of recently invented       Sphygmographs,     Cardiographs,
and the Kymographion, dwelling more particularly on the Sphyg-
mosphone.      This instrument enabled the time and rapidity of the
pulse and movements of the heart to be accurately determined by
the ear, in consequence of an arrangement which caused each
pulsation   to break a continued electrical circuit, that in its turn
communicated      a movement    to levers which struck bells.    The two

 64                Proceedings of the Royal Society
 halves of this Sphygmosphone     might be removed to any distance,    so
 that  if connected with a telegraphic wire, the rhythm of the pulse
 of an individual in London might be made audible in Edinburgh.

     1.   On the Colours of the Soap-Bubble.          By Sir David
                        Brewster, K.H., F.R.S.
   The colours of the soap-bubble have been the subject of frequent
observation since the time of Boyle, Hook, and Newton, and they
have been invariably ascribed " not to any colour in the medium
itself in which they are formed, or on whose surfaces they appear,
but solely to its greater or less thickness." The author of this
paper had been led to doubt the correctness of this opinion, and
while repeating     the beautiful   experiments   of Professor Plateau
" On the
             equilibrium of liquid films," he was led to discover the
true cause of these colours, whether they are observed on the soap-
bubble or on plane, convex, and concave films stretched across the

   The paper, which is illustrated with numerous         coloured draw
ings, is divided into five parts.
   1. On the phenomena      of colour in a vertical plane film.
   2. On the    production of revolving systems of coloured rings on
the soap film.
   3. On the form and movements of the bands and rings on convex
and concave films.
   4.   On the phenomena produced by different solutions.
   5. On the    origin and development      of the colours on the soap-
bubble.
   In   these sections the author has shown that the colouring matter
of the soap-bubble is secreted from the soap solution when reduced
to the state of a film ; —that it rises to the highest point of the film
in colourless portions, in the form of a tadpole, which pass into
molecules    of every possible order of colour,    and then take their

systems       of coloured rings, the one revolving from right to left,
and the other from left to right; and that under the influence
of the centrifugal force,          these molecules       are carried    into their
place     in Newton's scale— those of the first orders going to the
centre of the rings, and followed by those of higher orders that
happen to be in the film when            it is blown upon through         a tube in
the direction      of a diameter.
    "  It  is impossible," the author adds,         " to convey in language an
adequate idea of the molecular movements,                 and the brilliant chro

impossible for art to delineate them.                The visible secretion of a

inch    in thickness,— its separation into portions of every possible
colour, — the quick passage of these portions into bands of the differ
ent orders in Newton's scale, — their ever varying forms and hues
when the bands either break               up spontaneously,       or are   forcibly
broken      up, — their   conversion    into revolving systems of coloured
rings under the influence            of  a  centrifugal force, — their various
motions when the          film   is at rest, and protected       from aerial cur
rents, — their recombination into           a colourless   fluid when driven to
the centre or margin of concave              and convex      films, and their re-
absorption      by the film by means of mechanical diffusion, are facts
constituting      a system     of visible molecular       actions,  of which we
have no example, and nothing even approaching to it in Physics."
2.   On the Musculus Sternatis.                By William Turner, M.B.,
                         Demonstrator of Anatomy.
    In this paper the author described the results of his observations
on the presence       of the musculus       sternalis in upwards of six hun
 dred bodies dissected in the anatomical            rooms of the University of
 Edinburgh.        He had found it in nineteen individuals, i.e., in about
 3 per cent- of the bodies examined.             It  occurred nearly equally in
 the two sexes.       It  bore no relation     to the general muscularity of
 the  individual.      In  eleven subjects the muscle was single, in eight
    vol vi.                                                           i

The variations which it exhibited in its attachments,                             size,     and
shape, were then described.                  In   no case were its fibres continuous
with those of the rectus abdominis, or were tendinous intersections
found in    but it,mostly arose either from the flattened tendon of
                         it
the external oblique muscle of the abdomen, or from the cartilages
of the lower true ribs, and in many instances                      it    was continuous at
its upper end with the sternal tendon of one or both sterno-mastoids,
whilst in others    was inserted into the aponeurosis covering the
                            it
pectoralis       major.          It   was always    superficial to the great pectoral
muscle.  Of the single specimens, four occurred on the right side,
two on the left whilst in the remaining five
                        ;                      arose on one side ofit
the middle line, and was inserted                    either altogether or in part on
the opposite side.               It   formed an excellent illustration of the truth
of the general statement, that occasional and rudimentary struc
tures are especially liable to variations in arrangement.
     A   sketch       of the history of the muscle,                from the first obser
vation by Cabrolius in 1604, was then given,                              and the      various
opinions        as to   its morphology were discussed.              In    opposition    to the
view usually entertained by anatomists, the author contended that
it   was not an upward extension                  of the rectus abdominis, such as is
so   frequently seen in the mammalia,                  so   that the name rectus ster-

For   itwas not continuous with the rectus, and was placed super
ficial to the pectoralis, whilst the anterior end of the mammalian
rectus     always continuous with its abdominal part, and, moreover,
           is
concealed        by the pectoral           muscle;     and further, another            muscle
has occasionally been seen   in man which, differing in its position
from the sternalis, lying under cover of the great pectoral muscle
next the ribs,          is   undoubtedly to        be regarded      as homologous           with
the anterior end            of the mammalian rectus.
     The sternalis muscle, from many of its relations, seems to be most
closely allied to the panniculus                  earnosus,    or great skin muscle           of
the quadruped, and may perhaps be regarded as an additional rudi
ment of that muscle, occasionally                   present in man, though
                                                                   must                it

       3. On     Compensation Pendulums of two Pieces.                     By
                                Edward Sang, Esq.
     Three or four years ago, wishing to make some experiments on
  time-keepers,      and    desiring for that purpose to have a compensa
 tion pendulum fitted to my clock,             I  turned my attention to pen
 dulums composed           of two pieces, having different rates of expan
 sion.
     Such compensation           pendulums are now pretty common             ;    the
 idea which has led to           their construction being this, — that if         the
 pendulum       rod be made of material having a very small rate of
expansion,      and   if  the bob or weight be of a substance          much    more
expansive,      then the upward expansion           of the one may be made to
compensate for the downward              expansion      of the other, and so the
going of the clock may remain unaffected by changes of tempera
ture.
    On designing the arrangement,             and on proceeding      to make the
calculation, according to the received expansions of deal and lead,
I   was much surprised to find the solution of the resulting equation
to be impossible         ;  and the surprise was the greater,      because   I had
understood       that of clocks      constructed     with such   pendulums,       the
compensation          had     been verified   by actual    observations.    There
is not sufficient disparity between the expansibilities               of deal and
lead.
                                                                            Fig     L
    A very slight      glance at the subject is sufficient to show,             .
that   if it be impossible to construct        such a pendulum with
a deal rod of great tenuity, and with an enclosing cylinder
of lead also of inappreciable            diameter,     it must be im
possible     to make one with the parts             having appreciable
diameters     ;  since the lateral expansion         of the parts tends
to    augment       the     length of     the    corresponding simple
pendulum.
    Let us then suppose an exceedingly thin rod AB, of some
slightly expansive substance, suspended by the end A, and
having on the lower end B             a small projection or seat, on         Bll
which the end of            a  cylinder BC of heavy and expansive           metal
rests.    Then neglecting the weight of the inner rod, and the radius

and therefore, in order that there be no change in the value of                                                               b,

y   exceed the double of                    /J,     all the terms of this equation have the
same sign, and therefore there can be no positive root                                                    ;       so that, on
this        account, there can be no such pendulum                                            as we are             thinking
of, unless the one rate of expansion                                         be more than                 double of the

pansions of any two available solid substances.               Thus we conclude
that pendulums        constructed     of two pieces after the manner shown
in figure 1, cannot be compensated.
    The equation      of condition (3) being of an odd degree, must
have always one root possible.              It is true that this is merely a
numerical     possibility, which may or may not be represented by a
mechanical arrangement; yet it may be worth while to examine
into it.     Now, when n is positive, the equation (3), must have one
of its roots negative, and thus the point B, corresponding to that
root, must be the above point of suspension.

we   obtain the diagram given in figure          3.
    In this   figure, the distances      measured along the
 horizontal line OS indicate the ratio of the expan

 1.   On the     Tertiary Volcanic Rocks of the British Islands.
                   By Archibald Geikie, Esq., F.R.S.
    This paper was in continuation of the series of memoirs on the
 volcanic rocks    of Scotland previously read by the author before the
 Society,* and contained the first portion of the results           of   a survey
    * See Proceedings,  iv. 309. 453, 582, and Transactions,  vol. xxii. 633.

72                 Proceedings of the Royal Society
of the western region, extending from the south of Antrim to the
north of Syke.      The districts more especially dwelt upon were the
islands of Mull, Eigg, and Staffa.         After alluding to the writings
of previous geologists upon these tracts, more particularly to the
discovery by the Duke of Argyll of tertiary leaves under basalt at
Ardtun Head, in Mull, the author remarked             that up to this time
the great mass of volcanic rocks in the Western Islands has been
usually regarded     as of Oolitic age — an opinion in which he himself
had shared.      His object in the present communication was to show
that   as regards Mull and the adjoining islets this opinion was
erroneous,    that the enormous        volcanic accumulations of these
islands belonged in reality to the Miocene period, and that, in all
likelihood, the long chain of basaltic masses, extending from the
north of Ireland along the west coast of Scotland             to the Faroe
Islands, and beyond these to Iceland, was all erupted during the
same wide interval in the Tertiary periods.
    The nature of the volcanic products was first sketched.          It was
shown that the two great classes of recent lavas — the basaltic and
the trachytic — were well represented        among the Western Islands,
and that the basaltic       series was on the whole the older, since     it
was found to pass under massive sheets of pale grey and blue clay-
stones,   clinkstones,    and   porphyries belonging to the trachytic
group.    In addition    to these lava-form   rocks, masses of coarse vol
canic agglomerate occurred, along with beds of tuff and peperino.
   The manner in which these various volcanic rocks occur in Mull
and   Eigg was next described.        It was shown    that the leaf-beds of
Ardtun, which     are  known by their fossil contents     to be of Miocene
age, lie near the bottom         of the whole    volcanic series, and that
above them comes a series of trap-beds between 3000 and 4000 feet
in thickness.     Throughout this enormous mass of bedded igneous
rock layers of ash, often abounding in chalk-flints, are interstrati-
fied, and in one part of the cliffs of Inimore of Carsaig a bed of
flints twenty-five feet thick lies between the dolerites.       Thin lenti
cular seams or nests of coal likewise occur, but these only occupy
small pond-like hollows of the original surface of the trap beds,
and are overlaid directly with trap.        They are sometimes excellent
in quality,    and occasionally three       feet in  thickness  ; but they
rapidly die out in every direction.         There is thus no probability

                     of Edinburgh, Session 1866-67.                    73
 that the tertiary coal    of the Western Islands will ever come to be
 of commercial importance.
     Proofs of the long continuance of volcanic action among these
 islands are afforded by the great thickness    of the successive sheets
of igneous matter, which in one mountain alone — Ben More — reach
 a depth of 3185 feet without revealing either the actual      bottom or
top of the series.      Another and striking piece of evidence on this
subject    is given by the well-known Scuir of Eigg. That island
consists   of nearly horizontal sheets of dolerite, like those of Mull,
resting unconformably upon oolitic rocks.          After their eruption,
they must have been long exposed to the wasting agencies of the
atmosphere.       A valley was cut out of them, and its bottom was
watered     by a river, which brought down coarse shingle and sand
from the distant Cambrian mountains of the north-west.             These
changes      must   have demanded     a lengthened   lapse of time,   yet
they took place during an interval in the volcanic history of the
island.     The igneous forces which had been long dormant          broke
out anew, and poured several successive coulies of vitreous lava
down the river-bed. In this way the channel of the stream came
to be sealed up. But the same powers of waste which had scooped
out that channel continued their operation.         The hills which had
bounded       the valley crumbled    away,  and  the  lava-currents that
filled the river-bed being much harder than the surrounding rocks,
were enabled      in great measure to resist the degradation.     Hence
the singular result now appears that the former hills have been
levelled down into slopes and valleys,        while the ancient valley
occupies     the highest ground in the neighbourhood, and its lava-
current stands up     as the well-known precipitous ridge of the Scuir
of Eigg.       The gravel and drift-wood of the old river are still to be
seen under the rock of the Scuir.
    The author then proceeded to point out the possible connection
between these tertiary volcanic rocks and the metamorphism             of
different parts of the West Highlands.             He showed that in
Mull, under Ben More, the volcanic rocks themselves give signs of
having been subjected to a process of metamorphism, and that they
are associated there with masses of syenite, like those of Raasay
and Skye.        Macculloch pointed   out that the syenite   of the two
latter islands was later than the secondary rocks of that district       ;

     The acicular crystals dissolve readily and completely in ether and
 in alcohol; these solutions also rapidly decompose, chloride of
 ammonium being deposited, and the viscous substance above men

     It would be premature to speculate on the nature of these sub
 stances without quantitative analyses;         I hope before long to be
 able to lay these before the Society.
 3.   On the Figures        of Equilibrium of Liquid Films.            By
                    Sir David Brewster, K.H., F.R.S.
     In repeating     some  of the experiments      of Professor Plateau,
 described in seven interesting memoirs
                                                             "
                                                published in The Trans
 actions of the Belgian Academy," and in prosecuting his own expe
riments on the colours of the soap-bubble, the author of this paper
observed     several   new phenomena      which may have      escaped  the
notice of the Belgian philosopher.
    Professor Plateau has described and drawn the beautiful systems
of soap-films, obtained by lifting from a soap solution a cube made
of wires about one and a half inch long.            This system is a poly
hedron, composed       of twelve similar films stretching from the wires,
and united to a plane quadrangular film in the centre.          When this
vertical film was blown upon, M. Von Rees observed that it was
reduced to a line, and then reproduced in a horizontal position,
from which      it could be blown again   into a vertical position.
    If  we suppose the quadrangular film removed, and all the twelve
films radiating from the centre of the cube, Professor Plateau found
that such a system could not be kept in equilibrium, unless there
was something solid in the central point, such as the end        of a wire
or a drop of fluid.
    In  repeating these experiments     the author found that, after con
verting the horizontal into the vertical quadrangular film, and con
tinuing the blowing, he produced the radial system of films, which
in an instant returned to the system with a vertical film, and then
into the system with the horizontal film.
    M. Von Rees had found that, by immersing the wire cube with

                        of Edinburgh,           Session 1866-67.                                  77
the normal polyhedron a few millimetres in the soap solution, the
film formed on its lower face imprisoned                         the air in the quadran
gular pyramid above           it,   and that this air rose to the centre of the
cube, and replaced the quadrangular plane with                         a   hollow cube with
curved faces.
     In this beautiful experiment                   the    hollow cube       is   invariable in
size, being necessarily           equal in its contents               to one-fourth part of
the wire cube.            The author of the present paper discovered                                a
method         of inserting   a   hollow cube of any magnitude in the centre
of the polyhedron.            This was done by blowing                 a   bubble of the re
quisite size, and introducing                  it   within      the wire cube.          He suc
ceeded also by this means in inserting                     a   second hollow cube beside
the first, the side common to both being plane when the two cubes
were equal, convex when the one was less, and concave when                                   it   was
greater        than the other.          In     such    a   system, which          is   in perfect
equilibrium, the number of films                    is    nineteen.    He found also that
two hollow solid figures could, by the same means, be inserted in
the other systems of films which Professor Plateau had discovered
in   a   wire tetrahedron, or       a   quadrangular pyramid, or             a    regular octo-
hedron, or       a   rectangular prism, or in              a   system obtained from two
rectangular planes fixed at right angles to each other.
     This last and interesting system consists of four curved films
extending from each vertical wire, and connected with an elliptical
film in the common section of the rectangles.     The major axis of
this film   four times greater than its minor axis, and
                is                                          placed                 it   is
in the angle, which           is
                              a         little greater         than   90°,   but sometimes
also   in the other angle.
     By making this system of wires movable, so that the rectan
gular planes can pass from 90° to 180°, the author obtained                                   some
singular results.         As the angle increased from 90°, the minor axis
of the elliptical film increased,               till   when     it   approached to 180°            it
was      nearly circular, appropriating gradually the fluid of the four
curved films attached to the wires.
     By again diminishing this angle the almost circular film became
more and more elliptical,               till   it   reached its normal state at 90°,
giving back to the curved films the fluid which formed them.                                       If
the angle        of the rectangular plane which contain                           the elliptical
film     is   diminished, the film will grow more elliptical, and at                              45°

78                         Proceedings of the Royal Society
will become            a   straight line, giving up its fluid to the other four
films.      At this instant               the whole system changes, the oval film
being reproduced in the angle of 135°                       !
     Remarkable            as    this phenomenon            is,    there    is   one      still more
remarkable,            which requires        the testimony of the eye to make                          it
credible.         If   when the rectangles             are inclined 90° we blow upon
the elliptical film,            a   bubble of such      a   size as to replace the system
of films with          a   hollow curvilineal cube, and wait                  till   it   bursts,     the
system    of   liquid films which           it   expelled   will reappear, as         if  it    had left
its yhost behind           it   to recover the elements which the bubble had appro
priated   !
   By uniting the upper and lower ends of all the wires in this
system, and also by uniting the wires at various points in their
length, the author obtained                  a    number          of beautiful and complex
systems of films, which require                     numerous        diagrams to make them
intelligible.
     After treating of the equilibrium of liquid films,                              as seen       in the
union of spherical bubbles                   and      other hollow solids, the author
considers the formation of plane, convex, and concave                                     films upon
the mouths of open and closed vessels of different shapes, and their
deposition         on the         same vessels from             bubbles; and he describes
various     remarkable       of the films, upwards and down
                                  movements
wards, when they are formed upon conical vessels open at both
ends.
4. On     a       Method of ascertaining the                          Specific Gravity of
  Water which holds     minute quantity of Foreign Matter
                                       a
  in Solution or, on the Specific Gravity of Impure Water.
                           ;
     By Edward Sang, Esq.
     The determination of the degree of impurity of spring or well
water     is   every day becoming                of more and more importance.                         In
order to discover how much foreign matter                           is   contained     in   a   sample
of water, the chemist                is   under the necessity of drying up                     a   quan
tity of     it,   and of weighing the residue.                     This operation         is   tedious,
and gives      a   trust-worthy result only when the evaporation has been
carried on in closed vessels from which atmospheric                              impurities have

                             of Edinburgh, Session 1866-67.                                           79
been       carefully excluded           ;       and, therefore, any assistance which can
be obtained           from mechanical                measurements              must be acceptable as
affording          a test   for confirmation of the results.
  If       we attempt to find the specific                         gravity of any potable water
by means            of the balance, we encounter very great obstacles                            ;   the
extreme delicacy of the weighing, and the uncertainty introduced
by changes            of temperature               during the process, render the direct
method almost               valueless       ;   since both the expansion of the water
and that of the glass vessel in which                               it is contained would need
to be allowed for.  But, by taking advantage of the peculiarity of
water in regard to changes of temperature, we can obtain an ex
tremely sensitive indicator of changes in its composition.
  Let us prepare a glass ball, adjusted in its specific gravity so
that it will just float in pure water between the temperature of
melting ice and               5   degrees          of the centigrade               thermometer       (be
tween             32° and    42° of Fahrenheit's),                    and       placing a delicately
graduated thermometer                   along with it in              a   jar of cold water, let the
whole be allowed slowly to become warmer.                                       The effect of an in
crease of temperature               at first is to produce                      a contraction    in the
water, and at the same time a slight expansion                                    in the glass of the
ball   ;   and the result is that, when                          the temperature       becomes such
that the two specific gravities are alike, the ball begins to float
upwards.             By placing the ball of the thermometer                             at some dis
tance from the bottom               of the vessel,                 we can note the temperature
at the instant when the ball passes                              it ; let this temperature be tv
  As the water continues to grow warmer its density augments,
but more and more slowly, until it reach its maximum ; after this
the water begins              to expand, and eventually the glass ball, which
had risen to the top, begins to descend.    we note the tempera           If
ture    at which the ball again passes the thermometer bulb, we

                                                closed in         a   thermometer           tube
                                                made of the same kind of glass.
                                                The distance            E   A, or     F  B     be
tween the tangent and the chord             is,     according         to the well-known
properties of the parabola, proportional                 to the square of the inter
cepted absciss Dts, or to that of its double                 t,.
  Hence the square of the observed interval                   (,   t,   between the two
temperatures at which the ball passes the thermometer                            bulb, when
multiplied by some constant number to be determined by means of
the known formula for the expansion of water, will give the dif
ference between the glass and the water, when each                          is   of the tem
perature half-way between    tf,   and    ia.
  If   now we mix in the water some soluble                       salt, so as to change
slightly its specific gravity, without perceptibly altering the law of
its expansion, we shall thereby augment the interval between the
temperatures     at which the ball passes the thermometer                         ;    and the

                    of Edinburgh, Session 1866-67.                           81
 difference between the squares of the interval in the one case and
 in  the other    will  be  proportional to the change in the specific
gravity of the water, which again, when the amount of impurity is
 minute, may bo held as being proportional to the amount of that
 impurity.
    The determination, by this method, of the quantity of heavy
 impurity in potable water may be freed from all dependence on                 a
 knowledge    of the co-efficients of the expansibility of water, by com
 paring the observations       made on distilled water with those made
 on water containing       a   known quantity of lime or other saline
 matter.     And this, indeed, is the only useful method of procedure           ;
 for in the apparatus     exhibited there    are   many glass balls, and, to
 distinguish these from     each other,  they   are made   of glass of various
colours   ; and it is found that the means of the temperatures at which
these pass the thermometer         are different    for the different colours.
These    means are also influenced     by the conformation of the balls        ;
thus those which are thin, and which, consequently,                have heavy
drops, are more acted on by the expansion           of the internal air, than
those are which have thick sides, and, consequently,             small drops.
    By using   a glass  ball adjusted to float in pure water just at its
maximum relative density,         we obtain    the greatest delicacy     in the
indications.     I  found that such     a  ball, when placed in the water
supplied to the New Town of Edinburgh, gave an interval of 17-2
degrees on Fahrenheit's thermometer.            And the same method may
be extended      to the case of balls which float on water of much
higher temperatures, only it then becomes necessary to use a ther
mometer of proportionally greater delicacy in its graduations.             And
it may be remarked that, for the purpose of securing certainty in
the indications, it is expedient to inclose the jar containing the
water to be experimented          on in a large       vessel   also containing
water, and to agitate      the water contained in it so as to keep the
fluid in the internal vessel     as  nearly  as possible     at the same tem
perature from top to bottom.         By this arrangement we almost          en
tirely avoid the formation of internal currents, which would tend to
give uncertainty to the observations.

   5.  On the Oxidation of Phenyl Alcohol, and a Mechanical
      Arrangement adapted to illustrate Structure in the Non-
      saturated Hydrocarbons.             By   J.  Dewar, Esq.       Communi
      cated by Professor Playfair.
      The syntheses      and    oxidation analyses of organic compounds
  have so confirmed        each other in many cases, that chemists are
  enabled to judge of the structure of a compound from the oxidation
  products.       Many chemists       have used      the   oxidation method in
  special   cases, the bodies operated       upon belonging       principally  to
  the    fatty series;   but until Fittig and Beilstein published their
  memoirs on the aromatic         compounds,     it was never applied     to the
  systematic     study of a hydrocarbon         and its derivatives.     But al
  though the syntheses and oxidation analyses of the derivatives of
  benzol confirmed each other, still the structure of the original
  nucleus    (benzol)   remained    unexplained.         Kekule's  original and
 elegant    speculations    on the structure of benzol and its derivatives
 induced me to try the effect of oxidising agents on benzol,                with
 the view of eliciting whether         the carbon     atoms would separate in
 the way theory pointed out.          The carbon atoms in benzol may          be
 supposed to be arranged in a closed chain, where the carbon affini
ties are bound two and one alternately.               Now,   if we examine the
 formula graphically,        it is evident there are three symmetrical
groupings, C2H2 (acetylene), in benzol.              We would, therefore, ex
pect the carbons to separate in twos, and produce the corresponding
oxidised product, CtH,04, oxalic acid.             I  attempted the oxidation
of benzol with permanganate of potash, but no decomposition took
place in a sealed tube at 150° C.            I  then had recourse to phenyl
alcohol.      If  a  solution of permanganate          of potash is added     to
phenyl alcohol, dissolved in water, the decomposition is immediate,
the solution becomes alkaline, and peroxide of manganese separates
as a    bulky precipitate.       Equivalent    quantities of the substances,
1  pt. phenyl alcohol to 3"5 pts. of permanganate           of potash were the
proportions used.         If  the liquid is filtered      and acidulated   with
acetic acid, on the addition        of acetate of lime, a white precipitate
of oxalate of lime separates.          I  have analysed the lime salt, and
also examined       the physical properties of the acid.        So that phenyl

                    of Edinburgh, Session 1866-67.                            83
 alcohol, when treated with one-third of the quantity of perman
ganate of potash necessary for complete                oxidation, gives oxalic
 acid.    If the  oxidising agent had      been   in excess, we could not have
considered the action specific        ;  but as Berthelot has shown that
 acetylene can be condensed into benzol, and that acetylene, when
 oxidised,    gives oxalic acid,    we    must consider      the production    of
oxalic acid      as  depending on the more intimate           union of the two
 carbon atoms.
    By the regulated oxidation of phenyl alcohol several substances
must be produced.          If we compare benzol and naphthalin, both
members of a homologous series of hydrocarbons where the common
difference is     C4H.2, we   would expect       them to undergo      a  similar
decomposition       on oxidation.      And    as   naphthalin, when oxidised,
gives oxalic and phthalic acids, thus
                         . C.H, +       = CaH604 + 0,11,0.,
                    C„Ha           Oa
so we would expect benzol to give          oxalic and fumaric or an isomer,
 thus
                    C4H4 . C,H, +  Oa
                                        = C4H404 + C            .
But    if  the resisting   nucleus  in benzol       be C4HS, we would    expect
the formation of an acid, C4Ha04 mellitic. So far as my experiments
have gone, they prove the formation of two other acids along with
oxalic,    when two      molecules of permanganate           of potash to one
of phenyl alcohol        were used.      When the alkaline liquid, after
filtration from the manganic            oxide,   is strongly acidulated    with
hydrochloric acid, shaken up with ether, and the ethereal extract
evaporated      on the water-bath,       a  yellow resinous acid, giving a
purple colour, with ferric chloride, is left.             If  this substance is
heated, it chars, giving a beautiful sublimate in the form of long
needles.      The crystalline acid has         a   styptic taste, and gives a
strong reddish violet reaction with ferric chloride, but no reaction
with ferrous sulphate or lime water.               The acid, therefore, differs
from pyrogallic.        Whether this crystalline acid is       a decomposition
product of the resinous acid, or the same substance separated from an
impurity, further experiments must decide.               When the acid liquid
left, after separating      the ether, is evaporated to dryness, treated
with alcohol to dissolve the oxalic acid, freed from alcohol by eva
poration, and the lime salt precipitated in presence of acetic acid,

 84                 Proceedings     of the  Royal Society
 the percentage      of lime, in the precipitate, was        4 per cent-   below
 the theoretical quantity required for oxalate            of lime.      Analysis
 gave 34-l per cent- of lime instead           of 38-3 per cent.      ;  the salt
 blackening on ignition.         There must therefore        be an acid along
 with oxalic whose lime salt is insoluble in acetic acid, and, judging
 from the percentage of lime, probably fumaric or mellitic.              Further
 experiments on a larger scale must be made before the exact com
 position   of the two acids can    be affirmed.
    The application of permanganate          potash as an oxidising         agent
 in organic chemistry promises         interesting results.       Many hydro
 carbons    are directly attacked,     such   as the    oil from caoutchouc,
some of the substances        in Young's paraffin oil, &c., while others,
 having the same composition, resist. It may prove of great value
 in investigating the isomeric hydrocarbons.
    In   connection    with this subject,     I  bring before the Society       a
simple mechanical arrangement            adapted to illustrate structure in
the non-saturated     hydrocarbons.       This little device is the mechani
cal representative     of Dr C. Brown's well-known graphic notation.
A   series of narrow thin bars of brass of equal length are taken, and
every two of the bars clamped           in the centre by       a  nut,  so as to
admit of free motion       the one on the other.         Such a combination
represents a single carbon atom with its four places             of attachment.
In   order to make the combination look like an atom, a thin round
disc of blackened      brass can be placed under the central nut.              At
the ends of the arms are holes to connect              one carbon atom with
another by means of a nut.          The filling up of the places of attach
ment may be effected by slipping on the arms round discs of brass
having     a groove attached,    and placing the symbol        of the chemical
element on the round projection.           A carbon atom would then look
like the following diagram (see p. 85).
    As it is only intended to express the number of places of attach
ment along with the arrangement,           when a given number of carbon
atoms are combined in different ways,           it is better to dispense with
the symbols, remembering that every free arm represents                  a place
of attachment.        When     a number      of carbon      atoms    are joined
together, all the   joints and arms being moveable, it is easy to show
saturation    in a closed or open chain, and the many arrangements
of the atoms corresponding         to the same formula.          Although     the

of Edinburgh, Session 1866-67. 85
 86                  Proceedings of the Royal Society
 bars are of equal length they are not intended to represent             equal
 forces.     We have no unit for comparing the values of the unit
 affinities in different atoms, and they may be incommensurable.             In
 filling up the places of attachment we saturate the fixing powers
 of the individual atoms, taking no account of the influence the
 different elements and radicals have in affecting the energy of
 the whole      compound.      Without entering into any detail on the
 structure of the hydrocarbons,         to show the ease with which         the
 instrument can represent the same hydrocarbon in different ways,
 seven formulae of benzol are appended.             To show the latent affini
 ties, all we have to do is to open the bars connecting any two atoms.
 To show the six latent affinities in benzol,             as represented  in a
 closed circuit, we have merely to separate the bars a little, when we
 have six free places        on the outside,   and six in the inside.        By
opening the whole arrangement we get fourteen free affinities.
Naphthalin and many other hydrocarbons give elegant symmetrical
diagrams when represented          as a closed   circuit.

    2.  Notice of an Easy Method of Preparing Nitroprussides.
                          By Dr Lyon Playfair, F.R.S.
      Since   I described    the method     of making nitroprussides         by the
  action    of nitric    acid   on yellow    prusside     of potassium,     Hadow
  (Chem. Soc. Journal, 1866) has given a more productive process,
  by treating potassic ferridcyanide with an equivalent quantity of
  mercuric chloride, of sodic nitrite, and of acetic acid.                  Hadow
  contends that Nt03 substitutes Cys in this reaction, instead of NO
  as supposed by me.           I  am still of opinion that the formula of
  nitroprussides     is FeCy6    NOMt.      For if an equivalent quantity of
 an acid be added to a solution of potassic ferridcyanide, and a
 stream of NO be passed through this solution, at a temperature of
 between 70° C and 80° C, nitroprusside is slowly but abundantly
 formed, with the evolution of hydrocyanic acid.
                  FeCy6KtH + NO = FeCy5NOK„ + HCy.
     In   these experiments every care was taken to remove all traces
 of  a  higher oxides of nitrogen.        But this process is not productive,
 and is only interesting as        showing that NO can substitute Cy.
     After various experiments,        I found     the following simple process
 to yield excellent results      : — Equal  weights of potassic ferridcyanide
 and of crystallised tartaric acid          are dissolved     separately    in the
 smallest quantity of cold water.        One-half of the solution of tartaric
 acid is then mixed with the solution of ferridcyanide and briskly
stirred, the clear liquid being decanted from the precipitated               cream
of tartar.      A   standard    solution of sodic nitrite* having been de
termined beforehand, a quantity, corresponding to one equivalent
for each equivalent of the potassic ferridcyanide used, is now divided
into two parts.        One-half of this solution is added to the cold mix
ture as above described, and immediately after the remaining half
    * I  prefer for this purpose sodic nitrite, made by fusing lead with sodic
nitrate, lixiviating with water, and then adding H,S04 cautiously, till the
lead is precipitated.

                           of Edinburgh,             Session 1866-6 7.                                    91
of the solution           of tartaric acid, and            a   solution of one equivalent of
chloride of sodium.                 These cause        a   further precipitation of potassic
bitartrate.          A slight        effervescence         now ensues          ;      and from the       in
solubleprecipitate giving points of escape for the nitrous acid, a
good deal would be lost.
                                                                             is is,
                          The clear solution     therefore, rapidly
decanted         from the precipitate,               and the latter                   thrown on   a    filter
to drain.            The mixture          is    now heated up as quickly as possible
to the boiling point, and                  is   briskly boiled.*             Portions of         it,   taken
out at intervals upon        bibulous paper, must be tested for nitrite
with   a    solution of starch and potassium iodide. When the nitrite
appears to be vanishing, the remaining half of the nitrite solution
must be added by degrees, so as always to keep nitrite in solution                                         ;
and    it   must remain distinctly acid with the original tartaric acid
added.          In   about an hour the solution, which had become at first
coffee-coloured,           has acquired         a   fine clear red       ;   but      it   must be boiled
for some time longer.                      The reasons for the precautions                         in the
manner    of adding the nitrite, and preventing any large excess
either of    or of acid, are the following — Red prusside of potas
             it                                                     :
sium heated with sodic nitrite, becomes yellow prusside of sodium
and potassium,  which would remain unconverted.     Again,   the                                   if
tartaric acid has decomposed all the nitrite, and remains in the
boiling solution,                  decomposes the ferridcyanide, and forms Prus
                           if it
sian blue.           But           the above process be followed out, after one or
two hours' boiling, the whole of the ferridcyanide                                    is   converted into
nitroprusside.             The progress     readily ascertained by placing from
                                                is
time to time          a   drop of the solution on bibulous paper, and touching
it   withsolution of the ferrous sulphate.
            a                                 The last traces of fer
ridcyanide are, however, the most difficult to obliterate. The solu
tion   is   now evaporated              and crystallized.                Two abundant            crops of
nearly pure sodic nitroprusside may thus be obtained.                                           The third
crop    is      generally mixed with potassic                           chloride, and sodic and
potassic tartrate, and has to be picked out from them.
   Unless the precautions which have been described have been
strictly attended to,  small quantity of sodic ferrocyanide will be
                                   a
found in the mother liquor.
  *    If the   solution, on mixture, instead of being boiled, as recommended, be
kept cool,   a   large quantity of nitroprusside    still formed, and considerable
                                                               is                           a
amount of oxamide           is     deposited.

  92                 Proceedings      of the Royal      Society
      By the process now described sodic nitroprusside             can be made
  in any quantity, and without the loss of any of the Cyanogen pro
  ducts.    The reaction involved in the above process is extremely
 simple.     The first portion       of tartaric acid removes an atom of
 potassium,    and substitutes      it by hydrogen.        The second portion
 of acid acts on the sodic nitrite, liberating nitrous acid : —
       2FeCy„KsH + 2NO,H = 2H20 + 2FeCy0NOK,                        + Cy2.
     The sodic chloride and tartrate exchange their sodium for the
 potassium of the nitroprusside,        partly on addition, and more largely
 on crystallization.
 3.   Note on the Keality of the Eoots of the Symbolical
      Cubic which expresses the Properties of a Self-conjugate
      Linear and Vector Function.                By Professor Tait.
    Hamilton has shown that        if
                               Pp = 2aS,Sp    + Ap,
 where a and    /J are given vectors, and       A  a given scalar, we have
                         (pt - 7»2p¦  + mtf   - m)p = 0,
where m, mu m, are scalars depending only on p.
    When the function p is its own conjugate, i.e., when
p and   <r being any vectors whatever, the vectors for which
                     (.<P~9)P=    0, or pp||p, or Vppp= 0,
form in general     a real and definite        rectangular  system.    This, of
course, may in particular cases degrade into one definite vector, and
any pair of others perpendicular       to  it ; and cases may occur   in which
the equation is satisfied for every vector.
    Suppose the roots of wt,= m + ml g + m,         g* + g* = 0 to be real and
different, then
           fPi = 9iPi
                         where p,, p„    p3  are definite vectors.

                        of Edinburgh, Session 1866-67.                              93
     Hence           g&Spip,       -  Sflp, <pp,
  because    p is its own conjugate.
     But                          p>, = y,tft,
 and therefore
                     °i&sPiP. = °ISplP,           = o?SplP2;
 which,    as a, and       are   by hypothesis different, requires
                                        sPiPi = °-
 Similarly                Sp.1 p2   = 0,         Sp, p, = 0.
    If two    roots be equal, as g2,g,, we           still have, by the above proof,
 SptP, =  0, and     Sp^^O.          But there is nothing farther to determine
p, and p3,     which    are therefore any vectors perpendicular             to pl.
    If all  three roots be equal, every real vector satisfies the equation
 (P-<7)P=0.
    Next, as to the reality of the three roots when the function is
self-conjugate.
    Suppose gt + h2n/      -   1 to be a root, and let pt + o-tV      -  1 be the cor
responding value of p, where g, and ht are real numbers, p, and cr,
real vectors, and        J-    1  the old imaginary of algebra.
    Then           p(p, + a-2^l)=0?,+Af^T)(p2                 + crJ^T),
and this divides itself, as in algebra, into the two equations
                                   PPi =  &Pt-V2,
Operating on these by            So-,, Sp, respectively,     and subtracting the re
sults, remembering         our condition as to the nature of           <p
                                  So-sPP, = Sp.fo'ai
we have                           h(.<r%'+P,2) = Q-
   But,   as   o-t and p, are both real vectors, the sum of their squares

of the root.

4.     On Vortex Atoms.               By Professor Sir William Thomson.
  After noticing Helmholtz's admirable discovery of the law of
vortex motion in a perfect liquid, that     in   fluid perfectly
                                                              is,     a
destitute       of viscosity (or fluid friction), the author said that this
discovery       inevitably suggests the idea that Helmholtz's                   rings    are
the only true atoms.                For the only pretext seeming                to   justify
the monstrous         assumption         of infinitely strong and infinitely rigid
pieces      of matter, the existence of which               is   asserted as   a   probable
hypothesis        by some of the greatest modern chemists in their rashly-
worded         introductory statements,          is that urged by Lucretius and
adopted by Newton         ;    that      it   seems necessary to account for the
unalterable distinguishing        qualities of different kinds of matter.
But Helmholtz          has proved an absolutely unalterable quality in the
motion of any portion of             a    perfect     liquid, in which the peculiar
motion which he calls " wirbel-bewegung" has been once created.
Thus, any portion of       a   perfect liquid which has
                                                                    " wirbel-bewegung"
has one recommendation         of Lucretius' atoms — infinitely perennial
specific quality.       To generate or to destroy " wirbel-bewegung" in
a    perfect    fluid can only      be an act         of creative power.       Lucretius'
atom does         not explain any of the properties              of matter without
attributing them to the atom itself.                    Thus the " clash of atoms,"
as   it   has been well called, has been invoked by his modern followers
to account        for the elasticity of gases.             Every other property of
matter      has similarly required            an assumption      of specific forces per
taining to the atom.           It   is   as easy (and      as improbable      — not   more
so) to assume whatever specific forces may be required in any por
tion of matter which possesses the " wirbel-bewegung," as in                              a
solid indivisible piece of matter, and hence the Lucretius atom has
no prima facie advantage over the Helmholtz atom.      magnificent        A
display of smoke-rings, which he recently had the pleasure of wit
nessing        in Professor Tait's lecture-room,             diminished by one the
number of assumptions required to explain the properties of matter,
on the hypothesis        that all bodies are composed of vortex atoms in
a    perfect    homogeneous      liquid.        Two smoke-rings were frequently

                      of Edinburgh,      Session 1866-67.                     95
 seen   to bound obliquely from one another, shaking violently from
 the effects of the shock.         The result was very similar to that       ob
 servable in two large india-rubber rings         striking one another in the
 air.   The elasticity of each smoke-ring seemed no further from
 perfection than might be expected in a solid india-rubber ring of
 the same shape from what we know of the viscosity of india-rubber.
 Of course this kinetic elasticity of form is perfect            elasticity for
 vortex rings     in a perfect liquid. It is at least as good a beginning
 as   the "clash of atoms" to account for the elasticity of gases.
 Probably the beautiful investigations of D. Bernouilli, Herapath,
 Joule, Krbnig, Clausius, and Maxwell,              on the various     thermo
 dynamic properties of gases, may have all the positive assumptions
 they have been obliged to make as to mutual forces between two
 atoms and kinetic         energy acquired    by individual   atoms or mole
 cules, satisfied by vortex rings, without requiring any other property
 in the    matter whose motion        composes them     than inertia and in
 compressible occupation         of space.   A full mathematical investiga
 tion of the mutual action between two vortex rings of any given
 magnitudes       and velocities,  passing one another in any two lines,
 so directed     that they never come nearer one another than           a large
 multiple of the diameter         of either, is a  perfectly solvable mathe
 matical     problem;     and the novelty of the circumstances        contem
 plated presents      difficulties of an exciting character.      Its solution
 will become the foundation of the proposed new kinetic theory of
 gases.     The possibility of founding a theory of elastic solids and
 liquids on the dynamics of more closely-packed            vortex atoms may
 be reasonably       anticipated.     It  may be   remarked, in connection
 with this anticipation, that the mere title of Rankine's paper on
 " Molecular Vortices," communicated to the
                                                      Royal Society of Edin
burgh in 1849 and 1850, was a most suggestive               step in physical
theory.
    Diagrams and wire models were shown to the Society, to illus
trate knotted or knitted vortex atoms, the endless variety of
which     is  infinitely more than sufficient to explain the varieties
and allotropies of known simple bodies and their mutual affinities.
It  is to be remarked        that two ring atoms linked together, or one
knotted in any manner with its ends meeting, constitute a system
which, however it may be altered in shape, can never deviate from

96                 Proceedings of the Royal Society
its own peculiarity of multiple continuity, it being impossible         for
the matter in any line of vortex motion to go through the line of
any other matter in such motion or any other part of its own line.
In  fact, a closed line    of vortex core is literally indivisible by any
action resulting from vortex motion.
   The author called attention to      a very important property of the
vortex atom, with reference to the now celebrated spectrum analysis
practically established      by the discoveries  and labours    of Kirchof
and Bunsen.        The dynamical theory of this subject, which Pro
fessor Stokes had taught to the author of the present paper before
September      1852, and which he has taught       in his lectures in the
University of Glasgow from that time forward, required that the
ultimate constitution of simple bodies should          have one or more
fundamental periods of vibration, as has a stringed instrument of
one or more strings, or an elastic solid consisting of one or more
tuning forks rigidly connected.        To assume such a property in the
Lucretius atom, is at once to give it that very flexibility and elas
ticity, for the explanation of which, as exhibited in aggregate
bodies, the atomic      constitution was originally assumed.      If, then,
the hypothesis      of atoms and vacuum      imagined by Lucretius and
his followers to be necessary to account for the flexibility and com
pressibility of tangible solids and fluids, were really necessary, it
would be necessary        that the molecule     of sodium, for instance,
should   be not an atom,      but a group of atoms with void space be
tween them.       Such a molecule could not be strong and durable,
and thus    it loses the one recommendation, which has given it the
degree of acceptance it has had among philosophers ; but, as the
experiments shown to the Society illustrate, the vortex atom has
perfectly definite fundamental modes of vibration, depending solely
on that motion, the existence of which constitutes it.            The dis
covery of these fundamental modes forms an intensely interesting
problem of pure mathematics.         Even for a simple Helmholtz ring,
the analytical     difficulties which it presents are of   a  very formid
able character,    but certainly far from insuperable in the present
state of mathematical science.         The author of the present com
munication had not attempted, hitherto, to work it out except for
an infinitely long, straight, cylindrical vortex.      For this case he is
working out solutions corresponding to every possible description of

                      of Edinburgh,         Session 1866-67.                        97
infinitesimal vibration, and intended to include them in                   a mathe
matical paper, which he hoped soon to be able to communicate to
the Royal Society.           One very simple result which he could now
state is the following.         Let such      a vortex be given    with its section
differing from exact circular figure by an infinitesmal harmonic
deviation of order ». This form will travel as waves round the axis
of the cylinder in the same direction                as the vortex rotation,     with
an   angular velocity equal to                    of the angular velocity of this
                                            i
rotation.     Hence, as the number of crests in a whole circumference
is equal to     », for a harmonic          deviation   of order*', there are i 1   -
 periods of vibration, in the period of revolution of the vortex.
 For the case * = 1 there is no vibration, and the solution expresses
 merely an infinitesimally          displaced vortex with its circular form
 unchanged.        The    case   t = 2 corresponds         to elliptic deformation
 of the circular section         ;  and for       it the period of vibration is
 simply, therefore, the period of revolution.                 These   results are, of
 course, applicable to the Helmholtz ring, when the diameter of the
 approximately circular section is small in comparison with the
 diameter of the ring, as it is in the smoke-rings exhibited to the
 Society.     The lowest fundamental            modes of the two kinds of trans
 verse vibrations      of a  ring, such     as the   vibrations that were      seen   in
 the experiments,       must be much graver than the elliptic vibration
 of section.     It  is probable that the vibrations which constitute the
 incandescence of sodium vapour are analogous to those which the
 smoke-rings      had exhibited      ;   and   it is therefore probable that the
 period of the vortex rotations             of the atoms of sodium vapour are
 much less than       ^
                            of the millionth of the millionth of a second,
 this being approximately            the period       of vibration of the yellow
 sodium light.        Further, inasmuch          as this light consists of two     sets
 of vibrations      co-existent    in slightly different        periods, equal      ap
 proximately to the time just stated, and of                   as nearly as can be
 perceived equal intensities           ;  the sodium atom must have two fun
 damental      modes of vibration, having those for their respective
 periods, and being about equally excitable                  by such forces as the
  atom experiences in the incandescent vapour.                  This last condition
  renders  it probable that the two fundamental modes concerned                      are
     VOL. VI.                                                                N

98                    Proceedings of the Royal Society
approximately similar (and not merely different orders of different
series chancing to concur very nearly in their periods of vibration).
In an approximately circular and uniform disc of elastic solid the
fundamental        modes of transverse vibration, with nodal division into
quadrants, fulfils both the conditions.            In   an approximately circular
and uniform ring of elastic solid these conditions                   are   fulfilled for
the flexural vibrations in its plane, and also in its transverse vibra
tions perpendicular          to its own plane.     But the circular vortex ring,
if created with one part somewhat thicker than another, would not
remain so, but would experience longitudinal vibrations round its own
circumference,        and could not possibly have two fundamental                modes
of vibration similar in character and approximately equal in period.
The same assertion may, it is probable,* be practically extended to
any atom consisting of a single vortex ring, however involved, as
illustrated by those of the models shown to the Society, which con
sisted of only a single wire, knotted             in various ways.          It   seems,
therefore, probable that the sodium atom may not consist of a single
vortex line    ;   but   it may very probably consist of two approximately
equal vortex rings passing through one another, like two links of a
chain.    It   is,
              however, quite certain that   vapour consisting of
                                                             a
such atoms, with proper volumes and angular velocities in the two
rings of each atom, would act precisely as incandescent sodium
vapour acts;         that   is   to say, would   fulfil the "spectrum test" for
sodium.
  The possible effect of change of temperature on the fundamental
modes cannot be pronounced upon without mathematical inves
tigation not hitherto executed          ;   and therefore        we cannot say that
the dynamical explanation now suggested      mathematically demon
                                                        is
strated so far as to include the very approximate identity of the
periods of the vibrating particles of the incandescent vapour with
those of their corresponding           fundamental      modes, at the lower tem
perature, at which the vapour               exhibits its remarkable         absorbing
power for the sodium light.

simple vortex ring       is,   that   it   always  moves, relatively to the dis
tant parts of the fluid, in           a    direction perpendicular to its plane
towards the side towards which the rotatory motion carries the
inner parts of the ring. The determination of the velocity of this
motion, even approximately for rings of which the sectional radius
issmall in comparison with the radius of the circular axis, has pre
sented mathematical difficulties which have not yet been overcome.
In   the smoke-rings which have been actually observed,                   it   seems
to be always     something smaller than the velocity of the fluid
along the straight axis through the centre of the ring;                    for the
observer   standing beside the line of motion of the ring,                      sees,
as   its plane passes through the position of his eye,                a   convex*
   • The diagram represents precisely the convex outline referred to, and the
lines of motion of the interior fluid carried along by the vortex, for the case
of a double vortex consisting of two infinitely long, parallel straight vortices
of equal rotations   in opposite directions.        The curves have been drawn by

100                       Proceedings of the Royal Society
outline of an atmosphere of smoke in front of the ring.      This
convex outline indicates the bounding surface between the quantity
of smoke which is carried forward with the ring in its motion,
and the surrounding air which yields to let it pass.   It is not
so easy to distinguish the corresponding convex  outline behind
the ring, because a confused trail of smoke is generally left in the
rear.       In   a perfect fluid the bounding surface of the portion carried
forward would necessarily be quite symmetrical on the anterior and
posterior sides          of the middle plane of the ring.             The motion of the
surrounding fluid must be precisely the same                     as   it would   be   if   the
space within this surface were occupied by a smooth solid                        ;   but in
reality the air within it is in        of rapid motion, circulating
                                            a state
round the circular axis of the ring with increasing velocity on the
circuits nearer and nearer to the ring itself.                   The circumstances          of
the actual         motion may be         imagined thus : — Let        a   solid column of
india-rubber, of circular section, with               a diameter       small in propor
tion to its length, be bent into a circle, and its two ends properly
spliced together, so that it may keep the circular shape when left
to   itself; let the aperture of the ring            be closed   by an infinitely thin
film    ;   let an impulsive pressure        be applied     all over this film, of in
tensity so distributed          as to produce the definite        motion of the fluid,
specified        as    follows, and instantly thereafter let the film be all
liquefied.            This motion    in accordance with one of Helmholtz's
                                   is,
laws, to be along those curves which would be the lines of force,                           if,
in place of the india-rubber circle, were substituted ring electro        a
magnet,* and the velocities at different points are to be in pro
portion to the intensities of the magnetic forces in the corresponding
points of the magnetic field. The motion, as has been long known,
will fulfil this definition, and will continue fulfilling              the     it,   if

the corresponding  points of the magnetic field. Let, now, the ring
be   moved perpendicular to its own plane in the direction with the
motion of the fluid, through the middle of the ring, with a velocity
very small in comparison with that of the fluid at the centre of the
ring.      A   large approximately globular portion                      of the fluid will   be
carried     forward      with the ring.     Let the velocity of the ring
be increased      ;   the volume of fluid carried forward will be diminished
in every diameter, but most in the axial or fore-and-aft diameter,
and its shape will thus become sensibly oblate. By increasing the
velocity of the ring forward more and more this oblateness will in
crease, until, instead of being wholly convex it will be concave,
before and behind, round the two ends of the axis.                             If the   forward
velocity of the ring be increased until it is just equal to the velo
city of the fluid, through the centre of the ring, the axial section
of the outline of the portion of fluid carried forward will become a
lemniscate.           If              still faster forward, the portion
                            the ring be carried
of it carried with the india-rubber ring will be itself annular ; and,
relatively to the ring, the motion of the fluid will be backwards
through the centre.                In   all   cases, the figure        of the portion of fluid
carried forward, and the lines of motion,                       will   be symmetrical,     both
relatively to the axis and relatively to the two sides of the equatorial
plane.   Any one of the states of motion thus described might of
course be produced either in the order described, or by first giving
a velocity      to the ring, and then setting the fluid in motion by aid
of    an   instantaneous           film, or by applying the two initiative actions
simultaneously.               The whole amount of the impulse required, or, as
we may call           it,   the effective momentum of the motion, or simply
the momentum of the motion,                      is   the sum of the integral values of
the impulses on the ring and on the film required to produce one
or other of the two components                        of the whole motion.         Now    it   is
obvious that, as the diameter of the ring                       is   very small in compari
son with the diameter of the circular axis, the impulse on the ring
must be very small in comparison with the impulse on the film,
unless the velocity given to the ring      much greater than that
                                                           is
given to the central parts of the film.                      Hence, unless the velocity
given to the ring             is   so very great as to reduce the volume                 of the
fluid carried forward with              it    to something      not incomparably        greater

102                       Proceedings of the Royal Society
than the volume of the solid ring itself, the momenta of the several
configurations of motions we have been considering will exceed by
but insensible quantities the momentum               when the        ring is fixed.
The value of this momentum is easily found by                a proper    application
of     Green's formulae.         Thus the actual momentum           of the portion
of fluid carried forward (being the same            as   that of    a   solid of the
same density moving with the same velocity), together                         with an
equivalent for the inertia of the fluid yielding to let it pass, is
approximately the same in all these                cases,    and    is equal to a
Green's integral expressing the whole initial impulse on the film.
The equality of the effective momentum for different velocities of
the ring is easily verified without analysis for velocities not so great
as to cause sensible deviations from spherical figure in the portion
of fluid carried forward. Thus, in every case, the length of the
axis of the portion of the fluid carried forward is determined by
finding the point in the axis of the ring at which the velocity is
equal to the velocity of the ring.              At great     distances    from the
plane of the ring this velocity varies, as does the magnetic force
of an infinitesimal magnet on a point in its axis, inversely as the
cube    of the distance from the centre.        Hence the cube of the radius
of the approximately globular portion carried forward is in simple
proportion to the velocity of the ring, and therefore its momentum
is constant for different velocities of the ring. To this must be
added, as was proved by Poisson, a quantity equal to half its own
                                      of the external fluid ; and
amount, as an equivalent for the inertia
the sum is the whole effective momentum of the motion. Hence
we see not        only that the whole effective momentum            is independent
of the velocity of the ring, but that its amount is the same                   as the
magnetic moment in the corresponding ring electro-magnet.                        The
same result        is,   of course, obtained by the Green's integral referred
to above.
  The synthetical method just explained               is    not confined       to the
case    of   a   single circular ring specially referred to, but         is   equally
applicable       to   a   number of rings   of any form, detached from one
another, or linked through one another, in any way, or to                  a   single
line knotted to any degree and quality of " multiple continuity,"
and joined continuously, so as to have no end.                 In   every possible
such case, the motion of the fluid at every point, whether                     of the

vortex core or of the fluid           filling all   space round     it,   is   perfectly de
termined      by Helmholtz's          formulae,, when the shape of the core                 is
given.   And the synthetic investigation now explained proves that
the effective momentum of the whole fluid motion agrees, in magni
tude and direction, with the magnetic moment of the corresponding
electro-magnet.             Hence,   still considering, for simplicity, only          an   in
finitely thin line of core, let this line            be projected on each           of three
planes at right angles to one another.               The   areas   of the plane circuits
thus obtained (to be reckoned, according to De Morgan's rule, when
automic, as they will generally be), are the components of momen
tum perpendicular            to these three planes.         The verification of this
result   will      be   a    good exercise on
                                              " multiple continuity."                    The
author   is   not yet sufficiently acquainted with Riemann's remark
able researches                     of analytical geometry, to know
                         on this branch
whether or not all the kinds of " multiple continuity

   That part of the synthetical investigation in which thin solid               a
wire ring    supposed to be moving in any direction through
              is                                            fluid                    a
with the free vortex motion previously excited in                         it,   requires the
diameter  of the wire at every point to be infinitely small in com
parison with the radius of curvature of its axis and with the dis
tance of the nearest of any other part of the circuit from that point
of the wire.            But when the effective moment of the whole fluid
motion has been found for            a    vortex with infinitely thin core, we may
suppose any number of such vortices, however, near one another to
be excited      simultaneously        :   and the whole effective momentum, in
magnitude       and direction,         will be the resultant of the momenta of
the different component vortices each estimated separately.                           Hence
we have the remarkable               proposition     that the effective momentum
of any possible motion in an infinite incompressible fluid agrees in
direction and magnitude with the magnetic moment of the cor
responding electro-magnet                 in Helmholtz's       theory.          The author
hopes to give the mathematical    formulae expressing and proving
this statement in the more detailed paper, which he hopes soon to
be able to lay before the
                        Royal Society.
  The question early occurs to any one either observing the phe
nomena of smoke-rings or investigating the theory —What condi
tions determine             the size of the ring in any case?                   Helmholtz's

104        .
                        Proceedings of the Royal Society
investigation proves that the angular vortex velocity of the core
varies directly as its length, or inversely as its sectional area.
Hence the strength of the electric current in the electro-magnet,
corresponding to an infinitely thin vortex core, remains constant,
however much its length may be altered in the course of the trans
formations which it experiences by the motion of the fluid.                           Hence
it is obvious that the larger the diameter of the ring, for the same
volume         and strength of vortex motions in an ordinary Helmholtz
ring, the greater is the whole kinetic energy of the fluid, and the
greater is the momentum ; and we therefore see that the dimen
sions   of a Helmholtz ring are determinate                 when the volume                and
strength of the vortex motion are given, and besides, either the
kinetic energy or the momentum of the whole fluid motion due
to it.  Hence     after any number of collisions or influences,
                        if,                                                                     a
Helmholtz ring escapes to great distance from others and
                                   a                          then                    is
free, or nearly free, from vibrations, its diameter will have been
increased or diminished according as             it   has taken energy from, or
given energy            to, the others.   A   full theory of the swelling of
vortex atoms by elevation of temperature               is   to be worked out from
this principle.
   Professor Tait's plan of exhibiting smoke rings                    is   as   follows     :—
A large rectangular           box, open at one side, has          a   circular hole of
six or eight inches diameter cut in the opposite side. A common
rough packing-box of two feet cube or thereabout will answer the
purpose very well.            The open side of the box        is   closed by          a    stout
towel or piece of cloth, or by            a   sheet of India-rubber               stretched
across it.          A   blow on this flexible side causes          a   circular vortex
ring to shoot out from the hole on the other side.                              The vortex
rings thus generated are visible,  the box  if               is   filled with smoke.
One of the most convenient ways of doing this                 is   to use two retorts
with their necks thrust into holes made for the purpose in one of
the sides of the box.     small quantity of muriatic acid
                               A                          put into               is
one of these retorts, and of strong liquid             ammonia         into the other.
By    a   spirit-lamp applied from time to time to one or other of these
retorts,       a   thick cloud of sal-ammoniac    is   readily maintained in the
inside of the box.            A curious   and interesting experiment may be
 made with two boxes thus arranged, and placed either side by side,
close to one another, or facing one another              so as to project smoke

rings meeting from opposite directions      ; or in various relative posi
tions, so as to give smoke-rings proceeding in paths inclined to
one another at any angle, and passing one another at various dis
tances.     An interesting variation of the experiment may be made
by using clear air without smoke in one of the boxes.             The in
visible vortex rings projected from it render their existence start-
 lingly sensible, when they come near any of the smoke rings pro
 ceeding from the other box.

1. On the      Arctic Shell Clay of Elie and Errol, viewed in
   connection with our other Glacial and more Recent De
   posits.     By the Rev. Thomas Brown, F.R.S.E.
   Referring to the papers formerly read before the Society in 1863
and 1864, the author first noticed       the Section  at  Errol, its strati-
graphical position and fossils, more especially the skeleton of a seal
which had been found in the clay. He then described more in
detail the different deposits as they occur in the neighbourhood of
Elie. Since the shore Section was described in 1863 two new Sec
tions had been examined, and the position of the different beds
more   fully ascertained.     One was in the railway cutting extending
from Elie Bridge to the Railway Station, in which, when first laid
open, the series of deposits was remarkably well displayed.         Begin
ning   a little to the east of the station, the following beds were    seen
in the descending order : —
   1.  Blown sand with intercalated beds of shell-bearing peat, one
of which was six feet in thickness. This upper portion of the
series is largely developed.
   2.  A   peculiar bed of peat destitute of shells, and apparently a
continuation of that at the shore, — the submerged forest.
   3.  A portion of   the high-level stratified gravels and sands    of the
district.
      At this point     there is a break in the series.      The portion
         above is unconformable to that beneath.
   4. The arctic shell clay — a continuation        of the same deposit
seen on the shore about      one-third of  a mile distant.
   5. The boulder-clay     in two stages, with large boulders enclosed.
   6.  The basement bed of the boulder-clay full of shivers, and
resting immediately on the rock.
   These different deposits are seen in regular succession from east
to west.

  108              Proceedings of the Royal Society
     The other Section     lies to the westward    of Kincraig,    and runs
 nearly at right angles to the former, passing from the shore inland
 up the course of the Cockle   Mill Burn. It   shows the following beds: —
     1. Blown sand rising into dunes close to the shore.
    2.  The   so called  raised  beach consisting of sand, shingle, and
 shells in layers, the shells being the common species of the shore,
 and very much in the same state as those now on the beach.             This
 deposit   is powerfully displayed,    rising at some points to twenty
 feet above high-water mark.
    3.  Further inland, and apparently underlying No.         2, is a series
 of sands and clays      in contorted   layers.   Marine shells occur at
 various points.     One of the layers of clay was pointed out contain
 ing numerous specimens of Scrohicularia piperata in their natural
 position, with the siphonal end uppermost.          As this bed is from
 twelve to fourteen feet above high-water mark, attention was called
 to the evidence thus furnished for a rise in the bed of the          Firth,
 and its remarkable     coincidence  with the evidence furnished by the
 same deposits at    Stirling and Portobello.
    4.  The submerged      forest of Largo Bay as     it is found near the
 mouth of the stream, between tide-marks.
    The additional species of shells were described      as determined    by
Dr 0. Tozell, and the still more complete evidence thus furnished
of extreme arctic cold.
2.   On the     Motions      and  Colours upon Films of Alcohol,
    Volatile Oils, and other Fluids. By Sir David Brewster,
    K.H., F.E.S.,      &c.
    In   a paper    " On the Phenomena of thin Plates exposed to
Polarised Light," published in the Philosophical Transactions for
1841, the author observed certain       motions   and colours upon some
of the volatile and fixed oils, the cause of which he did not attempt
to discover.       Their apparent similarity to the molecular move
ments and colours, described in a preceding paper, induced him to
resume the subject.
    When    a drop  of alcohol is placed upon an aperture the fifth of
an inch in diameter or less, a concave lens       will be formed upon it.
As the alcohol evaporates, a      very small plane film will appear in
the centre, and will gradually increase till it fills the aperture.       If

                  of Edinburgh,       Session 1866-67.                   109
held in a vertical or even inclined position, and examined by trans
mitted light, a current of fluid, without colour, will be seen issuing
from the margin of the film, moving quickly to different parts
of its circumference, sometimes dividing itself into two currents
dancing opposite one another, and then extending into secondary
currents in constant motion. Similar currents are produced upon
various alcoholic solutions and a large number (seventy to eighty)
of volatile oils, &c.
   If we   now examine the film by reflected       light, the principle and
secondary currents    will be   seen   as before,   but accompanied with
systems of coloured rings of great beauty, shifting their place on
the film, sometimes in rotation, expanding and contracting quickly,
and changing their form and colour.
   In  small films there is often only one system of rings contracting
and expanding with a constant variation of the central tint. In gene
ral, however, there are two, three, or several systems— each system
being produced by a secondary current giving motion to the colour
ing matter on the surface of the film.         In some cases the motions
and colour disappear,    the film becomes colourless,        and tints issue
from its margin    as on the soap-bubble     ;  but,  in general, the film
bursts   before this takes   place.     The colourless    currents and the
colours   into which they expand      are supposed by the author to have
the same origin as those upon the soap-bubble.           The paper is illus
trated with drawings    of the currents and of the systems of rings.
3. Note on the       Action of Nitric Oxide, Nitrous Acid, and
    Nitrites on Haemoglobin.              By Arthur Gamgee, M.D.,
    F.R.S.E., F.C.S.
   When engaged, during the course of last summer, in the exami
 nation of the action of various medicinal and poisonous agents on
blood,  I observed  the remarkable      change in the colour of the blood
of animals poisoned with nitrite of amyl.          In  every case  in which
I induced death    by this agent     the blood    presented a dirty choco
late coloration, instead of the characteristic colour of normal blood.
 When examined by means of the spectroscope, this blood was found
to present optical characters very different from those of ordinary
blood, for the two well-marked absorption bands of 0         - haemoglobin,
 or (as the readers of Professor Stokes' paper       will know them better

110               Proceedings of the Royal Society
as) of scarlet cruorine, were found to be extremely faint, and only
visible when comparatively thick layers of fluid were examined ;
 whilst an additional and very faint absorption        band  in the red,
occupying the same position       as  that of acid haematine, was seen.
I at first thought   that the acids, generated by the oxidation of the
nitrite, had acted upon the blood-colouring matter in the same
manner as weak acids usually do, effecting         a  partial conversion
into haematin, so that whilst the bands of haemoglobin          were yet
visible, the one characteristic of haematin had been super-added.
The total incorrectness of this view was proved on        a more  careful
examination being made.          On adding a few drops of ammonia
to the blood-solution in which nitrite        of amyl had effected the
peculiar change alluded to, its colour again became red, and whilst
the band in the red instantly and totally disappeared, the two
absorption    bands situated   between   D and   E  became much     more
distinct.    Moreover,  a  third very faint absorption   band was found
occupying the junction of the orange and yellow, and just below
Frauenhofer's line D. On now treating the blood solutions with
such deoxidising agents as protosalts      of iron and tin and sulphide
of ammonium,       a spectrum, differing in no respect from that of
reduced haemoglobin, was obtained, and the solution, when agitated
with air, presented the most beautiful spectrum of oxy-baemoglobin,
i.e., the two bands a and /3 reassumed all the distinctness and
beauty which they presented in the unaltered blood solution.
   Nitrite of ethyl was found to effect exactly the same alteration
as nitrite of amyl, whilst, as might be expected, vinic and amylic
alcohols, when    added in small quantities to blood, were without
any effect.    When solutions of nitrite of sodium or of potassium
were added to blood, instantly the same change was noticed as was
produced by amylic and vinic nitrites.      On very faintly acidulating
blood with acetic acid, and subsequently     adding  a small quantity of
a solution of nitrite of sodium, the same change occurred.
   In   this case the change must have been due to the nascent
nitrous acid, or to the nitric oxide secondarily resulting from it.
In   order  to endeavour    to determine   whether the body produced
under the influence of nitrites was really due to the action of
nitrous acid, or whether, on the contrary, it was formed through
the agency of nitric oxide,     I performed  the following   experiment.
Perfectly pure nitric oxide was passed into blood, exactly the same

                   of Edinburgh, Session 1866-67.                          11 1
arrangements       being employed as were used by Hadow in his
experiments on the constitution of nitro-prussides ; instead, how
ever, of generating the nitric oxide by the action of nitric oxide on
copper, the gas was obtained by boiling a solution         of ferric sulphate,
which had been saturated with NO, in              a stream  of carbonic acid.
After the action of nitric oxide had gone on for some seconds, the
line in the red made its appearance, and the two haemoglobin
bands became very indistinct, whilst the colour of the blood became
brown    ; the same changes        were thus induced       as were   found to
occur when nitrites act upon        blood.    On the addition of ammonia
the band     in the red disappeared, and the spectrum was marked by
the band in the orange, to which allusion has already been made.
    Although this observation appeared to point to nitric oxide as
the agent in effecting the change, it was perfectly possible that,
in reality, it was due to nitrous acid, for it appeared likely that
this acid might be formed in the blood by the nitric oxide seizing
 that portion of the oxygen of the blood-colouring matter, which is
 capable of removal by reducing agents, or capable of expulsion by
 carbonic oxide.      It would   indeed appear from my experiments         that
 nitrous acid is produced in the reaction, as when by means of a
 long funnel a mixture of potassic iodide, starch, and acetic acid is
 conducted to the bottom of a blood solution, and through which
 nitric oxide is passing,    a  blue colour is produced.
     In order to separate,   if  possible, the substance formed under the
 influence    of NO in a crystalline form, the blood of a dog was
 allowed to coagulate, and after complete separation of the serum
 the clot was squeezed         in linen.     The red fluid thus expressed
 was mixed with one-and-a-half times its volume of water, and then
 solution   of nitrite of sodium added, until the characteristic spectrum
 was obtained.       The fluid was then mixed with one-fourth of its
 volume of 86 per cent- alcohol, when          it  became filled with micro
 scopic needles and prisms identical with those of           0- haemoglobin.
 They merely differed        from the latter in having a dirty brown
 colour.    They were collected on filter paper, washed with ice-cold
 water, pressed, and afterwards        mixed with     a considerable quantity
 of water.      They did not, however, entirely redissolve,            a small
 quantity of    a white albuminoid substance          remaining undissolved.
 The solution of the crystals presented the same spectrum                as the
  blood from which     they had been precipitated.

     At   the present    stage of my researches                 it would be premature to
express an opinion on the nature of the substance                         produced, when
haemoglobin      is acted upon by nitrites and nitrous acid.                       That it
holds a very close relation, indeed, to                   0 - haemoglobin,     with which
it appears to be isomorphous, is obvious, whilst it is most im
probable that it has any analogy to the bodies formed when blood-
colouring matter is treated with carbonic oxide, or when subjected
to the prolonged        action of nitric oxide,            in          of ammonia.
                                                                the presence
When CO acts upon blood, or, as                         Hermann has recently shown,
when NO is made for a long time to pass through blood made
alkaline with ammonia, there are formed compounds in which one
volume of CO or one volume of                      NO have respectively replaced one
volume of oxygen in the colouring matter                   — compoundswhich       present
exactly the same spectrum as ordinary blood, but which differ from
it in being totally irreducible.
                               That Ns0a should form a compound
of this character seems improbable, and that NO should form two
altogether distinct compounds with blood-colouring matter, is even
more improbable.          It   is,   however, much more            likely that the action
of nitrites and nitrous acid               is   mainly    a   reducing action, and that
the body obtained by me              is   merely    a   less oxygenised form of blood-
colouring matter.

 1.   On the Application of Relative, or Proportional, Equality
      to International Organisation.            By Professor Lorimer.
     It is often regarded almost      as a matter   of admission, on the part
of the cultivators of social and political philosophy, that their sub
jects defy scientific treatment       ; and that, when they talk of tracing
out laws       of social   wellbeing or progress, they use words which
indicate,     at most, a very faint analogy      between the methods which
they affect to follow, and those really employed in the physical
sciences.       The reproach to which they are exposed, on this ground,
would never have arisen, or would not have been merited, had they
habituated       themselves     and  others  to regard    their subject,    as  a
science,     in the ordinary sense of an inquiry into nature, and not as
a   series of random observations, in which the contingent and the
 necessary, the permanent         and the accidental,    were hopelessly and
 inextricably mixed up. Political methodology, viewed as a branch
 of applied logic, has risen, in the hands of some of its recent culti
vators, almost to the dignity        of a separate science.    By eliminating
 impossible     schemes, and thus circumscribing the sphere of political
 effort,  it  has already given evidence     of its practical value. Within
 the state, forms of government,         after which the vulgar still aspire
 as the   ideal forms of society, have been shown by its means to be
 permanently irreconcilable with order, and if with order, then with
 liberty, which is possible         only through order, and       so  ultimately
 with civilisation itself.
     But all that can        be  attempted   on the present     occasion,   is to

114                 Proceedings of the Royal Society
point out two principles, the realisation of which can be shown to
be impossible,      and which           have, nevertheless,       been sought        to be
realised in conjunction with every scheme of international organisa
tion which has yet been propounded.                   These principles are       :   —
  1.  Finality. — In national politics this principle has been ex
hibited in those arbitrary, and, in some states, impassable lines
between classes, which science has long ago condemned, and which
practical men are everywhere engaged in obliterating. In schemes
of international organisation, it has sought to manifest itself in
the establishment        of final and permanent              international relations,
or in the maintenance of what is technically called                  a status quo.
  2. Absolute equalityof rights and obligations.                — In internal politics
this principle is the basis of the form of government called
Democracy.    In international politics it has exhibited itself in
the custom  of assigning equal votes to all the members of the
family of nations, not absolutely excluded from the European
council board, however widely they might differ in real power and
importance.
   As regarded the first of these principles, the absurdity of attempt
ing to stereotype the map of Europe will be readily admitted.
With reference to the second, there is much difference of opinion,
both as to the possibility             and the justice of recognising, or de
claring absolute         political equality, whether within               the   state or
in the wider commonwealth                    of nations.      Now this diversity of
opinion, great      as   it    is,   and terrible as       have been, and       may yet
be its effects,    is    traceable      to   a   defect   in the popular mind, on
which Aristotle, with his usual perspicacity, put his finger more
than two thousand            years ago.
                                               " The vulgar,"      he says,     " do not
distinguish,"      and    in modern Europe, for nearly               a   century,    they
have lost sight of       a   distinction which Aristotle did them the farther
favour to point out.
  The distinction        is   that between        absolute   and relative or propor
tional equality.
  The two are, in truth, neither more nor less than two different
manifestations     of the principle of justice.              They differ not in them
selves, but   in the manner of their application, and in the subject
matter with which they deal.      Following, and giving definiteness,
as usual, to Plato's conception of what, in its origin, was probably
the teaching of Socrates, Aristotle gave to these two forms of applied

justice         the    names      of diorthotic         and      dianemetic      justice     (Sucaiov
BlopOwriKov and hiiauav              hlavtprjrucov),         names which the schoolmen
and    jurists        rendered    by juslicia corrective, or commutativa, and jus-
ticia distributive!.             The object of diorthotic or corrective justice
Aristotle         explained to be, to give to each                     a   perfectly fair, un
biassed, and,           in that
                            opportunity of vindicating what
                                   sense, equal
ever might be due to him, whether the amount was greater or
smaller than that which was due to his neighbour.                                 This was what
we call equality before the law ; and justice demanded that equality,
in this sense, should be absolute.    There was to be no distinction
whatever          of rich or poor, wise or foolish, male or female, old or
young.           The object of dianemetic justice, on the other hand, was to
ascertain how much was due to each, and to rank them accordingly.
Here was still equality, perfect equality, but equality which was no
longer absolute, but relative.  It was proportioned to the facts which
the claimants respectively                established with reference to the matter
in dispute.            So far    all is clear.        There can       be no doubt          that this
was what Aristotle                 little doubt that he was right.
                                 meant,      and as
As to the application of the doctrine there is great confusion in
the text, and even Sir Alexander Grant has not made much of it.
What it seems to indicate      that diorthotic justice, or absolute
                                              is,
equality,        is   applicable to private         — and    dianemetic justice, or relative
equality, to public questions, and                     both exclusively.          But this could
scarcely have been Aristotle's meaning.                           Both principles come into
play     in every department                 of jurisprudence, and are called into
action in the decision               of every        case,    from   the most insignificant
question         of private right to the                most      momentous         questions      of
national or international policy.                      And the method of their action
is   this   :    The first principle — absolute equality — governs the con
duct     of the suit, or of the investigation, whatever form                                 it   may
take, whether           it   be conducted for judicial, legislative, or social pur
poses.          The second, relative equality, governs the decision of the
cause, whether that decision                  be pronounced           in   a   small-debt court,
in   a   national legislature,          in   a      congress of nations, or         in   a   club of
gossips.         As an illustration of the mutual action of these principles
in private law, take the familiar                    case    of the distribution of a bank
rupt estate.            One man has invested L.5                 in the concern, and another
L.50. As suitors, the law puts them on footing of absolute equality.

to white skin or to black skin.                         So far they are dealt with diorthoti-
cally.        But then the dianemetic,
                                    or distributive principle, comes
into play; — and suppose the estate to yield a shilling in the pound,
one man gets five shillings, and the other gets fifty.                                     The distribu
tion has reference to the objects                       of the suit, not to the suitors, and
is wholly dianemetic.                     But
                                 far is the dianemetic principle from
                                                  so
acting alone, that it is in virtue of the diorthotic principle that it
assigns fifty to a man who may possibly                                  be   a    millionaire and           a
scoundrel,          and five shillings             to a man who may be a pauper and a
saint    I        And just in the same way the presence of                          both   principles is
indispensable              to the        decision       of questions          of    a   public nature.
There, too, justice demands that the dianemetic                                    principle shall act
diorthotically, and the diorthotic principle dianemetically. Suppose
that the suffrage is claimed by a particular class of persons whose
right to it has hitherto been ignored or denied.    What justice en
titles them to ask the State to do   not to create new rights in their
                                                          is,
favour, but to recognise                      rights which they allege exist in their
persons already.                   Here, too, they claim equality before the law —
they demand               a   fair (i.e.,   a     But their plea
                                                 diorthotic) hearing.                                        is
that they are entitled to the suffrage on some ground, as they call
  — property,

they have           it,   or simple humanity.                   Whatever the ground may                  be,
they demand that                   it   should     be     diorthotically inquired into.                 But
they do not dispute, except by mistake, that                              it   must be dianemeti
cally recognised.                  Even     if    they ask the State to proceed on the
assumption that they all possess the ground of recognition equally,
they do not ask the State to make                               it   equal to them all       ;   in other
words, they do not ask                   it   to give them           means to teach them, or to
make them human beings, for that would be to ask not recognition,
not equality before the law, but revolution, or the abolition of the
law.         It   was Rousseau's              doctrine that all men ought to be equal,
and not Hobbes's doctrine that                          all men are equal, and ought, con
sequently, to be recognised as such, which brought about the revolu
tions of last century, and which threaten us still.
   Keeping this distinction in view, then,          obvious that,         it   is                            if
justice       is   to be done between nations, there must, as                               in all other
cases        in which         it   is   called    into play, be proportion between the

more especially since the American and French                                        revolutions, the
tendency in international,                  as     in national politics, has been to ignore
the proportional or dianemetic                        principle altogether, to give exclusive
sway to the diorthotic principle, and to deal with                                   all states either
as    internationally equal, or else                       as   internationally non-existent.
   As regards the future, then, the question, on which the possibility
or impossibility of international organisation seems to turn is this, —
Can we shadow forth a European or cosmopolitan                                      constitution, self-
sustaining and self-vindicating,                            which shall make provision for
legitimate progress and righteous development, and for inevitable
retrogression, whilst it takes cognizance of existing diversities of
power ?        To anything approaching to a confederation, in the stricter
sense of a single composite state, there       think, the objection    is,
                                                                        I
which exists to all confederations, and of which we have just seen
the consequences so terribly exhibited, first in America and then in
Germany.            In   a    confederation there                 are always two forces at work,
— centrifugal
     a                     force and       a       centripetal force         :   the tendency of the
first of which        is   to   pull       to pieces, and the tendency of the second
of which       is   to centralise      it it   till   it   becomes    a   homogeneous        State.     A
perfect and permanent                  balance between these forces                 I    believe to be
a practical impossibility              ;   and for this reason          I        regard all confedera
tions    as   transitional forms of government.                      I    concur, therefore, in the
latest opinion of Kant, whose great mind was much occupied with
this great subject before  experienced the eclipse which darkened
                                         it
his last days — an opinion in which he was partially anticipated by
Grotius — to the effect that     to the creation, not of
                                               it     is confedera                       a
tion, but of     a   Permanent Congress of Nations, or International Par
liament, that         we must      direct our endeavours.                        Such   a   Congress, I
think, would obviate the errors                    I       have indicated, and might possibly
satisfy the great desideratum                          of a self-vindicating             international
legislature,        if   it   were constituted in                   accordance       with something
approaching the following scheme — 1st, That its meetings should
                                                            :
be    annual, taking place in the autumn, between the sessions of the
various national assemblies                    ;   and that the places of meeting should
beBelgium and Switzerland alternately, or perhaps one of the Swiss
Cantons — say Geneva — set apart as neutral European ground.   2d,
That each State should be represented                                  by    two deputies,      both of
whom should be present at the meetings of the Congress, but one

118                     Proceedings of the Royal Society
of whom only should               be    entitled to speak and to vote.           3d,    That
each State be  entitled to vote in proportion to its real power and
importance, for the time being. 4th, That in order to fix this pro
portion, it be the first business of each Congress to ascertain the
relative importance of each State on the basis, — (a) of population                          ;
(b) of exports                (c) of free revenue.
                       and imports         ;        5th, That each
State be entitled to propose and push to a vote any question of in
ternational politics in which it might                 be interested.     6th,   That each
State be bound to supply a contingent of men, or money, propor
tioned to the number of votes assigned to                    it,   for the purpose of en
forcing the decrees of the Congress,  arms            by     if    necessary.    7th,   That
the representatives    of any State which should make war without the
sanction      of the Congress be excluded from its next meeting and                    ;
that the conduct of such State be judged of in their absence, on                            a
written statement           and oral hearing of counsel, by the representa
tives of the other States.                 8th,   That all purely national questions
be   excluded from the deliberations of the Congress                     ;   but that the
Congress       itself should           determine whether any question              brought
before   it    were or were not                    That civil wars, as
                                           of this kind.     Qth,
opposed to rebellions, be within the jurisdiction of the Congress the                   ;
Congress       itself being entitled to judge what internal commotions
possess the           character    of civil wars.          10th,     That all questions
brought by individual States before the Congress be submitted to                            it
by the representatives of such States, — first scripto, and then viva
voce.    11th, That       a   Judicial Tribunal be constituted, to the decision
of which   it   should be competent for the Congress to remit any matter
which    it   conceived to admit, demand, or to admit of,                 judicial deter
mination.        12th, Thatfinal appeal should lie from this tribunal
                                  a
to the Congress itself, in    manner analogous to that in which the
                                       a
judgments of our supreme courts may be carried to the House of
Lords.        13th,    That the judges of this court be appointed                  by the
Congress,       each State voting in proportion to its real weight, ascer
tained as above.           14th, That the presidents,              both of the Congress
itself and of the judicial tribunal, be appointed                       or re-elected       at
each meeting of the Congress, but that the ordinary judges of the
tribunal should hold their offices ad vitam aut culpam.    15th, That
the presidents and judges, being officers of the Congress, be paid by
the Congress      ;    but that the representatives receive no remuneration,
except such as should be granted                    them by their respective States.

                   of Edinburgh,     Session 1866-67.                    119
1G/A,   That the expenses of the Congress        be defrayed by an     inter
national tax, to  be fixed by the Congress   ; that the said tax be propor
tioned to the number of votes enjoyed for the previous year by each
State, and be levied by the several States on their own inhabitants.
    Many provisions of a more special kind would, of course, suggest
themselves. were the scheme to assume a practical shape            ;  but the
preceding will sufficiently indicate its general character.           A body
which should take cognizance of the real power and importance of
its various members would have a very much better chance of being
accepted in lieu of the verdict      of battle than those of      a body    of
which all the members voted equally.          The chances would then       be
many that individual States would        gain no more by fighting than
by voting;    and to assume that, in such circumstances,        they would
 in general prefer to vote, is surely to credit them with no very
 wonderful measure either of humanity or of wisdom.
       2.  On the Sophists of the Fifth Century, b.c.              By
                           Professor Blackie.
    The object of this paper was to controvert the views of M r Grote
 as stated in his history of Greece and in his work on Plato.            Pro
 fessor Blackie, while admitting that the Sophists might have been
somewhat hardly dealt with by certain          extreme writers in modern
 times, and recognising gladly the view stated by Meiners and Hegel
that their teaching      was an   important and necessary step in the
intellectual development      of Greece, nevertheless maintained that
the current character of the Sophists, as handed down to us from
ancient times, was in the main correct; and that all that could be
said in defence of their teaching amounted to no more than a slight
 palliation of the charges brought against them by Plato and Aristo
phanes, not to an acquittal.       The portrait of the Sophists left us
by these two great writers       was  substantially correct ; and, if any
 man considered their testimony unworthy of credit, it was amply
confirmed in all points by Aristotle, and Xenophon, and Isocrates in
passages of their works, which had been ably analysed by             Mr Cope
of Trinity College, Cambridge, but which Mr Grote had either over
looked altogether, or looked at with eyes of prejudice and obliquity.
Professor Blackie concluded his paper with the following five points
of the Sophistical doctrine,    as he gathered    it from Plato : —

 120              Proceedings of the Boyal Society
    1. General information and alert intelligence without a philo
sophical   basis, or a scientific method      of verification.    2. The art
of public speaking, considered      merely as an instrument of moving
masses of ignorant men with        a view to political advancement,      and
not necessarily connected either with noble motives, earnest purpose,
or business habits.     3.  The exercise of      a dexterous    logic, which
aimed at the ingenious, the         striking,  and the plausible, rather
than the true, the solid, and the judicious.         4. A theory of meta
physics, which, by confounding knowledge with sensation,                 and
subordinating the general to the particular, made wisdom consist
rather in the urgent use of present opportunity than in the moulding
of materials according to an intellectual principle.         5.  A theory of
morals, which, by basing right on convention, not on nature,              de
prived our sensual and animal instincts of the strong control of
reason, and substituted for the eternal instinct of justice in the
human heart the arbitrary enactments of positive law, whose ulti
mate sanction is the intelligent selfishness of the individual.
3.   An Account of         some    peculiarly-shaped Mineral Con
    cretions found near Carlisle. By Henry Barnes, M.D.
    Communicated by Sir David Brewster.
    I have very great pleasure in presenting to the Society's museum
a  few very peculiarly-shaped stones or mineral concretions found
near Carlisle, similar in external characters        to those fairy stones
found in Elwand Water, near Melrose, and described at              a meeting
of this Society, held 5th February 1866, by Sir D. Brewster. These
stones or nodules were found about twenty years ago embedded in
marl in a deep cutting at Wreay, five miles south of Carlisle, during
the formation of the Lancaster and Carlisle Railway.              They were
found in great numbers by the workmen, but only in this particular
cutting, and excited a great deal of curiosity at the time, but were
soon laid aside and forgotten    ;  and   it was not until the account of
those fairy stones described     by Sir D. Brewster appeared, that my
esteemed relative,   Dr T. Barnes, F.R.S.E., remembered that he had
them in his possession, and asked me to present them to the Society.
    They are all of a light colour, presenting     a smooth     surface, and
inodorous when dry.         When breathed upon they emit an argil
laceous odour.     They vary in weight from two to seven ounces.

     On section they are seen to be perfectly homogeneous, presenting
the same uniform structure              showing that the nodules
                                                    throughout,
on the external surface are produced by some external agency act
ing on the surface of the stone. They are probably formed in the
same way as the fairy stones, viz., by the dropping of water con
taining the matter of which they                              are    composed;         but must be of
great age, as the cutting in which                                 they were       found is about one
hundred      yards from the bed of a river.                                The following         are     the
geological      characters              of this part of Cumberland                       in which they
occurred.        It    is situated on the New Red Sandstone, but at Coathill
and Newbiggin                gypsum           is found        lying in red argillaceous                marl
between two strata of sandstone, and at Wreay is the commencement
of the whinstone dyke which extends from that place                                       to   Renwick.

     minants of the Third Order.                                   By the Eev. Hugh Martin,
     M.A.       Communicated by Professor Kelland.
     I   have read with much interest Professor Tait's
                                                       " Note on Deter

(pp. 59-61), and admire                        the method of discovering                   new proper
ties of Determinants.                    I am       not sure, however, that the properties,
when       discovered,            are    more         difficult' of proof            by    Determinant
methods,        and      I       venture      to submit            the following         as simple       and
elementary       :   —

is   true under greater generality,                       and the Determinant proof                 is   the
same as for the special case.

   The third and fourth are immediate translations of Quaternion
expressions into Determinant forms.                      And I suppose there is no
analytical difficulty in enlarging the number of Sir William R.
Hamilton's symbols, i, j, k (though it would introduce the concep
tion of ideal   space    of more dimensions than three), and thus ex
tending the reach of the " Quaternion path" to Determinants of
any order.

 1.  On the Analysis of Compound Ethers.                  By W. Dittmar.
    In  many cases the best guarantee          of the purity of    a chemical
substance    is the method by which         it has been prepared.       If  the
processes are well devised and carefully conducted,           they constitute

                    of Edinburgh, Session 1866-67.                            127
 in themselves    a  qualitative analysis on      a large scale, the exactitude
 and reliability of which go far beyond what could be obtained                 by
 ordinary testing.      This, however,       does  not apply to many organic
 preparations,    and is eminently inapplicable           in the   case  of com
 pound    ethers.    If  in the preparation       of such   an   ether, we start
 with   a pure alcohol and a pure acid, and         carefully distil, wash, and
 redistil the ether produced, the product ultimately obtained may
 contain considerable quantities of alcohol, free acid, and water.
 The purity of    a compound ether          can be established only by direct
 experiment.      Free acid is easily tested for, and even quantitatively
 determined by the well-known acidimetric processes ; the presence
 or absence of water may be proved by an elementary                 analysis, but
 an admixture     of alcohol is not easily established.          An elementary
 analysis would, in a majority of cases, show very little, because the
 difference between the percentages of carbon in the ether and al
 cohol respectively, is usually too small to admit of basing upon a
 small fraction of that difference anything like an exact calculation.
 Thus, for instance, acetate of ethyl contains 54'54 per cent, of
 carbon, and alcohol 52-18 % — the difference is 2-3G; a decrease               of
 0-l % in tne carbon would therefore correspond to an admixture                 of
 about 4 per cent, of alcohol.
    Many years     ago  F. Mohr proposed         a method    for quantitatively
                          "
 testing the officinal       aether   aceticus," which consisted in heating
 the ether in a closed vessel, with an excess of standard alkali, and
 determining the amount of alkali saturated.               The method was in
 1863 extended and improved upon by Berthelot, who seems to have
 employed    it extensively in his researches. The standard alkali
used by Berthelot was caustic baryta, which he heated with the
 ether under examination           in  a glass tube.     On   attempting some
 time ago to employ          Berthelot's method for testing, what          I  had
good reason to     look upon as very pure formiate of ethyl,          I was sur
prised by obtaining perfectly inexplicable results            ; and on subject
ing his process to      a   critical examination,     I found that the discre
pancies in my results arose from the action of the baryta solution on
glass.    When baryta water was heated to 120° C. in sealed-up tubes,
and kept at that temperature for about twenty-four              hours, the glass
was found to be     strongly attacked, and the litre of the baryta solu
tion considerably altered. How Berthelot managed to obtain exact

128                    Proceedings of the Royal Society
results is more than         I can        explain.      Seeing that baryta was not a
reliable reagent for the titration of ethers,                   I   tried    a   solution of car
bonate of sodium, hoping that                   it would not appreciably act on hard
glass, but without success.
  A solution         of the carbonate, when heated in                a sealed-up       tube, took
up enough of alkali from the glass for its titre being increased by about
iVh.         At last   I found   that, of all the available alkaline solutions,
caustic ammonia was the only one which could be safely heated in
sealed-up glass tubes.               In    order to see now          if     ammonia       also was
capableof completely decomposing compound ethers, a series of
experiments was instituted, in which measured quantities of stan
dard     ammonia        (containing           NH3 per litre) were
                                              about    17 grms.
heated with acid acetate of ethyl, containing a known quantity of
acetic     acid.     Such   mixtures were procured                   by heating to 130° —
140J C.      &c, in sealed-up tubes, weighed quantities of glacial acetic
acid, with a large          excess of alcohol, a direct experiment having
shown        that, after    a few hours              heating,   60    "/„   of the acid         em
ployed       was etherified.          The amount           of ammonia              saturated    by
the acid, after        it   had passed into the state of ether,                       was com
pared with that which the same quantity required                                   when    mixed
directly with the alkali.                 Of the results obtained in this manner
some came surprisingly                near      the truth, others differed by               a   per
cent., and some even more                 ;   this
                                                 I      can only explain             by   the fact
well known to chemists who are familiar with titrimetric analysis,
that in the saturation of             a       weak acid with ammonia the point                   of
neutrality      is   not by any means well marked.                    It    may be, also, that
in some cases the ethers had not been completely decomposed.
Although        the conditions under which this method would be sure
to give exact results might, perhaps, be established                             by an extended
investigation,     I    preferred     to go back to using baryta-water,                     as re
commended                        substituting only for the sealed glass
                     by Berthelot,
tubes    a  copper digestor, soldered with sterling silver, and provided
with   a   conical copper stopper, which could be securely fastened by
means of a screw.           The stopper kept perfectly tight, even under                         a
pressure of two atmospheres,                  as was shown by         charging the diges
tor with water, weighing the arrangement,                       keeping      it    at 120° C. for
about four hours, and weighing again.              There was not any loss of
weight observable           by   a   balance turning with two centigrammes.

                     of Edinburgh,           Session 1866-67.                        129
The liquid obtained         by heating           in the digestor         a mixture    of
acetate of ethyl and an excess of baryta- water, did not contain any
appreciable trace of copper.            After these facts had         been established,
a number of experiments were made similar to those carried out for
testing the ammonia method.                  The amount of baryta taken up by
a weighed quantity of partially aetherified acetic acid was found to
be about      to T$5th less that what the same quantity of acid
              ^th
would have saturated when directly mixed with the standard alkali.
This must       be looked upon as a        pretty satisfactory approximation in
experiments       of this kind.          The method would, no doubt, give
much more exact results            if   the excess of baryta was not titrated
directly, but first precipitated by carbonic acid, and then alkali-
metrically determined.      The undecidedness of the end-reaction
observed in titrating a weak organic acid with an alkali would thus
be completely       eliminated.         I   am   now occupied with experiments
in this direction.
     It   was only after the greater part of the facts communicated                   in
this notice hadbeen established that I first saw Mr Wanklyn's paper
" On the Titration of Ethers" in the Chemical Society's Journal.
Mr Wanklyn uses alcoholic potash for decomposing the ethers, and
obtains very satisfactory     But he extended his experiments
                                  results.
to such substances only which can be safely heated in an open
flask, and which are easily decomposed by a short digestion                        with
alcoholic potash.       When alcoholic            potash is heated to 100°        C   in
sealed glass tubes for about twenty-four hours, the glass is so strongly
attacked that there is a regular layer of silica formed.
     I    cannot conclude   without acknowledging the great assistance
which my friend Mr Cranston gave                  me in    carrying out my experi
ments.
2.       On a Derivative of Meconic Acid.                         By Messrs     James
                      Dewar and William Dittmar.
     The meconic acid group of substances has always                     been regarded
as   peculiarly interesting.       Situated, as     it   is,   on the ill-defined limits
of the fatty and aromatic compounds, and exhibiting interesting
isomeric relations with other organic substances, the structure and
derivatives     of the whole group afford ample scope for theoretical
     vol. vi.                                                                 a

 130              Proceedings of the Royal Society
speculation.    Meconic acid has always been considered            a tribasic
acid, which, by the successive elimination of two molecules of car
bonic anhydride, yields first    a  dibasic and then     a monobasic     acid.
But chemists     now know that the basicity       of an acid may be less
than its atomicity, and that even the former cannot be deduced
from the composition of one or two isolated salts, but only from
a comprehensive    view of all the salts and ethers of the acid.           As
now a general review of the salts and ethers of meconic acid seems
to point to an acid with an atomicity greater than its basicity, and
as any additional proof of this constitution would help to explain
many abnormal decompositions         in the series, the authors have in
vestigated the action of the general      reagents     on these compounds
that enable us to distinguish        between    the   basic   and  alcoholic
hydroxyls.     In this  paper we communicate        to the Society some of
the results obtained in the course of our experiments, as a recent
paper, by Baron von Crofft, on the action of nascent hydrogen on
the members of this group, shows that other chemists are working in
the same direction.      The introduction of hydriodic acid and penta-
chloride of phosphorus as general reagents in organic chemistry
has been productive of the         happiest   results,   through the easy
separation   of the water residue, HO. By their use we have ob
tained a  very complete knowledge of the relation of acids, alcohols,
and hydrocarbons,    and we now await the discovery         of some reagent
that will separate the ammonia residues with as great ease, to
obtain a more precise knowledge of the structure of the organic
alkaloids.
   When meconic acid is treated with hydriodic acid of constant
boiling point at 150°    C,  carbonic   anhydride is evolved, and large
quantities of free iodine liberated.     No definite compound could be
separated from the products of this decomposition.              As the first
action of the hydriodic acid was to form comenic acid, and as many
actions succeed with concentrated      hydriodic acid that are unman
ageable with the dilute, we attempted        the reduction by the action
of  a saturated   solution of hydriodic acid on comenic           acid.    As
Berthelot has lately shown that the action of concentrated hydriodic
acid, at high temperatures,    on mono- and bi-basic acids of the fatty
series, regenerates the hydrocarbon      from which they were derived,
the formation   of a hydrocarbon    in this reaction was not impossible.

                     of Edinburgh, Session 1866-67.                             131
But the effect of hydriodic acid on this group is totally different
from its action on the fatty series.      If  comenic acid and concen
trated hydriodic acid are heated to upwards of 200°            C,  large quan
tities of free iodine separate out, mixed with a considerable quantity
of free carbon.      Hydriodic acid, therefore, is inapplicable as a re
ducing agent on these compounds.
    Seeing that no definite      compound    could     be   obtained       by the
agency of hydriodic acid, the action of pentachloride           of phosphorus
did not look very promising.        Under the influence of this reagent,
however, the acid sustained a perfectly regular decomposition,                  and
did not break up in the way one would have anticipated                   from its
general instability in presence of powerful reagents.               If meconic
acid is treated with three molecules of pentachloride          of phosphorus,
hydrochloric acid is slowly given off in the cold         ; and   if  the retort
containing the substance      be heated to 100°      C,   the reaction takes
place with great rapidity, torrents of hydrochloric acid are evolved,
and oxychloride of phosphorus (PC1,0) distilled over.               In   order to
separate the oxychloride of phosphorus, the whole              was heated for
some hours to 130° C. in a current of dry carbonic anhydride.                  Ter-
chloride of meconyl remained as an intensely red, non- volatile, semi
solid substance, fuming in air, and decomposible by water, with the
 formation    of an intensely dark-brown liquid.             Several organic
analyses of this substance were made, but as it was found impos
                        ....
sible to free     it from all traces of phosphorus, perfectly agreeing
results could not be obtained.

As analysis did not give a satisfactory proof of the carbon group
remaining entire in this reaction, .a direct experiment was made
with the view of estimating the amount of carbonic anhydride
evolved.     For this purpose a special apparatus was devised, by
means of which the amount of any permanent gas produced during
the reaction could be estimated.       To effect this, the retort contain
ing the substance was connected with        a tubulated      receiver, to con
dense the oxychloride of phosphorus,         and this joined to a small
gasometer containing a saturated        solution    of chloride     of sodium.

132                        Proceedings of the Royal Society
Daring the action we did not observe any gas collecting in the
receiver. After the reaction the gases in the retort and condenser
were swept into the gasometer by a current of dry hydrogen.   Any
hydrochloric acid gas was immediately absorbed by the water, and
the residual gases were then made to pass through a series of U
tubes filled with soda-lime,                    in order to estimate the carbonic anhy
dride by weight.                 Only      a trace    of carbonic anhydride could        be de
tected     ;   nothing like          a molecule       was evolved.
     When the terchloride of meconyl was treated with water, hydro-
chlorio acid was produced with much frothing, and the whole dis
solved to an intensely brown            When this action took place
                                                  liquid.
in the apparatus formerly described, large quantities of carbonic an
hydride could easily be detected.      Many attempts were made to
produce definite salts of the acid formed in this reaction, but without
success.  When the acid liquid was thrown upon a dialyser, the
whole of the hydrochloric acid diffused out ; a dark brown solution
of the acid remained.   This acid solution, when boiled with strong
nitric acid, in presence of nitrate of silver, produced chloride of
silver, and        is,   therefore,     a   chlorinated compound.            Although the acid
is   a   lower derivative of meconic acid, the presence of chlorine shows
that the three atoms of chlorine replacing the water-residues are not
retained with equal degrees of force.     The dark brown solution
was completely decolourised                      by the action of sodium amalgam.
     When comenic                acid      was treated       with pentachloride of phos
phorus,        a   chloride more intractable than that formerly described
was obtained.
     As pyromeconic              acid contains the simplest form of the charac
teristic nucleus of the whole group,                     a   knowledge of the structure of
this substance would throw great light on the constitution of the
meconic acid series.                  If   a   careful examination be made of the gene
ral properties of pyromeconic                     acid, we can hardly characterise       it   as
a   real acid.No doubt salts can be formed, but with great difficulty                         ;
and the fact of  not combining with the alkalies or alcohol radicals,
                          it
shows that         it    bears   a   great analogy to pyrogallic acid.             If we com
pare the formulae of pyromeconic                       and pyrogallic acids, they would
appear to be members of                     a   homologous     series   ;   and as we know by
synthesis that pyrogallic acid                   istrihydroxyl-benzol, the pyromeconic
acid may be looked               upon as         bearing the same relation to   hydroa

carbon, C5H4, below benzol.         From our general     knowledge of this
class  of compounds we would expect the formation, by the action of
pentachloride of phosphorus, of a chloride of a hydrocarbon.            We
investigated this reaction on the small quantity of pyromeconic acid
we had at our disposal.         When pyromeconic acid, in presence of
oxychloride of phosphorus, was heated in a sealed tube to 200° C.
with an excess of pentachloride of phosphorus, and the result of
the   action treated with water,       a brown   oil separated out, which,
when distilled, yielded a colourless oil that boiled above 200° C.
This substance did not fume in the air, and remained in water with
out dissolving for days.       The analysis gave somewhat anomalous
results,  the percentages     of its constituents agreeing very exactly
with the formula CJgH5Cl,Os.           This highly chlorinated substance
seems to approach nearly to the chloride of a hydrocarbon.
   Unfortunately, pyromeconic acid is a substance which cannot be
easily investigated,    as  it is extremely difficult to procure in any
quantity.    In the course of our experiments we obtained only one
per cent- of pyromeconic       from   meconic   acid, so that until a better
process for preparing this substance        is discovered,  it must remain
an open question      whether pyromeconic acid is a lower homologue
of pyrogallic acid.
3.  On the Action of Ammonia              on Dichloracetone.        By Dr
                             A. Crum Brown.
   This paper contains some further details of the properties and
composition    of the substance mentioned in a former note (Proceed
ings, vi. 75).
   The substance is produced by the action of dry ammonia gas on
dichloracetone.      A low temperature favours its formation. It
forms colourless     needles, generally radiating from central points.
It is extremely unstable,        and can only be preserved     in an atmo
sphere of dry ammonia.         In  vacuo over sulphuric acid, even at a
temperature    of 0°  C, it   decomposes into ammonia, dichloracetone,
and   a viscous    substance,     which has a smell recalling that of
acetamide.      The same decomposition           takes place in dry air.
Hydrochloric acid converts it into dichloracetone and chloride of
ammonium. It may be fused in an atmosphere of dry ammonia,

134                Proceedings of the Royal Society
and sublimes readily at temperatures far below its fusing point.       The
point of fusion was found to be about 45° C.          When exposed to      a
slightly   higher temperature it boils with partial         decomposition,
leaving a slight trace of chloride of ammonium.              Owing to the
readiness    with    which    it decomposes,      great  difficulties  were
experienced     in its analysis, and the results have hitherto been
somewhat discordant.         They lead to the formula, CjH^Cl3N3O, or
C3HtCl,O + 2NEL,, and it is possible that it may be the represen
tative in the acetic series of the hydrochlorate of flavine.
    The author is at present engaged in the further examination of
 this substance and the products of its decomposition.

    Monsieur,   — Les   semaines passées   j'ai trouvé quelques faits dans
 le sel gemme et le spath d'Islande, que je prends la liberté de vous
 communiquer,      parceque je m'imagine, qu'il n'y a personne au
  monde, qui saurait mieux apprécier la valeur des petites choses qui
  se sont offertes à moi.
     Dans le sel gemme il y a un clivage ou passage multiple, omis
  à tort par les minéralogistes,     qui jouit des proprietès singulières
                          et qui jetera peut     être quelque   lumière sur
                          le phénomène, de la "polarisation lamellaire."
                          Ce passage suit les faces du granatoëdre       ou
                          dodecaèdre régulier.     En pressant un morceau
                          carré, dont deux arêtes opposées sont enlevées
              <(
                   \.     par la lime, on obtient par une pression modique
                          un passage brillant suivant la diagonale.
  Mais  on peut avoir les six passages dodecaedriques tous à la fois en

passent par le point frappé, des condensations permanentes, cause de
phénomènes       de polarisation bien connus     par vous (" Treatise on
Optics," page 281, 282).       Les six directions, suivant lesquelles les
condensations se font avec la plus grande facilité paraissent          être
parallèles   aux grandes diagonales    des rhombes du dodecaèdre.
    En pressant des pièces convenables sur les faces du cube ou mieux
suivant quatre faces limées sui

dans la lumière polarisée des phé
nomènes     qui rapellent, quoique
imparfaitement, ceux de la polari
sation, lamellaire, car jamais on ne réussira à réaliser un etat de com
pression uniforme, indispensable pour avoir les effets de l'alun.        La
meilleure expérience,      que j'aie pu trouver est la sui
 vante  : on perce un trou de quelques millimètres dans
 une plaque carrée, en tournant le foret (a métal
 doucement     entre les doigts.

 les diagonales.
    Sur les faces octaëdrique du spath fluor, attaquées par le poinçon,
j'ai plusieurs fois observé des clivages normaux aux cotés du triangle
 isocèle, qui correspondent    aux surfaces du granatoëdre.     Sur l'alun,
dont je n'avais que de très mauvais échantillons, je n'ai encore rien
vu de distinct, mais je ne manquerai          pas de poursuivre mes re
cherches.       En attendant je suis porter        à soupçonner,    que   la
 " polarisation lamellaire"
                               pourrait être due aux condensations per
manentes et uniformes suivant les passages dodecaëdriques, les pres
sions étant dues ou à des forces extérieures,        ou à l'act de la cris

avec les vues, que vous vous êtes formées sur la véritable cause
de ces phénomènes.
   Quant au spath d'Islande je prends la liberté de vous rappeler vos
observations sur cette substance (Treat- on Optics, pp. 254-256, et
pp. 349-351)     ;  de plus je vous prierai de jeter un coup d'oeil sur un
mémoire de       Fr. Pfaff à Erlangen, dans PoggendorfFs Annalen,
band 107, p. 336, et band 108, p. 599.                     En rapprochant ces
deux choses on est poussé vers ce résultat singulier, qu'il doit être
                                    " twin-films," dans ce cristal
possible, défaire naître des                                               par une
pression suffisante.        Or c'est ce que j'ai fait par douzaines de fois
dans le dernier temps.          On prend un prisme de spath, rhombique
ou rhomboidique, on y lime des surfaces planes parallèles et nor
males aux arêtes longues du prisme, on y colle des petits cartons et
l'on met le prisme         dans une presse à mâchoires            parallèles.     En
pressant    doucement vous aurez un à trois passages, correspondant
au rhomboèdre        obtus, et ces passages ne sont pas ordinairement
des clivages,      mais de véritables * twin films."            Ce fait singulier
m'a rappelé     l'albite, le labrador,      qui sont si terriblement maclès
(twin films) et pourrait donner quelques indication sur la cause
de la formation de differents twin-cristaux dans la nature.                   Quant
aux twin-films du spath d'Islande je suis persuade, qu'il sont
tous dûs à une pression         extérieure   soit dans le lieu de leur nais
sance, soit dans les mains de celui qui maltraite les cristaux en les
clivant.

   d'abord sur la ligne MmnN, se trouve transportée sur la ligne brisée

   planes, qu'elles donnent des images mésurables au goniomètre.

 vrai, qu'une pression suffisante et poussée jusque                 à    la séparation
 des molécules,       peut   produire    des   clivages    miroitants dans le sel

 avant la rupture, me parait être tout autre chose que ce qui s'opère
dans un clivage ordinaire.           Je    soupçonne,      que suivant ces plans,
qui sans doute existent dans tous les cristaux, les molécules                       sont
singuliérement disposées, non             à se séparer,      mais à prendre        dans
des directions déterminées          des nouvelles      positions d'équilibre sous
l'influence    de pressions      extérieures,     et cela sans solution de con
tinuité.     Voilà un problème qu'il s'agit d'approfondir et auquel je
crois  a peine   avoir touché.
    La preuve    de ce que les lames, dues à            la pression,     ne sont pas
des clivages, mais bien des véritables twin-lames, est très simple.

1.   On the Nature and Character of European Winter Storms,
    with the best means of giving Warning of their Approach.
    By R. Russell, Esq.
    The object of this paper was to show the true character of storms,
illustrated by those of 2d, 3d, and 4th December 1863. It was
pointed    out that the mode usually adopted of laying down the iso-
barometric     lines was calculated to present an erroneous view of their
figure or form.        The laying down representative lines in round
numbers of 5 millemetres in each, or in two-tenths of an inch of
barometric      readings,  lead deceptively to the conclusion that the
areas of least pressure were circular or elliptical.
    It was then shown that the lines of equal pressures were ribbed
into the latitudinal line of minimum barometer, which was usually

                      of Edinburgh,       Session 1866-67.                    141
 found     running    north and south, sometimes            nearly  straight, but
often curved, with its convex side towards the east.               The minimum
 line of barometer was easily fixed by consulting the self-register
 ing barometers.       The minimum line of barometer was shown to have
 been on the meridian of London at             8 a.m. of the 3d December, and
 apparently nearly straight from Algiers to the Orkney Islands.
 The barometer along the line of minimum barometer gradually
 descended      from   upwards     of   30  inches in Algiers       to 29 inches
 a  little to the south of London.             From London to the Shetland
 Islands the minimum barometer was isobarometric in its character
 — the pressure varying little over a distance of 600 miles.                  The
 isobarometric     lines were shown to run parallel to each other over
 Spain,     the  Mediterranean, and south           of France, and joined to
 the minimum line at an obtuse angle.                 Where the difference of
 pressure on the latitudes from the middle of France to the south
 of England was considerable,          they were ribbed in from both sides
 at acute angles.       "Where the minimum line assumed the character
 of an isobarometric      line, the isobarometric       lines on the east were
 nearly straight and parallel to each other.            On the west, they were
 much of the same character,          especially   about a hundred miles west
of the minimum line.            It was shown that curved lines could not be
put in over       France on the      3d    December     storm, according to the
barometrical      readings    as given in the Paris Bulletins.
    The isobarometric       lines were shown to have been similar in their
character on the morning of the 2d           ;  that, however, they were flatly
ribbed     into the minimum          line of barometer        over    France  and
England, and corresponded with the diagrams of the self-register
ing barometers at Oxford, Kew, and Greenwich.                  The effects of the
storm     of the 3d, then out into the Atlantic, were shown on the
lines in contrast with those of the latter date.
    It was    shown that the winds on the west side of the              minimum
barometer      were from the west and north-west — the only exception
to    this being over the north of France              and south     of England,
where south-west winds were observed at those stations where the
isobarometric lines were kneed in towards the minimum line of baro
meter.       At those places they mostly blew right across the isobaro
metric lines. At other places to the west the winds blew obliquely
or directly across these lines towards the minimum barometer.

 142                Proceedings of the Royal Society
   Along the line of minimum barometer, where it was almost iso-
harometric,     the winds either lulled or fell down to a calm on its
passage from west to east, both on the 2d and 3d December.                    On
the morning of the 2d, calms and         light winds prevailed for several
hours from the north of Scotland to the south of England.                   The
winds to the east were shown to have blown from easterly quarters
obliquely or directly across the isobarometric lines towards the calms
and line of low barometer       — the winds       to the west, across the iso
barometric    lines, also towards the calms and line of low barometer.
   The winds on the west were comparatively cold and dry, raising
the barometer,       while on the east they were relatively moist and
warm, and attended with rains and          falling barometer.
   Over the south and easterly         parts of France        the   winds were
from    southerly quarters up to the line of low barometer, which
apparently ran nearly north and south at 8 a.m. on the 3d betwixt
Rochefort and Bordeaux.          The winds in the south-east of the line
were then light, but blowing across the isobarometric             lines, but in
the north strong, where the difference           in the pressure on the lati
tudes became great.
   The storm of the 2d December             travelled rapidly from west to
east from the north of Scotland       to the south      of Europe — the baro
meters all rising on the passage of the line of low barometer, very
sharply   as far north    as  Utrecht, Munich, and Vienna;           as  well  as
at Geneva, Marseilles, and Rome.            It  reached    Rome    and Ancona
at 8 a.m. of 3d, with wind and rain.               The self-registering baro
meters at Prague and Cracow showed             that the rise was only slight
at both these places.
   During the 2d the barometers continued to fall slowly over Nor
way and Sweden.          On the morning of the 3d, however, after the
barometers had again fallen rapidly after midnight over the south
of Europe, the rise of the barometer was general over the whole of
Europe.
   The line of low barometer was over Liverpool              at  6 a.m.  of 3d   ;
Oxford at 6.45     ;  Nottingham at 7.45     ; Greenwich at 8.12      ; Brussels
at 11 ;  Utrecht at noon    ; Geneva at 4.20; St Bernard, Marseilles, and
Munich at     6 ; and Prague at 8.       At    9   p.m. the  barometers    from
Haparanda, at the head of the Gulf of Bothnia, to about 50 miles
east of Prague, attained their minimum.               It passed Vienna at 10,

                     of Edinburgh, Session 186G-G7.                        143
  Buda at midnight, and Cracow at       1 a.m.  of the 4th.    On this occasion
  the line of low barometer was largely curved on its passage over the
  Alps, having only reached Florence at 9 a.m. of the 4th, and Rome
  at 2 p.m. The effect of the Alps in sometimes delaying the kisb of
  the harometer in      Italy, hut not the fall, was formerly pointed out
  by the author to Signor Matteucci — the cause of the Alps and
  mountains     of Norway in sometimes delaying the rise of the baro
  meter, is alluded to as an interesting fact for discussion.
    The storms of      2d and 3d    December both travelled       rapidly from
 west to east over Europe.         They  were shown to have had no such
 erratic    course as some had been led to suppose.               That of the
 3d, in which the rise of the barometer          was general     over Europe,
 was shown, by the self-registering barometers              and observations,
 taken     at different   hours,  to have travelled    with great rapidity.
 Over Norway and Sweden it was upwards of fifty miles                 an  hour,
 and about the same from Greenwich         to Cracow.     The rate of motion
 was less in the lower latitudes, being 45 miles an hour from Paris
 to Munich, 37 from Rochefort to Geneva, 34 from Bordeaux to
 Marseilles, and only 3 ) miles an hour from Florence to Rome.
    The winds blew obliquely or directly towards the low barometer
 when    it was to the westward, and in the opposite direction when it
 was to the east.     The bending of the isobarometric line in its passage
 across the Alps produced a hurricane        from the north at Rome after
 2 p.m.   of the 4th, in consequence of the westerly cold current being
pressed down        towards the south by the higher barometers            then
 existing in the north.
    The easterly progression of storms is due to the westerly current
that generally prevails, as an upper or under current in extra-tropi
cal latitudes.      Henry and Herschel consider this         a counterpart   or
return of the trades of the tropics.       The author is not satisfied with
this explanation, but in the meantime cannot give             a better.
    The high west winds at Liverpool and all places           to the south, on
the morning of the 2d December, was caused by a descent of the
upper westerly current, and they blew with great force for four or
five hours at the earth's surface.     There   was a calm behind them and
a calm    in front.   The self-registering anemometers at Liverpool and
Utrecht, which are not far from being on the same latitude, showed
that the strong winds from the west lasted about the same time at

  144               Proceedings of the Royal Society
  both places.     It  was merely a repetition of the same phenomena
 along the same latitude.
    On the 3d the westerly wind prevailed             more generally on the
 surface of the earth, modified into north and north-west winds, as the
 pressure required to be equalised.          The winds over any great space
 do not blow      to a   centre, but to the calms and light winds along
 the line of minimum barometer.               It was shown that a minimum
 point or space of barometric pressure existed, on the line of low
 barometer, over the south of Scotland and north of England on the
 3d December.        This caused     a  centripetal action of the winds    as it
 passed from west to east.          They blew to the low barometer from
 the  N.E. over the Firth of Forth, and gradually veered round to
 N. and N.W. as the low barometer passed on toward the east. The
 winds to the south, on the contrary, veered from S.E. round by S.
 and S.W., till the arrival of the cold north-westerly current.
    The minimum barometer             is propagated, and cannot     strictly be
 said to travel.     It  is merely the western edge of the south-westerly
current, which prevails         as  a   middle current,    probably not more
 than 15,000 feet from the earth's surface.          It is this south-westerly
 current that brings the moisture and comparatively high tempera
 ture which is found east of the line of low barometer.           The easterly
winds, which are of no great depth, ascend into this south-westerly
current, not over       a given   elongated    space, as Espy supposed, but
over the whole area where they blow and the barometers are falling.
The existence of south-west         winds on St Bernard's,     8200 feet above
the level of the sea, while easterly winds prevail over the plains of
Europe during the falling barometers in the December                 storms, is
appealed to as decisive of the views which have been long held by
the Author on this point.
    The latitudinal line of minimum barometer represents that space
where the air from the surface of the earth to the top of the atmo
sphere    is   warmest      on  any latitude, and consequently lightest.
The air is abnormally heated by the condensation of vapour in
its upper    beds,  which has the effect of propelling the air from the
south-west     above, and from easterly quarters          below.   The heated
air of the upper surface of the south-west           middle current is swept
off towards the east, and causes the high pressure in Eastern Europe,
such as prevailed      there on the morning of the 2d December,           when

                   of Edinburgh,      Session 1866-67.                     145
the barometer was low in Western Europe.                  The same principle
that regulates the sea-breeze on our coasts            in   summer, regulates
the motions    of the winds in storms.
   The south-westerly current that blows above in the high latitude
is usually felt at the surface in France and the Mediterranean eight
or ten hours before the passage of the minimum barometer.                    It
blows    obliquely across the      isobarometric     lines,   and,  in contra
distinction to Espy's views, obliquely from the line of minimum
barometer.      When the difference of pressure is great betwixt the
isobarometric lines, the wind blows violently from the south, at
first changing to the south-west, on the passage of the low baro
meter, and then to the west and north-west, becoming                  a part of
the general cold and dry current which raises the barometer.
    The cold and dry current prevailing from the west, causing the
rise of the barometer, imparts form to the line of minimum baro
meter.     This line is of great length, and frequently nearly straight,
 and for obvious reasons, when bent, it can only be largely bent with
its convex side towards        the  east.    It  is often    greatly curved in
the slow- moving       storms   of autumn, when          north-easterly rainy
winds are largely developed on the north-eastern             part of storms.
   In  regard to storm- warning,     it was contended that,       as storms  all
issued out of the Atlantic,       a day and     night watch at Valentia, on
the west coast of Ireland, was indispensable to give warning of such
rapidly-moving      storms as those of December           1863.    That storms
all travelled from west to east was established              eighty years ago,
through the labours of the Meteorological Society of the Palatinate,
and   had    been completely verified       by   the   experience    of Signor
 Matteucci, the distinguished director of the Meteorological Depart
ment   in Italy. Every country in Europe must watch the develop
ment of storms as they pass to the east on the latitudes on which

breakings up in our weather may       be telegraphed     from Newfoundland.
  2.  On the Vapour Lines in the Spectrum.                    By Sir David
                          Brewster, K.H., F.E.S.
   In  the year 1842     I  discovered    that the luminous and brilliant
lines in the spectrum      of certain flames, since called vapour lines,
corresponded    to certain dark lines in the solar spectrum.

   This observation was made for the first time by the spectrum
produced by the deflagration of nitre, and          I afterwards   found that
this was   a property belonging to every such flame.*
   This result was obtained from experiments made at St Andrews
in 1842, on nearly 180 substances, deflagrated in a platina cup by
a mixture of oxygen and coal gas.           A notice of these experiments
was read at the meeting of the British Association at Manchester
in 1842. The journal containing them was laid before the Physi
cal Section, and one or two of the more interesting results were pub
lished in the reports of the Association for that year.            The object
of these experiments was merely to discover new facts for future
investigation, and hence the place of the bright lines was simply
estimated by the eye.       Other pursuits, of   a less laborious    kind, pre
vented   me from determining the           exact places of these lines in
those flames     where     their number     and    position were most re
markable,    but this will now       be   better   done   by some of those
numerous observers who are working so successfully             with the spec
troscope.
   The following specimens of these observations will show their
limited character, and how far they may be useful and suggestive
to future observers     : —
   1. In  the Chlorides of     Tin  and Lead.     The whole spectrum was
covered with splendid lines, the double line D being conspicuous.
   2. In   the Ammonio-Chloride         of Platinum.      The colour of the
flame yellow, and fine lines chiefly in the red and green spaces.
   3. Acetate   of Strontites.    Colour of the flame yellow. Fine red
and orange lines near D, and one fine blue line, and an extreme red.
   4. Acetate   of Lime.       Flame brown.        Many fine lines, and a
large green and red one on each side of D.
   5. Chromate    of Ammonia.       Fine  green and red bands near       D.
   6. Lithoxanthate     of Ammonia.      Fine lines throughout the whole
spectrum,    with  a fine bright blue band.
   7. Superacetate    of Lime.    A  fine blue line in the extreme violet;
and an orange and green band equidistant from D.
   8. Tartrate    of Potash     and   Antimony.       Flame    brilliant   blue.
The extreme red finely insulated.

 the green, and a very remarkable and bright one in the yellow
 close to D.       There    are  lines also in the red, and the yellow light
 is unusually copious.

     3. On the Radiant Spectrum.                By Sir David Brewster,
                                    K.H., F.R.S.
     I have given the name           of Radiant Spectrum to      a phenomenon
 which    I  discovered    in 1814, and which      I described  to this Society
 in the early part of that year.
    It  will  be understood     from fig. 1, which represents      the brilliant
radiation which surrounds           a very small image of the sun, when it
is formed either by reflection         or refraction, or otherwise.
    If  we now form a spectrum of this radiant image, either by a
prism or by diffraction,        we   shall have the radiant spectrum shown
in fig   2, where   MN     is the spectrum of the small circular image S,
                   Fig. 1.                             Fig.  2.
and    AB     the  spectrum      of the radiation, the centre of which is
beyond the violet, and nearly in the place where the intensity of
the chemical or invisible rays is a maximum.
    Id  order to analyse this compound radiation, let the image of the

148                      Proceedings          of the Royal         Society
sun S, fig. 1, be taken from homogeneous                            red light     It,   fig.    3,   and
refracted by the prism, we shall have its radiation ab at                                      a   little
distance from the bright portiou                   R,   as in fig.    3.       In homogeneous
yellow light        T,   fig.   4,   the   radiation   ab   will   be at   a   greater distance
from    Y      than in the red light.              In       homogeneous         violet light V,
fig.   5,    the radiation ab will be at          a    greater distance from            V      than in
the yellow light.
   If      we now refract      laterally these homogeneous radiant spectra,
fig.   3    will   be   changed into fig.    fig. into fig.
                                                 6,         and fig.
                                                            4         into 7,                   5
fig.   thus proving that the radiant portion of the spectra consists
        8,
of rays more refrangible than the portion ItY and       from which               V

it is derived, and that the difference between the refractive indices
of these portions increases with the refrangibility of the rays at
RY and V.
   The compound spectrum MN, AB, fig. 2, is therefore composed
of all these separate spectra, and if we refract it laterally, as shown
in fig.                 oblique radiant spectrum M'N'A'B', thus
          9, we produce the
proving that the radiant image consists of rays more refrangible
than the homogeneous    light from which it is derived.
   In a rude experiment with a prism of flint glass, whose mean
index of refraction was 1-596, the index of the extreme violet was
1"610, and that of the centre of the radiant image l-640.
  In     the preceding experiments the radiation is produced                   by the
action, on the retina, of the small and bright image of the sun                     ;
but the same results are obtained, and more distinctly exhibited,
by placing a surface of finely-ground                glass either on the front of
the prism, or behind            it,   and near the eye.
  The existence of             a    radiant image beyond the violet end of the
spectrum,       as   in fig.   2,   isa fact difficult to explain.Ihave had an
opportunity of describing, or showing                it   to several   distinguished
philosophers — to the Marquis Laplace and M. Biot in the autumn
of 1814, and more recently to others, by some of whom the ex
periments have been repeated, but no explanation of them has
been suggested,          excepting the untenable one that the separation
of the radiant image from the ordinary spectrum                        might   be the
result    of parallax.
  A  better theory, and one of great interest,             if
                                               true, may be sought
in the phenomena of fluorescence, discovered in sulphate of quinine
by   Sir John Herschel,               and in fluor spar and other substances by
myself, and in the beautiful explanation of them by Professor
Stokes.  In this theory the invisible radiation of the chemical
rays     is   rendered    visible by being scattered by granular surfaces,
just as the invisible chemical rays in the ordinary spectrum are
rendered visible by being reflected and scattered by the particles of
fluorescent bodies.

         4. On the        Vibration of        a   Uniform Straight Spring.
                                By Edward Sang, Esq.
   In this     paper the solution of the well-known and hitherto refrac
tory problem,
                         " to investigate the law of motion of                         a    uniform
elastic plate," is presented as an example of the application of the
theory of primaries to physical research.                         This problem, on account
of its importance in the theory of acoustics, has attracted                                         the
attention of the most celebrated mathematicians.
   If we     suppose a physical elastic           line, flexible only in one plane,
to have a number of masses                  fixed at intervals along it — if we in
vestigate     the law         of the motions of these masses — and                         if,   there
after, we imagine the              masses to be indefinitely                    subdivided and
their parts distributed along the intervals, we shall arrive at the
law of vibration of an elastic plate.  Now, when we examine the
general features of the vibration of such                         a   discrete series, we dis
cover that every motion of which                  it   is   susceptible        may be regarded
as the    combination of simple movements, the number of which                                       is
equal to the number of the connecting ties                            ;    these simple move
ments being such that,            if   one of them           existed alone, all the parts
of the series would come simultaneously into their mean positions.
The demonstration of this theorem        identic with that which
                                                            is
was given       in   a    paper on linear vibration read before the Society
during the session 1856-57, and therefore omitted from the present
paper.     From this theorem            it   follows, that the trembling of                  a    con
tinuous spring must be composed of an infinity of simple vibrations,
each of which            is   performed      in its own peculiar periodic time.
Hence our attention must               be    given to the characters of a simple
vibration.
  In     order that       a number of bodies may perform simultaneous
oscillations,   it   is   necessary that their tendencies to return to their
mean positions be proportional to their distances from these posi
tions, and to their masses jointly.                    Hence,         if   a   number of equal
masses be arranged             uniformly      along     a        thin elastic uniform bar,
the form which that bar assumes when making                                a   simple vibration
must be such that the pressures                   necessary to retain             it   at rest      in
that shape    are    proportional to the distances from the mean position.

That      is,   the pressure at           A     must be proportional           to the ordinate             Aa,
the pressure at            B    to the ordinate                 B5, and so on.                 Now,   if   the
ordinates        Aa, B6, Cc,             T)d,    &a,      were       in arithmetical progression,
there would be no flexure at any of the points                                 ;    the flexure         is,   in
fact, proportional              to the second difference                   of the ordinates            ;    for
example, the flexure                 at   D     is   proportional        to the second difference
of the three ordinates                    Cc,   Do*,      Ee, or to Cc     -   2Dd        +    Ee.    Again,
when      a    straight bar         is slightly bent by pressures applied at three
points, the flexures at               equidistant intermediate points are in arith
metical progression             ;    that    is   to say,      if   at the point    D     no pressure be
applied, the flexure                at   D   must be an arithmetical mean between
those at        C   and   E.     When pressure                  is   applied   at    D, that pressure
must be proportional                 to the second difference of the flexures at                              C
and    E,     and consequently               to the       fourth difference of the ordinates
at   B,   C,    D,   E,   and   F.
     Hence the characteristic                    property of the form assumed by such
a discrete series when making                        a    simple vibration          is,   that the length
of any ordinate, as dD, must be proportional                              to the     fourth difference
of the five ordinates of which                       it   is   the middle one.
     In   passing from              the discrete series of masses                     to the concrete
bar, the differences of the various orders are replaced by the deri
vatives of the same orders, and hence the general character of the
curve assumed by an elastic bar when making                                    a     simple vibration
is   this, " that the ordinate at any point of the curve                                  is   proportional
to its fourth derivative,                 the abscissa being the primary;"                           and this
statement contains the complete solution of the problem.
   Putting x for the abscissa, and  for the ordinate, of the curve,

calculus of primaries ; the object of that calculus being to discover
the    relation of the primary variable to the function, when the
relation subsisting between that function and its derivative is
known.       It    also shows that the function belongs           to the class     of
recurring functions of the fourth order             ;   and that, therefore,     the
equation
               <px  - y = AQ?       +  BQ*      +
                                                    OQf       +  D0?
represents the form of the curve           in every possible       case   of simple
vibration    ;   A, B, C, D being coefficients, having fixed ratios to
each other, and I being a length depending on the relation of the
linear unit to the dimensions of the system.
   It only remains to apply this general formula to particular cases.
The end of an elastic bar may be held firmly as in a vice, it may
be entirely free, and it may be touched, but without any angular
tension   ;  and these three conditions may be combined                  at the two
ends of the bar, thus making in all six distinct cases, as under,
viz. —
   Case 1.     When the elastic bar is held firmly by one end, the other
                     end being free.
   Case 2.     When both ends      are free.
   Case 3.     When both ends      are  held fast.
   Case 4.     When one end is free, the other touched.
   Case 5.     When one end is held, the other touched.
   Case 6.     When both ends are touched.
Now, when the end of the bar is held fast, both the ordinate and
its derivative must       be zero for that end    ;     when the end is free, the
second     and third     derivatives must be zeroes there            ;  and   lastly,
when the end is touched without angular tension, the ordinate and
its second derivative must each be zero               ;  and therefore the pecu
liarities of the equations       applicable   to the various     cases are     easily
found.
                                      Case  I.
   In   the first and most familiar      case, when the elastic bar is          held
firmly by one end, it is easily shown that            if X  be the  entire length,

the zero being placed at the fixed end, we must have           A = 0, B = 0,
while the coefficients C and D must satisfy the two conditions
which give
from which     equation the ratio    -r has to be determined.
   Denoting this ratio by p„ we observe that p, has an infinite num
ber of values corresponding to the infinite number of simple vibra
tions of which the system is susceptible, and that the times of
these vibrations are as the squares of the different values of I thence
resulting.    This general equation of condition may also be put
into the form
                         GK - EK              --   1 ;
and the equation of the curve becomes

   In this  case the equation    of condition becomes

2. On the Effect           of Reduction of Temperature on the
     Coagulation of the Blood. By John Davy, M.D., F.R.SS.
     Lond. and Edin.
    In   an excellent    little work recently published        on elementary
physiology,* its author, when treating of the blood and its coagula
tion, remarks that a low temperature retards its coagulation ; and
that " blood kept at the freezing-point of water will not coagulate
at all." He adds :
                         " Blood thus
                                           kept fluid will, however, coagu
late    when    its temperature      is raised;   and blood   has been   thus
cooled and warmed       till near coagulation     for three successive times
without losing its coagulability."
    That the lowering the temperature of the blood retards its coagu
lation is now unquestionable ; but the statement that it does not
coagulate at all at the freezing-point of water, is new to me.            Not
aware that      it has   been    the subject of experimental       inquiry,  I
thought it right to make some trials to endeavour to determine
   • Lessons on Elementary      Physiology.    By Thomas   H. Huxley, LL.D.,

158               Proceedings of the Royal Society
whether the blood can, indeed,      be retained  in its liquid form in the
manner stated.
   The trials  I have  instituted have been of two kinds— one by re
ceiving blood in    a cooled vessel, cooled by snow, and        kept in snow   ;
the other, by receiving    it in a vessel of low temperature in a freez
ing mixture of salt and snow, and, when frozen, transferring it to
snow, with the intent to see whether, after thawing (the freezing-
point of blood being lower than that of water) it would continue
liquid or would coagulate.
   The results of both trials — and they were more than once made
— were negative.      The blood used was that of the sheep, procured
at the slaughter-house ; the quantity (the subject of the experi
ment) half a cubic inch ; and the vessels into which it was received,
tubes of thin glass about half an inch in diameter.
   So small a quantity of blood was employed             on account of the
greater facility of lowering its temperature, whether to the freezing-
point of water, or to the lower degree requisite for the freezing of
the blood itself.
   As regards the first mode of trial, in each instance, the blood in
snow, at a temperature of 32° or 33° F., was found coagulated in
about a quarter of an hour.        The coagulum      was somewhat softer
than had the coagulation been more rapid without any interference
— i. e., in about two minutes.
   As regards the second mode of trial, the coagulum formed after
the thawing     of the frozen blood was also softer than common                ;
and the more so,    it seemed, the longer the blood had been kept in
the frozen state previous to liquefaction, as       if  the fibrin had thus
been rendered less contractile.
   The parts of the quotation given, in which it is said that blood
kept fluid at the freezing-point of water will coagulate when its
temperature is raised, and       may  be " cooled and warmed till near
coagulation for three or four successive times,"         I    do not,   I  must
confess, well comprehend.
   That blood may be rapidly frozen in small quantity, and rapidly
thawed, and this more than once,        I ascertained    many years ago ;*
and  just now, using sheep's blood,       I  have   had the        results con-

 firmed.      In  the space of one hour, a cubic inch of blood was frozen
 and liquefied four different times.          The vessel in which it was first
 frozen     was   a  thin drinking cup about two inches in diameter.
 For the sake of rapid effect, it had been kept some time previously
 in a freezing mixture ; and the blood, as soon as liquefied, waa
 poured into a tube similarly cooled in            the same mixture, to bo
again frozen,      — and   so on  in succession.
      These results,    I need hardly remark, are little more than a con
firmation      of those obtained by Hewson nearly       a century ago.*

       M.D.
      This ordeal poison is referred to in the works of Du Chailluf
and Winwood ReadejJ and several of its toxic properties have
been described by MM. Pecholier et Saintpierre.§                 A few speci
mens were sent to this country in 1864 by the Rev.             A, Bushnell of
Baraka, and these were very kindly given to the author by Mr
Thomson of Glasgow ; and a further supply came from the same
quarter in 1865. These gentlemen, and Dr Nassau of Bonita,
supplied      valuable and interesting     information regarding its employ
ment.
     The poison is known in Africa         as Akazga, Boundou (or M'Boun-
dou), Ikaja, and Quai        ; Akazga being probably derived from nJcazga,
which signifies pain or hurt.          It is used as an ordeal for the detec
tion of real and superstitious crimes on the West Coast of Africa,
in    a large   district which extends north and south of the equator,
and many miles inland, and also in the adjacent island of Corisco.

to this method of trial, and that the fatal cases            are about 50 per
cent.
    The Akazga arrived in bundles, which consisted of long, slender,
and crooked stems, having their roots generally attached to them,
but sometimes        their leaf-bearing branches        only, and containing
also a very few complete        plants,  with roots, stem, and branches.
The plant is usually about six feet in length          ; but some specimens
were only four, and others as long as eight feet.            The bark is yel
lowish orange, and in some parts light red, and it is frequently
covered with a gray efflorescence.          It  adheres firmly to the stem,
but may be readily detached, after exposure to a gentle heat for
some days. Its internal surface is light brown. The space between
the bark and the wood was found, in a few pieces, to be occupied
by a large number of minute sparkling crystals            ; but it has not yet
been determined        whether    these consist    of a vegetable or mineral
substance.       The leaves are opposite and oval-accuminate in form ;
the apex frequently consisting of a linear prolongation more than
an inch in length.        From its general characters, the plant is sup
posed to belong to the Loganiaceae, but the materials are insufficient
to identify it.
    By boiling the powdered bark with alcohol of 85 per cent.,
and distilling and evaporating the tincture, a brown shining ex
tract is procured, weighing from 12 to 15 per cent- of the bark em
ployed.      It   has a bitter, non-persistent taste, and, when        treated
with concentrated        nitric acid, produces a brownish-yellow colour,
 which is not materially affected by heat, nor by solution of proto-
 chloride of tin.      It is obvious that the active principle of Akazga
 is contained      in this extract    ; and   to separate    it the following
 method has been adopted, after several attempts with various pro
 cesses  : — The extract is treated with       a very  dilute solution of tar
 taric acid, which removes 77 per cent., and filtered.              The clear,
 yellowish-brown acid solution is shaken with successive portions of
 ether, so long as any colour is removed         ; and by this means also a
 small quantity of an aromatic oil is separated from it. After de-
 cantation, a solution of carbonate of sodium is added to the liquor,
 so  long   as  it causes  a  nearly colourless, ilocculent precipitate.     It
 is again    shaken    with ether, which is decanted, and agitated        with

three   successive   portions of distilled water, and finally received
in a bottle containing a dilute solution of tartaric acid, and shaken
with it.    As soon    as the     etherial solution is brought in contact
with the acid, it becomes opalescent, but again assumes its normal
appearance     on agitation.       This change is of some value,            as indi
cating the frequency with which the alkaline solution should                      be
treated with ether, as the milkiness, on contact               with tartaric acid,
 is not produced    when    the former is exhausted.             On reaching this
stage the    tartaric solution is exposed to          a gentle     heat — to free  it
completely from ether     —   filtered, and again treated with carbonate
of sodium, by means of which a bulky, colourless,                   and flocculent
precipitate is obtained.        This is collected       in  a  filter, washed, and
dried, by exposure to     a  gentle heat for       a short    time,   and then by
the action of sulphuric acid        in vacuo.
    By this means a colourless, amorphous substance is obtained,
which is the active principle of the Akazga poison, and which pos
sesses the general    properties      of   a vegetable     alkaloid.      About 10
grains may     be separated     from    500 grains     of the powdered stem-
bark, or 2 per cent. Akazgia is proposed as its name ; and it is
hoped that when the plant is described, if it has been previously
unknown to science, Akazga will be adopted as its specific name,
and thus the usual connection          of nomenclature between the vege
table alkaloid and its source        will  be maintained.
    Akazgia is soluble in about 60 parts of cold absolute alcohol ; in
about 16 parts of spirit, of 85 per cent. ; in about 120 parts of an
hydrous sulphuric ether         ;  and in 13,000 parts of distilled water,
at a temperature    of  60°   F.     It   is freely soluble     in chloroform, in
bisulphide of carbon, in benzole,            and    in sulphuric ether of spe
cific gravity 0735.      It   crystallises with difficulty, but it may            be
obtained in the form of minute prisms, by the slow evaporation of
a solution in rectified spirit.       An analysis of its platinum-salt, and
a determination    of its combining proportion with dry hydrochloric
acid, yielded 290 in the former, and 293 in the latter, as the equi
valent of Akazgia.     When heated it becomes yellow, then melts, and
gives off fumes of a pungent, disagreeable odour, and finally becomes
charred, but leaves almost no residue           if the heat be continued for a
sufficient time.    Its solutions      have an alkaline reaction, and neu
tralise acids; and the salts are freely soluble in water, and have a

  very bitter, non-persistent taste.         Concentrated      nitric, hydrochloric,
  and    sulphuric acids change its colour to brown, but these in a
  diluted state, as well as many of the organic acids, form pale, yel
  lowish solutions with Akazgia.            It  is precipitated from these solu
  tions by hydrate,         carbonate,   and bicarbonate         of sodium,      and of
  potassium     ;  by iodide,    sulphocyanate,     ferrocyanide,      and chromate

  other substances,       but  these precipitates   are never      crystalline.     Cor
  rosive    sublimate     causes an amorphous        white precipitate, which is
  dissolved    by heat,     and   reappears in a non-crystalline          form when
  the solution has cooled.          Chlorine produces an amorphous, colour
  less   precipitate,     which does not disappear            on    the  addition of
  ammonia.         With concentrated        sulphuric      acid,   and peroxide       of
  manganese,       bichromate      of potassium,     or any other of the usual
  oxidizing agents, the same succession of colours is produced, from
  blue to brown, which results from a similar treatment of strychnia.
     The alcoholic extract of Akazga           possess   physiological properties
  very similar to those of mix vomica; and comparative                   experiments
  were    detailed,     to show    that the    active    principle, Akazgia,         has
  exactly the same actions         as the extract,    and a proportional activity
  to it.
      There are several instances         in which     a  Natural Order produces
  several very similar active          principles.     In  the Loganiaceae        itself,
  strychnia, brucia, and igasuria already exist, and these are nearly
  identical in their physiological actions.              In chemical properties,
  brucia and igasuria have much in common, and they are both
   readily distinguishable, in this respect, from strychnia. Akazgia
   conveniently completes this group, as its chemical properties are
   nearly allied to those of strychnia, whilst its connection                   with all
   the numbers        is maintained by the similarity of its physiological
   actions.

  5     On a Lower Limit to the Power exerted in the Func
        tion of Parturition.        By   J.   Matthews Duncan, M.D.
      In this   paper the author's     object was to show what          propelling
 power was required       and produced        to push the foetus      through the
passages into the world in the easiest deliveries.                The fact chiefly
founded on, as affording a basis for the necessary calculations, was
the occasional       birth of the ovum entire,       that   is,   the membranes
containing the foetus and liquor amnii being entire after passing
through the maternal passages. In such cases the strength of the
amniotic membrane was greater than that of the parturient or ex
pulsive power.      The expulsive power was in them never so strong
as    to break the bag of membranes   and the tensile strength of the
                                          ;
membrane being ascertained           by experiment, the propelling power
could be calculated from it.
     In like    manner, in labours in which the expulsive efforts merely
ruptured the bag in the last pains, or did not increase                    in power
after the rupture, the tensile strength of the membranes                   afforded,
along with other data, the means of estimating with considerable
certainty and exactness          the effective   force which       completed    the
labour.
   One hundred experiments were performed upon the foetal mem
branes in many different cases, in order to acquire data for the
calculations above referred to.          In conducting      them,     Dr Duncan
had the assistance       of Professor Tait, who         also pointed out the
method     of making the computations from the data acquired                     in
them.
     After experimentally ascertaining the tensile strength of the
membranes,        the power of the labour at the time of the rupture              of
the bag was found, and       it   was held that the lumen of the passage
opened up by the advancing ovum was circular, and of                  J4    inches
in diameter, and that the bulge of the unsupported                membrane was
hemispherical.   The force required to rupture the weakest amnion
showed that the power of the labour was at least 4-08 lbs., that for
the strongest 37-58 lbs.  and the average power indicated by the
                             ;
experiments on the amnion was 1673 lbs.

164              Proceedings of the Royal Society
   It was interesting to point out that although the patient and a
skilled observer might not remark any increased strength of labour
as it advanced, yet, in consequence of the diminished dimensions
of the uterine cavity, its muscular action, though the same, had
greater effect or power.
   Dr  J. Poppel had made similar experiments,       which anticipated
some of the results of this paper.     But his method of experiment
ing was open to the grave objection, that he always supposed the
membrane to burst when in a hemispherical form — an error whose
tendency is to make the strength of the membrane too little, and
which may account for the difference between his results and those
given in this paper.
    Poppel experimented   on the membranes of seven cases in which
they burst " with the birth." In these cases, according to Poppel's
method of calculating, and changing his results only so far as to
make them comparable to those of this paper, the power terminat
ing labour varied from about    6 to about 27 lbs.
    The interesting result is thus arrived     at, that in some    of the
easiest cases of labour the mere weight of the child,    if duly applied,
gives a force sufficient to effect delivery.
    The average strength of the amnion found by Poppel, keeping
 in view an aperture of 2-5 inches in radius, was about 19 lbs. ; by
 Dr Duncan, about 17 lbs.
    Dr Duncan proceeded to show how an estimate could be formed
of the force exerted in the most difficult labours spontaneously
 terminated.    Joulin had stated it as about 100 lbs., while Dr
 Duncan believed it did not exceed 80 lbs.
    Dr Duncan then observed that he knew of no method of ascer
 taining the powers of ordinary labours.     But he described, though
 he did not recommend the use of, means by which it could be
 ascertained  in any case.    The essential   part  of this was the dis
 covery of the pressure to which the pool of liquor amnii retained
 in utero after the rupture of the membranes was subjected         as the
 labour progressed.

        8.    Note on a celebrated Geometrical Problem.                                By
                                         Professor Tait.
     The following problem, originally proposed by Fermat to Torri-
celli, To find          the point the sum              of   whose distances   from   three given
points is         the least possible,    seems to have given considerable trouble
to the older mathematicians, and even in modern times (see Gregory's
Examples, p. 126) to have been solved in a very tedious manner.
Simpler solutions have since been given (e.g., Cambridge and Dublin
Mathematical           Journal, viii. p. 92), but none, to my knowledge, so
direct       as   that indicated by Quaternions.    The object of this note is
to show the simplicity of the quaternion                            method.
     If a,    /S be     the vectors of two of the given points, the origin being
the third, and           if p   be the vector          of the required point,    we must have
(by the conditions of the problem)
                        Tp +    T(a-p)       +   T(/S-P)        a   minimum.
Hence                   S [Up - U(a - p) - U(/3 - p)] dp = 0,
for all values of Udp.   Hence the versor sum in square brackets
must vanish identically.   The immediate interpretation     that                        is,
lines parallel to           p,
                            p        - a, -
                                         p       /?,   form an equilateral triangle.          The
required           point   is   therefore        in the same plane as the three given
points    ;       and their distances,           two and two, subtend equal angles at
 it,   which       is   the well-known solution.
       Equally simple           is   the quaternion           solution  of the same problem
if     more points          than      three be given.               Let their vectors, to any

166                     Proceedings of the Royal Society
origin, be       o,   fi,   y,   &c, and let             p   be the vector of the sought point.
We have
                                     2   .   T(o-p)=            minimum,
from which, as above,
                                         2U(o-p)            =   0                                   (1.)
     Hence,      if   unit forces act at                the required       point, in   the lines   joining
it with the given points, these forces are in equilibrium. Or, in another
form, a closed equilateral gauche polygon may he drawn whose sides
are parallel to the lines                joining         the sought       points with   the given ones.
This opens up some very curious geometrical                                      speculations,      which
I   have not time to pursue.
     That there         is       but one point whose vector                  satisfies equation (1)
may easily be proved                     by quaternions,              but even more easily by the
following reasoning.                     Consider the system of unit-forces, just men
tioned, at any two points, one  of which satisfies the problem. It                                           is
obvious that,    these forces be referred to the line joining the two
                      if
points, each will be less inclined to    at one than at the other; so
                                                                it
that,   as at one    they produce equilibrium, at the other they must
have    a   finite component in the direction of this line.
     The quaternion investigation at once suggests the following
kinematical solution of the problem.     Suppose an inextensible
string to be passed through a small movable ring, then through
small rings at two of the fixed points, then again through the
movable ring, and so on — one end of the string being fixed to the
movable ring when the number of given points                                      is   odd, and to the
first fixed ring when the number                                is   even.      When the string              is
drawn tight, i.e., when the sum of the lengths                           joining each fixed
ring to the           movable            one       is   a   minimum, the movable ring will
evidently be in the position of the required point.                                     Also, since the
tension of the cord               is   the same throughout, the movable ring                       is   kept
in equilibrium by                a   set of equal forces in the directions                 of the lines
joining    with the given points, which
            it                            the condition above found. is
   This kinematical process, equally with the quaternion one, whose
form directly suggests                       it,   gives     easily    the    solution of the more
general      problem,        — To find             a    point such that m times its distance
from    A,   together with n times its distance from                               B,   &c, may         be   a
minimum.

  10. Note on the Radiant Spectrum.                  By Professor Tait.
   This was    a preliminary notice of       a set  of experiments, then in
progress under very unfavourable          circumstances,   on the rare occa
sions when a ray of sunlight was procurable.              The production of
the phenomenon was traced to the peculiar texture of the membrane
covering the cornea.         The dependence of the whole on parallax
was confirmed by the appearance of the radiant spectrum in precisely
the same position with reference to the bright spectrum, when it
was produced artificially by interposing a plate of slightly ground
glass in the course of the light, so long as this plate was sufficiently
near the eye to produce the phenomenon at all.              A farther confir
mation was given        by the fact that,    if the eye be near the prism,
the appearance is the same on whichever               side of the prism the
ground     glass be placed.        The effects of achromatic       prisms,  of
absorption     by coloured glasses, and of the use of various kinds of
 homogeneous light taken from         a  pure spectrum, were also described.
 11.  Note upon a Method of varying Weights hy Minute
                 Quantities.       By J. A. Broun, F.E.S.
    A  notice of a Gravimeter,      proposed by me, appeared in the Pro
 ceedings of the Royal Society          of Edinburgh early in 1861.        The
 instrument,     with various    modifications,    was forwarded    to me in
 India about three years thereafter, and          was found  to have several
 imperfections     which   could have been corrected only by my own
 supervision   of the work    as  it proceeded.     His Highness the Rajah
 of Travancore has      been  good enough to sanction       a sum   of money
 for the construction of    a second instrument,     with all the precautions
 experience has suggested.
    There   are two methods by which the' observations         may be made.
 One, by which there is a constant angle of torsion of a single wire
 giving   a variable   angular movement to the weight suspended by
 two wires (depending on the force of gravity at the place of obser
 vation).    The other, by which the weight suspended is varied, and

 168                Proceedings of the Royal Society
the angles of torsion of the single wire and movement of the weight
are constant.      This second method       I had at first rejected, as ex
perience    had shown      me the difficulty     of changing the weights
 without affecting the stability of the instrument.          I desire now to
note that   I devised,   about a year ago, and communicated      to different
men of science, a method          of varying the weight, suspended with
 the greatest    delicacy,   and without jar to the instrument.          This
method     consists   in suspending from the weight a metallic wire,
which enters    a piece   of barometer tube fixed below the instrument       :
by means of a screw entering a cistern below the tube, mercury (or
another fluid, can      be forced   into the tube   so as to immerse      the
metallic wire in the fluid      ;  the wire being properly chosen as to
fineness,   or as to its specific     gravity compared with that of the
fluid, and the height of the fluid being read to a thousandth of an
inch   as in the barometer, the weight suspended can           be made,    by
turning the cistern-screw, to vary gently and gradually, by as
minute a quantity as we please ; while the eye is occupied with the
coincidences    of the telescope wire and its images, which indicate
the constancy     of the angles of torsion of the single and double
wires.
   Although the difference        of the specific gravities is considerable,
I propose   to employ iron for the wire and mercury for the fluid.
   It has occurred to me that this method of varying a weight might
be of use in other branches of research.

    Opening Address by Sir David Brewster, the President.
                Communicated by Professor Kelland.
    Gentlemen, —     If  it is the primary object of our scientific institu
 tions to advance the interests of science, to promote its diffusion,
 and to extend its influence,        it is not the least of its secondary
functions to grapple with intellectual error, and to expose those
 various forms of superstition and spiritual agency which are now
 exercising such     a perilous influence over half-educated         minds.
    In  mediaeval times, when positive knowledge had hardly assumed
a definite form, and when          the  little which did exist was confined
 to particular     classes    of society,    minds of activity       and   power
 naturally   threw themselves         into depths which they could not
 sound, or among quicksands         from which they could not escape, and
 thus sought, in wild speculation, for the excitement and notoriety
 which they could not find in patient research. But in an enlight
ened age, when real knowledge has made such extraordinary ad
vances, and when        the open fields of literature and science invite
into their broad domains every variety of genius, and offer a rich
harvest of truths to the patient reaper,        it is difficult to discover how
men of character       and high attainments         should have surrendered
themselves     to opinions not       less visionary than the legends         and
prodigies of the ancient mythology.
    From such    a  high level the stream of error has        a  quick and easy
descent, permeating        the more influential      circles, but driven back
by the shrewd intelligence of the pious and educated poor. It is
doubtless among the middle and upper classes of society that this
credulity and love of the marvellous is most conspicuous.                   It is
luxuriant    among     the gay and the idle, who have been reared on
the rank pastures of our fictitious literature, and who have no faith
in those material forces and those cosmical laws which are in daily
operation    around    them.     But whatever     be its cause, its only cure
is  a system  of secular and scientific education.
    When the scholar        has learnt to read, to write, and to count, he
has obtained only the tools of instruction.           To acquire    a knowledge

                     of Edinburgh,      Session 1867-68.                    175
   of the works of God and of man, of the miracles of nature and of
   art, is the first step in the civilisation of the people. Without
  such information the highest as well as the humblest of our race is
  unfit for   a place in the social scale.    He may have learned to read
  his Bible, and may have read it.            He may have committed to
  memory every sentence of the decalogue         ;  and he may have packed
  into the storehouse of his brain all the wisdom of Solomon, and all
  the divine     precepts of One greater       than    Solomon,    while he is
  ignorant of everything above him, around him, and within him.
     To live upon a world so wonderfully made, without desiring to
  know its form, its structure, and its purpose ; — to eat the ambrosia
  of its gardens, and drink the nectar of its vineyards, without in
  quiring where, and how, and why they grow ; — to toil for its gold
  and its silver, and to appropriate its coal and its iron, without study
 ing their nature and their origin; — to tremble under its earthquakes,
 and stand appalled before its volcanoes, in ignorance of their origin
 and of their power      ;
                           — to see and to handle       the fossils of animal
 and vegetable life without asking where, and how, and why they
 perished   ;
              — to neglect such pursuits   as these would indicate a mind
 destitute of the intellectual faculty, and unworthy of the life and
 reason with which it has been endowed.            It  is only the irreligious
 man that can blindly gaze on the grandeur and beauty of material
 nature without seeking to understand its phenomena and laws. — It
 is only the ignorant man that can depreciate the value of that true
 knowledge which is within the grasp of his divine reason ;— and it
 is only the presumptuous man that can prefer those speculative in
 quiries before which the strongest intellect quails, and the weakest
 triumphs.      "In   wisdom hast Thou made them all," can be the
 language only of the wise       ;
                                   — and it is to the wise only that " the
heavens can declare the glory of God," and that " the firmament
can show forth      His handiwork."
     (Juder the influence of views like these        I have,  during the last
thirty years, in various works and on various grounds, pleaded for
a national system of secular and scientific education.              Like other
germs of truth, it excited the ridicule of ignorance,             and alarmed
the timidity of a political and religious           fanaticism  ;  but as the
poorest seed, even when cast among thorns, sometimes springs into

entrenching itself in the aspirations of the teacher and the taught,
and though not yet comprehended           by our statesmen,      it must sooner
or later receive the sanction of Parliament.
    The British Association, who have done more for science in                 a
quarter   of    a  century than all the Governments of England have
done since the revival of learning, have taken up the subject of
scientific education, and have issued an elaborate report which can
not fail to command the approbation of the public. The rejection
of the School Bill, when twice submitted to the House of Commons,
warns    us that a tribunal       so constituted is    ill fitted to decide the
great questions in which art and science, morality and religion, are
so deeply     concerned     ;  but in the great " Leap into the Dark,"
mysterious though it be, and deep as may be the abyss into which
it has plunged us, we may yet have fallen upon a solid platform,
from which orators, of a new class and loftier aspirations,           may plead
the cause of neglected science, of taxed and persecuted inventors,
and of those higher and           holier interests    which statesmen have
failed to advance or comprehend.
    In  calling your attention to this subject, it may             be  useful to
mention that the Report of the British Association was drawn up
principally     by Fellows of the Royal Society of London, and that
they count upon the assistance of other institutions in carrying out
the work which they have begun.             That science itself will be ad
vanced by teaching        it in our schools, and more fully in our univer
sities, is a proposition too obvious        to be questioned.       A startling
fact,   a striking     experiment, and even       a  popular toy, has often
given an impulse to geuius ;         and some of the greatest of our dis
coverers, even Newton and Leibnitz, spent their early life in flying
kites, making sun-dials, and constructing simple machines.                  The
smattering of science in the school will acquire solidity in the
university, and will re-appear in the workshop with valuable appli
cations.     It   was the chemical teaching of          Dr Black that made
James Watt the greatest inventor of his age; and it was the rush
of electricity through        a  mile of wire that gave the electric tele
graph to the world.
   Extensive      as is the scheme   of scientific instruction and scientific
training proposed by the British Association, we would venture to
suggest that some knowledge, however small, of the fine and useful

                   of Edinburgh,     Session 1867-68.                  177
arts should be introduced into our schools and universities.         If we
cannot teach the arts of the architect, the painter, the sculptor,
and the manufacturer,       we can at least     exhibit and explain the
most interesting    of their works, and thus cultivate in some degree
the public taste.    There is hardly  a neighbourhood where machinery
for almost every art, and where the works of the ancient masters,
may not be shown at stated periods to the young; while by the
facilities of locomotion our galleries of art and our museums of
industry may be visited by the humblest of our schools.           But even
under the village roof-tree       we may cultivate the taste, and add
to the happiness      of its inmates.     We may decorate their walls
by permanent       photographs    of the finest specimens of painting
and sculpture, and through the stereoscope they may gaze, as              if
on solid marble,      upon  the Apollo Belvidere, the Laocoon, and
the Venus de Medicis, or upon the modern productions            of Canova,
Thorwaldsen, and Chantry.          Even in the plain furnishings       and
simple utensils of the cottage we may refine the tastes and elevate
the sentiments of the hardworking children of toil.          The beautiful
in   art and nature,    equally the gift of the great Giver, may         be
enjoyed    by the humblest of our race.       The cup of cold water will
taste the sweeter, and the goblet     of wine the richer, when the eye
rests with pleasure on their lovely forms.           The village Lavinia
                               "
will be " adorned the most when she has exchanged the apparel of
the ball-room for the simple drapery of a less luxurious age.          Nor
will the cottage family be less joyous when, in their plot of flower-
garden, they revel in the harmonies       of colour, or when the mantel
piece or walls of their dwelling     exhibit to them the choicest forms
of art, or those scenes of the picturesque or the sublime with which
modern science can so cheaply supply them.
   The pleasures     of the eye and the ear are the cheapest           and
sweetest of our luxuries, and when they shall be equally appreciated
by the classes whom no common sympathy had previously blended,
or whom      the usages of a barbarous      age had too widely severed,
society   will be welded by more enduring bonds, and new buttresses
added to the social fabric.      The artisan or the labourer who devotes
his leisure hour to the observation of nature or the admiration of
art, who gathers     for his family the curious plant or the travelled
pebble, or who presents      to them    the  elegant   flower vase  or the

  178                 Proceedings of the Royal Society
  graceful   statue, is not likely        to seek for excitement in village
  revels, in political clubs, or in dishonest combinations.             His moral
  nature   will rise with his material tastes ; and while his less instructed
  neighbours will look up to him as a model for imitation, his more
  educated superiors will appreciate his acquirements as a companion
 or a friend.
      It is only in those studies where the eye becomes our teacher,
 that    we can   unite in one common pursuit the dissevered classes of
 society.     It  is in our galleries of art, — in the rich museums of our
 cities,  — in our   botanical,   horticultural, and zoological gardens, — or
 in our crystal palaces, where           art and science are rivals, that the
 children of wealth and of toil can assemble in the common admira
 tion of all that is beautiful and sublime.           It  is among the remains
 of ancient and the achievements               of modern      art, and amid    the
 beauties which we daily appreciate, and the lovely forms of organic
 life which are ever before us, that we can rise to a purer morality
 and a higher civilisation.
     But it is to the middle,          and even to the upper         classes, and
through them to the nation, that scientific teaching will offer its
richest benefits.       The functionaries who administer our affairs           are
in number legion.         Without science, without that elevation of char
acter which positive        knowledge      confers, we can readily understand
how the greatest interests of the state are mismanaged,              — how inte
rests equally great are neglected,        — and   how the public wealth is reck
lessly squandered.         Incompetent subordinates          assume the import
ance, and discharge the duties of their chiefs             ; and while the deep
problems of practical science receive a wrong solution, the feelings
and interests of inventors and discoverers are utterly disregarded.
     In this  great country, wealthy by its commerce, its agriculture,
and its manufactures,          and in no other country in the world, even
the poorest, our numerous            scientific boards  are conducted     by men
who are too honest to have any pretensions               to science, and whose
aggregate wisdom,        if it  exists at all, is enshrined    in the cerebellum
of   a secretary or a   clerk.     The parsimony of the Exchequer grudges
a   salary for the services which science only can supply, and con
signs to unpaid and irresponsible           hands the great interests in which
life and property are at stake.
     Nor will scientific education       be  of less value to the lawgiver uud

to  the statesman — to the men who preside over the life and death
of the nation, — who make its laws and direct its battles.* To them
the    British Association has applied in vain for the national recog
nition of science. Its parliamentary committee, presided over by
Lord Wrottesley (a patriotic nobleman, now removed to a brighter
sphere), and containing members of both Houses of Parliament,
have pleaded in vain for a board of science, to extend its influence
and to introduce it into our schools.              They have proclaimed to
successive governments            " that science has not its due weight and
                                                                "
importance in the councils of the nation ;" — that                a feeling per
vades the community at large that our country's welfare, and even
 safety, depends on its due encouragement               and fostering;"   — and
 adopting the words of our great political economist, Mr Mill,f —
 " that no limit can be set to the importance, even in a purely pro
 ductive and material point of view, of mere thought," — and " that
 every extension of knowledge of the powers of nature is fruitful of
 application to the purposes of nature and life."
     But there is another class of public servants to whom scientific
 education must        be of great importance.       Peaceful as science is in
 its theoretical    as  well as its practical aspect, it has often to wage war
 against pirates; and with its meagre exchequer to struggle against
 the hoarded       pelf of unprincipled       capitalists,  or   the  combined
 resources of needy speculators.           The discoverer or the inventor is
 thus driven into a court of law, and our judges and juries have to
 decide in the most perplexing suits where profound science can be
 their only guide.        To decide against     a pirate who     has stolen the
 intellectual property of his neighbour, and can plead only a mis
 take in the specification of his patent, is a trivial error, even if
 the decision is unjust      ; but it is  a deeper  injustice, and one not to
 be   forgiven, when an inventor is deprived of          a property   which he
 had provided     for his family, and when the verdict rests either upon
 the ignorance     of the judge, or upon the erroneous appreciation           of
 scientific testimony.
   * The Earl of     Harrowby, as one of the Parliamentary Committee of the
 British  Association, stated " that those who administer the affairs of the
 country   ought, at least, to know enough of science to appreciate its value,
 and to bo acquainted with its wants and bearings on the interests of society."

   180                  Proceedings of the Royal Society
       But there are still higher interests for which a scientific education
   is essential,   — interests intensely national,         and affecting the well-
  being of every member of the community.                        In expounding the
  results of the Great Exhibition of 1851, our eminent colleague,
  Dr Lyon Playfair, as one of the commissioners, did not scruple to
  tell the Government " that all European nations, except England,
  have recognised        the fact that industry must         in future     be supported,
  not by a competition         of  local advantages, but by a competition              of
  intellect    .    .  .   that each foreign metropolis rejoices in an in
  dustrial university;       — that    the result    of the Exhibition was one
  that England may well             be   startled at, — and that British manu
  facturers      themselves    were     convinced that most of the               foreign
  countries     were rapidly approaching,           and sometimes        excelling, us
  in those very manufactures            which were our own by hereditary and
 traditional right."          This voice of wisdom and of warning was
 listened to only by that noble Prince, who, but for petty jealousies
 and rival interests, would have established that great college of
 industry, with affiliated         schools, which he had announced                to his
 friends.
      The same mortifying lesson, thus neglected by the Government,
 was taught us by the French Exhibition of 1855.                          The British
jurors were        so surprised     at the superiority        of France and other
 nations in many of the scientific and useful arts, that it became
 the subject of frequent discussion ; and at a meeting called for
 the purpose, the jurors unanimously declared
                                                              " that it was only by
great exertion, under the most favourable                 circumstances,       that the
hitherto almost uncontested               superiority of Great Britain in the
mechanical and chemical arts could be maintained."*
     This second voice of warning, like the first, found no echo
     • This meeting was attended by Sir David Brewster, who was called to the
chair, by Sir Charles Manby, Secretary to the Institution of Civil Engineers,
who was requested to act as secretary, and by Professor Graham, Master of
the Mint, Professor       Owen,   Professor    Wheatstone,    Professor   Cockerell,  Mr
Fairbairn, Mr George Rennie,          Mr   De   La Rue, Mr Warren De         La  Rue, Dr
Hoffmann,      and    Mr Crampton, civil     engineer.   Several   jurors,   Sir Charles
Barry, and others who were unable to attend, warmly approved of the object
of the meeting.
     Resolutions   of a more specific nature were moved by Professor Owen.
Professor Wheatstone,       and Professor Cockerell, and it was resolved to repre

among our statesmen.           Foreign nations were gradually out-run
ning us in the most important of our arts, and the French In
ternational Exhibition of 1867 exhibited even to some British
statesmen     the infatuation of their policy.         Dr Playfair and the
British jurors again sounded the note of alarm.               Lord Granville
and Lord Taunton have given public expression                    to the same
judgment, and we may therefore            hope that, under a wider consti
tuency and a wiser          legislature, the rights      of science    may   be
vindicated; and that scientific instruction, beginning in our schools,
may be extended        to every department      of art which contributes to
the wellbeing of the citizen, and to the wealth of the empire.
    If these   views are approximately correct,      — if our statesmen, our
lawgivers, and our official functionaries           are unacquainted       with
science even in its popular aspects, what must be the intellectual
condition     of the residue of social life in the upper and middle
ranks of the community        !   All of  us can testify,  if we  had courage,
that there is not one person in a hundred              who believes,    or who
understands      if he believes, that he lives upon a ball      of earth mov
ing daily about its axis, and annually around the sun               ; and that
these two motions are so adjusted           as  to give us that variety of
seasons on which our daily happiness so essentially depends.               How
few know anything          more of our nocturnal lamp,         than that the
moon has horns in one week and is without them in another.                How
few    know anything more of the telescope and microscope, than
that they look into one end of a tube, and see something nearer
and larger at the other.          How few know anything more of the
barometer and thermometer,          than that the one is placed inside and
the other outside of the house, and that the one tells us something
about rain, and the other something about cold.                How few know
anything more of their inner and outer being, than that the one
requires to be fed, and the other to be clothed.
    To such persons scientific instruction must be the greatest of
gifts ; and if we cannot wrest it from the State, it becomes our duty
to   accomplish by private enterprise         what in other countries has
been done       by the nation.*       The efforts of individuals must, of

course, be feeble in their nature,          and limited in their results     ;  but
many of the noblest schemes of philanthropy have sprung from
one willing heart, and been achieved by one brawny arm.                    In the
field of education there may         be many labourers, and there is       hardly
an educated person          who may not throw some seeds into its soil,
and glean in return a portion of the harvest which it yields.               Each
of you must feel some interest in a parochial or other school, in
which the youth receive no instruction respecting the material uni
verse around them, and the productions of nature and of art which
are daily within their reach.          At a very moderate expense you can
furnish    a telescope    and microscope, a barometer and thermometer,
a stereoscope, a magic-lantern, a magnet, a burning-glass, and a
small electrical machine such              as   that little globe of revolving
glass with which Faraday began                his illustrious career  ; and    with
this apparatus, during an hour or two in each week, phenomena
could be displayed and illustrated, which would be                  a source     of
instruction and amusement, relieving the monotony of the school,
and giving the teacher a new power over the minds and affections
of his pupils.       Important      as  this step would be, it is but a small
part of what might be done in conveying scientific instruction.
people here, by schools, mechanics' institutes, and lectures, given or promoted
by benevolent persons, have wearied the souls of all those who have co-oper
ated or even looked on with interest.        In  Germany, without any commotion,
calmly and pleasantly, the youths have been trained in schools and colleges
without number, and so thoroughly, that they are able to supply foremen
and managers to their own manufacturers' establishments, and to send a sup
ply also to foreign countries.     In other words, whilst we have failed with our
most violent efforts, and with much noise, to teach our own people, they have
succeeded not only to teach their own citizens, but to assist in educating the
rest of the world.    In this matter of education the governments have been
able to mould the nation's mind, and to alter the habits of a leading portion
of it in a few years. A careful education would probably show its influence
 in less than ten years                   We require education in the fundamental
principles of physical science ; the moral principles, as found in literature, are
 not alone sufficient either for the higher cultivation of the mind or every
pursuit of the useful arts. This applies to the rich and not merely to the
poor." — Proceedings of Manchester Phil. Society, Nov. 12, 1867.
    In reference to the provincial lectures, which, Dr Smith says, " have wearied
 the souls of their promoters," there can be no doubt that, if properly organ
 ised by a committee in our University seats, such as the Committee for Local
 Examinations, a valuable course of scientific and literary instruction might be
provided for every class of the community.

                      of Edinburgh, Session 1867-68.                        183
In most of our provincial            towns    there  is a museum    of natural
history and antiquities, which would be a valuable auxiliary                  in
teaching natural science in the neighbouring schools.                 But even
where no such collection exists, a small museum                might be estab
lished in the humblest of them.              Within their own narrow sphere
objects    of natural history might be obtained, and many a private
collection in the district would surrender a tithe of its speci
mens for the public use.              Our Industrial Museum, too, might
distribute     a  portion of its overflowing collections, and even the
British Museum might contribute some of its innumerable dupli
cates,     and    bring    into   use   its accumulated    and   unproductive
treasures.     Itinerant museums, like the itinerant libraries, might be
chartered in the same cause, and might sell or exchange the dupli
cates which are found in different localities.
    By these means our school museums might obtain specimens of
the more important rocks which form the carpentry of the globe, —
of the metallic ores, and the metals themselves, which are in daily
use, — of the more precious           minerals    which are employed for the
purposes of art or ornament,         — and thus give to the youthful student
some knowledge          of the world on which he resides,          and of the
elements of civilisation which           it embosoms.
    In the departments         of Zoology and Botany we cannot expect to
collect specimens         for our schools, but our travelling menageries,
and the museums and botanic gardens of our principal towns, would
 supply, to     a great     extent, the means of instruction.        But even
 when    these are beyond         our reach, photography, and the stereo
scope which gives relief to its pictures,            might be advantageously
 employed.        The photographic process will give us accurate repre
 sentations     of those objects, both of nature and of art, which it
 would be desirable        to describe and to explain in the instruction of
youth.      In   the department       of zoology, the picture might    be often
 taken    from the      living animal, standing before the camera in
 vigorous life and transcendent         beauty;   or when this cannot be done,
 from the fine specimens of zoological forms which adorn our metro
 politan and provincial museums.               With equal accuracy might be
represented the osteology and integuments of animals,
                                                                 — the frame
work which protects            life, and to which life gives      activity and
 power.

    The trees and plants too of distant zones will show themselves
in true relief, — the banyan   clinging with its hundred roots to    the
ground, — the bread-fruit tree, with its beneficent       burden, or the
deadly upas, preparing its poison for the arrow of the savage          or
 the poniard of the assassin.    With no less interest will the school
 boy gaze on the structures of the inorganic world, — the minerals
 which have lain in the earth beneath his feet, — the crystals which
 chemistry has conjured into being, displaying to him their geo
 metric forms, infinite in variety, and interesting from their rarity
 and value.     Painted by the very light which they reflect, he will
see the   Koh-i-noor and other diamonds, and the huge rubies and
sapphires and emeralds     which have adorned the chaplet of beauty,
and sparkled in the diadems      of kings.   The gigantic productions
of the earth will appeal to him with equal power — the colossal
granites which have travelled in chariots of ice, the precipices       of
ancient lava, the doric colonnades     of basalt, and the fossil giants
of the primeval world, which trod the earth during its prepara
tion for man, and have been embalmed         in stone — to instruct and
to humble him.

aspects of nature, their representations in relief will be peculiarly
 instructive.    The mountain range, whether scarred with peaks, or

 — the fixed or the floating iceberg ; — the glacier and its moraines ;

 trayed in all the grandeur of nature.
    The works of human hands, too, will stand before the scholar in
 their pristine condition, or their ruined grandeur; — the monuments
 by which     sovereigns  and nations perpetuate     their names  ;
                                                                    —the
 pyramids,   with their mysterious legacy to science ; — the gorgeous
palaces of kings ; — the garish temples of superstition ; — and the
bastions and strongholds of war, will be seen as if the observer
were placed      at their base, and warmed     by the very sun which
shines upon their walls.
    Although    few of our village youth may become sculptors, yet
the sight   of ancient statues, in actual relief, and in their real ap
parent   magnitude, cannot fail to instruct and to refine them.       To
gaze upon the masterpieces       of ancient art, standing in the very

                   of Edinburgh,      Session 1867-68.                    185
halls which they occupy, or to contemplate the chefs d'ceuvres of
modern or living artists, with the sculptor himself standing by
their side, must excite an interest of no ordinary kind.
   The works of the architect, the engineer, and the mechanist,
may also be exhibited in full relief at our schools ; — the gigantic
aqueducts of ancient and modern times ; — the viaducts and bridges
which span our valleys and our rivers ; — and the living machinery
in our factories    and workshops,      which toil daily for our benefit,
and supply the commerce of the world.
   With   such   means   in our power, cheaply obtained, and easily
applied, a large portion of scientific instruction may be instilled
into the youth of our schools, — familiarising them with the works
of their Maker, and preparing them for the reception of that
higher revelation with which the truths of science cannot fail to
harmonise.     The knowledge thus imparted will not be confined to
the schoolroom. It will elevate the amusements of the holiday
and the leisure hour. It will pass into the cottage, amusing and
enlightening its inmates.       It will find its way into the workshop,
giving skill to the workman, and value to his work. It will in
sinuate itself into the servants' hall, and even into the boudoir and
the drawing-room, returning an usurious interest upon the liber
ality which introduced it into    the school.    Thus, diffused among our
now popular constituencies, and appreciated by those above them,
the truths of science may rise into the regions of legislation, wresting
from the still reluctant statesman     a measure  of secular, scientific, and
compulsory education, by which the benighted           and criminal popu
lation around us may be taught to fear God and honour the King.
   In conformity with     the usual     practice of the Society, the fol
lowing brief notices are given of deceased Members,                arranged
alphabetically.    In calling your attention      to the present     state of
our Society,  I regret to state that our losses during the past year
 have been severe, not only in their number, but in the talent and
reputation of our deceased colleagues.
   Sir Archibald Alison, Bart., was the younger son of the Rev.
Archibald   Alison,  LL.B.,   a   Fellow of this Society,      who was for

186                   Proceedings          of the Royal Society
many     years    senior    clergyman of the Episcopal                          Chapel in the
Cowgate, Edinburgh.             His son Archibald was born at Kenley, in
Shropshire,      in December       1792.           In   1800, his father removed              to
Edinburgh, where his two sons received their education, and studied
at the University, when its more important chairs were filled by
Dugald Stewart,        Playfair, and Leslie.                  Having chosen the law
as   his profession, he was called to the Bar in 1814.                             In   the same
year he made a tour on the Continent, and, in conjunction with his
friend Patrick Fraser Tytler, who accompanied him, he published
an interesting account of     entitled " Travels in France during
                                    it,
the years 1814-15, comprising              a   residence at Paris during the stay
of the Allied Sovereigns, and at               Aix       at the period of the landing
of Bonaparte."        In    1822 he was             made an advocate-depute,                  an
office which he filled          with great credit             till   the downfall of the
Wellington       Administration           in 1830; and,              as   the    result of his
experience       in that office,      in      1831       he   published his work, in
two vols.,
           " On the Principles and Practice of the Criminal Law
of Scotland." On the return of the Duke to power in 1834, Mr
Alison was appointed            to the Sheriffdom of Lanarkshire, an office
which he held to the end of his life.           Although his special duties
as  Sheriff occupied much            of his time, he yet found leisure to
prosecute his literary studies.               During his visit to the Continent,
when indignant        Europe had sent the first Napoleon into exile,
Sir Archibald       conceived      the     idea of writing                " The History of
Europe, from        the     commencement                of the French Revolution              to
the Restoration of the Bourbons                     in 1815."             Before    he quitted
Edinburgh      he had published the first two volumes                              of this able
and popular work, and the third and fourth were nearly ready for
the    press   when    he    removed          to   Glasgow, where                he completed
the work in fourteen            volumes.           In    1852 he began to publish              a
continuation of       it   in six volumes,              under the title of the " The
History of Europe, from the Fall of Napoleon in 1815 to the
Accession of Louis Napoleon in 1852."   In 1848 he published his
" Military Life of the Duke of Marlborough," and in 1859 his
" Lives of Lord Castlereagh an Lord Londonderry." Sir Archibald
                                          1
is                  " Treatise on the Principles of Population,"
     also the author of     a
which appeared in 1840, and of     great number of interesting
                                                   a
articles on various         literary and political subjects                     in Black\oood's

                  of Edinburgh,     Session 1867-68.                     187
Magazine, a selection from which was published           in three volumes.
In 1852   he received   the honour    of   a Baronetcy    from the    Earl of
Derby during his short term of      office.
   Although of a robust constitution, Sir Archibald was attacked
with a severe affection of the throat in the beginning of May
1867, and on the 23d of the same month he died at Possil House,
near Glasgow, in the seventy-fifth       year of his age.      Sir Archibald
was married    in 1825 to the youngest daughter of Colonel Patrick
Tytler, the brother of Lord Woodhouselee, who still survives him ;
and he has left a daughter,        and two sons, who have both dis
tinguished themselves in the army.
   Alexander Dallas Bacue, LL.D., an eminent natural philosopher
and engineer, was a descendant of the celebrated Franklin. He
graduated at the Military Academy at West Point in 1825, and held
such a high rank in his class that he was immediately              appointed
Professor of Engineering in that institution, but he held the chair
only for a year.  After serving   as an officer  in the oorps of Engineers,
for three years, he was appointed, in 1827, to the chair of Natural
Philosophy and Chemistry in the University of Pennsylvania, the
duties of which he discharged with distinguished ability.            In 1833,
he was elected superintendent of the Girard College, which had been
established in Philadelphia     under the princely bequest of Stephen
 Girard.   In 1843, on the death of Professor Karsler, he was appointed
superintendent    of the United States Survey,      a position  in which, for
 a period of twenty-three   years, he exhibited high scientific acquire
 ments and unrivalled administrative talents.          His annual reports
to Congress form a series of valuable contributions to science, and
 have been much admired       in every part of Europe.         While he was
president of Girard College, between 1836 and 1841, he was directed
 by the Board of Trustees to report upon the state of education in
 Europe.    With this view he spent         a year abroad, accompanied by
 his wife, and published in 1839 the result of his inquiries.         On thin
occasion he visited     Scotland,  and    I   had the great pleasure of      n
 visit from this distinguished philosopher.
    When the Congress established,          on the 3d   March     1863,  their
National Academy of Science, he            was  unanimously elected their

 188              Proceedings of the Royal Society
first President for six years.     He discharged the duties of this office
 till the time of his death.*
     Dr Bache was   a corresponding   member      of the French Academy
of Sciences, and of various other learned societies.
     He died at Washington in 1867, and left       a widow, who had been
the companion     of his labours.
    Jambs Black, M.D., an eminent physician, was born in 1787.
He began the study of medicine in the University of Edinburgh
in 1806, and became a licentiate of the Royal College of Surgeons
 in 1808.    In  1809 he was appointed       an assistant    surgeon  in the
 Royal Navy, and in the following year was appointed surgeon to
the Raven sloop -of- war, in which he served on the coast of Spain
during the Peninsular war.
    After practising his profession       for  a short   time in Newton-
Stewart,    he went    to Bolton, in   Lancashire, where he remained
till  1839, when he removed to Manchester for the education of his
family.     In  1840 he was appointed       physician to the Union Hos
pital, and lecturer on forensic medicine in the Medical School.
    As a member of the Philosophical Society, of which he was
chosen President in 1859, he contributed to its "Transactions"         many
papers on Antiquities      and Geology, and enriched its Museum with
numerous     specimens   of the rocks and fossils of South Lancashire.
In    1853 he was elected president of the Provincial         Medical Asso
ciation, organised by the late Sir Charles        Hastings of Worcester     ;
and he was one of the original members of the British Association
which met at York in 1831.        In 1848 he returned to Bolton, where
he remained for eight years, carrying on with activity the scientific
pursuits of his early life. In 1856 he returned to Edinburgh,
where he was elected a Fellow of this Society in 1857, and read
several    papers at its meetings.     Dr Black was        a  Fellow of the
Geological Societies of London and Paris,        a member     of the Medico-
Chirurgical    Society of Edinburgh, of the Social Science Associa
tion, and of the Historic Society of Lancashire ; and he contributed
several papers to their
                          " Proceedings." Dr Black was also an active
   * The only separate work which he published beside his volume on Educa
tion, was an edition of Brewster's Optics, with copious notes and a large
appendix.

contributor     to different   medical   and scientific    journals  ;  and  it is
wonderful      how, amid the occupations of an extensive            practice, he
could have found leisure for such a variety of pursuits.            His various
writings, which are too numerous for insertion               here, appeared as
separate articles, in the
                                 " Proceedings" of the societies to which
he belonged, in the medical and scientific          journals of London and
Edinburgh, and in the newspapers of the localities in which his lot
was cast.       Dr Black was a devoted philanthropist, and a defender
of Scripture against science, falsely so called.             He died at Edin
burgh on the 30th April 1867, in the eightieth year of his age,
leaving    a widow and two sons to lament         his loss.
    Alexander Bryson, an eminent naturalist,               was  born at Edin
 burgh on the 12th October 1816, and was the eldest son of Robert
 Bryson, senior partner        in the celebrated firm of clock and watch
 makers.      After receiving      his preliminary education at the High
 School, he was apprenticed to a watch and clock maker in Mussel
 burgh,    and subsequently         went to London      to   acquire   a   higher
 knowledge of his profession.          On his return to Edinburgh, after          a
 year's absence,       he was received     into partnership     with his father
 and brother; and was then able to pursue his scientific               tastes, by
 attending the classes of Chemistry and Natural Philosophy in the
 University, and the lectures delivered in the School of Arts. Mr
 Bryson was elected a Fellow of this Society in 1858, and con
                     "
 tributed to its Transactions" the                        of Sir Thomas Mak-
                                            biographies
 dougal Brisbane and         Dr John Fleming, and other papers, on the
 Preservation of Footprints on the Sand, and on the Boring of thePho-
 ladidae.     He was elected, in 1860, President of the Royal Society of
 Arts, to which he contributed several papers, for one of which, on
 the Method of detecting the Presence of Icebergs in Darkness, he
 received the Hephurn Prize. He was elected President of the Roynl
  Physical Society in 1863, and contributed a large number of papers
  to its " Proceedings."        Mr Bryson was likewise a member of the So
  ciety of Scottish Antiquaries, the Botanical Society, the Geological
  Societies of London and Edinburgh, and the British Association, at
  whose meetings he read various papers, chiefly on geological subjects.
     Mr Bryson died at Hawkhill           on the 7th December 1866,         in the
  fifty-first  j ear  of his age.

    Victor   Cousin, a distinguished philosopher,      was born in  Paris  on
the 28th November        1792, and was the son of a watchmaker.           He
was    educated at the Charlemagne          Lyceum, and he was so dis
tinguished     a pupil,   that at the competitions       in all the French
Lyceums      he carried   off the principal prize.      Cousin  had at first
resolved to follow music as a profession, but having attended the
lectures of Royer Collard on the History of Modern Philosophy,
they made such a deep impression upon him, that he devoted him
self to the study of literature and philosophy.             In 1812 he was
appointed assistant teacher of Greek in the Ecole Nonnale for
training professors, and he afterwards became a professor in the
same institution.       On the return of Napoleon from Elba he enrolled
himself among the Royalist Volunteers          ;  but on the Restoration    of
the Bourbons he resumed his studies, and though only twenty-three
years of age, he was appointed the successor of Royer Collard at the
 Sorbonne.      In this   new position    he assailed the opinions    of  the
 Doctrinaires, and expounded those of Reid and Dugald Stewart,
 which Royer Collard had first made known in France.               A visit to
 Germany,     however, unsettled     his opinions,    and on his return to
 France    he    expounded    the  views    of Kant, Hegel, Fichte,       and
 Schelling.     Under the Restoration      the boldness of his metaphysics
 exposed him to the royal         displeasure.    Suspended from his pro
 fessorship, he became tutor to the present Duke of Montebello,           and
 while he held that position he prepared his editions of Proclus and
 Descartes, and his translation of Plato.        During a visit to Germany
 in 1825, he was arrested at Dresden, on the supposition of his belong
 ing  to the Carbonari,   and being transferred to Berlin, he lay in prison
 for six months.       On his return     to  Paris he opposed the Villele
 ministry along with Guizot and Villemain, but he was restored              to
 his professorship under the more liberal ministry of Martignach.
     Under the Orleans dynasty Cousin            obtained  high preferment.
  Before the close of 1830 he was      made Councillor of State, Member
  of the Royal Council of Public            Instruction,   Professor in the
  Sorbonne, Director of the Ecole Normale, and Member of the French
  Academy.       In  1832 he was made a Peer of France, and a Member
  of the Academy of Moral and Political Sciences. During the short
  ministry of Thiers in 1840, he filled the office of Minister of Public
  Instruction.

                  of Edinburgh, Session 1807-68.                     191
    After the Revolution of February 1848, Cousin ceased to take a
part in political affairs.    At the instance of General Cavagnac,
however, he published      a popular   edition  of his Profession de foi
iVun vicaire Savoyard,     and of his Justice et ChariU, in which he
attacked the socialism of the day.        In order to please the clerical
party, he republished    several of his former lectures in a volume,
entitled   Du Vrai, Du Beau,    et  Du Bien.    During the last twenty
years his chair in the Sorbonne        had been filled by a substitute,
and in 1852 he was, along with Guizot and Villeinain, placed on
the retired list, with the rank of Honorary Professor.
    Between 1818 and 1865 Cousin produced many valuable works.
In 1842    he edited the Pensies   of Pascal, in which the original text
was restored.     In  1853 he  began his historical biographies of the
most     remarkable   women   of the 18th century,       of Madame     de
Longueville, Madame      de Sablé, Madame de Chevreuse, Madame         de
Hautefort, and Jacqueline       Pascal.     In 1863 he published      his
General History of Philosophy from the most remote times dovm to
the 18th Century.     His works include his Philosophical Fragments,
in 2 vols., his editions of Plato, Proclus, and Descartes,      his Meta
physics of Aristotle,   his Scholastic Philosophy,    his Lectures on the
Philosophy of Kant, his Lectures on the History of Scottish Philosophy,
including an account of Hutcheson, Reid, Dugald Stewart, Beattie,
and Ferguson, and his Literary Fragments.            He contributed  also
 many papers to the Memoirs of the Academy of Moral and Political
Sciences, and to the Journal des Savants, and the Revue des Deux
Mondes.
    Owing to his failing health, Cousin had for several years spent
the winter at Cannes.       When he went there in December 1866,
the state of his health was by no means alarming; but he was taken
 ill in the beginning of the present year, and     he died on the 15th  of
January, in the seventy-fifth     year of his age.
     Henry Home Drimmond, Esq. of Blair Drummond, was born in
 1783, and was the grandson of the celebrated Lord Kames.              He
 was educated    at the High   School of Edinburgh, where he distin
guished himself as a classical scholar, and he afterwards studied at
Oxford, where he took the degree of LL B. Having been educated
 for the bar, he was admitted   a  member of the Faculty of Advocates

192                Proceedings of the Royal Society
in 1808.      In  1812 he was appointed one of the depute-advocates,
and during his continuance        in that office he was entrusted with the
management        of a large part    of the criminal business of Scotland,
at a time when, in the State trials of from 1807 to 1821, courage
as well as     skill was required in the public prosecutor.          Having
discharged with distinguished ability the duties thus imposed upon
him, he resigned his appointment in 1821, and relinquished his
general practice at the Bar.
    In  1821   Mr Drummond entered Parliament           as member     for the
county of Stirling, and he continued to discharge his parliamentary
duties till 1852, when he resigned in favour of his friend and
neighbour, Mr Stirling of Keir. During that long period of public
service he gave valuable aid in passing the various statutes relating
to Scotland     ; but the country is under special       obligations to him
for the Turnpike       and   Statute Labour Acts, the Salmon         Fishing
Act of     19  Geo.  IV., and especially     the Act for the Recovery of
Small Debts, which confers            the most   signal benefits   upon   the
poor.
    As   a country gentleman,      a  landlord, and  an  ardent  and   skilful
improver of his estates, his name will be long remembered in his
county. Although it is to Lord Kames that we owe the happy
 idea of floating away to the Forth the moss which covers the rich
 alluvial soil beneath the Blair Drummond Moss, it was his grandson
 who completed this great enterprise, and converted into a fertile
 field this wide and useless expanse.
     Mr Home Drummond,            who had     long been in feeble health,
 died in September 1867.          He was married to Miss C. Moray of
 Abercairney, and has left behind him two sons and a daughter —
 Mr G. Stirling Home Drummond of Ardoch, who succeeds to the
 paternal estates ; Mr C. Home Drummond Moray of Abercairney ;
 and Her Grace The Dowager-Duchess of Athole.
     Michael Faraday,      a distinguished chemist, was born at Newing-
 ton Butts, Surrey, on the 22d September 1791.             His father was a
 smith, and at the age of fourteen he was apprenticed for seven
 years to a bookbinder.       In   1812 he became a journeyman book
 binder, and in that year he attended the course of lectures of Sir
  H. Davy, in the Royal Institution.          Having sent to Sir Humphry

                     of Edinburgh,        Session 1867-68.                   193
the   notes which he had taken            of his lectures, and requested his
assistance in obtaining some position which would allow him to
pursue his scientific tastes, Sir Humphry kindly attended                  to his
request, and procured for him the place of chemical assistant                   in
the laboratory      of the Royal Institution.          Faraday entered upon
this   office  in March       1813,   and     at Sir Humphry's       request   he
accompanied him        as  his amanuensis on his tour to the Continent
in 1814.      Upon their return, in 1815, Faraday resumed his place
at the Royal Institution, and began that course of experimental re
search which led him to such brilliant discoveries.
    In May    1821 he was appointed          superintendent of the house and
laboratory of the Institution.          In  1823 he was elected a correspond
ing member of the French Academy of Sciences.                  On the death of
Dalton, in 1844, he was elected one of the eight Foreign Associates
of that distinguished body;             and since    the death    of Humboldt,
 he has been the       eldest   member       in that class of the Academy.
 In  1824 he was elected a fellow of the Royal             Society of London,
 and for his   brilliant discoveries, recorded in their Transactions, he
 received successively      the   Copley, Rumford,        and   Royal    Medals,
 being, with one exception,       the only person who has received all the
 medals which the Royal Society can bestow.              In  1827 he published
 his work on Chemical Manipulation, which reached a second edition
 in 1836, and a third in 1842. In 1829 he was appointed Lecturer
 on Chemistry to the Royal          Military Academy at Woolwich.              In
  1832, when the     British Association met at Oxford, he received the
 degree   of D.C.L.     In  1833 he was appointed Fullerian Professor of
 Chemistry in the Royal Institution.               In  1835 Lord      Melbourne
 granted him a pension of L.300, in recognition               of his great dis
 coveries.    In   1836    he   was   appointed     scientific adviser    to  the
 Trinity House, in reference to the lighthouses under their manage
 ment, and in the same year he was nominated one of the senate
 of the University     of London.        In   1842 he was made Chevalier of
 the Prussian Order " Pour          le   Merite," founded     by Frederick the
 Great, and recently extended          to men of science and learning, who
 are recommended        by the Royal Berlin Academy of Sciences.               In
 1855 he received      the decoration      of Commander       of the Legion of
 Honour, and he obtained similar decorations from other sovereigns.
    In 1855, he published his " Observations on Mental Education,"

I 94                 Proceedings of the Royal Society
a lecture     delivered     before Prince Albert,        in which he advocates
the teaching of natural science in our schools and colleges.
    In 1858 Her Majesty allotted him             a residence at  Hampton Court,
where he died on the 25th August 1867, in the 76th year of his age.
    We cannot close this brief sketch of the life of Faraday without
a notice, however imperfect,          of several of the brilliant discoveries
which have placed him at the head of the experimental philoso
phers of every age.
    His first experiment, made in 1816, was an analysis of             a specimen
of caustic lime, which was published, with observations, by Sir                   H.
Davy.       In  1817 and 1818, he discovered that the velocity of gases
in    passing    through     a  narrow tube, depended         not  only on their
density,     but on their own nature           ;  and these experiments were
followed,     at different dates, by a variety of what may be called his
minor discoveries,         when compared         with those on electricity and
magnetism.         The most important of these relate to the combustion
 of the diamond       ;
                        — to  the sounds produced        by a bar of heated iron
 laid upon a mass of metal, the experiment of                 Mr A. Trevelyan,
 described     in our Transactions       ;
                                           — to the evaporation     of mercury at
 low temperatures       ;
                          — to  the optical illusions produced       in the  pheno-
kistoscope    of Plateau ; — to the acoustic figures of Chladni           ;
                                                                            — to the
 remarkable       phenomenon       of regelation,    so successfully   pursued by
 Professor Tyndall ; — and         to the mysterious       movements    of turning
tables, which he so ingeniously explained.                 In 1820 he described
 two new compounds             of chlorine and carbon.        In  1823 he began
 his fine experiments        on the condensation      of gases into liquids  ;  and,
 by refrigerating         mixtures, he obtained        liquids more dense than
 water,    from    a  variety    of gases   ;  but in 1844, by combining a
  mechanical pressure of fifty atmospheres with cold of — 166° of
 Fahrenheit, he obtained in a liquid state defiant gas, fluosilicic acid,
 phosphorated       hydrogen,     and arsenical hydrogen.       With this double
 power he converted           the first gases which he liquefied into solid
 crystals, but those last mentioned           he was not able to solidify.        In
 the compression        of oil gas, in 1825, he discovered a new compound,
 the bicarburet of hydrogen, from which Dr Hoffman has extracted
 another     substance     of great value in the production of colour.            In
  1857, Faraday published his curious experiment, in which a gold
  leaf, placed upon a plate of glass, becomes transparent and colourless

                     o/ Edinburgh, Session 1867-68.                              195
at a    high temperature,        and recovers its green         colour    by trans
mitted light, under pressure.             In 1820, he discovered the valuable
properties of alloys of rhodium             and steel, and of silver and steel
for cutting instruments.            In 1827, he published        his work on the
" Manufacture       of Glass for Optical Purposes," and in his Memoir
on the same subject, in 1829, he has given a minute account of all
the processes     which he employed.
     These various     researches, numerous         and brilliant as they are,
might have     been the occupation          of a busy   life, but they form only
an introduction, as it were, to the grand discoveries in electricity
and magnetism with which his name is more specially associated.
     With the exception         of his papers       on    the   Electricity of the
 Gymnotus, and the Electricity Developed                      by the Friction of
 Globules of Water upon Solid Bodies, his discoveries in electricity
 and magnetism may he arranged in three groups, — those that relate
 to electro-chemistry      ;
                             — those that relate      to electro-dynamical        and
 electro-statical    induction    ;
                                    — and those that relate to the action of
 magnetism      and dynamic         electricity, upon light and all the other
 bodies of nature.*
     The discoveries in these three groups, which are too numerous
 and profound to be noticed in a brief sketch of his life, he began
 to publish in the " Philosophical Transactions" for 1831. They
  were continued in successive volumes of that work, and were after
  wards republished in four octavo volumes, which appeared in                  1 830,
  1844,   1855, and 1859.
     As an original investigator of scientific truth, Faraday had few,
  if any, equals ; and as a lecturer and expounder of the discoveries
  of others he was without           a  rival.  With    a   judgment thus sound
  and thus patiently exercised,            he had no difficulty in answering
  the   question     "What      is    truth?"    among      the  complex    laws of
  the material world, and he had none in answering the question as
  put by the Roman         Governor.        Like Newton, the greatest of his
  predecessors, he was a humble              Christian, with the simplicity of
  apostolic  times.     Among the grand truths which he had studied
  and made known, he had found none out of harmony with his

   John Goodsir, a celebrated anatomist, was born at Anstruther
in 1814, and was the eldest son of Dr Goodsir, surgeon in that
town. After passing through the curriculum of arts at the Uni
versity of St Andrews, he was apprenticed           to  Mr Nasmyth, the
celebrated    dentist in Edinburgh.      While he was going through
the usual course of medical instruction at the University, he also
pursued his anatomical studies under         Dr Knox, and the study of
mineralogy under Professor Jameson.              After obtaining license
from     the College of Surgeons,   he returned   to Anstruther, to prac
tise medicine     with his father,   and in this favourable     locality he
found leisure to study the various forms of animal life which are
so numerous      in the Firth of Forth.    In  1839 he published in the
"Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal" an elaborate memoir
on the development      and structure of the human teeth, and he was
soon after this appointed Conservator of the Museum of the College
of Surgeons.       While he held this office, but particularly in      1842
 and 1843, he delivered a series of lectures       on various branches of
 anatomy     and physiology.     In   1840 he became a member of the
 Wernerian     Society, and contributed many papers to its Memoirs.
 In  1842 he was elected a Member of this Society,           and enriched
 our Transactions and Proceedings with            many valuable      papers.
 When Professor Monro required an assistant, Mr Goodsir was              ap
 pointed Demonstrator of Anatomy in the University; and when
 the chair was vacant in 1846, he was appointed to it by the Town
 Council.     In this position, so favourable   for research, he prepared
 an extensive series of specimens illustrative of the anatomy of the
 animal kingdom, which now constitute the most valuable              part of
 the University     Anatomical Museum.       As   a teacher   he enjoyed a
 high reputation,     and he had    the gratification of lecturing in the
 winter session to between 300 and 400 pupils.         Under such engross
 ing studies, with which his whole time was occupied, Mr Good-
 sir's health gave way, and he was obliged, in 1855, to seek for its
 restoration   in a visit to the    Continent.     Though   still in feeble
  health on his return     to Scotland,  he continued    to prosecute with

                    of Edinburgh,       Session 1867-68.                    197
ardour his anatomical      studies, and in 1856 he published a series of
 memoirs on the structure       of the skeleton, which added greatly to
his reputation.      Although     Mr Goodsir continued to discharge the
 duties of his class, and carry on his original researches, his health
 was gradually giving way.          He had been afflicted      for many years
 with a general paralysis, which carried         him off on the 6th March
 1867.    In  order to do honour to his memory, his friends and pupils
 have resolved to establish      in the University      a Fellowship in Ana
 tomy and Physiology bearing his honoured name.
    Hubert Edward Scoresby- Jackson was born at Whithy in 1833,
 and was the nephew       of our celebrated      colleague   the late   Dr Wil
 liam   Scoresby.     He prosecuted        his medical studies     in London,
 where he became a licentiate of the Apothecaries' Company in 1855.
 In 1857 he came to Edinburgh, and took the degree of M.D.                   He
 then visited the Continent, and on his return to Edinburgh, where
 he settled as a   physician, he became       a Fellow of the Royal College
 of Surgeons in 1859, a     Fellow of this Society in 1861, and a Fellow
of the Royal College of Physicians in 1862. In 1860 he wrote a
 Life of his uncle.     In 1862 he published his Medical Climatology,
and in 1863 he read an interesting paper to this Society on the
Influence of Weather upon Disease and Mortality,                  a subject   to
 which   he had devoted      much      attention, and another on       the Tem
perature   of certain Hot Springs in the Pyrenees. As chairman of the
medical department of the Meteorological Society, he conducted,
under its auspices,      some important inquiries into climate, and he
published several valuable                         "
                                  papers in its       Proceedings."      On the
appointment of Dr Douglas Maclagan to the chair of Medical
Jurisprudence      in the University,        Dr Jackson    succeeded     him  as
lecturer in Materia Medica and Therapeutics in the extra-Acade
mical School of Edinburgh         ; and the last work which he published
was entitled
                " A Note-Book of Materia Medica, Pharmacology, and
Therapeutics."       Dr Jackson was in 1865 elected one of the phy
sicians of the Royal Infirmary.           Besides the papers we have men
tioned, he contributed several articles to the          " Edinburgh Medical
Journal."      Dr Jackson was       an   active  member    of the Edinburgh
Medical Missionary Society, and an earnest student of divine truth.
He was attacked with typhus fever caught in the Infirmary, and
    vol. vi.                                                         2 c

 died on the 1st February 1867, in the thirty-fourth year of his age.
 Dr Jackson      was  married   to the only daughter of       Sir William
 Johnston of Kirkhill, and has left       a widow and two     daughters    to
 lament his loss.
    Thomas Richardson, an eminent chemist, was born at Newcastle
on the 8th October       1816, and was educated       in that city.     At  a
 comparatively    early  age   he went to the University      of Glasgow,
 where he prosecuted his chemical        studies in the laboratory    of the
late   Dr Thomson.      From Glasgow he went to Germany, where             he
pursued his favourite      science at the University of Giessen, in the
celebrated laboratory     of organic  chemistry, then under the direc
tion   of Baron Justus Liebig.       After taking the degree of Ph.D.
he accompanied       Dr Thomson to Paris, where he completed              his
studies under the late celebrated Pelouze, whose recent death            has
deprived the Academy of Sciences of one of its most distinguished
 members.
    On his return to Newcastle    Dr Richardson devoted himself chiefly
to the application of chemistry to manufactures,        and the results of
his researches have been       published in an important work, entitled
" Chemical
              Technology ; or, Chemistry in its Application to Arts and
Manufactures."       This work was commenced as a translation of
Knapp's Technology, by Drs Ronald and Richardson in 1S47. The
first two parts of a second edition greatly enlarged, and form
ing quite   a new work, by the same authors,       was published    in 1865.
Parts third and fourth, by Dr Richardson and Dr Watt, appeared
in the years 1863-1866.        This valuable work is still far from being
completed.      Dr Richardson also took an important part in the
preparation    of the work upon " The Industries of the Tyne, the
Wear, and the Tees."
   During the last two years of his life Dr Richardson        was engaged
at Kirklees, near Wigan, in a series of elaborate         experiments on
the coal of that district, with the view of obtaining for        it  a place
on the Admiralty list for naval purposes.
    In  1853, on the death of our late colleague,     Professor Johnston
Dr Richardson was appointed Reader of Chemistry in the Univer
sity of Durham. On this occasion the degree of M.A. was con
ferred upon him, and he continued for fourteen years to discharge

                                                                         199

the duties of the chair with great credit to himself, and satisfaction
to the University.
     When he was engaged at Wigan with his experiments on coal,
he was attacked by paralysis       on the 10th of   July   1867, and expired
in a few hours.       Dr Richardson    was elected a  Fellow of this Society
in 1866, and he was a Fellow of the Royal Society of Loudon, a
Member of the Royal Irish Academy, and an Associate of the
 Institution of Civil Engineers.
     The Earl of Rosse, William Parsons,           a distinguished astrono
 mer, was the eldest son of Lawrence, the second Earl, and was born
 in the city of York on the 17th June 1800.           In  1818 Lord Oxman-
 town    entered   Trinity College, Dublin, and in the following year
 he passed into residence       in Magdalene College, Oxford, where he
 took the degree of     M.A. in 1822, when he was first-class in mathe
 matics.      After quitting Oxford he directed his attention to the
 construction of reflecting telescopes, and while he was occupied
 with his earliest experiments,      I had  the pleasure of frequent com
  munication with him.        His first scheme was to remove as much as
 possible the spherical aberration of spherical surfaces, by dividing
 the speculum     into several rings, which were       so placed as to have a
 common focus.        The difficulty of adjusting these rings, and keep
  ing them in their place, was so great that he abandoned the attempt,
  and set himself to the construction of telescopes with specula of a
  large size.    In the  execution of such instruments a thorough know
  ledge  of chemistry and mechanics was required, and the difficulties
  which he encountered at every step of the process were surmounted
  with a success greater than he could have anticipated.
     With the exception of Sir W. Herschel's large speculum of four
  feet, the largest telescopes hitherto constructed        were those of 13J,
  15, and 21 inches      in diameter,   by Mr Ramage of Aberdeen, and
  those  of 18 inches, by Sir John Herschel.         So early as 1822 Lord
  Oxmantown began to construct large specula, and he had ground
  and polished them of 15, 24, and 36 inches in diameter before he
  began the gigantic speculum of six feet, with a focal          length of 56
  feet.   This speculum was cast on the 13th April 1842, ground in
  1843, polished in 1844, and ready for trial in February 1845.        When
  it was placed in   a tube made  of deal staves  an  inch thick, and hooped

 200                Proceedings of the Royal Society
  with strong iron clamp rings, it was established          between two lofty
 castellated piers 60 feet high, and raised to different altitudes by
 a  strong chain cable attached to the top of the tube.
     With this noble instrument, which cost L.20,000, Lord Rosse
  made a series of important observations on nebulae and clusters of
 stars, which have been published in the Transactions of the Royal
  Society of London, who evinced the high value which they put
 upon them by giving him the Royal Medal.                  Many of the prin
 cipal scientific   institutions    in Europe hastened     to  do him honour.
  In 1849 he was elected President of the Royal Society of London.
 The University       of Cambridge conferred         upon him the degree of
 LL.D.      The Imperial Academy of St Petersburg elected him                an
 honorary member; and he was a member of the Royal Irish Aca
 demy, and the Astronomical and Geological Societies of London.
 He was made      a  Knight of St Patrick by the Queen, and he received
 from   Napoleon      III.    the   decoration   of the   Legion   of Honour.
 Lord Rosse was also        a trustee  of the British Museum, and in      1862
 he was elected Vice-Chancellor of the University of Dublin.
     In 1821 Lord      Rosse     was   elected   Member of Parliament       for
 King's County, and he continued to represent it till the end of
 the first reformed Parliament.              After he succeeded his father
 in 1841, he sat in the           Upper    House   as a representative   Peer.
 After   a protracted     illness, Lord Rosse died at Monkstown, near
Dublin, on the 31st of October 1867, and is succeeded by his eldest
son, Lord Oxmantown, who inherits the taste and abilities of his
father.
    James Smith of Jordanhill,           an  eminent geologist, was born in
Glasgow on the 15th August 1782, and was the son of Archibald
Smith,    a West Indian merchant resident in that city. After study
ing at the Grammar School and University of Glasgow, he became
a  partner in the West India house of Leitch and Smith                ; but he
never took an active part in business, devoting his leisure entirely
to literary and scientific pursuits.        His love of yachting was one of
the most prominent features            of his life.    He performed his first
cruise to the   Isle of Skye in 1806, in a        small vessel of twelve tons,
with Professor Milne and Dr Ure, and he              was  one  of the earliest
Commodores      in the Royal Northern Yacht Club.               He had thus

many opportunities of carrying on in different localities his scientific
inquiries, and his writings show how successfully            he availed    him
self of them.     After the peace in 1814, Mr Smith visited France
and Italy, where he resided for some time, occupied chiefly with the
study of their works of art. About the year 1830 he began to take
an active interest in the management            of the Andersonian Institu
tion, of which he was President,             and  he was the    founder  of its
Natural   History Museum, and presented to it its valuable collec
tion of Scottish coins. His earliest scientific paper was a notice
                     " Transactions       of the Antiquarian                  of
printed in the                                                    Society"
an    undescribed     vitrified   fort  in  the  Burnt   Isles of the Kyles
of Bute.     In dredging        on the    Frith of Clyde, and examining
the superficial deposits       of the existing shells,     he found that a
large proportion of those which are not in the Clyde are                still to
be   found in the Arctic Seas        ; and he was thus led to announce to
the Geological Society in 1836, that the climate of this country
was once colder     than     at present.     From 1839 to 1846 Mr Smith
resided successively      at Madeira, Gibraltar,      Lisbon, and Malta, on
account of the health        of some of his family, and in each of these
localities he found the materials for the most interesting of his
writings.
   During his residence at Malta he carried on those remarkable
inquiries by which he has attained          a high reputation   as a Scripture
critio and theologian.         The work which contains        them was pub
lished in 1848, under the        title of " The Voyage     and Shipwreck of
St Paul, with Dissertations on the Life and Writings of St Luke,
and the Ships and Navigation of the Ancients."               His views on the
shipwreck of St Paul have been admired                 by the most eminent
theologians of every country;          and his essay on the  Life of St Luke
and the sources    of his writings, has been highly praised, even by
those who do not adopt          all the views of its author.       In the last
edition of this work, in 1866, Mr Smith has expressed his gratifica
tion on finding that his views have received            a remarkable    confir
mation by the publication of Dr Cureton's translation of the newly
discovered Syriac version of St Matthew.
   Mr Smith    was a member of many of our scientific institutions.
He was elected     a  Fellow of the Royal Society of London in 1830,
and of this Society in 1822.           He was also a Fellow of the Wer

202                    Proceedings of the Royal Society
nerian       Society of Edinburgh,        and    of the Geological Society of
London
  Mr Smith enjoyed good health till the spring of 1866, when he had
an attack of paralysis,         which did not affect his mind          ;    but a recent
attack, at the close of the year, had a fatal termination, and he died
on the 17th        January 1867, in the eighty-fifth year of his age.
      Mr Smith was married, in 1809, to the granddaughter of Dr
Wilson, Professor of Astronomy in Glasgow, and he left nine chil
dren, of whom only three survive, viz., Archibald Smith, Esq.,
F.R.S., a distinguished mathematician and barrister ; the wife of
Walter Buchanan, Esq., M.P.; and the wife of the late William
Hamilton, Esq. of Minard.
  Sir James South, an eminent astronomer, was born in London
in 1785. He was the son of Mr South, a dispensing druggist in
South wark. His son, however, chose a higher branch of the medical
profession, and became a member of the Royal College of Surgeons.
Although         he practised    medicine     for some years           in Southwark,
the greater part of his time was spent in the study                         of practical
astronomy.
      In his     observatory in Blackman         Street,     Southwark,       Mr South
had a very fine five feet telescope, mounted                 equatorially, and with
it,   and    a   seven feet telescope       equatorially mounted,           he and      Mr
Herschel carried on, in the years 1821, 1822, and 1823,                      a   series   of
most valuable observations          on 3000 double and            triple stars, mea
suring their apparent distances and positions, and comparing them
with those of other astronomers.    The large volume containing
these remarkable          observations      was communicated           to the      Royal
Society of London on the 15th     January 1824, and   published as     is
a part of their Transactions for that year.  For the part which he
took in this great work Sir James received the Copley Medal from
the Society.
      In   the vicinity of one of the great thoroughfares         of the metropolis
astronomical instruments require particular caution against tremors,
and        therefore   Mr South     removed to Camden            Hill, Kensington,
where he erected         a   fine observatory,    and      furnished   it   with   a   mag
nificent equatorial instrument, executed                by   Troughton, but owing
to some imperfection in its construction that was never remedied,

Sir James was never able to make with it                a  continued series of
observations.     As one of the finest instruments of the day, it was
visited and occasionally used by many distinguished foreigners,
who were always hospitably received at Camden                Hill.
   Sir James was one of the founders            of the Royal Astronomical
Society,   and was once its President.         In  1830, when      the Duke of
Wellington     was at the head of the Government, he received the
honour of Knighthood, and          a pension  of L.300a-year was afterwards
conferred   upon him in consideration        of his services to astronomy.
Sir James was     a Corresponding Member of the Imperial Academy
of Sciences     at St Petersburg, of the         Royal Belgic Academy of
Sciences,    an Honorary Member of the Royal              Irish Academy, and
a Fellow of the Linnean Society.          In  his later years he was afflicted
with severe deafness, and spent much of his time in the use of the
microscope.     He died at Camden       Hill in  October 1867, in the eighty-
second year of his age.
   Joun Stewart, of Nateby Hall,            a gentleman       versed in various
branches of natural science, was born at Parkhouse, Stranraer,                on
the   10th   January 1813, and was the son of Lieutenant Leveson
Douglas Stewart, R.N. He was educated at the Academy and at
the University of Edinburgh.           He began life        as a merchant,   but
he soon quitted his profession,         his ample fortune enabling him to
devote    his time to different scientific pursuits, but especially to
geology and various departments            of natural history, in which he
made very large and valuable collections.            He devoted much of his
time to the microscope, and was one of the first to execute instan
taneous photographs.
   Mr   Stewart was a member of the Royal Physical Society of             Edin
burgh, and of the Botanical Society.            He died on the 17th March
1867.

the case v = 3, it is an ordinary focus, and in the case                                       v   >    3,    it is
a    special kind of focus, which,                 if   the term were required, might be
called    a    foco-focus;           the memoir contains                   an explanation of the
general theory           of the foci of plane curves.                          For    v   =   3, the equa

given circle."            This theorem            is   a sufficient basis for the complete
theory of the trizomal curve                  V'A°      +    VmB" +            VnC =              0;   and    it      is
thereby very easily seen that the curve                          VIA"      +     JmB"         +    JnC°           =   0

But for    v   >    3,   this   is   not   so, and the curve           VI  A     +   <fec.    =   0    is   only      a
particular form of the curve                 VIA"       + &c. =        0   ;   and the discussion of
this general form           is   scarcely more difficult than that of the special
form     VIA     +     &c. =        0,   included therein.                 The investigations in
relation to the theory of foci, and in particular to that of the foci of
the circular cubic and bicircular quartic, precede in the memoir the

      In     connection with this theorem,                       I    communicated to                  Mr Casey,
in March or                 April         1867,    the theorem           No. 164 of the present

Mr Casey, in               a letter to me dated 30th                  April    1867, informed me                    of
his own mode of viewing the question as                                     follows : — "The general

that the foci of                F are the         double foci of the quartic, and the points

   The object of the present Note                          is      to show, by       a   few examples
(of which, however, the last   the only one of any real import
                                                     is
ance), how easily the geometrical ideas supplied by Hamilton's
beautiful invention of the Hodograph enable us to dispense with
analytical processes in the establishment of some of the funda
mental propositions                 connected with the motion of                    a   single particle,
besides many others which are merely curious                                   ;   and also how they
help us to understand                  the      full bearing of some of the analytical
methods.         Some of the simplest of such geometrical                                investigations
are given in

assumed, — as, for instance, that when the acceleration    directed                            is
to afixed point, and varies inversely as the square of the distance
from     it,   the hodograph           is   a   circle, and the path               a   conic section, of
which the point          is

                                                                                                          it

known that the circle may                       be considered         as
the hodograph            corresponding to planetary
motion in the ellipse, but turned through                              a
 right angle.          In      fact,   if   YPZ       be   a   tangent
 to the ellipse at             P,    SY'    is   proportional to
 the velocity at            P,      and perpendicular to              it
 in direction.          The actual velocity bears to
 SY' the ratio of        //.   to ha, in the usual notation.
   Hence the tangent at                    Y'
                                     perpendicular to SP (the direction of
                                                is
 acceleration),         and thus we have an immediate proof that SP                                         is

   For,    if AP    be the   cycloid described by the point                         P of   the circle
                                   SP rolling uniformly on the line AS, the
                                   velocity at P is proportional to SP, and
                                   the direction of motion is perpendicular
                                   to    SP.        Hence the             hodograph             (turned
                                   through a right angle in its own plane)

                                   described with uniform angular velocity
about the point S.           That the motion is due to constant accelera

drawn perpendicular to AS, SP' ,=cPp.
  5.   If the     orbit be central, and be          a     circle described about a point
in its circumference,        the hodograph              is a parabola described                  about
the focus with angular velocity proportional to the radius vector.
             ,?                         For,   if   S be the centre             of force, P the
                                   point in its circular orbit, p the corre
                                   sponding point of the hodograph                          :   qp, the
                                   tangent to the hodograph                         at p, must be
                                   parallel to SP              ;   and, therefore,         if   SQq be
                                   the tangent at S, the triangle                        pSj (being
                          similar to PSQ) is isosceles.    Thus the
locus of p is a parabola. Also the angular velocity of Sp, being the
same as that of PQ, is double that of SP, and         therefore,              is,                   in
versely as SP*.          But the length of           Sp    is      inversely    as the perpen
dicular from      S   upon   PQ, i.e., inversely           as      SPt.

velocity about the pole— find the acceleration.
                                            Since the angular velocity of SP
                                          and the inclination of this line to
                                          the tangent               are each constant,             the
                                          linear velocity of              P   is    as   SP.     Take
                                         a     length      PT,       equal to   e    SP, to repre
                                          sent      it.        Then the hodograph,                 the

equal, to   PT,  evidently another logarithmic spiral similar to
                    is
the former, and described with the same uniform angular velocity.
Hence pt, the acceleration required,    equal to Sp, and makes
                                                          is               e

and equal to pt, and uv parallel to                          PT,        the whole acceleration                P«
may be resolved into             P« and vu; and Pvm is an isosceles triangle,
whose base angles are each equal to the angle of the spiral.                                                Hence
Pu and vu bear constant ratios to Pu, or to SP or PT.
  The acceleration, therefore, is composed of a central attractive
part proportional to the distance,                         and a tangential retarding part
proportional to the velocity.
     And,   if                of P's motion parallel to any line in
                 the resolved part
the plane of the spiral be considered, it is obvious that in it also
the acceleration will consist of two parts — one directed towards a
point in the line (the projection of the pole of the spiral), and
proportional to the distance from                          it,   the other proportional to the
velocity, but retarding the motion.
     Hence a particle which, unresisted,                                would have              a   simple har
monic   motion, has, when subject to resistance proportional to its
velocity,   motion represented by the resolved part of the spiral

3.    On the Antiquity of Intellectual Man                          :    Practical
                                                                         from          a
     and Astronomical point of view.                        By Professor C. Piazzi
     Smyth.
     The author of this paper confined himself entirely to the use of
contemporary data          ;   and amongst these, the only kinds found avail
able for the very earliest ages, were buildings                               of one kind or
another.
     Examining         these again,    after their first approximate arrange
ment in chronological relative order by well-known archaeologists,
it   was discovered that there resided              a   peculiar astronomical                  opposi
tion between the chief structures                   in the valley of the Euphrates
and those in the valley of the              Nile.
     The final contest          for antiquity amongst               all the archaeological
known remains            of the whole earth seemed to lie entirely with the

                   of Edinburgh,    Session 1867 -68.                   227
Euphrates and Nile series of buildings;         the palm being assigned
at last to the Great Pyramid beginning       of the latter.
   This particular monument, being then still further examined for
the manner    of its origination and appearance, was found to be in
direct violation of what has often been laid down         elsewhere to be
the rule or natural law of all purely human work.           And    as such
interference   with  a natural law, is in   so far one of the ordinary
definitions of a miracle, a yet more stringent examination of the
monument was made ; and resulted in the discovery, partly by some
of the author's friends, of a continued and consistent            series of
geometrical and physical data, infinitely above the knowledge of
all mankind in the days when the Great Pyramid was constructed              ;
and therefore in so far strengthening the conclusion        for a  miracle,
already otherwise    obtained.
   First, therefore, beyond compare, of all known human architec
tural remains,    in point of both    time,   moral   purity, mechanical
excellence, and philosophical knowledge; and dating itself astro
nomically from no further back than 2170        B.C., the author thought
that the continued study of this Great Pyramid              building    was
likely to shed   a most unexpected     amount    of light on the doctrine
of miracles in general    ; as well as on what was the manner of ap
pearance of the first traces of a   high order of human civilisation in
the present post-diluvian history of the world.

mend the Council to award the        Keith prize to the communication
from Professor    Piazzi Smyth, entitled ' Notes of Recent Measure

which the Council has in its power to confer."                         The Chairman then
handed the      Keith Medal to Professor Smyth, remarking that the

1.    On the Changes produced by direct Chemical Addition
      on the Physiological Action of certain Poisons. By Drs
       A. Crum Brown and Thomas R. Fraser.
     In this   paper the authors                 communicate        the first results   of an
attempt      to discover           the    relation which must exist between the
chemical constitution and the physiological action of a substance.
As the chemical constitution of the majority of physiologically active
substances  is unknown, they investigate the subject by examining
the physiological action of a substance before and after the per
formance       upon    it of       a     definite chemical operation, introducing a
known change into its constitution. The question is thus reduced to
a problem in what may be called a chemico-physical calculus of
finite variations.         Thus,         if the chemical constitution          be represented
by C, the physiological action,                   P, is some unknown function of C,
say/C.         In   order to       find/ a      change is produced on C, by which             it
becomes C + A C, and the corresponding change of physiological
action from /C to/C + A/-C is investigated. We here know
A    C,/C,   and    A/*    C   ;   and by finding their relations for a sufficiently
large number         of values of C (even where these are unknown), and,
by varying      AC,    the function             /may   be determinded.           The change
of constitution represented by A C must                        be    a simple and unam
biguous one.  There are two kinds of operation to choose between
— replacement and addition ; and the authors select as the first
subject of inquiry the effect of addition — that   such chemical         is,
change as increases the active atomicity of atoms or radicals.                           The
following may         be   given         as   simple examples of such operations        : —

                      of Edinburgh,     Session 1867-68.                             229
  Their reason for this selection          is,   that, as far as     it   is   possible to
judge from previously known facts, replacement                     does    not produce
nearly so great  change of physiological action
                      a                                            as addition       does.
Thus, comparing           the action of carbonic      oxide      and carbonic        acid,
hydrocyanic acid and methylamine,                arsenious and kakodylio acids,
strychnia and brucia, and the salts of the ammonium                       bases derived
from them,      it   may be seen that addition,         in many       cases      at least,
diminishes or removes physiological activity.                      This comparison
leads to   a   suspicion    that physiogical activity       is     in some way con
nected with chemical condensation, by which term the authors mean
susceptibility of addition, whether the addition takes place                        by   the
increase of the atomicity of an atom, or of group of atoms.
                                                       a                             This
suspicion      receives some confirmation          from    the fact, that such of
the stable combinations          of pentatomic       arsenic and antimony, as
have been             physiologically, are stated to be inert, while
                examined
all the soluble compounds of triatomic arsenic and antimony are
active; similarly, the aromatic         _ bodies     are, as   a   rule, more active
than the corresponding          fatty bodies.      The occurrence, however, of
such poisons as alcohol, oxalic acid, and corrosive sublimate among
saturated      substances, and of comparatively            inert condensed com
pounds, such as benzoic acid and salicine, shows that condensation
is   not the only condition of physiological activity.
     The statements of Stahlschmidt and Schroff, in reference to the
action of the salts of methyl strychnia, induced the authors to turn
their attention, in the first place, to the effect of the addition of

230                  Proceedings of the Royal Society
iodide of methyl to the natural alkaloids.            As the iodides of the
complex ammoniums             thus produced are, in most cases, sparingly
soluble in water, they have also examined the action of the cor
responding sulphates.
    The poisonous alkaloids thus examined, and included in this
paper, are strychnia, brucia, thebaia, codeia, morphia, and nicotia.
The authors give details of the processes followed in obtaining the
 iodide and the sulphate of the methyl-derivatives of these bases,
and they describe their physiological effects.
    Twelve grains of iodide of methyl-strychnium,*             subcutaneously
administered,      produced no effect on a rabbit, weighing three pounds.
Fifteen grains were recovered from, after symptoms; and twenty
grains was a fatal dose. When exhibited by the stomach, twenty
grains of this compound           did not cause any symptom        ;  while the
same rabbit was rapidly killed by one-tenth           of a grain of strychnia,
given    in  exactly the same way. Twenty grains of iodide of methyl-
strychnium contain about fourteen grains of strychnia.
     The sulphate of methyl-strychnium, being a much more soluble
 salt than the iodide, was found to have a much smaller poisonous
 dose.     One grain was fatal to a rabbit, by subcutaneous          exhibition.
 Eight-tenths of a grain were recovered from, while five-tenths did
 not   cause     any symptom.        The rabbit that recovered after the
 administration of eight-tenths of a grain of sulphate of methyl-
 strychnium, died shortly after one-twentieth of          a grain of strychnia
 was injected under the skin.
    Both the iodide and the sulphate of methyl-strychnium produced
symptoms        altogether different from those of strychnia.             There
 were no convulsions, nor was there the slightest exaggeration                 of
 the reflex function    ;  the symptoms were those of paralysis, and death
was produced        by the asphyxia that this occasioned.         The authors
further investigated this action by localised            poisoning in frogs      ;
 and they have demonstrated           that iodide and sulphate of methyl-
strychnium paralyse the peripheral terminations (end-organs) of the
 motor nerves, and, therefore,           possess exactly the same action       as
 curare (wourali) has.
    Brucia and thebaia act in the same way as strychnia, and              it was
    * The   action of iodide of ethyl-strychnium  was also examined, and found
 to bo the same as that of iodide of methyl-strychnium.

                   of Edinburgh,      Session 1867-68.                     231
found that iodide and sulphate of methyl-brucium and methyl-the
baium have the same action as the analogous strychnia compounds.
The fatal dose of iodide of methyl-brucium            was found to be very
much the same as that of the corresponding compound              of strychnia   ;
a larger dose was, however, necessary to produce death with sulphate
of methyl-brucium, than with sulphate of methyl-strychnium.
Iodide of methyl-thebaium, being more soluble in warm water, has
a  smaller fatal dose than the iodides         of methyl-strychnium         and
methyl-brucium.       Six grains produced no effect when injected under
the skin of a rabbit    ; eight grains caused symptoms, which were re
covered from    ; and death occurred eleven minutes after the injec
tion of ten grains.        Eight grains of iodide of methyl-thebaium
contained about five grains and       a half of thebaia, and, for a rabbit,
the fatal dose of this alkaloid is one-fifth     of a  grain.
   Among the opium alkaloids, codeia ranks next to thebaia               in ac
tivity.   It was found by the authors, that six grains of iodide              of
methyl-codeium dissolved in warm warer, and injected under the
skin of a rabbit, caused no effect.         Ten grains, however,        was an
almost fatal dose, and this contains         about twelve     times   as much
codeia as would     kill a rabbit.   It was also found that the fatal dose
of sulphate of methyl-codeium is not very different from that of the
iodide. Neither of these compounds possess the usual convulsant
action of codeia; and      as this alkaloid has but a feeble soporific ac
tion,  it was difficult to determine how far this was modified by the
direct chemical addition of methyl compounds.               The author also
found that iodide and sulphate of methyl-codeium paralyse the motor
nerve end-organs, an effect that is not produced by codeia itself.
    Iodide of methyl-morphium is        a  very insoluble substance.       The
largest dose that could, therefore,      be administered subcutaneously
to a rabbit was twenty grains, and this large quantity produced               no
effect.    Eight grains of morphia were, some days afterwards,               ex
hibited in the same way to this rabbit       ; the result was a decided so
porific effect, followed by epileptiform convulsions and death.
    No effect was produced when iodide of methyl-morphium was
administered to rabbits by the stomach, even in          so large    a dose as
thirty grains.
    Recognising     the possible   fallacies connected with experiments
with such    a substance on rabbits,    the authors determined       to observe

232                Proceedings of the Royal Society
the effect on man.      One of themselves,     accordingly, took, on one
occasion,   half a grain of iodide of methyl-morphium         as a powder,
and on another, one grain (containing about three-fourths         of a grain
of morphia), but on neither occasion was there observed the slightest
soporific or other effect.
    Four grains of sulphate of methyl-morphium produced decided
narcotism on a rabbit, but no convulsive effect.         Indeed, with this
dose, and with various others that were given, paralysis appeared,
and the authors have demonstrated        that this symptom is due to an
effect on the motor nerve end-organs.
    Iodide of methyl-nicotium was obtained in the form of crystals
extremely soluble in cold water. When given to rabbits by subcu
taneous injection, a dose of five grains was perfectly inert ; one of
fifteen grains produced serious symptoms, followed by recovery          : and
a dose of twenty grains was fatal.       The symptoms were principally
distinguished from those of nicotia by the absence of convulsions            ;
but no paralytic action on motor nerve end-organs          was caused.
    The   authors have    also  investigated    the  action  of   iodide    of
methyl, and they obtained no evidence in support of the extremely
improbable    hypothesis, that some of the changes produced           in the
action of the substances     they had examined      might have been due
to the addition of the physiological action of the methyl compounds.
They conclude by discussing the possible causes of these modifica
tions, by pointing out some of the practical applications of their
results, and by promising to examine how far iodide of methyl may
prove an antidote to the poisonous       effects of these vegetable alka
loids, whose fatal dose it increases.
2.   On the Burning Mirrors of Archimedes, and on the Con
    centration     of Light produced         by Keflectors.       By John
    Scott, Esq.     Communicated by Professor Kelland.
    That the Roman ships were destroyed by burning glasses in
vented by Archimedes, is mentioned as a fact by most of the ancient
writers, especially   those who treat on mechanics,       and their state
ments    have been     repeated   by succeeding     authors,   without any

doubts having been          suggested   until comparatively recent times.
 The earliest authorities on the subject are Diodorus Siculus, Lucian,
Galen, Dion Cassius, and Pappus.            It is much to be regretted that
a  work by the last named author on the Siege of Syracuse is now
lost ; but Zonares and Tzetzes, writers of the 12th century, in
whose time      it was extant, give quotations       from it.     That of the
latter, translated                                         "
                        pretty literally, runs thus : — When Marcellus
had placed the ships a bow shot off, the old man (Archimedes) con
structed a sort of hexagonal mirror.          He placed at proper distances
from the mirror other smaller mirrors of the same kind, which were
moved by means of their hinges and certain             plates of metal.     He
placed   it amid the rays of the sun at noon, both in summer and
winter. The rays being reflected by this, a frightful fiery kindling
was excited on the ships, and it reduced them to ashes, from the
distance    of   a  bowshot.     Thus the old man baffled Marcellus, by
means of his inventions."
   At  a later period, mirrors similar to that of Archimedes, appear
to have engaged the attention of Baron Napier of Merchiston, and
other mathematicians;         but strange enough, the famous naturalist,
Buffon, was the first to establish         the practicability, and therefore
the probability, of the achievement.         He employed      a combination of
plane reflectors, consisting of ordinary looking-glasses, eight inches
by six, attached to a single frame.         With forty of these glasses he
set on fire    tarred beech at a distance of 66 feet.        A  plank smeared
with   tar and brimstone,        was ignited at 126 feet, by 98 glasses.
A combination of 1 28 glasses, with         a clear sun,  inflamed very sud
denly a plank of tarred fir at 150 feet.          In addition   to these expe
riments made at Paris, about the beginning of April, others were
made in summer, by which wood was kindled at 200 and 210 feet,
and silver and other metals were melted at distances varying from
25 to 40 feet.
   So much for the positive side of the question,          let us now briefly
consider the negative side.
   Descartes       and others treated    the   whole affair of the     burning
mirrors   as a    fiction, on the gratuitous assumption that the specula
employed were single parabolic reflectors.             A different and more
valid reason for doubt has arisen from the circumstance, that
   vol. rv.                                                          2h

234               Proceedings of the Royal Society
Polybius,    Livy, and Plutarch, are silent respecting           the burning
mirrors, although they describe        some    of the     other  contrivances
employed     by Archimedes against the assailants.            In reply to this
objection,   it has been stated,    as an   admitted axiom in estimating
historical evidence, that the silence of one author is not sufficient
to disprove an event of which another, even subsequent in point
of   time, has given a plain       and   consistent narrative.         Besides,
similar omissions     by ancient historians are not unfrequent            ;  and
in this instance, it is the less surprising, since the invention had
perished    with the fall of Syracuse,       and the death      of the illus
trious inventor, who, in the peculiar circumstances,           must have en
deavoured     to keep from    his contemporaries      the secret of its con
struction.
    Returning to Buffon's experiments,       Peyrard appends to his trans
 lation of the works of Archimedes         a memoir     of his own, pointing
out the defects     of Buffon's combination of reflectors, viz. : — That
the number of assistants       required   to adjust so many mirrors were
apt to confuse     one   another  — the   operation     itself was   a  tedious
one, taking about      half an hour for one hundred and sixty-eight
 mirrors — and, after all, the superposition of the light was imperfect.
Again, after     a short  interval, a readjustment would          be rendered
 necessary by the angular deviation of the rays, arising from                 the
 varying position of the sun.       Peyrard suggests
                                                           " that each mirror
 should be furnished with a telescope, and a somewhat                  complex
 apparatus, to render the adjustment more speedy and accurate,               and
 by this means to diminish the number of assistants required.               This
 remedy is admitted to be only partial.            It  is proposed, in what
 follows, to obviate the forementioned        defects, by producing a solar
 reflecting machine, capable of being directed by one eye, guided by
 a single hand,    and coinciding in its construction with the descrip
 tion in the fragment preserved by Tzetzes from Pappus.
    It  is stated that Archimedes contrived a hexagonal mirror, and
 placed at proper distances      from  it other smaller ones of the same
 kind.    This peculiarity has no parallel in that of Buffon.           Articles
  11, 12, and 13,  in the memoir, show how burning mirrors can be
 constructed,   corresponding    to the above description,       free from the
  defects of Buffon, and capable, moreover, of darting the consuming
  rays instantaneously in any given        direction, thereby      affording    a

3.    On the Great Pyramid                        of Gizeh, and Professor C. P.
       Smyth's Views concerning it. By A. D. Wackerbarth,
       A.M., of Upsala.                Communicated by Professor Kelland.
     The author gives a detailed statement of the theories of Professor
Smyth, as given in the Transactions of this Society, Vol. XXIII.
Part    III.        He then, after heartily commending                   the zeal and      dili
gence of the Professor,                 brings forward objections to some of hi*
views.        1.   As to the metron or unit of linear measure. Mr Wacker
barth objects that this measure was utterly unknown to the ancient
Egyptians — appearing in no Egyptian document or monument
whatever, nor in any ancient writer who describes the condition of
the Egyptians.               Mr Wackerbarth collects from the materials most
accessible the following table of weights and measures in use amongst
the ancient Egyptians (corrected for the recent measure of the cubit
of Karnak, made by Sir Henry James).

   2. The author then, finding no such measure as the metron, goes
on to say       :   —
   " It is really           very unpleasant to reject a beautiful and ingeniously
carried out theory which one wishes to believe, but                                 I cannot,         how
ever, arrive at any other conclusion than that Professor Smyth's
very interesting account of an ancient Egyptian standard                                    of length,
exactly equal to a ten-millionth of the earth's axis of rotation, and
the entire system of weights and measures that he has deduced
from this imaginary unit, requiring accurate knowledge                                              of the
earth's dimensions,              figure, and density, several centuries before the
age of Abraham,                  and    the supposed              connection of the English
measures with these, are things purely mythical.                                     On the other
hand, that the pyramid and its contents                            were really the standards
of the ancient Egyptian kingdom,                            is,
                                     or seems to me an opinion
not destitute of probability but cannot think that those standards
                                             ;      I
were constructed with any reference to the dimensions                                    of the earth,
but that they were arbitrarily chosen quantities, intended                                     to repre
sent on        a    tolerably large scale the size of those portions of the
human body which their names indicate                              :   e.g.,   JUL&.g,I        (cubitus),
the arm from the elbow to the point of the middle finger                                        ;    cuon
palmus),       the breadth of the band,                 &c, &c.
 "   In fine, Professor Smyth's method, namely, that of multiplying
or dividing by quantities, for the introduction of which  would be                        it
hard to give any satisfactory reason, — as, for example, the number
366, with which the base was divided, and which          neither the                is

                           of Edinburgh,             Session 1867-68.                              237
exact number of days in                     a sidereal      year, nor anything else, and
again,    the very              uncertain     number,        5,672 (the          earth's    density),
— appears           to me in the highest degree dangerous.                          How deceitful
results thus obtained can be,                     I shall now,       in conclusion of this dis
cission, attempt to illustrate by                     a few examples         ;    and before doing
this, I beg to state that, entertaining the highest respect for Pro
fessor Smyth, I have not the least intention of making light of his
work, though this method    of reasoning, being analogous to the
reductio ad absurdum, will unavoidably at times have something of
that appearance.
   " Ex.   1.       It   is a historical fact, that the present English weights
and measures are not of any very great antiquity. At the time of
the Norman conquest the yard was about 39-6 of the present Eng
lish inches,         a    little longer than the French metre ; and the foot,
accordingly,             132 modern inches, a little greater than the Paris
foot.     In    the year 1101,              King Henry I. determined the yard by
the length of his own arm, and that is the determination                                         which
the present yard is intended                        to represent;        and that yard, more
over, has never been, even in modern times, defined by any fraction
of any of the earth's dimensions, but by its proportion to the length
of the seconds' pendulum at 51£° latitude, and of this yard the
English foot is the third part. Now, a degree of the equator is
just 365,260524 ft.   Divide a thousandth part of that number by
the length of the sidereal year in solar days, 365'25G358, and we
have 1-0000114              ;   that is to say,      if   we take a thousandth             of   a degree
of the equator, and divide it by the number of days in                                     a sidereal
year, we have an English foot as nearly as a powerful                                      microscope
can determine it.                 And yet it is certain that this is purely accidental.
    "Ex.       2.    If I       take 10,000 times e, the base of the hyperbolic
logarithms,          and multiply           it into the quantity, which in the lunar
theory is called g, — that                  is,   the ratio of the difference between the
 moon's and its ascending node's mean motions to the moon's mean
motion,    — and divide the earth's polar radius by the product, tho
 result   is   the length of the pyramid's                   side.     But       are we to suppose
 that the Egyptians forty centuries                         ago were acquainted with the
 lunar theory, the earth's compression, and the use of logarithms,
 and, moreover, took this clumsy method of perpetuating their know
 ledge?        Is   it   not far more probable that the architect simply deter

238                        Proceedings oj the Iiot/al bociety
mined that the length of the side should be 444 cubits, and accord
ingly measured out that distance                   ?
     " Ex.     3.   Again,    if                               of the
                                   instead of taking Colonel Vyse's measure
base,     we accept for that quantity the mean of half a dozen of the
most trustworthy travellers' statements,                        — for   instance, Vyse's, the
French Academicians', Caviglia's, Wilkinson's,                               Lane's, and Davi
son's, — we have for the length of the side in English feet a number
which expresses in millimetres the mean height of the barometer
at Upsala.  But will any one maintain that the dimensions of the
pyramid were intended by its builders to have any reference what
ever to that interesting constant ?
  " Ex. 4. If we multiply
                              together one-tenth of the side of the
pyramid's base, the length of the line joining the middle of the
side and the apex (that                 is,
                              the height of each one of the four
isosceles triangles that compose the pyramid), and the modulus for
the common logarithms, the result                      is   3420, the constant              of lunar
parallax, for which, in Burg's tables, the value 3420""96                             is    given.
     " Ex.     5.   the side of the base (763-81) be divided by the
                    Lastly,   if

that quotient again by the ratio of the force of gravity at London
to the force of gravity at the pyramid (lat. = 30°), (1-00188), the

4.On the best Arrangement for producing Pure Spectrum                    a

        a      By   Clerk Maxwell, M.A., F.RSS. L. E.
                                   J.                                                        &
     In   experiments          on the spectrum,           it    is   usual    to employ       a   slit
through which the light                 is    admitted,     a   prism to analyse the light,
and one or more lenses to bring the rays of each distinct kind to                                    a
distinct focus on the screen.     The most perfect arrangement                                     is
that adopted by M. Kirchhoff, in which two achromatic lenses are
used, one before and the other after the passage of the light through
the prism, so that every pencil consists of parallel rays while pass
ing through the prism.
   But when the observer has not achromatic lenses at his command,
or when, as in the case of the highly refrangible rays, or the rays
of heat, he         is   restricted   in the use of materials,          it    may   still   be use-

                             of Edinburgh,            Session 1807-68.                              239
ful to be able to place the lenses and prism in such                                    a way as to
bring the rays of all colours to their foci at approximately the same
distance from the prism.
     We shall first examine the effect of the prism in changing the
convergency or divergency of the pencils passing through        and                           it,
 then that of the lens, so that by combining the prism and the lens
we    may cause their defects to disappear.
     When pencil of light       refracted through                                  plane surface, its
                                            is is
               a                                                               a
convergency         or divergency                   less in that medium which has the
greatest       refractive index         ;    and this change              is   greater as the angle
of incidence        is       greater,   and         also as       the index of refraction             is
greater.
   When the pencil passes through     prism its convergency ora
divergency will be diminished as   enters, and will be increased
                                                         it
when    emerges, and the emergent pencil will be more or less con
          it
vergent or divergent than the incident one, according as the angle
of emergence            is   greater or less than that of incidence.                      This effect
will increase           with the difference                 of these angles and with the
refractive index.
     When the angle of incidence                       is   equal to that of emergence the
convergence         of the pencil            is     unaltered,      but since the more refran
gible rays have the greatest angle of emergence, their convergency
or divergency will be greater than that of the less refrangible
rays.
     This effect will          be increased          by making the angle of incidence
less, and that of emergence greater                      ;    and    it    will be diminished by
increasing         the angle of incidence,                   that    is,
                                                                      by turning the prism
round its edge towards the slit.                       If    the angle of the prism     not   is
too great, the convergency                   or divergency of all the pencils may be
made the same (approximately) by turning the prism in this way.
     This correction, however, diminishes the separation of the colours.
It   is   inapplicable to        a   prism of large angle, and                 it   takes no account
of the chromatic aberration of the lens.                             By altering the arrange
ment, the lens may be made to correct the prism.     The effect of                                    a
convex lens   to increase the convergency, and to diminish the diver
                   is
gency, of every pencil           ;   but the change           is   greatest on the most refran
gible rays.  The prism, except when its base       very much turned         is
towards the slit, makes the highly refrangible rays more convergent

240                       Proceedings of the Royal Society
or more divergent than the less refrangible rays, according as they
were convergent             or divergent originally.                        If the     rays pass through
the prism before they reach the lens, the pencils                                      will be divergent
at incidence,       and the more refrangible        will be most divergent at
emergence.          If     they then fall on the lens, they will be more con
verged than the rest                 ;   so    that by      a proper arrangement                   all may be
brought to their foci at approximately the same distance.                                                 If    the
violet rays come to their focus first, we must turn the                                           base    of the
prism more towards the light, and vice versa.
  We proceed to the numerical calculation of the proper arrange
ment.
  To find the variation of position of the focus of light passed
through a prism as dependent on the nature of the light.

turned from the light.

  1.  Pyramidal      Structures in Egypt and elsewhere              ; and the
       Objects of their Erection.           By Sir  J. Y.   Simpson, Bart.
     After considering the many proposed derivations of the word
 Pyramid, it was pointed out that the origin of the name suggested
 by the     distinguished    Egyptologist, Mr Birch, from two Coptic
 words, "pouro," "the king," and " emahau" or "maha," "tomb,"
 — the two in combination signifying " the king's tomb," — was pro
 bably correct.     "Men," in Coptic, signifies "monument," "memo
 rial;" and " pouro- men," or "king's monument " may possibly also
 be the   original form of the word.        Various authors,   as  Pope, Pow-
 nall, Daniel      Wilson,   Burton,    had   long applied the term pyra
 mid to the larger forms       of conical and round sepulchral mounds,
cairns,    or barrows   —   such   as   are  found   in Ireland,      Brittany,
 Orkney, &c., and in numerous districts of the New World                as  well
as   the Old   ; and which are all characterised     by containing     in their
 interior, chambers or cells, constructed       usually of large stones, and
with megalithic galleries leading into them.             In  these chambers
(small in relation to the hills of stone or earth in which they
were imbedded) were found the remains of sepulture, with stone
weapons, ornaments, &c.          The galleries and chambers were roofed,
sometimes with flags laid quite flat, or placed abutting against each
other; and occasionally with large stones arranged over the
internal cells in the form of         a  horizontal arch or dome.        In his
travels to Madeira and the Mediterranean (1840), Sir W. Wilde
details in interesting terms his visit to the pyramids of Egypt;
and in describing the roof of the interior chambers of one of the
pyramids at Sakkara,* he remarks on the analogy of its construc-
    * Sir  J. Gardner Wilkinson thinks that the pyramids of Sakkara are pro
bably older than the other groups of these structures. as those of Gizeh or the
Great Pyramid. — See Rawlinson's Herodotus, vol. ii. chapter viii.

placed   on its banks above Drogheda, he describes at some length

the last of these mounds (New Grange), stating that it
of an enormous cairn or " hill of small stones, calculated at
 180,000 tons weight, occupying the summit            of one of the natural
undulating slopes which enclose the valley of the Boyne upon the
north. It is said to cover nearly two acres, and is 400 paces in
circumference,     and now about 80 feet higher than the adjoining
natural surface.      Various excavations    (he adds) made into its sides
and upon its summit, at different times, in order to supply materials
for building and road-making, have assisted to lessen its original
height, and also to destroy the beauty of its outline."               Like the
other analogous mounds and pyramids placed there and elsewhere,
New Grange has          a long megalithic gallery, of above 60 feet in
 length, leading inward into three dome-shaped chambers or crypts.
 After describing minutely, and with a master-hand, the construc
tion of these interior parts, and the carvings of circles, spirals, &c.,
 upon the enormous        stones of which they are built,      Sir William
Wilde goes on to observe :— " We believe with most modern
 investigators into such subjects, that it was a tomb, or great
 sepulchral Pyramid, similar in every respect to those now standing
by the banks of the Nile, from Dashour to Gizeh, each consisting
 of  a great   central chamber      containing one or more sarcophagi,
 entered by a long stone-covered         passage.    The external aperture
 was concealed,      and   the whole    covered    with a great    mound of
 stones or earth in a conical form.         The early Egyptians, and the
 Mexicans also, possessing        greater  art   and better tools than the
 primitive    Irish, carved,     smoothed,     and   cemented    their    great
 pyramids   ;  but  the type   and purpose is all the same.     .   .   . How
 far anterior to the Christian era its date should         be placed, would
 be a matter     of speculation   ; it may be of an age coeval, or even
 anterior, to its brethren on the Nile."        Other pyramidal barrows at
 Maeshowe, Gavr       Inis, &c., were referred to and illustrated; showing
 that a gigantic sepulchral cairn was in its mass an unbuilt pyramid,
 or, in other words, that a pyramid was a built cairn.

                     of Edinburgh,     Session 1867-68.                    245
           Sepulchral Character, dtc, of the Egyptian Pyramids.
    All  authors, from     the father of history downwards,        have gene
rally agreed in considering the pyramids of Egypt              as  magnificent
and regal sepulchres       ; and the sarcophagi,      &c., of the dead have
been found in them when first opened for the purposes               of plunder
or curiosity.      The pyramidal sepulchral mounds on the banks of
the Boyne were opened and rifled in the ninth              century by the in
vading Dane,       as  told in different old Irish annals; and the Great
Pyramid       of Gizeh, &c, is said       to   have   been broken     into and
harried in the same century by the Arabian Caliph,                El  Mamoon.
This, the largest       and   most gigantic      of the many pyramids of
Egypt, had been calculated by Major Forlong, Asso. Inst. C. Engrs.,
as a    structure which in the East would cost about L. 1,000,000.
 Over   India and the East generally, enormous sums had often been
expended on royal sepulchres.           The Taj Mahal of Agra, built by
 the Emperor Shah Jahan for his favourite queen, cost perhaps
 double or triple this money      ; and yet it formed only a portion of an
 intended larger mausoleum which he expected to rear for himself.
 The Great Pyramid contains in its interior, and directly over the
 King's Chamber, five entresols or "chambers of construction,"
 as   they have been termed, intended apparently to take off the
 enormous      weight of masonry      from    the cross stones forming the
 roof of the King's Chamber itself.           These entresols   are chambers,
 small and unpolished, and never intended to be opened.                    But
 in the uppermost of them, opened by Colonel Howard Vyse, a most
 interesting discovery was made about thirty years ago. The sur
 faces of some of the stones were found painted             over in red ochre
 or paint with rudish hieroglyphics — being quarry marks written
 on the stones 4000 years ago, and             hence, perhaps,    forming the
  oldest preserved     writing in the world.        Among these accidental
  hieroglyphics Mr Birch discovered two royal ovals, viz., Shufu (the
                                               "
  Cheops of Herodotus) and Nu Shufu — a brother" (writes Professor
  Smyth)    "of  Shufu, also   a king and    a co-regent   with him."     Most,
  if not  all, of the other pyramids     are believed    to have been erected
  by individual     kings during their individual         or separate reigns.
  If  these hieroglyphics proved that two kings were connected with
  the building of the Great Pyramid, that circumstance          would perhaps
 account for its size and the duplicity and position of its sepulchral

246                  Proceedings of the Royal Society
chambers.*         The Great Pyramid             is now totally deprived             of the
external polished limestone coating which covered it at the time
of Herodotus' visit, some twenty-two centuries ago                         ;   and    " now
(writes Mr Smyth) is so injured as to be in the eyes of some
passing travellers little better than a heap of stones." But all
the internal built         core of the magnificent structure               remains,       and
contains in its interior (beside a rock chamber below) two higher
built chambers or crypts above — the so-called King's Chamber and
Queen's Chamber— with galleries and apartments                         leading to them.
The walls of these galleries and upper chambers are built with
granite and limestone masonry of             a   highly-finished character.               The
pyramid standing next the Great Pyramid, and nearly of equal size,
is said by Herodotus to have been raised by the brother of Cheops.
The other pyramids at Gizeh are usually regarded                               as   later in
date.     But the exact era of the reign or reigns of their builders has
not as yet been determined,            in consequence            of the break made in
Egyptian chronology by the invasion of the Shepherd Kings.
  In their mode of building,              the pyramids of Gizeh, &c., are all
similar. " There is nothing"                                                        "in
                                          (observes Professor Smyth)                      the
stone-upon-stone          composition of the Great Pyramid which speaks
of the mere building            problem    to be solved there,            as   being of     a
different character or requiring inventions by man of any absolutely
higher order, than elsewhere."               But the Great Pyramid has been
imagined to contain some hidden symbols and meanings.                               For " it
is the manner        of the Pyramid"             (according to Professor Smyth)

  * Mr Birch,  however — and it is impossible to cite a higher authority in such
a question— holds the cartouches of Shufu and Nu Shufu to refer only to one
personage— namely, the Cheops of Herodotus ; and, believing with Mr Wilde
and Professor Lepsius, that the pyramids were as royal sepulchres built and
methodically extended and enlarged as the reigns of their intended occupants
lengthened out, he ascribes the unusual size of the Great Pyramid to the
unusual   length   — as   testifiedby Manetho, &c. — of the reign of Cheops ; the
erection of a sepulchral      chamber in its built portion being, perhaps, in conse
quence of some ascertained deficiency in the rock chamber or gallery below.
   t The Mexican Pyramid of Cholula has a base of more than 1420 feet, and
is hence about twice the length of the basis of the Great Pyramid of Gizeh.

marvellous metrological monument,               built some forty centuries ago,

for them, but one where the original standards were to be preserved
for some thousands of years, safe from the vicissitudes of empires
and the decay of nations."            Messrs Taylor and Smyth further hold
that this Great Pyramid was built for these purposes of mensura
tion, under Divine inspiration — the standards being, through super
human origination and guidance, made and protected by      till they      it
came to be understood and interpreted in these latter times.    For,
observes     Professor Smyth, "the Great Pyramid was                a    sealed book
to   all the world until this present day, when modern science, aided
in part by the dilapidation            of the building       and    the structural
features thereby opened up — has at length been able to assign the
chief interpretations."          Professor Smyth has, in his remarkable
devotedness         and enthusiasm,   lately measured most of the principal
points in the Great Pyramid           ;   and for the great zeal, labour, and
ability which he has displayed in this self-imposed mission, the
Society have very properly and justly bestowed upon him the
Keith Medal. But the exactitude of the measures does not neces
sarily    imply exactitude in      the reasoning      upon   them   ;    and on what
grounds can     it   be possibly regarded as     a   metrological monument and
not   a   sepulchre,   legitimately the subject of our present inquiry.

     Mr   Taylor ascribes to Noah the original idea of the metrological
structure      of    the    Great Pyramid.        "To Noah"             (observes        Mr
Taylor) "we must ascribe the original idea, the presiding mind,
and the benevolent purpose. He who built the Ark was, of all men,
the most competent           to direct the building       of the Great Pyramid.
He was born 600 years before the Flood, and lived 350 years after
that event, dying in the year 1998 B.C. Supposing the pyramids

 248                Proceedings of the Royal Society

 but nothing could more illustrate this character of a preacher of
 righteousness     after the Flood than that he should be the first to
 publish   a system    of weights and measures for the use of all man
 kind, based upon the measure of the earth." Professor Smyth,
 computing by another chronology, rejects the presence of Noah,
 and makes a shepherd       — Philithion, alluded to by Herodotus* — the
 presiding and directing genius of the structure, holding him to be
 a Cushite skilled in building, and under whose inspired direction
 the pyramid rose, containing within            it miraculous measures and
 standards of capacity, weight, length, heat, &o.
    The   Coffer in the King's       Chamber     in the Great Pyramid an
             Alleged Standard for          Measures op Capacity.
     A granite    coffer, stone box, or sarcophagus          standing in that
 interior cell of the pyramid called the King's Chamber,                  is held
by Messrs      Taylor and Smyth to have been hewn out and placed
there as a measure of capacity for the world, so that the ancient
Hebrew, Grecian, and Roman measures of capacity                     on the one
hand, and our modern          Anglo-Saxon       on the other, are all derived
directly or indirectly from the parent measurements of this granite
vessel.
    Various extractsf were read from the works of these authors, show
 ing that, in their belief, the great object for which the whole pyra
mid was created, was the preservation of this coffer as a standard
of measures.        Further published accounts from Mr Taylor and
from Mr Smyth's first work were adduced, averring that the coffer
represented     without and within       a rectangular figure of mathemati-
   *  Herodotus states that the Egyptians detested the memories of the kings
who built the two larger   Pyramids, viz., Cheops and Cephren ; and hence, he
adds, " they commonly call the Pyramids after Philithion, a shepherd, who at
that time fed his flocks about the place."       They thus called the second, as
well as the Great Pyramid, after him (iii. \ 128).

surface, and highly polished. " The chest or coffer in the Great
Pyramid" (writes Mr Taylor in 1859,) " is                     so shaped      as to be       in
every part rectangular from side to side, and from end to end, and
the bottom is also cut at right angles to the sides and end, and made
perfectly       level."     " The coffer," said Professor Smyth in 1864,
" exhibits      to us a standard          measure of 4000 years ago, with the
tenacity and hardness of its substance unimpaired, and the polish
and evenness of its surface              untouched       by nature      through all that
length of time."
     But later inquiries          and    observations      upset     entirely all these
notions and strong averments in regard to the coffer. For—
   (1.) Tlie Coffer, though an alleged actual standard of capacity-mea
sure, has yet been found difficult or impossible to measure. — In his first
work,
       " Our Inheritance in the Great
                                      Pyramid," Professor Smyth
had cited the measurements of                  it,
                                   made and published by twenty-
five different observers, several of whom had gone about the matter
with great mathematical            accuracy.         Though imagined to       be     a   great
standard of measure, yet all these twenty-five,                    as   Professor Smyth
owned, varied from each other in their accounts                      of this imaginary
standard in "every element of length, breadth, and depth, both
inside and outside."   Professor Smyth has latterly measured                                it
himself, and this twenty-sixth measurement varies again from all
the preceding twenty-five.                Surely     a   measure of capacity should
be measurable     that ought to be its most unquestionable quality
                    ;                                                                        ;
but this imagined standard has proved virtually unmeasurable — in
so far at least that its twenty-six different and skilled measurers
all differ from each other in respect to its dimensions.   Still, says
Professor Smyth,    " this affair of the coffer's precise size      the              is
question of questions."
                                                                   —
  (2.) Discordance between its actual and its theoretical measure.
Professor Smyth holds that theoretically its capacity ought to be
71,250
        " pyramidal " cubic inches, for that cubic size would make
it   the exact measure for        a    chaldron,     or practically the vessel would
then contain exactly four quarters                   of wheat, &c.   Yet Professor
Smyth himself             found   it    some    60    cubic inches less than this;
while also the measurements of Professor Greaves, one of the most
accurate measurers of all, make    250 cubic inches, and those of

 hand, the measurements            of Colonel Howard Vyse make it more
 than 100, those of Dr Wilson more than 500, and those of the French
 academicians who accompanied the Napoleonic expedition to Egypt,
 about 6000 cubic inches above the theoretical size which Professor
 Smyth has latterly fixed on.
    (3.) Its theoretical measure varied.
                                                 — The actual measure of the
 coffer has varied in the hands of all its twenty-six measurers.               But
 even its theoretical measure is varied            also, for the size which the
 old coffer really ought to have         as
                                              " a grand capacity standard," is
 strangely enough not a           determined quantity.          In his last work
 (1867), Professor Smyth declares,              as  just stated ,its proper theo
 retical cubic capacity to be 71,250 pyramidal cubic inches.                But in
 his first work (1864), he declared something different, for " we
elect," says he,     " to take 70,970-2 English cubic inches
                                                                        (or 70,900
 pyramidal cubic inches) as the true, because the theoretically
proved contents of the porphyry coffer, and therefore accept these
 numbers      as  giving the cubic size of the grand standard measure
of capacity in the Great Pyramid."                 But again,   Mr John Taylor,
who, previously to Professor Smyth, was the great advocate                   of the
coffer being       a marvellous standard           of capacity measure for all
nations, ancient and modern, declares its measure to be neither
the above quantities, but 71,328 cubic inches, or a cube                    of the
ancient cubit of Karnak.*           A  vessel cannot be a measure of capacity
whose own standard theoretical size is thus declared to vary some
what every few years by those very men who maintain that it is
a standard.        But whether its capacity is 71,250, or 70,970, or
71,328,    it is quite equally held up by Messrs Taylor and Smyth
that the Sacred Laver of the Iraelites, and the Molten Sea of the
Scriptures,
                " also conform     and correspond to its (yet undetermined)
standard     with all conceivable practical exactness;" though the
standard     of capacity to which they thus " conform and correspond "
is itself  a size or standard       which has not been yet fixed with any
exactness.       Professor Smyth, in speaking of the calculations and
   * " Its  contents,"  says Mr Taylor    (p. 299),
                                                     " are equal in cubic inches to
the cube of 41,472 inches— the cubit of Karnak— viz., to 71,328 cubic inches."
Elsewhere (p. 304) he states—" The Pyramid coffer contains 256 gallons of
whoat ;" — " It also contains 256 gallons of water, 4c."

  theoretical dimensions      of this coffer — as published by Mr Jopling,
  a  believer in its wonderful standard character — critically observes,
  " Some very astonishing results were brought out in the
                                                                        play of
  arithmetical numerations."
                                              —
     (4.) The dilapidation of the Coffer. Thirty years ago this stone
  coffer was pointed out and indeed delineated by Mr Perring
  as   " not particularly well polished,"        and  " chipped and broken
  at the edges."       Professor Smyth, in his late travels to Egypt,
  states that he found every possible line and edge of it chipped
  away with large chips along the top, both inside and outsidei
  " chip   upon   chip, wofully      spoiling   the original   figure ;  along
 all the corners of the upright sides            too, and even along every
 corner of the bottom, while the upper south-eastern            corner of the
 whole vessel is positively broken away to a depth and breadth of
 nearly a third of the whole." Yet this stone vessel is professed to
 be the permanent       miraculous standard of capacity measure for the
 world, and that it might serve this purpose it would be, according
 to Mr Taylor, " formed of one block of the hardest kind of material,
 such as porphyry or granite, in order that it might not fall into de
        " for " in this
 cay ;                   porphyry coffer we have (writes Professor Smyth
 in 1864) the very closing end and aim of the whole pyramid."
     (5.) Alleged mathematical form of        the Coffer erroneous.—    But in
 regard to the coffer       as  an exquisite and marvellous standard         of
 capacity to be revealed in these latter times, worse facts than these
are divulged by the tables, &c.,        of measurements      which Professor
Smyth has recently published of this stone vessel or chest.                His
published     measurements      show that it is not at all a vessel, as was
averred a few years ago, of pure mathematical form ; for externally
it is in length an inch greater on one side than another ; in breadth,
half-an-inch broader at one point than at some other point; its
bottom at some points is nearly a whole inch thicker than it is at
some other parts      ;  and in thickness its sides vary in some points
about a quarter of an inch near the top. " But," Professor Smyth
adds, " if calipered lower down, it is extremely probable that a
notably different thickness would have been found there," though it
does not appear why they were not thus calipered.                Further, ex
ternally " all     the  sides" (says    Professor Smyth) " were slightly
hollow, excepting the east side        ;
                                         "
                                            and the   " two external ends "

  252                Proceedings of the Royal Society
 also show some         "concavity" inform. " The workmanship" (he
 elsewhere describes)           " of the inside is in advance of the outside, but
 yet not perfect."             For internally there is        a convergence       at the
 bottom     towards     the centre;        both in length and in breadth             the
 interior differs about half-an-inch at one point from another point;
 the "extreme points (also) of the corners of the bottom not being
 perfectly worked out to the intersection              of the general planes of the
 entire   sides;" and thus its cavity seems really of                    a form  utterly
 immeasurable       in a correct       way by mere lineal measurement             — the
 only measure yet attempted.                If it were   an  object of the slightest
 moment, perhaps liquid measurements                  would be more successful.
     (6.)  Coffer cut with ledges and catch-holes              for    a lid, like other
 sarcophagi. — More damaging details still remain in relation to the
 coffer as " a grand           standard     measure of capacity," and proving
 that its object or function was very different.                     In his first work
 Prof. Smyth describes the coffer as showing no                 "               " what
                                                                    symptoms
 ever of grooves or catchpins or other fastenings for a lid. " More
 modern accounts,"          he re-observes, "have been further precise in de
 scribing the smooth and geometrical finish of the upper part of the
 coffer's sides, without any of those grooves, dovetails,                or steady-pin-
 holes which have been found elsewhere in true polished sarcophagi,
 where the firm        fastening of the lid is one of the most essential
 features of the whole            business."     Mr Perring, however, delineated
 the catchpin-holesfor a           lid in the coffer thirty years ago.*          On his
 late visit to it Prof. Smyth found its western side lowered down in
 its whole    extent to nearly an inch and three-quarters (or more ex
 actly, T72 inch), and ledges cut out around the interior of the other
 sides at the same height.             Should we measure on this western side
 from this actual        ledge brim, or from         the imaginary higher brim          ?
If reckoned as the true brim, " this ledge" (according to Professor
Smyth) would " take away near 4000 inches from the cubic capa
city of the vessel."            Besides, he found       three   holes cut on the top
of the coffer's lowered            western    side, as in all the other Egyptian

    7. Sepulchral contents          of  coffer  when first     discovered.— When,
about a thousand           years    ago, the    Caliph    Al Mamoon tunnelled
into the interior of the pyramid, he detected by the accidental
falling, it is said, of a granite portcullis, the passage to the King's
Chamber,       shut up from the building of the pyramid to that time.
" Then "                                                     " the treasures of the
              (to quote the words of Prof. Smyth)
pyramid, sealed up almost from the days of Noah, and undese-
crated by mortal eye for 3000 years, lay                full in their grasp before
them."         The     Arabian     historian    Ibn Abd Alhokim states that
on this occasion they found in the pyramid, " towards the top, a
chamber [now the so-called King's Chamber] with an hollow stone
[or coffer] in which there was a statue like a man, and within it a
man upon whom was a breastplate                  of gold set with jewels        ;  upon
this breastplate was a sword of inestimable price, and at his head a
carbuncle of the bigness of an egg, shining like the               light of the day     ;
and    upon him were characters writ with            a pen,  which no man under
                                                                            " statue,"
stood   "f — a     description stating, down         to the so-called
mummy-case,          or cartonage, and the hieroglyphics upon the cere
cloth, the arrangements now well known to belong to the higher
class   of Egyptian mummies.
   * " The   western side,"   observes Professor Smyth,     "of  the coffer is, through
almost its entire length, rather lower than the other three, and these have
groove* inside, or the remains of grooves once cut into them, about an inch or
two below their summits and on a level with the western edge ; in fact, to
admit a sliding sarcophagus cover or lid; and there were the remains of three
fixing pin-holes on the western side for fastening such cover into its place."

         Standard of Linear Measure in the Great Pyramid.
  The standard in the Great Pyramid, according to Messrs Taylor
and Smyth, for linear measurements,                      is    the length of the base line
or lines of the pyramid.                 This, Professor Smyth states,                 is   " the
function proper of the pyramid's base."                          It   is   professed also that
in this base line there has been found                     a    new mythical inch — one-
thousandth of an inch longer than the British standard inch                             ;    and
Professor Smyth has attempted                     to show that the status               of the
kingdoms of Europe in the general and moral world may                            be measured
in accordance with their present deviation or conformity to this
mythical pyramidal standard in their modes of national measure
ment. " For the linear measure (says Prof. Smyth), " of the base
                               "
line of this colossal monument, viewed in the light of the philoso
phical connection between time and space, has yielded standard                     a
measure of length which      more admirably and learnedly earth-
                                        is
commensurable         than anything which has ever yet entered into the
mind of man to conceive, even up to the last discovery in modern
metrological science, whether in England, France, or Germany."
  The engineers            and mathematicians of different countries have
repeatedly measured              a   meridian arc of       a    degree of sixty miles in
order    to use      it    as   a   standard    for linear divisions.             As part of
their standard, they measure off sixty miles of the irregular earth-
surface of   a   kingdom with almost perfect mathematical exactitude.
Professor Smyth holds that the basis side of the pyramid has been
laid down by Divine authority                  as such   a    guiding standard measure.
  What,      then,    is    the exact    length    of    one    of   its oasis linesf       The
sides of the pyramid have been measured by many different
measurers.  Linear standards have, says Professor Smyth, " been
already looked        for by many and many an author on the sides of

                      of Edinburgh,      Session 1867-68.                           255
 the base of the Great Pyramid, even before they knew that the
 terminal points of^those magnificent base lines had been carefully
 marked in the solid rock of the hill by the socket-holes of the
 builders." But— as in the case of the cubic capacity of the coffer
 these measurers sadly disagree with each other in their measure
 ments, which, in fact, but vary from some 7500 or 8000 inches to
 9000 and upwards.     Thus, for example, Strabo makes it under 600
 Grecian     feet, or under 7500       English inches       ;   Dr Shawe makes it
 8040 inches    ;   Shelton makes it 8184 inches       ;   Greaves, 8316      ;   Davi
 son, 8952; Caviglia, 9072;           the French academicians,           9163;          Dr
 Perry, 9360, &c., &c.
   At    the time at which Professor Smyth was                  living at the pyra
 mid,    Mr Inglis, of Glasgow, visited       it,   and, for correct      measure
ment, laid bare for the first time the four corner sockets.    Mr
Inglis' measurements not only differed from all the other measure
ments of " one-side " base lines made before him, but he makes
the four sides differ from each other; one of them — namely, the
 north side— being longer than the otherthree.  Strangely, Pro
fessor Smyth, though in Egypt for the purpose of measuring
the different parts of the pyramid — and holding that its base
line ought to be our grand standard of measure, — and further
holding that the base line could only be accurately ascertained by
measuring from         socket   to   socket — never    attempted       that linear
measurement         himself after the sockets were cleared.             These four
corner sockets were never exposed before in historic times                ;       and   it
may be very long before an opportunity of seeing and using them
again shall ever be afforded to any other measurers.
  Before the corner sockets were exposed, Professor Smyth at
tempted     to measure the bases, and made each side                of the present
                 " between 8900 and 9000 inches in
masonry courses                                       length," or
                       "       "
(to use his own word)    about   8950 inches for the mean length
of one of the four sides of the base           ;    exclusive of the ancient
casing    and   backing stones — which last Colonel Howard Vyse
found and measured to be precisely 108 inches                    on each side, or
216 on both sides.        These 216 inches, added to Professor Smyth's
           of " about
                      "
measure                                                       But
                          8950 inches, makes one side 9166 inches.
                    "         "
Professor Smyth has   elected   (to use his own expression) not to
take the mathematically exact measure of the casing stones as

256                 Proceedings of the Royal Society
given by Colonel Vyse and Mr Perring, who alone ever saw them
and measured them (for they were destroyed shortly after their dis
covery in 1837), but to take them, without              any adequate    reason
and contrary to their mathematical           measurement,    as equal  only  to
202 inches, and hence
                             " accept 9152 inches     as the  original length
of one side of the base of the finished pyramid."            He deems, how
             "                    "
ever, this      determination       not to be so much depended upon as
the measurements       made from socket to socket.
   The mean of the only four series of such socket or casing stone
measures as have       been recorded      hitherto by Jomard (9163), Vyse
(9168), Mahmoud Bey (9162), and            Inglis (9110), amounts to nearly
9150.    The first three of these observers were only able to measure
the north side of the pyramid.           Mr Inglis measured all the four
sides, and made them respectively 9120,             9114, 9102, and      9102,
making    a difference    of 18 inches between the shortest       and longest.
Professor Smyth thinks the measures of Mr Inglis             as on the whole
probably too small, and he takes two of them,          91 14 and 9102 — (but,
strangely,   not the largest, 9120)— as data, and strikes a new num
ber out of these two and out of the three previous measures of
Jomard,     Vyse, and Mahmoud            Bey,   from   these  five  quantities
          a calculation of
                               "            and electing 9142 as the proper
making                           means,"
measure of the basis line         of the pyramid —(which exact measure
certainly none of its many measurers ever yet found it to be) ; and
                                       "
upon this foundation, "derived           (to use his own words) "from the
best modern measures yet made," he proceeds to reason on, "as
the happy, useful,       and  perfect   representation    of 9142," and the
great standard      for linear measure revealed to man in the Great
Pyramid.       Surely it is   a  very strange standard of linear measure
that can only be thus elicited and developed — not by direct mea
surement, but by indirect logic, and regarding the exact              and pre
cise length of which there is as yet no kind         of reliable and accurate
certainty.
   Lately, Sir Henry James has shown that the length of one of
the sides of the pyramid base, with the casing stones added, as
measured by Colonel        H. Vyse — viz., 9168 inches — is precisely      360
derahs, or land cubits of Egypt        ;  the derah being an ancient land
measure    still in use,  of the length of nearly 25£ British inches, or,
more correctly, of 25-488 inches ; and he has pointed out that in

                       of Edinburgh,      Session 1867-68.                     257
  the construction of the body         of the Great Pyramid, the architect
  built 10 feet or    10 cubits    of horizontal length for every         9 feet or
  9 cubits of vertical height      ; while in the construction of the various
  galleries the proportion was adhered to of horizontal length to
  vertical height     as 9 to 4, — rules   which would greatly simplify the
  building of such      a structure.    The Egyptian derah of 25-48 inches
  is practically one-fourth more in length than the old Egyptian
 cubit of Memphis of 20-7 inches.              Long ago Sir Isaac Newton
  showed     from Professor Greaves'        measurements     of the chambers,
 galleries, &c., that the Memphis cubit of 20-7 British inches was
  apparently the working cubit of the masons in constructing the
 pyramid — an opinion so far admitted more lately by both Messrs
  Taylor and Smyth; "the length" (says Professor Smyth) "of the
 cubit employed by the masons engaged in the Great Pyramid build
  ing, or that of the ancient city of Memphis," being 20-73 British
 inches.*      According to Mr Inglis' late measurement               of the four
 bases    of the pyramid, after its four corner sockets were exposed, the
 length of each base line was possibly 440 Memphis cubits, or 9108
 English inches     ;  or, if the greater    length of Jomard        and Vyse be
 held nearer the truth, 442 Memphis cubits, or 9150 British inches.
     But Professor Smyth tries to show that (1.) if 9142 be granted
 him as the possible base line of the pyramid ; and (2.) if 25 inches
 be allowed to be the length of the          "  Sacred Cubit,"     as revealed to
 the Israelites (and as revealed in the pyramid), then the base line
 might be found very near a multiple of this cubit by the days of
 the year,f or by 365-25; for these two numbers multiplied together
    * Yet this, the Memphian cubit, "need not"
                                                     (somewhat mysteriously adds
 Professor Smyth), " and actually is not, by any means the same as the cubit
 typified in the more concealed and symbolised metrological system of the Great
 Pyramid."
    t Godfrey Higgins, in his work on " The Celtic Druids," shows how, among
 the ancients, superstitions connected with numbers, as the days of the year or
 the figures 865, have played a prominent part.    " Amongst the ancients" (says
      " there was no end of the superstitious and trifling play upon the nature
he)
and value of numbers.       The first men of antiquity indulged themselves in
these fooleries" (p. 244).      Mr Higgins points out that the old Welsh or
British word for Stonehenge, namely Emrys, signifies, according to Davies,
865 ; as do the words    Mithra, Neilos, &c. ; that certain collections of the old
Druidic stones at Abary may be made to count 365 ; that " the famous
                      ...
Abraxas only meant the solar period of 365 days, or the sun," 4c. " It was all
judicial astrology.

                                                                       2 b

258                Proceedings of the Royal Society
amount     to   9131 pyramidal inches,       or 9140 British       inches— the
British inch being held, as already stated, to be 1000th less than
the pyramidal inch.        Was, however, the "Sacred Cubit" —upon
whose alleged      length of 25 " pyramidal"        inches    this idea is    en
tirely built — really a measure of this length       ?   In this   matter — the
most important and vital of all for his whole linear hypothesis —
Professor Smyth seems to have fallen into an error which upsets
all the calculations and inferences founded by him upon it.
    Sir Isaac Newton, in his remarkable " Dissertation upon the
Sacred Cubit of the      Jews," long ago came to the conclusion that
it measured 2482 British inches.             In this way it was one-fifth
longer than the cubit of Memphis, viz., 20-7 inches,             as previously
deduced      by   him from    Greaves'     measurements        of the    King's
Chamber      and other parts    of the interior of the Great Pyramid.
Before    drawing his final inference       as to the    Sacred Cubit being
24-82 inches, and as so many steps conducting to that inference,
Sir Isaac shows that the Sacred Cubit was some measurement inter
mediate between a long and moderate human step or pace, between
the third of the length of the body of a tall and short man, &c.,
&c.    Professor Smyth has collected eight of the measurements thus
                                                        " to
adduced by Newton as " methods of approach                   circumscribe the
length of the Sacred Cubit        ; and adding to these data Sir Isaac's
deduction     of the actual length of the Sacred Cubit              as a  ninth
quantity, he enters the whole nine in         a table as   follows : —
   Professor Smyth's Table    of Newton's Inquiry regarding         the Sacred
                                    Cubit.
              First,   between        23-28 and 27-94 British inches-
              Second,     „           23-3       27-9            „
              Third,      „           24-80      25-02           „
              Fourth,     „          24-91       25-68
        And Fifth,   somewhere near 24-82.
 " The mean of all which numbers "
                                               (Professor Smyth remarks)
 " amounts to 25-07 British inches. The Sacred Cubit, then, of
 the Hebrews"                  " in the time of Moses —
                   (he adds)                                   according   to  Sir
 Isaac Newton — was equal to 25-07 British            inches, with a probable
 error of ±-1."
    But — ' according to Sir Isaac Newton" — the Sacred Cubit of               the

                   of Edinburgh, Session 1867-68.                          259
Jews was not 25-07, as Professor Smyth makes him state, but 24-82
British inches (or 25 unciae of the Roman foot, and -fc of an uncia),
as Sir Isaac himself more than once deliberately infers in his
Dissertation.      Besides,  in such      inquiries   is   it not illogical to
attempt to draw mathematical deductions             by these calculations of
" means," and especially by using the ninth
                                                         quantity in the table
— viz., Sir  Isaac's   own deliberate      deduction     regarding the actual
length of the Sacred Cubit — as one of the nine quantities from which
that length was to be deduced by the equivocal process of means ?
Errors, however, of a still more serious kind exist. The " mean "
of the nine quantities in Professor Smyth's table is, he infers, 25 07
inches  ;  and hence he avows that this, or near this figure, is the
length of the Sacred        Cubit.    But the real mean of these nine
quantities is not 25-07, but 25-29 — a number in such                a  testing
question as this of a very different value.         For the days of the year
                                          —
(365 25) when multiplied by this the true mean of these nine
quantities— would make the         base  line of the pyramid 9237 inches,
instead of Professor Smyth's theoretical number of 9142 inches               —
a difference   altogether   overturning all his inferences and calcula
tions thereanent.
   The incidentally erroneous        summation which Professor Smyth
makes of the nine quantities in his table, as amounting to 2507, he
declares (to use his own strong words) as a
                                                    "
                                                      really glorious consum
mation for the geodesical science of the present day to have brought
to light;" for    he avers this length of 25"J7 — which he forthwith
elects to alter to     25-025  British inches — being "practically the
sacred Hebrew cubit, is exactly one ten-millionth            (l-10,000,000th)
of the earth's semi-axis of rotation; and that is the very best mode of
reference to the earth-ball as a whole, for a linear standard through
all time, that the highest science of the existing age of the world
has yet   struck out, or can imagine.         In  a word, the Sacred     Cubit,
thus realised, forms an instance      of the most advanced and perfected
human     science   supporting the truest, purest, and most ancient
religion  ; while a linear standard which the chosen people in the
earlier ages of the world were merely told by maxim to look on                as
sacred, compared      with other     cubits of other lengths, is proved by
the progress of human learning in the latter ages of time, to have
had,   and   still to have,  a philosophical merit about it which no

260                 Proceedings of the Royal Society
men or nations at the time           it was first produced, or within several
thousand     years thereof, could have           possibly thought of for them
selves."    Besides,     adds he elsewhere,        " an extraordinary (sic) con
venient length, too, for man to handle and use in the common affairs
of life is the one ten-millionth of the earth's semi-axis of rotation
when    it comes to be realised, for         it  is extremely close to the ordi
nary human arm, or to the ordinary human pace in walking with                       a
purpose to measure."
    Of course, all these inferences            and    reasonings,   regarding the
Sacred    Cubit being an exact segment of the polar axis, disappear
when     we find Sir Isaac Newton's length of the sacred cubit is
not, as Professor Smyth elects           it to  be, 25-025    British inches ; nor
25-07 as he calculated           it to be from the mean of the nine quan
tities in his table    ;  nor 25-29,    as is the     actual mean of these nine
quantities   ; but,
                      " according to Sir Isaac Newton's" own reiterated
statement and conclusion,           24-82.      A   Sacred    Cubit, according to
Sir Isaac Newton's admeasurements of it of 2482 inches, would
not, by hundreds of cubits, be one ten-millionth of the measure of
the semi-polar axis of the earth          ; provided the polar axis be, as     Pro
fessor Smyth elects        it to  be, 500,500,000       British inches.
             Axis or the Earth          as a  Standard of Measure.
    The standards of measure in most modern civilised countries are,
as   is well known, referred          to divisions     of arcs of the meridian,
measured off upon different points of the surface of the earth.
These measures of arcs of the meridian,                   as  measurements     of  a
known and selected portion of the surface of the spheroidal globe
of the earth, have, more or less, fixed mathematical relations with
the axis of the earth       ; as the circumference       of a sphere has an exact
mathematical ratio to its diameter.                 The difference     in length of
arcs   of the meridian at different parts of the earth's surface, in
consequence of the irregular spheroidal form of the globe of the
earth, has led to the idea that the polar diameter or axis                   of the
earth would form a more perfect and more universal standard than
measurements       of the surface of the earth.               In  the last century,
Cassini* and Calletf proposed, on these grounds, that the polar

axis of the earth should         be  taken   as the   standard      of measure.
Without      having    noticed    these    propositions     of    Cassini    and
Callet, Professor     Smyth adopts the same idea, and avers that
4000    years   ago   it had been adopted and used also by the
builders of the Great Pyramid, who laid out and measured off the
basis of the pyramid       as a multiple by the days of the year of the
Sacred Cubit, and hence of the pyramidal cubit ; while the Sacred
or Pyramidal Cubit were both the results of superhuman or divine
knowledge, and were both, or each, one ten-millionth of the semi-
polar axis of the earth.        We have already seen, however, that the
Sacred Cubit, according to Sir Isaac Newton, is not a multiple by
the days of the year of the base line of the Great Pyramid, and is
not one twenty-millionth        of the polar axis of the earth, when that
polar axis is laid down as measuring, according              to the numbers
elected by Professor Smyth, 500,500,000 British inches.
   But is there any valid    reason whatever    for fixing and determining,
as an ascertained mathematical        fact, the polar axis of the earth to be
this very precise and exact measure, with its formidable                  tail of
nothings ?     None, except the supposed requirements or necessities of
Professor Smyth's pyramid metrological theory.            The latest and most
exact measurements are acknowledged to be those of Captain Clarke,
who, on the doctrine of the earth being a spheroid of revolution, com
putes the polar axis to be 500,522,804 British inches          ; or 500,482,296
British inches, calculating it from the results of all the known arcs of
meridian measures.      If we grantthattheSacred Cubit could          be allowed
to be exactly 25-025 inches, which Sir Isaac Newton found it not to
be ; and   if we  grant that the polar axis is exactly 500,500,000           Bri
tish inches, which Captain Clarke did not find it       to be; then, certainly,
as shown by Professor       Smyth, there would be 20,000,000 of these
supposititious    pyramidal cubits, or 500,000,000 of the supposititious
pyramidal inches       in this supposititious     polar axis of the earth.
" In  so far, then" (writes Professor Smyth), "we have in the 5, with
the many 0's that follow, a pyramidally commensurable and sym
bolically appropriate unit for the earth's axis of rotation." But
such adjustments       have been made with as great apparent exacti
tude when entirely different        earth-axes   and quantities      were taken.
Thus, Mr John Taylor shows the inches, cubits, and axes to answer
precisely,    although    he  took   as  his  standard    a  totally different

262                   Proceedings     of the Royal    Society
diameter     of the earth from Professor Smyth.              The diameter of
the    earth   at    30°   of latitude — the geographical position       of  the
Great Pyramid — is some seventeen miles, or more exactly                 17"652
miles, or above 1,100,000           inches,  longer than at the poles.      But
Mr Taylor fixed upon this diameter of the earth at latitude                  30°
— and    not, like Professor Smyth, upon its polar diameter— as the
standard for the metrological         linear measures of the Great Pyramid       ;
and yet, though the standard            was so different,   he found, like Mr
Smyth, 500 millions of inches also in his axis, and 20 millions of
cubits also.*        The resulting figures appear to fit equally as well
for the one       as  for the other.      Perhaps they answer best on Mr
Taylor's     scheme.       For Mr Taylor maintained that the diameter
of the earth before the Flood, at this selected point of 30°, was less
by nearly 27 miles from what it was subsequently to the Flood,f
and is now ; — a point by which he accounts for otherwise unaccount
able circumstances          in the metrological doctrines which have been
attempted to be connected with the Great Pyramid.                For while Mr
Taylor believes the Sacred Cubit to           be 24-88, or  possibly 2490   Bri
tish inches, he holds the new Pyramidal cubit to              be 25 inches     in
full;   and the Sacred and Pyramidal            cubits  to be different, there
fore, from each other, though both inspired.            In explanation of this
startling difference in two measures supposed to          be equally of sacred   J

by 2,336,000 inches, equal to 26868 miles."
   I Alleged Sacred Character of the Scottuh Yard or Ell Measure. — Professor
 Smyth tries to show (iii. 597), that if Britain stands too low in his metro
logical testing of the European kingdoms and races, its "low entry is due to
accepting the yard for the country's popular measure of length."       But long
ago the "divine" origin of the Scottish ell — as in recent times the divine
origin of tho so-called pyramidal cubit and inch — was pleaded rather strenu
 ously.   For when, in the 13th century, Edward I. of England laid before Pope
 Boniface his reasons for attaching the kingdom of Scotland to the Crown of
 England, he maintained, among other arguments, the justice and legality of
 this appropriation on the ground that his predecessor King Athelstane, after
 subduing a rebellion in Scotland under the auspices of St John of Beverley,

                       of Edinburgh,      Session 1867-68.                      263
           Mr Taylor       observes —
                                       " The smaller
origin,                                                   (24"88) is the Sacred
Cubit which measured the diameter of the Earth before the Flood ;
the one by which Noah measured the Ark, as tradition says ; and
the one in accordance with which all the interior works of the Great
Pyramid were constructed.* The larger (25) is the Sacred Cubit
of the present Earth, according to the standard of the Great
Pyramid when it was completed."
     Surely such       marked    diversities and contradictions, and such
si .range hypothetical adjustments and re-adjustments of the data
and calculations, entirely upset the groundless and extraordinary
theory of the base of the pyramid being a standard of linear
measurement        ;  or a segment of any particular axis of the earth ;
or a standard for emitting a system of new inches and new cubits ; —
seeing, on the one hand, more particularly, that the basis line of the
pyramid is still itself an unknown and undetermined linear quantity,
as is also the polar axis of the earth of which it is declared and
averred to be an ascertained,         determined,    and measured segment.
     M. Pancton, in 1780, wrote         a  work in which he laid down the
base     side of the pyramid as 8754            inches;    maintained, like Mr
 Taylor and Mr Smyth, that this length was a standard of linear
 measures ; found it to be the measure of a portion of a degree of
 the meridian, such degree being itself the 360th part of               a  circle ;
                                                                                    —
 and apparently the calculations and figures answered                   as   well   as
 prayed that through the intervention       of that saint, it " might be granted to
 him to receive a visible and tangible token by which all future ages might
 be assured that the Scots were rightfully subject to the King of England. His
 prayer was granted in this way : Standing in front of one of the rocks at
 Dunbar, he made a cut at it with his sword, and left a score which proved to
 be the precise length of an ell, and was adopted as the regulation test of that
 measure of length." This legend of the " miraculously created ell-wand stand
 ard" was afterwards duly attested by a weekly service in the Church of St
 John of Beverley. (See Burton's " History of Scotland," ii. 319.) In the official
 account of the miracle, as cited by Rymer, it is declared that during its per
 formance the rock cut like butter or soft mud under the stroke of Athel-
 stane's sword.     " Extrahens gladium de vagina percussit in cilicem, quae adeo
  penetrabilis, Dei virtute agente, fuit gladio, quasi eadem hora lapis butirum
  esset, vel mollis glarea ; .  .  .  et usque ad presentem diem, evidens signum
  patet, quod Scoti, ab Anglis devicti ac subjugata ; monumento tali evidenter
  cunctis adeuntibus demonstrante."       (Foedera, tom. i. pars ii. 771.)

   the working cubit by which the Pyramid was built was the cubit of Memphis.

the other ways he was misled, are enough, suggests Professor Smyth,

      M. Pancton, Mr Taylor,                  and       those      who   have       adopted      and
followed their pyramid metrological ideas,                          seem   to imagine that
if,   by multiplying           one of their measures or objects, they can run
the calculation out into           a     long tail of terminal 0's, then something
very exact and marvellous                    is   proved.
                                                                   " When " (upholds Mr

which the measures of the Great Pyramid and of the Earth require
for their expression, round numbers present themselves, or such as
leave no remainder,             we may be sure we have arrived at primitive
measures."         But many small objects, when thus multiplied suffi
ciently, give equally startling strings of 0's.                        Thus,   ifthe polar axis
of the earth       be held as 500,000,000               inches, and Sir Isaac Newton's

the brim of the lecturer's hat, measuringl2-4 inches,                      is   l-20,000,000th
of the earth's polar axis          ;   a   page of the print of the Society's Trans
actions     is   l-60,000,000th of the same               ;   a    print page of Professor
Smyth's book,          6-2      inches     in length,         is   l-80,000,000th         of this

                               &c, &c.
  Professor Smyth seems further                          to   think      that the       figure    or
              "

the new noun " fiveness."        But it applies to many other matters as
strongly, or more strongly, than to the Great Pyramid. For instance,
the range of rooms belonging to the Royal Society is " five
                                                                              "  in

bearers of the Society are twenty-five in number, or five times five ;
and so on.     These arrangements were doubtless, in the first instance,
made     by the Royal Society without any special relation to
                                                                            " five

the evidences adduced in proof of the conformity of old or modern

 1851, that distinguished mechanician,          Mr Whitworth, of Manches
 ter, was the first to show the possibility of ascertaining by the sense
 of touch alone the one-millionth of an inch in            a  properly-adjusted
 standard  of linear measure    ; and  in  his great establishment at Man
chester   they work and construct machinery and tools of all kinds
with differences     in linear measurements           amounting to one ten-
 thousandth   of an inch.     The standards        of the English inch, &c.,
 made by him for the      Government — and        now used by all the engine
 and tool makers, &c.,    of the United Kingdom — lead to the construc
tion of machinery, &c., to such minute divisions            ; and the adoption
of these standards      has already     effected    enormous     saving to the
country by bringing all measured metal machinery, instruments, and
tools, wherever    constructed    and wherever        afterwards   applied  and
used, to the same identical series of mathematical and precise gauges.
               The Sabbath,   &c, Typified in      the  Pyramid.
    The communication next discussed             some others      amongst   the
many    and   diversified matters     which Professor Smyth fancifully
averred to be typified and symbolised         in the Great Pyramid.
    One, for example, of the chambers          in the Great Pyramid       — the
so-called    Queen's   Chamber — has       a  roof composed       of two large
blocks of stone leaning against each other, making a kind of slant
ing or double roof.       This double roof, and the four walls of the
chamber count     six, and typify, according to Professor Smyth, the
six days of the week, whilst the floor counts,           as it were, a seventh
side to the room,    " nobler and more glorious than the rest," and
                                                 "
typifying something, he conceives, of a nobler and more glorious
       "—
order      namely,   the Sabbath.      It  is surely difficult to fancy any
thing more strange than this strange idea.             In forming this   theory
liberties are also confessedly taken with the floor in order to make
it duly larger than the other six sides of the room, and to do so he
theoretically lifts up the floor till it is placed higher than the very
entrance    to the chamber; for originally           the floor and    sides are
otherwise too nearly alike in size to make a symbolic seven-sided
room with one of the sides proportionally and properly larger than
the other six sides.      Yet Professor Smyth holds that, in the above
                        "
typical way, he has       shown," or indeed " proved entirely," that the
Sabbath had been heard of before Moses,              and that thus he finds

  extraordinary    importance,
through many departments of religious life and progress."
   He believes, also, that the corner-stone — so frequently alluded to
by the Psalmist and the Apostles as a symbol of the Messiah — is
the head or corner-stone of the Great Pyramid, which, though long
ago removed, may yet possibly, he thinks, be discovered in the
Cave of Machpelah      ;  though how, why, or wherefore it should have
found its way to that distant and special locality is not in any

                             Metrological Erection.
   Professor Smyth holds the Great Pyramid to             be   in its emblems
and   intentions and work         "superhuman;"     as  "not altogether of
human origination         and in that case whereto
                                                      "                "  should
                      ;                                  (he asks)
we look for any human assistance         to men but from Divine inspira
tion?"    "Its metrology is," he conceives, "directed by a higher
        "
Power than man ; its erection " directed by the fiat of Infinite
Wisdom ; " and the whole " built under the direction of chosen
men divinely inspired from on high for this purpose."
   If  of this Divine origin, the work should       be   absolutely     perfect;
but, as owned by Professor Smyth, the structure is not entirely
correct in its orientation, in its squareness, &c., &c. — all of them
 matters proving that       it is human, and not superhuman.             It  was,
 Professor Smyth further alleges, intended to convey standards of
measures to all times down to, and perhaps beyond, these latter
days,
       " to herald in    some of those accompaniments        of the promised
 millennial peace and goodwill to all men." Hence, if thus miracu
lous in its foreseen uses, it ought to have remained relatively perfect
                                                                        "
till now.    But " what feature of the pyramid is there                     (asks
 Professor Smyth) " which renders at once in its measurements in
the present day its ancient proportions ?        None."       If  the pyramid
were a miracle of this kind, then the Arabian Caliph            El Mamoon so
far upset the supposititious miracle a thousand years ago — (of course
 he could not have done so provided the miracle had been truly
 Divine)
         — when   he broke into the      King's Chamber and unveiled its
contents; inasmuch       as the  builders, according to Professor Smyth,

268                   Proceedings of the Royal Society
intended      to    conceal    its secrets    for the benefit     of these latter
times, and for this purpose had left a mathematical sign of                  a cross
joint on the floor of the gallery, by which some man in the distant
future, visiting        the interior, should      detect the     entrance    to the
chambers      ;    and which secret sign Professor Smyth himself was, as
he believes,        the first to discover two years ago.         The secret, how
ever,   if any     such was placed there, for the detection of the entrance
to the interior chambers, has been thus discovered some 1000 years
too late for the evolution of the alleged            miraculous arrangement.
In relation        to the Great Pyramid, as to other things, we may be
sure that God does not teach by the medium of miracle anything
that the unaided intellect of man can find out; and we must beware
of wrongously and disparagingly attributing to Divine inspiration
and aid, things that are imperfect and human.
  The communication concluded by a long series of remarks, in
which it was pointed out that at the time at which the Great
Pyramid was built, probably about 4000 years ago, mining, archi
tecture, astronomy, &c., were so advanced in various parts of the
East     as   to    present    no obstacle    in the way of the erection            of
such    magnificent mausoleums              as the colossal    Great Pyramid       and
its other congener pyramids undoubtedly               are.
2.   Note on the Occasional Occurrence of the Musculus Rectus
                  Thoracis in Man.           By Professor Turner.
     During the last winter session,          I communicated      to the Society*
a paper on the " Musculus Sternalis," in which                  I argued    that   the
longitudinally         arranged   muscle,     occasionally found superficial        to
the sternal fibres of origin of the pectoralis         major, was not,      as anato
mists have usually described            it,   homologous      with the anterior or
thoracic fibres of the mammalian rectus, but belonged to another
group of muscles.
     Since that time    I     have met with two subjects        in the dissecting-
room, in each of which     longitudinal muscle occurred, lying in
                                  a
contact with the outer surface of the anterior extremities of the

                            of Edinburgh, Session 1867-68.                                269
upper true ribs, and beneath the fibres of the pectoral muscle, which
is,from the position, direction, and connection of its fibres, believe            I
to be regarded as homologous                with the thoracic end of the mam
malian rectus. Both subjects were males.  In one  longitudinal              a
ribbon-shaped muscle arose by  thin expanded tendon, from the
                                             a
upper border of the fifth left rib, immediately internal to the at
tachment of the serratus magnus.     The innermost part of its tendon
was continuous with the membrane covering the internal intercostal
muscle, and was attached to the rib at the junction                     of its osseous and
cartilaginous portions. From the anterior surface of the fourth rib,
close to the origin of the serratus magnus,    second and smaller
                                                                a
origin proceeded.             The muscle ascended superficial to the osseous
parts of the third and second ribs, as high as the first rib, into which
it    was inserted       immediately external to the tendon of attachment
of the subclavius muscle. The muscle was    inches long and ths6                        f
of an inch broad at its widest part. The breadth of the fifth rib
alone separated         it   from the upper attachment               of the rectus abdo
minis.        A corresponding         muscle existed on the right side.
      In   the other     subject,    a   longitudinal     muscle     — on     the right side
only —arose beneath the pectoralis minor from the upper border of
the fourth rib two inches to the outer side of the junction of its
bone and cartilage.             It   ascended superficial to the third and second
ribs, to be inserted into the bony part of the first rib,                       f  ths of an
inch external to the attachment of the subclavius.
      In   the cat, the otter, the beaver, the porcupine, and various other
 Mammalia, the rectus muscle extends                     as   high   as the     first rib, into
which      it   is   inserted, and in this respect the arrangement                    may be
compared with that             of the occasional human muscles just described.
      In   these animals,       however, the thoracic and abdominal parts of
the rectus are directly continuous with each other,                           whilst in the
human        subject    a    break, corresponding in the first specimen                to the
fifth rib, and in the second,              to the fifth rib and fourth intercostal
space, occurred         ;   but this break may be regarded              as comparable         to
one     of those transverse tendinous intersections, invariably found in
the abdominal   part of the human rectus, and which exist also in
the recti of the greater number of the Mammalia.    These speci
mens seem to present as complete                     a   representation        of the mam
 malian      arrangement,         though in      a   somewhat        different form,     as   is

afforded    by the case    recorded by    Kaau Boerhaave,     to which  I
alluded in my former       paper, and they support the opinion     I ven
tured to throw out in that communication,           that the Bupracostal
muscle described by      Mr John Wood (Proc. Roy.      Soc. London, June
15, 1865), is homologous       with the pectoral end of the mammalian
rectus.
   During the past year, Mr Wood has described another specimen of
the supra-costal      muscle (Proc. Roy. Soc. London, May 23, 1867)
which passed from the third rib upwards to the first rib and cervical
fascia  ; Dr Roberts (Liverpool Medical and Surgical Reports, Octo
ber 1867), one which extended from the fourth to the first rib; and
Bochdalek, Jun. (Virchow's Archiv. 18th November 1867), under
the name of M. supra-costalis anterior, has described and figured
one, which also passed from the fourth to the first rib; but by
none of      these anatomists    is any   reference  made to the proba
bility of its being homologous with the pectoral end of the mam
malian rectus.
    The specimens which        I   have now recorded apparently     corre
 spond to the supra-costal muscles of these writers ; and the arrange
 ment more especially of the first, in which the muscle extended as
low   as the  fifth rib, and was separated from the rectus only by the
breadth of that rib, justifies me,     I think, in the conclusion  I have
come to respecting the homology of the muscle.

buried    city lay beneath        the   streets   of modern      Zion,   as  little
revealed by the contour of the buildings on the surface as were the

1838 that any attempt was made to explore any part of
                                                                        Palestine
in  a strictly scientific manner, whether with reference to its topo

American      Dr Robinson, in company with the missionary Eli Smith,
made    his first Biblical researches, which he continued in 1852.

archaeological theories, he remains   still the prince of Palestine geo
graphers in all that relates to general topography; and in many cases
where his conclusions have subsequently        been rejected as unsound,
his researches have been the means of identifying or correcting the
positions of long lost sites.    He was followed in 1848 by his coun
tryman, Commodore Lynch, whose celebrated expedition down the
Jordan and upon the Dead Sea is familiar to every student.              In
1851-52, the Dutch officer, C. W. M. Van de Velde, made                his
survey, and provided for us the first accurate map of modern Pales
tine. His work has been the basis upon which most subsequent
explorers have proceeded.         In the following year, Mr Porter
explored the wonderful country of the Hauran, or Bashan, and
revealed to us many of its ruined cities.         In these regions east  of
Jordan Mr Cyril Graham has made yet more important discoveries,
which he has published chiefly in the Transactions of the Geogra
phical Society.
    Of those who have not personally visited the country, one writer,
Carl Ritter, has rendered invaluable service by his exhaustive work
on the Comparative       Geography of Palestine, which has recently
been rendered accessible to English students by        Mr Gage's transla
tion, published by Messrs Clark, and which is almost indispensable
 to every student   of the subject.
    The Eev. G. Williams, in his learned work " The Holy City," is
 almost   the only writer who has hitherto devoted both learning,
 archaeological knowledge, and a long residence         in the Holy City,
 to the elucidation of the topography    of ancient Jerusalem itself, all
 other writers having been deficient in one or other       of these indis
 pensable requisites    for investigating the vexed question of the
 sacred sites.
    In  1864 the Palestine Exploration        Fund was commenced,       for
 the purpose of the complete and thorough exploration of the         Holy
 Land, both as regards      its archaeology, topography, manners and
 customs, geology, and natural history.         It is perfectly impossible
 for ordinary travellers from private resources, still less for tourists,
 to accomplish   these great objects, especially as regards archaeology.
    Before proceeding to other branches      of research, I will endeavour
 shortly to explain what the Palestine Exploration Fund has already
 accomplished in the examination of Jerusalem itself.

                    of Edinburgh,       Session 1867-68.                     273
   Iu 1864-65, Captain Wilson, R.E.,               completed      the  ordnance
survey   of Jerusalem, at the cost of Miss Burdett Coutts.
   In December 1865, Captain Wilson again returned, and was occu
pied until the following May in the general survey of the country.
   Shortly after his return, Lieutenant Warren, R.E., was sent out,
and has been devoting himself            with unwearied      diligence in the
exploration of ancient Jerusalem,        as  well as to the survey    of Grilead,
Moab, and     Philistia.
   We may classify his discoveries          in Jerusalem itself under two
heads — 1st, The    traces of ancient walls and streets         ;  and 2d, The
ancient water supply and hidden streams of the city.
   The main key to the topography of ancient Jerusalem is the
course of the Tyropoeon valley, frequently mentioned               by Josephus,
and described by     him   as bisecting the city, and dividing the upper
market, or Zion, from the lower market, or Akra. Its lower end has
been identified by all explorers as coming out between Mount Zion
and Moriah.      But the whole portion of it within the walls, which
was once a deep depression        dividing the upper city from the lower
and from the Temple, is now but a slight depression, and in places
not at all to be detected        on the surface.       More than any other
existing city, Jerusalem has been whelmed under heaps of rubbish.
Its repeated sieges and destructions, and its rebuilding with fresh
material from the inexhaustible quarries on every side, have com
pletely hidden all remains of the city of Herod, still more of that
of Ezra and of Solomon.
   Walls and gates lie low beneath the accumulated debris of cen
turies.   Towers, fortifications, houses, have come down in the course
of ages, and the old ruin has always been taken as the foundation
of the new edifice. Captain Wilson and Lieutenant Warren have
sunk    more than thirty      shafts in different directions, and every
where, after penetrating through many feet of rubbish and ruin,
they have found old foundations,         cisterns, or watercourses.
   At the south-west corner of the Temple area,             a shaft has been
sunk    85 feet, and then      a   gallery run along,      which shows        the
bottom    of the valley to be actually 115 feet beneath the present
surface, at the point known as Robinson's arch.
   Josephus tells    us of  a magnificent viaduct across the Tyropoeon,
leading from the Temple area to Mount              Zion.   Dr Robinson was

274                 Proceedings of the Royal Society
the first to detect the remains of this viaduct, in three stones, evi
dently the first spring of an arch, near the south-west corner of the
Temple area.
   This seemed to place the site of the Temple at this angle of the
platform, until Captain Wilson discovered, much farther to the
north, near to the Jews' wailing-place, another arch entire, but
buried under the rubbish on which the modern houses stand.
     Continuing Captain Wilson's            researches,       and sinking       50 feet
below the present surface,         Mr Warren has traced this magnificent
viaduct by the remains of its arches right across the chasm, thus
setting this question for ever at rest.
   Robinson's arch appears to have been a single arch, probably for
the purpose of supporting a gallery alongside of the Temple wall.
   The Tyropoeon, moreover, from the excavations in its upper part,
proves to have been very different in form from anything hitherto
supposed, viz., tolerably flat for the greater part of its width, with
ample space for a lower city, as described                  by Josephus, and sud
denly descending close below the Temple wall to                      a narrow    gallery
of great depth.           Here projected Robinson's arch, the pier of which
seems to have been reached, and two courses of huge dressed stone
found in situ.        What must have been the effect to one standing
on the pinnacle of the Temple, which here rose to a height of 150
feet, from a platform of solid masonry 150 feet lower down, so that
he looked down from an elevation of 300 feet sheer into the valley
beneath     ?
                "   See   what manner of stones and what buildings were
here."
     Then, again,         by the repeated    sinking of shafts          all over the
surface of the sloping pier, which runs down from the Temple
platform to the fount of the Virgin, that lower hill once known as
Ophel, and an important suburb of the city, it is established by
actual demonstration          that the south wall of the sacred enclosure
which contained the Temple is buried for more than half its depth
beneath an accumulation of rubbish, probably the ruins of the suc
cessive buildings which once crowned                 it,   and that   if   bared to its
foundation, the wall would            present    an unbroken front of solid
masonry of nearly 1000 feet long and 150 feet in height.                        The wall
as   it   stands, with less than half that height emerging from the
ground,     has always        been regarded     as   a     marvel.    What must       it

                      of Edinburgh,       Session 1867-68.                     275
have been when         entirely exposed to view        !  No wonder that pro
phets and psalmists           should have rejoiced in the " walls " and
" bulwarks " of the Temple, and that Tacitus should have described
it              arcis constructum.        " Walk about Zion, and
   as modo                                                               go round
about her    ; tell the towers thereof.        Mark ye well her bulwarks, con
sider her palaces, that ye may tell           it to the generations following."
   Now,    as the lower      part of this wall is manifestly        a substratum,
in order to increase the platform space for the Temple area, which
must always have been at its present elevation,               that of the Sakhra,
or central rock, the          question   naturally arises whether there         are
not subterranean        chambers     beneath     those already known and de
scribed    underneath       the   Aksa.     Now, beneath       the Huldah     gate,
in the    south wall of the Haram, is an ancient double                passage or
tunnel.      At   the north end        of this is   a vaulted    chamber 17 feet
square, recently discovered, but further than               this no explorations
have yet been made.
   To proceed to the south.            The wall of Ophel has been discovered
abutting on that of the Temple area at the south-east, and has been
traced 300 feet from the Haram area to the south.                A tower has been
discovered,     a face   of 29 feet   6 inches projecting about 8 feet beyond
the   wall, built by Jotham,           king of Judah (2 Chron. xxvii. 3).
The bases on which the piers of the arches of the substructure rest
on this point are 80 feet above the rock, and                it is likely there is
another system of older arches underneath those visible at present.
The courses of this south wall are from              3 feet 3 inches to 4 feet   in
height   ;  and 20 feet below the surface of the Haram walls, or 60 feet
below the area of the Haram, has been found                    a passage from 12
to 16 feet high, and in        it the check where       a metal gate was swung,
and the marks of its abrasion on the stones.
   In  the double passage is what is called the             " Well of the Leaf,"
at the bottom of which was found a curious arch of tiles, perhaps
an outlet to some subterranean            flow of water.
   Lieutenant Warren is inclined to doubt that the masonry west of
Robinson's arch was a pier, as the ancient masonry is not in keeping
with the Haram wall.             It is 15 feet above the rock, and the re
mains of      a house rest on the top         of the wall.      The pier itself is
12 feet 2 inches       thick, and the distance to the Haram wall           41 feet
6 inches.
                                                                                    •-"

   Higher up, under Wilson's arch, the depth of the shaft till the
rock is reached is 53 feet. At 50 feet 9 inches the base course of
the Haram wall is let into the rock, and the span of the arches is
within   6  inches the same as that of Robinson's arch.
   In  the centre of the city the accumulation of debris is scarcely
less.   In Muristan      the shaft was sunk 70 feet before the rock was
reached   ;   and some years       since the foundation        for the English
Church on Mount Zion was sunk for to                a depth   of 40 feet, when
the arch of an old aqueduct was struck.
   When, however, we get to the north at the Damascus gate, we
find the foundation of the old wall outside it 10J feet thick, only
3 feet   beneath    the present roadway, which,          it must be noted, is
sunk many feet beneath           the surrounding       heaps.    At  the foot of
this wall, which is very unlike the Temple walls in masonry,                   a
Templar's cross was found, and it is probably the Crusaders' wall,
destroyed when they were compelled to leave the city.
   We next come to the water supply.
   The most distant     as well as the most    important source of the supply
are Solomon's pools at Etham, near Bethlehem, now called               El Burak.
These three artificial tanks are well known, being respectively             380,
423, and 582 feet in length, 236 feet wide,            and from 28 to 50 feet
deep.    They   are supplied   from a subterranean fountain, " the sealed
fountain," three-quarters of      a  mile to the north-west; from which        a
subterranean     passage, leading to the pools of Solomon, has been ex
plored by Lieutenant Warren.           In the course   of his researches he has
met with traces which lead to the belief that there is another sealed
fountain yet to    be discovered      to the south-east,     which contributes
to the supply of the pools, at the head of which is a spring or out
flow, carefully concealed in the rock, from which the water rushes
to the upper      pool.    There are two lines of aqueduct at different
levels, the higher one now in ruins, from these cisterns to Beth
lehem and Jerusalem.          The lower level aqueduct, in which water
still flows, follows the windings of the hill sides by Bethlehem
to the valley of Hinnom, which it crosses upon nine low arches
above the lower pool of Gihon.             From hence it sweeps round the
 southern brow of Zion, and enters the city on the side above the
 Tyropooon, where     it can  be traced    for  a short distance,  partly hewn
 in the rock, and partly supported          on   masonry against     the side of

the cliff.     It   enters the Haram at the gates of the Chain.                Just
outside of this gate is a large subterranean                    cistern,   84 by 42
feet, and 24 feet deep, doubtless supplied in olden times by this
aqueduct.  Again, near the Fountain gate, is a tank of enormous
dimensions, which is within          a few     feet of the       aqueduct,    which
could easily fill it. {Burg al Kibreyt.)
   But this was not the only supply of water on which Jerusalem
had to depend.         In all   the history of its sieges, there is not any
allusion to the inhabitants suffering from thirst.                All   confirms the
truth of Strabo's words — evros      p.b>   tvvBpov, iicrbs 8t TravrtXGs Sufn)pov.
  There is first the upper pool of Gihon, spoken of by Isaiah, who
went forth to meet Ahaz at the end of the conduit of the upper
pool in the highway of the fuller's field.     We also read that
Hezekiah stopped the upper outflow of the waters of Gihon, and
brought it down to the west side of the city of David. Here, too,
Rabshakeh stood when he delivered               the insolent message of his
master the      king of Assyria.
   The lower pool of Gihon is also mentioned by Isaiah (xxii. 9) :
 " Ye gathered together the waters of the lower pool."
   There is next the vast system of tanks by the fosse of Antonia,
 north   of the temple area, the pool of Bethesda, connected with the
 enormous system of tanks under the Haram area, so far as we can
 conjecture.        Then there is the pool of Hezekiah, close to Muristan,
 which probably supplied Akra, or the lower city.                    This was pro
 bably fed by the outflow from the aqueduct from the pool of Gihon
 after supplying the city of David.             It   is mentioned        in 2 Chron.
 xxxii. 30, that Hezekiah stopped the upper outflow of the waters
 of Gihon, and brought it straight down to the west side of the
 city of David. And in expectation of the siege by Sennacherib,
 " he took counsel with his
                            princes and his mighty men to stop the
 waters of the fountain which were without the city.      So there      ...
 was gathered        much   people together who stopped all the fountains
 and the brook that ran through the midst of the land, saying,                 Why
 should the king of Assyria come and find much water ?"
   We have not yet discovered these hidden sources, but Lieutenant
 Warren has explored at Lifta (Nephtoah               ?),   two miles north-west of
 Jerusalem,    perpendicular chasm 155 feet deep, through which
                a
 water constantly drains and runs out of sight at once, which cleft

278                 Proceedings of the Royal Society
he thinks partially artificial, and connected with a similar cleft he
examined      near the Russian buildings north of the pool of Gihon
and close to it.
    Underneath the temple area is a vast system of caverns, one of
which, " the sea," deserves the name of a beautiful subterranean
lake, while the whole hill is pierced by wells, and honeycombed by
rock-hewn cisterns.
    To the west of the temple is the Bath of Healing (Hummam esh
Shefa), where there is a series of vaulted cisterns, with passages
and deep wells, from which the water rises.
    Below Ophel is the Fountain of the Virgin, celebrated             for its
irregular and uncertain flow, and which appears to be fed from
some outflow underneath Mount Moriah.               Hence is a subterranean
channel     leading to the pool of Siloam, which has been explored,
and another strange tunnel discovered by Lieutenant Warren, con
necting it with a vast tank.
    Siloah, mentioned       in Scripture    as  by the king's gardens,    has
 again a subterranean connection with          En Rogel or Bir Eyub, Joab's
Fountain, discovered by Lieutenant Warren, while this too appears
 to have had a yet further extension by a second hidden channel to
 the south.      500 yards below      Bir Eyub, Lieutenant Warren opened
 a  spring, and at   a depth   of 12 feet a stone suddenly rolled away,  and
 revealed a staircase, about 25 feet deep, and at the bottom, passages
 leading north and south.          Steps and passages are cut in the rock;
 the latter are about    6  feet high, and may have been for the purpose
 of leading off the Jerusalem waters out of the reach of an enemy
 invading the city. The passage north has been explored for 107
 feet, and is   full of silt without stones.
     Then again, under the Well of the Leaf, beneath the Haram,
 are   ducts   discovered,    plainly   leading to some yet undiscovered
 cisterns.
     Again, at the upper end of the Tyropoeon valley, Lieutenant
 Warren has discovered, at the bottom of a shaft of 50 feet, a drain
 with   a stream   of sweet water running through it with         a constant
 flow, not from the baths,        nor yet from the aqueduct of Solomon's
 Pools, but which must be from           a spring at the head of the valley
 within the city.
     At the south-east of the        coenaculum   he has discovered,  50 feet

                        of Edinburgh,              Session 1867-68.                         279
above     the level      of the present             aqueduct,       what is no doubt the
remains               original aqueduct from the pools of Etam.
             of Solomon's
This he has penetrated 250 feet in one direction, and 200 in the
other.      Often the explorer had to wriggle through lying on his
back, at others to crawl on hands and knees.                         In   parts it is built of
masonry, in parts cut out of solid rock,                         and generally of a semi-
cylindrical shape  but in many parts it has the peculiar shoulders
                         ;
only before noticed under the triple gateway, and recently dis
covered also in the channel leading to Tekoah from Etam, almost
certainly Solomonic in date.                       In part of       the passage he could
stand upright,       it being      10   or    12 feet        high, with the remains of two
sets of stones for covering,            as shown         in Mr Piazzi Smyth's work on
the Great Pyramid            ;   the stones at the sides being of great size, 12
feet by 6.   This channel cannot be so late as the Roman period ;
it is evidently of the most ancient construction. It is built in little
spaces, as    if the
              work had been commenced at two or three points,
and had not been directed properly. The plaster is still in good
preservation. This channel must have been of great consequence,
both from the distance it is driven under ground, and from the
well-cut shafts which lead to it.                       The main supply of Jerusalem
was probably obtained              by   it,   as   it   is   perfectly concealed from any
besieger.
     In   the Muristan       a   system of tanks has been discovered 53 feet
below the surface.     Four have already been examined, from 50 to
68   feet long and 17 feet wide, with flight of twenty-five steps down
                                                    a
the side, with water in some, hard mud in others, and the plaster as
fresh and impervious to water as                   if   just constructed.
     Most interesting            have been         the explorations        of the      Virgin's
Fountain       under Ophel.             Lieutenant             Warren     discovered    in the
channel from this fountain              a     passage branching from that to Siloam
of the most extraordinary character.                          For 50 feet the tunnel runs.
Then for      17 feet more         is   the new passage, opening upon                  a   shaft
6   feet by   4,   and 42 feet high, to the landing in                    a   wide cave some
30    feet high      in its slope.         After creeping along for 40 feet,                  a
passage      was discovered         8   feet wide, and from  to  feet high, cut
                                                                      3       4
in form of      a   depressed arch out of rocks.                   After following this for
40 feet more,       a   wall of rough masonry was found across it.                         From
this wall the passage rises at an angle of 45°,                           still cut   as before
     vol. vi.                                                                     2

280              Proceedings of the Royal Society
out of rock, with toe holes cut in it.       Fifty feet up there is another
wall of rough masonry,         opening into     a vaulted     chamber,   with a
descent   of 20 feet from the opening, and at the bottom              a smaller
one 8 feet deeper, with a passage blocked            up, which has not yet
been explored.     In  the horizontal part of the passage were found
curious antique glass lamps, water jars,          a little pile of charcoal as
if for cooking,   and a cooking-dish glazed           inside.    Evidently this
had been used as a refuge.           Overhanging the shaft was an iron
ring, to which  a rope  might have been attached for hauling up water.
    Lieutenant Warren considers that which has usually been held
to be the aqueduct from the Temple to the            Virgin's Fount, to have
been rather an aqueduct for the supply of Ophel, as evidenced by a
shaft and draw-well.
    While exploring the tunnel between the Virgin's Fount and
Siloam, the same gurgling sound of water was heard which has
been noticed by others      ;  but the hidden channel, which has thus
been detected by sound at intervals from               the Damascus     gate to
Siloam, yet remains to be revealed.
    Now, fragmentary     as   all these discoveries      are, they indicate an
amount    of ancient remains below the surface, which cannot but
excite our hopes, and stimulate        us to  strain every nerve to lay bare
such interesting relics.      We may find but little yet to throw direct
 light on the lives we       so cherish,   and    any detail of which we so
dearly prize.    True, but it must be recollected that the exploration
in Jerusalem is at present in the condition of a puzzle or joining
map, of which only half a dozen pieces are found out of sixty or
seventy.     Find the others, and the whole can           be  put together, and
will then be intelligible enough.         Extend to the other parts of the
city the researches here begun, and the sites of the Temple, of the
Tombs of the Kings of Judah, of the Holy Sepulchre, of the Pool
of Bethesda, will be problems no longer.
                                    I
    As Mr Grove remarks " as read Lieutenant Warren's accounts,
I  seem to feel the ancient city within my grasp, to know for a cer
tainty that its very houses, and streets, and water-courses, all the
 ancient life of its structures, its hills and its ravines, are lying
buried,   like some enchanted         person,   beneath     that singular and
 solemn   tomb.    The cliff (says Dean Stanley) which Joab climbed,

the catacombs      of the kings of Judah, the very Via Dolorosa itself,
of which not even the shadow of            a  likeness can    be found    in the
upper air of the modern city — all these are doubtless there.            Wher
ever we probe, go deep enough, and we come on some solid sub
stance    of curious and ancient kind.          A  stone suddenly rolls away
and reveals staircases, passages, subterranean           halls in the heart of
 the rock, leading to who knows what repositories             of treasure.    An
almost invisible crevice in the hill turns out to be an enchanted
cave, 150 feet deep, containing perhaps the hidden fountain of the
water supply of Jerusalem."
     But outside Jerusalem how much remains for us to learn 1 In
the valley of the Kedron, Lieutenant Warren has sunk for 50 feet
through debris again and again, without meeting the native rock.
 He is inclined to believe the tradition of the Mishna respecting
 the bridge of the red heifer, and is now searching for the founda
 tions of the arches or pillars,     as it will probably prove to have been
 a  pier bridge,  if it really existed.
     Of archaeological researches in other parts of the country there
 is little to be noticed.     The few examinations which have hither
 to been made here and there all encourage us to hope for a rich
 harvest    wherever     the  work shall     be  systematically undertaken.
 Thus Captain Wilson's          exposure    of the ancient synagogues          of
 Capernaum     has, with a very trifling amount of excavation, revealed
 to us the extent and magnificence         of an edifice associated in our
 minds with events scarcely less deeply interesting than those which
 cluster round the temple of Jerusalem.              The remains of Seileon
(Shiloh), Samaria, Gerizim,         the cities of the Philistines,      Beisan,
 (Bethshean), Heshbon, Rabbath- Amnion, all by their extent and
 interest invite careful exploration.
     In physical  research, much too has recently been accomplished.
  It  is only within the last four years that we have become aware of
 the wonderful variety of the physical phenomena               of Palestine, of
 the very interesting geological record contained           in the region sur
 rounding the Jordan valley, and especially of the unique fauna and
 flora confined within the narrow limits of the cliffs which overhang
 the Dead Sea.       There, in   a depression    1300 feet below the level of
 the    Mediterranean, we find an almost           tropical fauna and flora,
 containing    a few    Indian,   many Abyssinian, and several peculiai

and unique species in all the different forms of life, which make, in
fact, a tropical outlier, just as the tops of the mountains,        10,000 feet
high, supply us in their botany with boreal outliers. Not the least
interesting fact ascertained is the peculiar character of the fishes
of the Sea of Galilee and the Jordan, many of which are peculiar,
some   Nilotic  ; but whether peculiar or African, exhibiting           remark
able affinities with     the   African forms of the entire and central

pointing to    a time,   perhaps at the close of the Miocene period,
when this depression      formed     the northernmost of a long chain of
fresh-water lakes, extending        as  far  us south-east  Africa.
    The following       Gentlemen were elected               Fellows of the
Society : —

                                      Chair.
    The Chairman said — Gentlemen, before beginning the business
of this meeting,    I wish to refer to the lamented death of two of the
office-bearers of this Society.        Dr Burt, a member of our Council,
was well known as a public-spirited citizen, who had long usefully
devoted himself to the development              of our institutions, and who,
by his genial disposition and honesty of character, endeared                him
self to all those who enjoyed his acquaintance.            The other loss     has
had a more marked          relation to us, because in the death of Sir
David Brewster this Society has lost its President, and this country
one of her most distinguished philosophers.             This is not the time
to refer   to the benefits which         Sir David Brewster has bestowed
upon science.      These have been        so numerous     and important that
we may expect a special         evening to     be devoted   to this considera
tion.   If  Professor Tait, who is         so capable   to do justice to the
merits of his deceased friend, were to undertake            this subject,   I  am
sure the Royal Society would hail with pleasure the announcement

                  of Edinburgh,            Session 1867-08.                           283
of his intention.      Such       a record   of the achievements of             a great

while they become landmarks in the progress of science over new
and untrodden     paths, they indicate the methods                  by which further
progress is to be attained.         Sir David Brewster entered this Society
so long ago as 1808, and has been a constant                        contributor to its
Transactions.     It   is worthy of notice that in the year 1808 the
three candidates who became Fellows of the Society were, James
Wardrop, surgeon, now in London, David Brewster, and Humphry
Davy.      In announcing          to us at the opening             of the session the
death of Faraday, Sir David said that there was only one person
living who had, like Faraday, taken all the medals of the Royal
Society of London — the Copley, Rumford, and Royal medals.
There is no one living now to claim this high honour, for the
" one " so          hinted at was himself. In Brewster and
              modestly
Faraday the nation has suffered              a heavy       loss.     Both were great
philosophers and ardent Christians. We point to them as con
clusive proofs that science and infidelity are not akin. dare not           I
trust myself to speak of the last days of Brewster. The perfect
calmness and kindly consideration with which he wrote farewell
letters to the public bodies which had honoured                        themselves       by
honouring     him during life, were perhaps to have been looked for
in one who viewed        death as a means of attaining a higher and
purer knowledge of God and of His works.   But it is given to few
men to possess their mental faculties unclouded to the last.    A
week before his death         I   had a long letter in his own handwriting,
showing the liveliest interest in the affairs of the University, and
in some optical discoveries regarding which he frequently corre
sponded with me. A few days after, while his mind was still clear,
but his bodily frame weaker, he dictated a letter to the Council of
this Society, in which he took         a   touching leave of his old associates
and of the Society itself, and left to          it,   as   a   precious   legacy,   a   re
search, nearly completed, which formed the death-bed study of the
old philosopher.    I am sure that the Society would not have
wished to commence        the      business of this evening without some
allusion   to the death of their venerable                 President, and without
some expression     of sympathy with his widow and family.                   I      there
fore invite, from the body of the Society,                 a   resolution   which will

  284                 Proceedings of the Royal Society
  record    the sense of our own sorrow, and of our strong sympathy
  with that deeper personal affliction which is felt by the widow and
  children of so great and good a man.
     Professor Sir James      Y.  Simpson  moved the following resolution,
  which was seconded by Thomas Stevenson, Esq., and unanimously
  adopted    : —
     " The
               Royal Society of Edinburgh hereby record their deep sense
 of the great loss which the Society have sustained by the death of
 their late venerable and esteemed President, Sir David Brewster.
     " Early in life an earnest worker and a happy discoverer in some
 of the most recondite         fields of physical   knowledge,      Sir David
 Brewster has, during the last sixty and more years, continued with
 ceaseless energy to pour into the con temporary stream of science
 and    literature    a series  of contributions of rare excellence        and
 originality.      At last he has passed from among us,      as  ripe in fame
 as  in years    ; for he has reaped all the highest academic and other
 distinctions, both domestic and foreign, which       a British philosopher
 can possibly win, and in his chosen departments of research he has
 left behind him no name more illustrious than his own.
    " The
               Society further resolve to send a copy of this minute to
 Lady Brewster and the other members of Sir David Brewster's
 family, at the same time expressing their sincere sympathy with
them in their late bereavement."

 1.   Observations      relative to the Desireableness of Transport
    ing from Alexandria to Britain the prostrate Obelisk
    presented to George IV. by Mahomed Ali Pacha.                          By
    Colonel Sir J. E. Alexander, K.C.L.S.
    In  the month of September last (1867), when visiting the Great
Exhibition in Paris,       I was particularly struck with the fine appear
ance of the obelisk of       Luxor in the Place de la Concorde, and          I
thought that       as the French had taken the trouble and gone to the
expense of moving this highly interesting monolith, it was a re
flection on our nation and on the engineering skill of Britain that
the prostrate obelisk at Alexandria (one of Cleopatra's         needles, as it

                      of Edinburgh,     Session 1867-68.                                  285
is commonly termed),          was not      occupying      a   place    of honour in
England or Scotland.
   This obelisk was presented to George IV. many years ago by
Mahomed Ali Pacha, who also generously offered to move it on
rollers to the sea, from which it is 200 or 300 yards distant, and
embarking it on rafts and lighters, convey it to                 a vessel         for trans
port to England.
  The state of public affairs at the time, perhaps, prevented the
accomplishment of this enterprise; now the time may be more
favourable for it.
    Sir Gardiner Wilkinson and other writers on Egypt and its
antiquities are of opinion that Cleopatra's needles (one of which is
upright) were brought by one of the Ptolemies from Heliopolis,
near Cairo, to decorate         a palace     at Alexandria.           On the obelisks
appear     the    names    of Thomes    III.    (b.c.    1463), of Remeses                 the
Great, and of Oserei         II.
                          (b.c. 1232), long before Cleopatra's time.
Sandys, who travelled in 1610, calls the prostrate obelisk
                                                           " Pharaoh's
needle,"     and says      " it is half-buried in rubbish."             It        is of red
granite, and, looking down a hole, its top is seen with crowned
hawks sculptured on it.  Lord Nugent, writing in 1845, says the
hieroglyphics on three sides are well preserved. Colonel Ayton, of
H.M. Bombay Engineers, informed me that whilst in Egypt in
1862, and whilst there was an idea of a memorial for Prince Albert
first started, Mr Clark, of the telegraph department,                  uncovered the
prostrate obelisk, removed the sand and rubbish from                        it,   found the
hieroglyphics on three sides in good                preservation,           and,     as    the
obelisk was not then wanted, he covered             it    up again.
     This obelisk, with others,         is   well ascertained          to     have        been
quarried at Syene, at the extreme boundary of Upper Egypt.     It
isnot easy to find out how the hieroglyphics were graven on such
a   hard   surface, and what was the process of hardening the bronze
tools used for this purpose.         The Messrs          Macdonald of Aberdeen,
and other workers in granite in this country, might be able to ex
plain this    :   possibly the assistance of emery powder was brought in.
     Denon       alludes   to Cleopatra's needles,         and   says       they might
be moved without difficulty, and form                   interesting trophies.              To
remove       works of art from countries where                they form ornaments
and are conspicuous         objects of interest   is    quite unworthy of           a   great

286                     Proceedings of the Royal Society
people       ;   but the obelisk in question              lies in dishonour among low
huts in the outskirts              of Alexandria, and might well                     be spared to
ornament          one of our capital cities.                In      a conversation       with    Mr
David Laing,            the well-known             antiquary, about           it,   he suggested
the open space in front of the British Museum as the most appro
priate for it.         Still,   it   might not      be   sufficiently      seen there   —further
west might be better, or in our Charlotte Square.
I                   Mr Newton, the keeper of antiquities, British
       corresponded with
Museum, about the obelisk, and he writes — " It seems to me that
if,    by   public subscription,         a   sufficient sum could            be raised to trans
port this obelisk to England,                 it   would be        a    just matter of national
satisfaction       ;   but you       will understand          that,       while this may        be   a
casefully justifying an appeal to the public for       subscription,         a                       it
may not be one sufficiently strong to justify the trustees and officers
of the British Museum in moving in the matter officially, because
we have to make so many applications to the Treasury for grants
for excavations,          &c."
I       communicated            with the Peninsular            and Oriental Steam Navi
gation Company   regarding the means of transporting the obelisk,
and the secretary for the managing directors states — " We would
beg to suggest          that the matter should                     be   referred    by you to the
Foreign Office, whose agents have made all the necessary calcula
tions on the subject, and without whose permission nothing could
be     done."
      The Foreign Office was accordingly communicated                                with, and       an
answer was returned that the matter                      is   now under the consideration
of Lord Stanley.
      The eminent civil engineer,                  Professor Macquorn Rankine,                   was
asked what he thought of the means of transporting the obelisk,
and he said — "        I   regret    I   cannot form any opinion whatsoever as to
the best way of transporting the obelisk without having detailed
information which,         I       believe,  I     could not obtain except by visiting
the spot where           it     lies.    The subject          is   undoubtedly one of very
great interest, and       I       should very much like to be present when                           it
is    discussed."
      In    the Royal United            Service     Institution, London,           I   found thir
teen large plans, carefully drawn,                       illustrating        how, by means of
inclined planes,         a      flat-bottomed       vessel, machinery for raising the

                     of Edinburgh, Session 1867-68.                             287
obelisk   on a pedestal,      &c.,   it could      be sent    to and set up        in
England.     These plans are supposed to have been prepared in 1820
by Captain Boswell,       R.N., for the Government, but no action was
then taken in the matter.
   It  appears to me (having studied and been employed formerly as
an engineer) that there might be no need for a vessel being built on
purpose to carry the obelisk.          A   large Clyde lighter, raised upon,
might transport it across the Bay of Biscay in summer               ;  or  if an old
ship, sufficiently seaworthy,      is got, and the masts taken out of her,
and the beams cut across, the obelisk might be taken                     alongside,
raised, and lowered       into her, iron beams being ready, with bolts
and screws, to connect and secure the cut beams of the vessel;                  then
towed by a steamer to England.              Once there,   little difficulty would
ensue before    it occupied    a place   of distinction    ; but not necessarily
on a pedestal,    which would change its original character                 through
giving it additional height.          It  is 64 feet long, weighs 284 tons,
 and is 7 to 8 feet square at the base of the shaft.
    I understand     that in    an   apartment      in the Louvre part        of the
 machinery is preserved by means of which the transport of the
 French obelisk was effected. This could be seen, or even lent to
 assist our engineers, and save heavy costs            ; and this need not be
 heavy, unless with gross mismanagement              and a mere job made of it.
 Honestly gone about, the cost would be moderate.
    Lord Stanley wrote me that he was not aware that the Parlia
 ment would vote      a sum   of money to move the obelisk.             This might
 be asked, however.
    I quite concur     with Professor Piazzi Smyth in denouncing the
 barbarism of breaking off pieces of and carrying away Egyptian
 antiques ; but      I  think we might remove the prostrate obelisk
 hidden and buried in the sand, leaving, of course, the twin obelisk
 set up in its place, and always         most interesting as a        "
                                                                        Cleopatra's
 needle." The prostrate one might be converted into building mate
 rials ere long,   if not  looked after.
     Lately, in Glasgow,     I made    myself acquainted with the engineer
 of the Clyde Navigation, Mr A. Duncan. I went over the matter
 with him of the means of transporting the obelisk, and I suggested
 an iron casing or vessel built round           it.   He approved of this, and
 on my asking him to give his ideas on the matter— also to look at
     vol. VI.                                                           2 p

288                  Pmtecdinys of the Royal Society
the plans from the United Service          Institution — he kindly consented
to do so; and his clear and excellent method                 for carrying out
what is so much desired — the removal of the obelisk to Britain —
is placed before the Royal Society of Edinburgh.*
 2.    On the Temperature of the Common Fowl (GaUus domes-
      ticns).     By the late Dr John Davy.              Communicated by
      Professor Allman.
      Before    proceeding   to read    Dr Davy's paper, Professor Allman
 made the following remarks          : —
      The duty has devolved         on me of being the medium           through
 which the paper just announced should be communicated to the
 Society — a duty not unmixed with melancholy; for when the dis
 tinguished author of that paper had placed it in the hands of the
 Council, there was nothing to prevent our looking forward to a con
 tinuance of those labours with whose results the pages of your
  Transactions have been so often enriched.            But the pen which had
  worked       unwearyingly for nearly sixty years is at last still        ; and
  the paper now before you closes in for ever the earthly labours of
  its author.
       It  has been suggested that, under these circumstances,          it would
  be right to accompany        the communication of        Dr Davy's paper by
   a few words      setting forth the salient points in his scientific life,
   and    it is in accordance with this suggestion that I have drawn up
   the following short note.          For the facts which it contain I am
   mainly indebted to his son-in-law, Professor Rolleston, of Oxford.
        Dr John Davy was born at Penzance in May 1791 ; he died at
   his residence near Ambleside in January 1868. He was therefore
   in his seventy-seventh       year at the time of his death.
       * Sir William Wylde, in   a pamphlet sent me by  Sir James Simpson, states
   that, in the year 1839, he proposed that the obelisk      should form a Nelson
    testimonial, with sphinxes at its base ; two of which, after the capture of
    Alexandria in 1801, were bnilt into the wall of the Custom-House near thc
    principal landing-place.   These might be recovered also without much diffi
    culty, as they are in a manner buried where they are. At St Petersburg
    I saw the granite rock on which the statue of Peter the Great stands, and got
    the details of the manner of its transport.

                   of Edinburgh,      Session 1867-68.                     289
   His scientific labours began in controversy, and we find him, in
1811, defending the       views   of his brother,       Mr (afterwards Sir)
Humphry Davy, regarding the nature of potassium                  and sodium,
and the    composition of hydrochloric, or,          as  it was then called,
oxymuriatic     acid.  His advocacy       of his brother's views was in
reply to the objections urged against them by Mr Murray, at that
time a lecturer on Chemistry in Edinburgh.                 His letters on the
subject were published in Nicholson's Journal, and the controversy
ran through several successive numbers of that periodical.
   It  was at this time that he was studying medicine in Edinburgh,
where he became a member and one              of the annual Presidents of
the   Royal Medical Society — a        society composed of students, and
which has numbered        amongst its members          some of the most dis
tinguished names by which medical science                has been advanced
during the present century. Among Davy's contemporaries in the
Medical Society were Richard Bright and Marshall Hall. In
1814 he graduated       in Edinburgh       as  M.D., with     a thesis,   "De
Sanguine."      It  must have been about           the period    to which we
 now refer that he assisted his brother in the Royal            Institution in
 London, and discovered chloro-carbonic gas. He became a Fellow
 of the Royal Institution of London on 17th February 1814.
    During the Waterloo       campaign in 1815, Dr Davy was attached
 to a general hospital in Brussels, and in the following year be was
 appointed staff-surgeon in Ceylon, where he remained until 1820.
 While there he accumulated materials for an account of Ceylon,
 which still continues a standard work on that island. During
 subsequent    years  he did duty on various foreign             stations — the
 Ionian Islands, Malta, Constantinople, and the West Indies.                 He
 also served on home       stations ;   and his value as a public servant
 was   subsequently   recognised    by Government in his appointment
 to the post  of Inspector- General of Army Hospitals.
    In  1842 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, Edinburgh.
    The opportunities afforded        by a life so singularly active        and
 varied were not allowed to escape him         ;  for, with an ardent love of
 inquiry, he possessed powers of observation which have rarely been
 surpassed, and a versatility which enabled him to direct these
 powers into the most diverse channels.
    In  comparative   anatomy his name        will  be always associated   with

290               Proceedings of the Royal Society
our knowledge     of the circulation of the blood in the Amphibia       ;   for
though    Meckel had previously discovered        that the auricle in      the
Pipa or Surinam toad was divided into two chambers by a                mem
branous    septum, yet   the   German    anatomist regarded this       as an
exception   ; and in common       with every other anatomist, from the
time   of Harvey downwards,       considered that the batrachian heart
had, as a rule, only a single auricle, by which        it was distinguished
from   that of the true reptiles.      Davy, however, by showing that
the auricle is double in the frog and in the common toad, established
this important structural feature       as an essential     character of the
Amphibia.
   Dr Davy's extensive       pathological experience afforded him the
materials for his work on
                             " Diseases of the Army." His Life of his
brother Sir Humphry proves his aptitude for critical biography;
while his numerous       papers on Natural      History, Chemistry, and
Physiology, show still further how free from              speciality was his
active and inquiring mind.
   It is his physiological    researches, however, and more especially
those on animal heat, which stand        forth with greatest prominence
in  the   long list of his scientific labours.        His observations      on
temperature,    which extend to almost every important group of the
animal kingdom, and embrace animals in almost every possible
condition, are among      the   most valuable with which this depart
ment of inquiry has been enriched,        and  will always continue to      be
referred to by the historian of physiological progress.           Among    the
very earliest of his publications is a paper presented to the Royal
Society in 1814, on the difference of temperature between arterial
and venous blood, and his last— that now before you— is still on
his favourite subject.
   Dr Davy's place in the history of scientific discovery has none of
the brilliancy of his brother's, but it will always be known as that
of the uncompromising advocate of truth — the patient, painstaking,
conscientious,   and successful observer.     The discovery of facts — the
elucidation of positive truth — was his mission      ;   he seldom indulged
in speculation,   and did not possess that genius for generalisation
which shed such     a lustre over the career of the great chemist.
   The later years of his life were spent in his retirement                  at
Lesketh     How, near    Ambleside.      When    I   saw     him there    last

                      oj Edinburgh,     Session 1867-68.                   291
autumn      he had lost none of his love of research, and dwelt with
all the delight of a young man            upon the natural features of his
neighbourhood       ;  time seemed     as yet to have    leant but lightly on
him, and his looks were no index to his years ; but he was hardly
what   I  had known him some years before, and was certainly sadder
than had been his wont.
    His last illness commenced with what he at first considered               as
only   a severe attack      of influenza  ;  but alarming symptoms super
vened,     and    against    these   no   treatment    had any power.        Dr
Rolleston writes to me that          " he retained his faculties to the last,
and to the last the watchword           was,   with him    as with the Roman
              '
 Emperor,       Laboremus.'"
                              Abstract of the Paper.
    The observations were made on birds of different ages and sexes,
and under various conditions, and the following results were approxi
mative^ obtained         : —
    1. The average temperature of the common fowl is 107°-81.
    2. The temperature of the sexes before maturity is comparatively
high, being      108°"5,   whilst that of the two sexes at this stage varies
very little.
    3. The temperature of the male, on the whole, irrespective           of any
particular age, is higher than that of the female, being             as 108°-39
to 107°-3.

attains a comparatively high temperature, and that the temperature
of nestlings is also comparatively high, facts which are scarcely in
accordance with the views of Dr William Edwards, who, in his
work    "  On the Influence of Physical Agents on Life," maintains
that   "  the power of producing heat in warm-blooded animals is at
 its minimum at birth, and increases markedly until adult age."

  The tendency of the air contained in a soap-bubble is to ex
pand in bulk, while that of the film is to contract in surface.
Hence it becomes                a curious           question                     to decide whether              both of
these tendencies are not satisfied when two or more bubbles unite
into one.

The quantity                    is exceedingly small, so that                                   we    call it   3 e, we

That      is,   the    quantity by which the radius of       bubble must be                 a

of the atmosphere,               is    independent                       of the radius               of the bubble
(unless  be very small).

  Suppose two bubbles of radii                          r,      and      rt      to coalesce, and let       r3   be the
radius      of the single bubble formed,                                  we have          (by expressing          that
the whole content               is   unchanged).

Hence,      if    SV express the increase of volume, SS that of surface
we have
                                          8V            +    cSS             =    0.

Hence it appears that the volume increases and the surface con
tracts, or vice versd, for they cannot both remain unaltered. And
the physical circumstances              show at once that the former is the case.
     The formula just written shows that the volume increases by
as much as that of a bubble, whose surface is equal to the diminu
tion of surface, would change when it is                       so increased     that the air it
contains is at the pressure of the atmosphere.
     Itis obvious that the same process of physical reasoning may
be   applied to any number of soap-bubbles when made to unite ; so
that we may thus, without any analysis,                             conclude    that for any
number of positive quantities x, y,                   z, &c., we have always

from which the above result                 is   evident.
     Professor Tait exhibited to the Society                        a   very easy mode of de
monstrating some of Stewart's results regarding equality of absorp
tion and radiation. Letters drawn with ink on slip of platinum             a
foil appeared brighter than the ground when the foil was heated
in a large blowpipe flame, but darker than the ground on the other
side of the foil. Thus, though glowing more brightly, the iron
spots are really at           a    lower temperature than the foil beside them.
The spectra of the two portions were described and their lengths
compared, with the view of strengthening the proof; and the ex
periment was applied to suggest an explanation of the singular
observation by which Secchi was led to conclude that iron trans                       is
parent at      a   red heat.

1.  Observations on the Spores of Cryptogamic Plants, and on
   the Reproductive Process in some Algae and             Fungi.      By
   Professor Balfour.
   In this paper the author alluded to the spore        as the  ultimate
germinating cell of cryptogamic plants.          The true spore is the
product   of impregnation, but there     are also bodies called spores
which,  so far  as  known, do not depend on the process of fertilisa
tion.   Occasionally the term spore includes both the spore and the
spore-case or sporangium.      The structure of the spore was described,
and its resemblance to the pollen grain, both as regards its anatomy
and germination, was shown.        Ciliated moving spores were con
sidered, and reference was specially made to the movements        of the
non-ciliated spores of Helminthora, which, when discharged, con
tinue to change their form for several hours like the Amoeba,
becoming in turn oblong, pyriform, rhomboidal,       &c, — lengthening
and contracting, swelling at one point and shrinking at another.
   The germination of spores was considered.        Some of them were
shown to produce a prothallus, and were hence called Thalloid spores;
while others had no prothallus, and were therefore Athalloid.          In
the case   of the former,    the prothallus was sometimes      produced
externally,  as in   ferns, and hence the spore was Exothalloid      ; in
other cases   the prothallus was internal, as in Lycopods, and        the
spore was called Endothalloid.
   In all the great divisions of cryptogamic plants, bodies called
Antheridia and Archegonia have been detected, — the former usually
containing spermatozoids.
   The conjugation in Tyndaridea, Zygnema, and Mougeotia was
then considered, and the function of a compound spore in some

                    of Edinburgh,     Session 1867-68.                   205
 species of Vaucheria and in     Fungi, such   as Rhizopus   nigricans.    In
the last-mentioned plant the compound spore is called           a Zygospore.
     Special attention was drawn to the fertilisation of Florideae, as
demonstrated by Bornet and Thuret.           The formation of antheridia
with corpuscles, and of a peculiar hair-like body called Trichogy-
nium was noticed. The cell at the base of this latter organ, after
 fertilisation,  is transformed   into the Cystocarp,      which is some
 times supported on cells called the Trichophore.            The formation
of the Cystocarp containing spores was exhibited in large drawings
of Nemalion, Batrachospermum,          Helminthoro, Liagora, Callitham-
nion, Bonnemaisonia, and Polysiphonia.          It  was shown that, in the
case    of Dudresnaya,   there is a long Trichogynium      with spiral coils
 near its base, and that the cells below that organ elongate so as to
form llexuose filaments, which pass in a serpentine manner among
the ramifications of the sea-weed, and come in contact with the
fructiferous filaments which they are destined to fecundate.           These
conducting tubes are attached         successively   to the terminal cells
of the filaments,      becoming   incorporated     with them.      Thus, the
fructiferous filaments are united together by a sort of network of
delicate tubes.      These tubes convey the fertilising influence from
the Trichogynium to the Ampullae, from which the Cystocarps are
formed.      It was thus shown that the fecundating apparatus of the
Florideae consists     of antheridia containing      corpuscles,   and  of  a
small cellular body terminated by a unilocular hair or Trichogynium.
Fecundation is produced by the union of antheridian corpuscles
with the Trichogynium, followed by the development of the capsular
fruit or Cystocarp.
    In   some cases, as in Nemalion,      the fertilisation   is direct, the
influence of the antheridian corpuscle       being at once conveyed by
the Trichogynium to the rudimentary cell of the Cystocarp. In other
cases, as in Dudresnaya, the action is less direct,      — the influence of
the    antheridian corpuscles    being conveyed      by connecting tubes,
which pass laterally from the base of the Trichogynium to numerous
fructiferous filaments, on which the Cystocarps are finally de
veloped.
   The author then considered       the case   of the spores contained in
the Thecae of Mosses and Ferns.         These spores have not been shown
to be produced by direct fertilisation.     In these plants there is a pro-
    VOL.   VI.                                                   2  Q

 thallus bearing the reproductive organs.          The spermatozoids of the
 antheridian cells come into contact with the archegonial cell, and
 after fertilisation the cell remains      attached    to the prothallus, and
 from   it is developed the stalk bearing the sporiferous              theca in
 Mosses, and the sporangiferous         frond in Ferns.       These so-called
 spores seem to resemble buds.         Remarks were made on the buds of
 the Marchantia, the gonidia      of Lichens, and the tetraspores of Algae,
 as well  as on the   production of separable buds in the higher classes
 of plants, and the production of ova and buds in Medusae. The ten
dency,    also,  of the spores of anomalous         ferns  to produce     fronds
having the peculiar character of these varieties, was considered               as
indicating their alliance with buds.
    The paper was illustrated by      a large series of coloured drawings
and by models, as well as recent           specimens     of ferns in various
states, from the prothalloid condition up to the frondiparous state,
bearing sporangia,      and also at times producing viviparous buds.
2.   Note on a Eecent High Tide on the East Coast of Britain.
           By George Eobertson, M. Inst. C.E. (Plate.)
    The greatest height to which the tide has ever been known to
rise at any given place is of the utmost consequence to the marine
engineer.      It forms an important element in the design and in the
estimate    for any works in the       sea ;  and any error on this point
might lead to the most lamentable            results both to life and pro
perty, especially in the construction        of embankments for the recla
mation of land.
    I have  therefore   thought that    a notice   of the tide of the 8th of
last month might not       be  uninteresting to the Society,      as it  is one
of the highest,      if  not  indeed   the    highest, that has ever been
recorded with accuracy on the east coast of Britain,            and the most
remarkable      example    with which   I  am acquainted      of the effect of
wind in raising the level of high water on that coast.
    The months of January and February of this year have been
remarkable      for the long continuance and violence of westerly
winds — at times approaching to the fury of a hurricane.
    A long continuance of these winds has always                the   effect of

 keeping up the tides round the coast of Britain ; and if the wind
 then goes suddenly round to the north of west, it brings in the
 tidal wave from the Atlantic in great strength round the north
 of Scotland, and consequently raises the level of high water on
  the east coast to an abnormal height, more especially as the wave
 works its way southward to the shallow water and obliquely shelv
 ing shores of England.
    The effect of these long-continued westerly winds on the tides
 culminated, on the morning of the 8th of February, in a tidal wave
 of perhaps unprecedented height on the east coast — the same wave
 which brought high water to the west of England and Ireland on
 the afternoon    and evening of the 7th.
    I   shall endeavour    to trace the  height of this wave from the
 time   it passed the Pentland     Firth till it met, off Lowestoft, the
 counteracting low water of the wave which travels rounds the south
 of England.
    Nothing remarkable in the height of the tide was noticed at
 Wick, where the tides seem to be more locally affected by gales
 from the S.W. to S.E., which raise the level of high water some 12
 or 15 inches.
    As the wave swept along the coast of Banffshire it increased in
height, till at Aberdeen the level of high water was 3 feet 6 inches
above the calculated height.        High water took place here at 1.16
a.m   , and was 24 feet 4 inches on the dock cill.         The average of
spring tides for five years at Aberdeen is 22 feet on the cill, but
the tide   of the 8th was not expected to rise so high      as this, and it
is the highest recorded since 1862, before which the records appear
uncertain.
    At Leith   the tidal wave rose at 1.58 a.m. to the height of 26 feet
10 inches     on the   Victoria   Dock cill.    The   calculated   height,
according to Reid's tables, which are those used at the port, should
have been 22 feet 6 inches, so that the actual         height was 4 feet
4 inches more     than the calculated height  ;  the greatest discrepancy
1  have ever heard of at Leith.       Between    the previous  high water
on the afternoon     of the 7th and that on the morning of the 8th,
there was no less a difference than 5 feet 8 inches.       The extraordi
nary amount     of this difference will be better understood if we bear
in mind that it represents the ordinary total rise between high

298                Proceedings        of   the  Royal Society
 water of low neap tides and high water of high spring tides, an
 amount     which   it usually takes seven days and fourteen tides                to
 accomplish     by successive increasemente            ;  but which, in this case,
 was done at one bound.
    Ou going over the tide-books at Leith                 for as far back as time
 has permitted,      I  find that during the last eighteen years there
 have been ninety tides, or five per annum, which reached the level
of  25 feet on the     Victoria Dock cill.         Of these only two tides have
 been   so high    as 26    feet,   viz. — the morning tide of October 26,
 1865, and the morning         tide of January 29, 1850.           The latter tide
 reached the height of 26 feet 8 inches, or 2 inches lower than the
 one  of the 8th ult.
   A very high rise of tide is recorded on several of the charts                  as
 having taken place on          July   18, 1829     ; but, on looking at Reid's
Commercial      List for   July 21,    1829,    I find   that on the day recorded
on the charts the tide was         a very ordinary one, only rising 2 inches
higher than was expected, and being exceeded by those following.
So that    there is some mistake which makes this high tide very
doubtful, to say the least.
   I have    prepared    a diagram of the height of high water at             Leith
for a tidal month, which shows the extraordinary                   state of oscilla
tion   in which     the tides      have been       during the late boisterous
weather.      It will    be  observed that from            the 11th to the 24th
January the tides were all above the calculated height.                     On the
      —
24th the day of the great gale in Scotland— the wind went vio
lently round to the south, and immediately the tides fell to more
than 2 feet below their proper height,                rising again     as the wind
went back to the west.           After   a  fortnight of most unusual oscilla
tion, the tide rose on the 8th February, with the turn of the wind
to the north, to the unprecedented height alluded to in the paper.
   I regret   that  I cannot     give a diagram of the low waters for the
same period, which would have been very valuable and instructive                    ;
but at Leith, as at many other ports, no regular                 record is kept of
the low waters.
   The height of the tidal wave of the 8th, when it had reached the
mouth of the Tyne, in Northumberland, was much the same as at
Leith — a little less, however, as might be expected from the con
figuration    of the    coast.      The height of high water in Shields

inches higher than any tide previously recorded.          The tide     on  the
6th was also unusually high, being      3  feet 2 inches more than cal
culated.
   At Sunderland     the tide was 3 feet 11 inches more than the cal
culated height.
   At Hull it    was  high water at 5.45 on the morning of the 8th,
and the tide rose to a height of 30 feet 5 inches above the Humber
Dock cill, or no less than   5 feet 5 inches   more than was calculated.
The tide of the previous day had risen only to 23 feet 4£ inches
above the cill ; so that we have at Hull the extraordinary difference
of  7 feet £ inch between two successive tides — the greatest amount
of aberration I have hitherto discovered in the east coast tides.
   The average height of springs at Hull is 26 feet        8 inches on the
dock cill, there being very seldom tides of 28 feet.           A  list of the
high tides at this port has been sent to me, and         I find   that since
1788 there have been only twenty-three tides which have reached
a  height corresponding to 29 feet on the Humber Dock cill — an
average    of only one tide in three and        a  half years.      Of these
twenty-three tides only one reached the height of 30 feet, and that
was on    the 18th    February 1816, during       a gale   from the     N.W.
The tide was then 4 inches      lower than that of the 8th ult., which
is the highest tide on record at Hull.
   The tidal wave appears to have reached its maximum about
Hull, having travelled from Aberdeen in 4h. 29m. — according
to Imray's     tide-tables — exactly one hour faster        than usual,     as
might be expected from so strong a flood.          This is at the rate of
                                —
nearly eighty miles per hour a great speed for a wave of the first
order in 50 fathoms water, and equal to what it usually is in 70
fathoms.
   About this point, or perhaps nearer Yarmouth, the tide began to
feel the counteracting influence of the low water of the wave which
sweeps along the south and west of England.
    By the time high water reached Lowestoft the level had appa
rently fallen a little ; for though the tide was 20 feet 9 inches, or
 4 feet 3 inches above the average,     still this is 2 feet 3 inches     less
 than the tide of the 2d December          1867,   which is     the highest

  300                  Proceedings      of    the  Royal Society
  on record      at Lowestoft.       On the 25th of January last — the day
  after  the great       storm   in Scotland — the low water at Lowestoft
  was 4 feet below the average           ;   and the harbour-master writes        that
  they have had extraordinary                 fluctuations during the last three
  months.
     When the wave reached the London Docks it was still extremely
 high, being       3 feet 6 inches      above     Trinity datum ; but this is not
  unprecedented ; for on January 20, 1850, it was an inch higher ;
 and on November 12, 1852, it was 2 inches higher. This latter is the
 highest tide on record at the London Docks, and the water rose to
 29 feet    1   inch on the dock cill, or           3 feet 8 inches  above    Trinity
 datum.
     In examining the height of that portion of the great tidal wave
 from the Atlantic which sweeps along the south and west of Eng
 land,  I  find a marked difference from the east coast tide.                Instead
 of being the highest wave on record, it was a tide, slightly in some
 places only above the calculated height, and in no respect very
 remarkable       as to  height of high water.
     At Cork the water did not rise above the average of springs
 either on the 7th or 8th February;                   but there was a great ebb,
 which left banks exposed in the harbour that had not been visible
 for years.
    The wave which reached Portsmouth Dockyard at 11                     p.m. on the
 7th was the same         as calculated    ;   but on the morning    of the 8th the
tide rose to 21 feet 4 inches on the              cill of Dock No. 6, which is the
zero,   or    1    foot 11    inches above calculation.          This is not very
remarkable,       for there was    a  tide at Portsmouth on November 1840
which rose       2 feet   higher, and is the highest on record.
    At Dover      the wave on the 8th was unusually high, being 2 feet
4 inches above the calculated              height.      High water was     21 feet 9
inches above low water of ordinary springs                   ; but this is not the
highest tide known, for the engineer of the Admiralty works writes
that he has on record one of 22 feet, or 3 inches more.
    That branch of the tidal wave which flows up St George's Chan
nel towards the Irish Sea had nothing extraordinary in its height.
    At Bristol       the tide of the 7th was 29 feet 8 inches,             or only 9
inches more than calculated.               On the 8th it was     31 feet   1  inch —
the height expected;            this, too, at      a place subject   to very    high

 tides, the highest on record being that of           January 29, 1846, which
 was 37 feet 4 inches at the Cumberland Basin.
     At Dublin the height on the 7th was               13 feet,  and on the 8th
 12 feet 7 inches above zero      ; but the engineer of the Ballast Board
 writes that this is nothing remarkable, and that he has a record of
  a tide 2 feet 9 inches higher than the one on the 7th ult.
     The tides at Holyhead were much            as usual,    and were exceeded
 by those of the 9th and 10th.
    At Liverpool      the tide of the 7th was       1   foot 5 inches above cal
 culation    ; but on the 8th it was 4 inches below what it ought to
 have been.
    At Belfast    the tide of the 7th was 11 feet above datum          ; on the
 8th, 11 feet 2 inches     ; the average of tides being 10 feet.         On the
 13th and 14th the tides were at least          2 feet   higher.
     I  have brought this notice of the recent            high tide on the east
 coast before the Royal Society, not only for the purpose             of having
 on record one     of the most remarkable tide waves occasioned by wind
 in this country of which we have any authentic account, but also
 for   a practical purpose.
    The knowledge that there is        a  tidal wave of more than ordinary
 height on its way to any of the great commercial ports of Britain
 would be of great value to merchants and sailors. There are always
vessels    lying in harbours and docks of too great a draught of water
 to allow them to sail during neap tides, or even during low springs.
Few ports in this country have sufficient depth of water to prevent
                         "
large vessels being neaped,"         as   it is called.     These vessels might
be able to sail several days, perhaps ten or more, sooner than they
could otherwise do, or be docked,          as the   case might be, were they
timely warned of the fact that        a  tidal wave of more than the usual
height was on its way to them, bringing, in extreme cases, a high
spring during a low neap.
    Information     regarding high or low tides might just as easily be
 sent to each great port, without any extra expense, and with far
greater certainty of prediction, as the warnings for high winds are
at present, and might be signalled with equal simplicity.
    There is always plenty of time for it. The tidal wave which
reaches the west coast of Ireland about four o'clock at springs

 302               Proceedings of the Royal Society
 divides into two parts.     The northern branch takes eight hours       to
reach Aberdeen,     nine hours to reach Leith, fourteen hours to reach
Hull, and twenty hours to reach London.              The southern   branch
takes seven hours to reach Portsmouth, and seven hours to reach
 Liverpool.
    The character of the winds prevailing at the time would, with         a
little experience,    give  a good    idea of whether the coming tide
would be felt most on the east or the west coast, and also           of its
probable height at different places.
   The knowledge      of the approach of an extraordinarily high tide
might also occasionally be of some use in the preservation of pro
perty from its effects.
    In  these days of steam    I am sure that information about tides
would be quite as generally appreciated       as information about winds,
by both     merchants   and sailors.   I  believe that the Royal Society
of Edinburgh would do        a great   practical service to the shipping
interests of this country   if they  could prevail on the Meteorological
Department of the Board of Trade to arrange that notice should           be
sent to all the principal ports     of Britain, not only of the expected
winds, but also     of the expected tides, whether unusually high or
unusually low.      The storms of wind may or may not arrive — for
the wind "bloweth where       it listeth ;" but the tidal waves flow and
ebb without fail, with the speed of the hurricane, but the silence of
the grave.

1.   The Mean Pressure of the Atmosphere over the Globe for
     the Months and for the Year.   Part I.— January, July,
     and the Year. By Alexander Buchan, M.A., Secretary to
      the Scottish Meteorological Society.
     The three charts which were exhibited, showing, by isobarometric
lines, the mean atmospheric pressure over the globe, during January,
July,      and the year, were constructed                   from     observations      made at
358 places thus distributed over the                      earth, — 167 in Europe         ;       51   in
Asia; 22 in Africa and adjoining islands ; 35 in South America,
West Indian Islands, and Atlantic ; 63 in North America ; and 20
in Australasia and Antarctic Ocean.    Of the European stations,
12 are     in Scotland, 14 in England,               27   in Austria,      12    in Italy, 10 in
France,      10   in the Netherlands,           9   in Norway, and          57   in the Russian
empire, &c.          The list might have been largely increased                              ;   thus
a larger        number might have been given from the 80 Scottish
stations    ;   but the   1   2   given were judged sufficient                to represent the
mean atmospheric              pressure of this country.
     In   the British     islands     the means were uniformly taken for the
ten years from 1857 to 1866, in order that they might be strictly
comparable        with each other          ;   and the means of several European
stations were calculated             for the same year.              In    the United States
of America the means were uniform for the six years from 1854 to
1859.       In selecting the          stations, respect was had to the obtaining
of a      good mean, — that          is,   observations        for   a   sufficient   number of
years to show, as nearly as possible, the true mean.                             For example,
at Bombay, from 1847 to 1860, the lowest                                 mean for     July        was
29-598 inches in 1851, and the                     highest 29-673 in 1853.             This re
gularity in the pressure of the same month, from year to year,                                    is   a
feature common to all tropical countries and hence, in such places,
                                                           ;
a    few years were accepted as                a   good mean.            On the other hand,

                                                                                   R

304                   Proceedings of the Royal Society
since the mean pressure             at Reykjavik,          Iceland, during January
1867,   was     29-913 inches;         during February, 29-359 inches; and
during March, 30-037 inches,               it is evident that a good many years
are required       to represent the mean of the month at Reykjavik.
Hence,     a    very     subordinate      position,     if    any     at   all, has       been
given to observations            from    such    places, unless         they embraced a
considerable number of years.                  The following are a few of the
places, with the number of years, for which the means are given : —

rona, 73   ;  Bologna, 45      ;  Milan, 25 ; Turin, 74 ; most of the Austrian
stations,    14 to 18, &c.
    Tables were prepared ruled with columns for the insertion of the
following information : — 1. The place and country ; 2. The source
or authority from whence             the observations         were obtained         ;  3.  The
number of years of the means ; 4. These years specified ; 5. The
hours of observation; 6. The latitude; 7. The longitude; 8. The
height above the sea in English feet; 9 to 21. The simple arith
metic means for each month and for the year.
    For reducing to sea- level a table         was prepared from the           formula and
Table   XVI.      given in Guyot's Meteorological and Physical Tables,
D,   p. 89.      This table, calculated for each 5" F. of the tempera
ture of the air — from 40" to 90° — was used in all cases where the
 height did not exceed 800 feet.                For higher situations, the reduc
 tion was made by means of Dippe's method, as detailed in Guyot's
 tables, D, p. 60.        With the correction for height was included the
 correction for daily range.
    For many means          I have   been indebted to the labours and                 writings
 of Buys Ballot, Carl Jelinek, Dove, Quetelet, James, and Kuppfer,
 and particularly to Secchi's admirable abstracts, which have appeared
 from time to time in the " Bulletino Metereologico."
    The means,        so reduced, were then entered on charts                  of the globe
 drawn    on Mercator's Projection,              from which         isobarometric         lines
 were drawn for every tenth            of   an   English inch in the difference of

  the pressure.        The lines of 30 inches and upwards were coloured
  red,   and the lines representing        pressures less than 30 inches were
  coloured blue.        Thus, the portions of the earth's surface where the
 pressure was above or below the average (30 inches) could be seen
 at once.
     Mean Atmospheric Pressure         for July. — The    lowest pressures occur
 over the       land and the highest over the ocean             ;  or, the lowest
 pressures occur in the north           hemisphere     and the highest in the
 south hemisphere.          The greatest extent of high pressure extends
 quite round the globe from a little south of the equator to 40° lat.
 south.       In  the   South Atlantic,     in lat.  20°,   this rises to 30-348
 inches    ;  in the North Atlantic there is      a corresponding     area of high
 pressure rising at lat. 35° to       full 30-348 inches    ; and this region    of
 high pressure extends over the south-west of Europe and the south
 east   of the United States.        There is also   a region   of high pressure
 in the North Pacific, but        it only amounts to about 30-l inches.
    The greatest extent of low pressure occurs in Asia, amounting in
 the central regions of the Continent only to 29-5 inches. Pressures
 are also    low in the interior of North America, and round the north
 and the south poles.
    Mean Atmospheric Pressure for January. — In January the highest
 pressures are over the land and the lowest over the ocean ; or, the
 highest are in the north hemisphere              and the lowest in the south
 hemisphere.         Thus, taken in     a general sense, the      mean pressures
of  July     and January are reversed.
    The region of highest pressure occurs in the interior of Asia,
where it amounts to 30-4 inches, being thus nearly one inch greater
in winter than in summer.             The area of high barometer (above 30
inches) is continued westward through Europe south of the North
Sea and the Baltic ; the north of Africa ; the North Atlantic, be
tween 15° and 45° lat.       ; North America, except the north and north
west   ;  the West India Islands ; and the North Pacific, as far west
probably as 150° long.         W.     The effect of the Mediterranean and
adjoining      seas,  which are at this      season  warmer than the land, in
lowering the mean winter pressure, and thus breaking the con
tinuity of the isobarometrio         30"2 inches, and    preventing its exten
sion from the Pacific to the north           of the Lena, in Siberia, is very
striking.       All  the charts show similar disturbances         of the lines of

306               Proceedings     of the Royal     Society
equal pressure over the same region.         There   are two other regions,
though of comparatively        small extent,    where the mean pressure
exceeds 30 inches, — one in South Atlantic, and the other between
South America and Australia.
     There occurs in the North Atlantic      an   extensive   diminution of
 pressure, which deepens northwards          till the greatest depression
 (29-5 inches) is reached in Iceland.*         It is this low pressure over
 the North Atlantic, together with the high pressures in North
 America,    in the Atlantic south of lat.    40°, and in   Asia, which fur
 nishes the key to the winter climates of North America and Europe.
 Another and equally remarkable depression occurs in the North
 Pacific, having its course of greatest depression (29-6 inches) in the
 ocean between Kamschatka and Sitka in the north-west of America.
 The pressure is also under the average in the south of Africa           and
 in South America.
     The equatorial depression stretches quite across the globe in an
 irregular belt, which attains its greatest breadth in Africa and its
 least in the Pacific.      In  crossing   the Indian     Ocean it does not
 lie parallel to the equator, but slants from Tamatave in Madagascar
 18° lat. S. to the coast of Sumatra, in 5° lat. S.             It is in this
 trough    that nearly   all the tropical storms of the Indian Ocean
  have their origin.
     Mean Atmospheric Pressure     for   the Year.  — There    are two broad
  belts of high pressure passing completely round the globe, — the        one
  north, the other south of the equator, — enclosing between them         the
  low pressure of the tropics,     through    the centre of which runs       a
  narrow belt of still lower pressure, towards which the trade winds
  blow.    The southern belt of high pressure lies nearly parallel to
  the equator, and is generally of uniform breadth throughout.            But
  the belt north of the equator has a very irregular outline and great
  differences in its breadth and in its inclination to the equator, —
  these irregularities being due to the unequal         distribution of land
  and water in the northern hemisphere.
      Considered  in  a broad sense, there are    only two regions of low
   pressure, one round each pole, bounded by or contained within the
  belts of high pressure just referred to. The most remarkable of these
     * The diminution  of pressure in this region is even greater than this in
   February.

is the region of low pressure round the south pole, which probably
is subject to little variation throughout the year.     The depression in
the neighbourhood of the north pole is divided into distinct centres,
at each of which a diminution of pressure still further below the
average pressure prevails.       These are the north part of the Atlantic
and the north part of the Pacific oceans.        There is also    a smaller
area   of low pressure in Hindustan, caused altogether by the low
summer pressure of that region during the south-west monsoon. The
centre of Asia is also a little below the average, owing to the very
low summer pressure.
    These differences in the pressure arise from the unequal distribu
 tion either of the temperature or of the moisture of the atmosphere-
 Of  these, considered as   disturbing agents, by far the most important
 is the moisture,  — thus giving to this element   a paramount     claim on
 our regard in studying winds, storms, and other atmospheric changes.
    The relations of the barometric pressure to the prevailing winds,
 the varying temperature, and the rainfall in different parts of the
 world, were pointed out.       Isobarometric and isothermal charts, —
 (1.) Of Europe and Western Asia, from the 18th to the 26th of
 December 1866 ; and (2.) Of Europe, from the 19th July to the 1st
 of August 1867, were exhibited      ; and it was shown that the remark
 able deviations from the mean pressure of these months which then
  prevailed  were accompanied       with  equally  remarkable    deviations
 from the mean temperature of the same months.
  2. On the     History of the Sun's Distance Determinations ;
     and on Scriptural and Scientific Probabilities. By William
     Petrie, Esq. Communicated by Professor C. Piazzi Smyth,
     March 16, 1868.
     This paper was accompanied by two diagrams, one of them repre
  senting more particularly the features attending      on space, and the
  probable errors of several modern determinations therein ; and the
  other representing the chronological order of the events, or progress
  made by man from the earliest times, down to the present, in ascer
  taining that most important of all questions in astronomy and gene
  ral physics, viz., the true mean distance of the earth from the sun.
     At the dawn of human science, properly         so called, or  of efforts

in schools and societies to attain to                      a knowledge     of nature by obser
vation and measure, and when the Greeks                                sowed the first seeds of
those methods which have since developed                                   into the giant tree of
modern science — that                    is,   in the ages of 600 b.c. or 500 b.c. —their
greatest           philosopher concluded               the sun         to be hardly more than
10 or 12       miles from the surface of the earth.                          But they increased
that estimate,               as    their science       advanced,           to 14,000 miles in 50
years   ;    and        to   5     millions of miles in 200 years more.                         At that
point, however, knowledge remained stationary for 1800 years, and
continued perfectly satisfied with the truth of that result, — until
Kepler showed, in 1620 a.d., that the distance was more nearly
26 millions of miles and La Caille, in 1750 a.d., that
                                    ;                  was nearly                  it
78 millions of miles; and the transit                          of Venus, in 1769, that           it   was
95    millions of miles.
     This last determination was, however, over the truth, and sub
sequent measures have been reducing the quantity again                                      ;    but at
the same time oscillating, sometimes on one side and sometimes on
the other, of           a    mean quantity nearly 92 millions of miles in length.
     Now this quantity — which modern science seems to                             be approach
ing only, but has not yet definitely arrived at, or settled for society,
and     is   not    likely to       be able to do so     until the next good transit of
Venus, in 1882 a.d. —                   is   the quantity marked off for the sun's dis
tance in the Great Pyramid of Jeezeh, by the ancient architect or
designer thereof, and in so early                      a   period      of the world     as to     have
been 1600 years before the very embryotic commencement of Greek,
or any other known human, science                          ;   or at   a   time when   it   was per
fectly impossible for any man then living, to have had any means
at all sufficient to solve the problem even approximately                              !
     How, then,          was      it   solved? and whence came that marvellously
accurate physical knowledge,                        perfect,    apparently, at its very out
set, and      in    a   building which has lived through all historic times of
all nations and peoples, but never been known to possess those
scientific details before, not even by the Egyptians themselves                                   ?
     This great question much occupies Mr Petrie, after having de
tailed clearly          a    large quantity of numerical and other                     particulars
connected with the establishment of all the positive and material
facts    of the         case   ;   and his solution leads him ultimately to some
interesting correlations with certain portions of Scripture exegesis.

3.    Physical Proof that the Geometric Mean of any Number
       of Quantities is less than the Arithmetic Mean. By
       Professor Tait.
     If         of equal masses of the same material be given, at
          a number
different temperatures, and enclosed in an envelope impervious to
heat, they will finally assume a common temperature ; which is the
arithmetic mean of the initial temperatures, if the material be one
whose specific heat does not vary with temperature.
     But they may         be   brought to      a common    temperature by means of
reversible thermodynamic engines                    employed   to obtain the utmost
amount of work from the                   initial unequal distribution.
                                                       This ques
tion was first investigated by Thomson (Phil. Mag. 1853, " On the
Restoration of Energy from an unequally heated Space "), and the
application of his method to the present problem shows that the
final common           temperature          of the masses, when      as much work as
possible has been obtained                  from them, is the geometric mean of
the    initial temperatures           ;   but this investigation introduces the con
dition that the temperatures                  must be measured from the absolute
zero.
      Obviously the whole energy restored is proportional to the ex
cess      of the arithmetic over the geometric mean.
      Far more complex analytical theorems may easily                            be proved
by means         of the above process;              for instance,    if   tlt

       4. On the Dissipation of Energy.                     By Professor Tait.
   The paper contains some curious applications of the principle of
dissipation to the conduction of heat, the connection of heat and
electricity, thermo-electric currents, the electric convection of heat,
 &c.       But in this abstract           we confine   ourselves    to one very simple
 case      of the conduction of heat,           as the hypothesis    on which         it      is   in
 vestigated      is   fundamentally assumed in all the other applications.

 310                Proceedings of the Royal Society
    If an   infinite plate    be kept    permanently heated in layers, each of
 equal   temperature        throughout — the temperature                rising gradually
 from one side to the other — the hypothesis is made that the tem
 peratures of any three contiguous layers (of equal thickness) so
 adjust themselves that the least possible energy can be restored
 from the system of three.            From this it immediately follows that
 if xl be the thickness of the plate, t0 and <, the (absolute) tempera
 tures  of its sides   ;  and   if the specific heat be the same for all tem
 peratures between       t0  and t, : the temperature            t at a distance x from
 the side at    t0 will be

                                             oc      let.
    This must be the same throughout the plate, because there is
equilibrium of temperature, and therefore

    The only published experiments,               so far    as  I am   aware, by which
this result can      be tested, are the         very valuable series by Forbes
(Trans. Roy. Soc., Edin. 1864), which are, unfortunately, confined
to iron. They agree uncommonly well with the above theoretical
result, as the following short table shows                : —

    No account has, in this abstract, been taken of the alteration of

 two or three numbers          in Forbes' table are (as he points out) pro
bably much less accurate than those which follow them, on account
of the temperature at which they were obtained,               which was but
little above that of the atmosphere.

2.    On the Figures        of Equilibrium of Liquid Films.            By Sir
                                David Brewster.
     This paper is    a  continuation of that read on 4th February 1867,
and already published in the Transactions.               Instead, however, of
the liquid films being formed within systems of wires, hollow glass
vessels are here employed.            By using   a single or double cone of
glass open at both ends, and inserting within         it small bubbles blown
from a      quill or tube with a small aperture, regular binary, ternary,
or quaternary systems of films are produced.                Thus, by first ob
taining     a plane   film within the conical vessel, and then inserting
upon it four small bubbles, a system is produced consisting of four
hollow films, of curious curvature, united to one another respectively
by vertical plane surfaces, and connected in their centres by a com
mon      plane film, which, by adopting certain precautions, may, with
a   little care, be made to assume either a horizontal or a vertical
     vol. vi.                                                      2 s

312                 Proceedings     of the Royal    Society
position.     This system may aptly        be compared    to that produced
within the wire cube, and previously described. The analogy of
the two systems may be further carried out by inserting one or
more small bubbles in the centre of the system, which           will, accord
ing to the form of the cone employed, assume a form approaching
to that of a cube, and therefore analogous to the system shown in
figs. 4 and 5 of Plate xxxiv.,         or to that of a pyramid (perfect or
truncated), and therefore corresponding         to the systems in 10 and
 11  of the  same plate.
    The paper contains also some experiments on the motions of films
 when brought in contact with surfaces of glass under certain con
 ditions.    Thus,   if a film  bo formed   on the mouth of a wine-glass
by dipping it in the solution, and be then covered over by a watch-
glass of more or less convexity, so long as no contact is established
 between the      film and the watch-glass       no change will take place.
 But let the wine-glass      be inverted so as to  bring the film into  a ver
 tical position (the watch-glass being meantime kept firmly in posi
 tion by the thumb), the film will now attach itself to the watch-
 glass at its lowest margin,        and  will run up its inner surface, de
 scribing thereon a series of curious curves. The upper part of the
 film will at the same time retreat down the inner surface of the
 wine-glass,   and form a hollow segment of a sphere.
    The   cause  of the phenomenon is the existence of a drop of the
 solution which enters the wine-glass in the operation of dipping, and
 remains at its bottom, and which, when the glass is inverted, runs
 down as far as its margin,         and there comes in contact with the
 margin of the film.         A   connection is thus produced between the
 film and the watch-glass, which originates at a single point, but
 quickly extends in the manner mentioned.              A variety of further
 experiments may be made on the film thus produced, several of
 which    are described    in the paper.
     The last part of the paper consists of       an  account of some mis
 cellaneous     experiments      chiefly on the tenacity of films when
 brought in contact with one another, or with surfaces of fluid, and
 then drawn apart, and the forms of the curves which in such cir
 cumstances they assume.

 1.  Notice of Works designed by Sir Charles Hartley, C.E.
    for the Improvement of the Danube. By David Stevenson,
    Civil Engineer.
    Having received from Sir Charles Hartley an interesting record
of the works executed for the improvement of the Danube, to be
presented to one of the    Public Libraries in Edinburgh,     I think   its
fittest destination is the Royal Society  ; and, on behalf of Sir Charles
 Hartley,  I have to present the volumes on the table for the Society's
 acceptance.
    It may not be uninteresting,      in presenting these books, to    de
 scribe, in a very few sentences,   the work that has been executed
 for the improvement of the Danube, and the results that have been
 obtained.
    In  1856 the  " European Commission of the Danube "           was  ap
 pointed under the Treaty of Paris, and consisted of seven delegates,
 representing England, Austria, France, Prussia, Russia, Sardinia,
 and Turkey, and its object was to improve the bar of the river, and
 open the navigation to the traffic      of all nations.   The Danube,
after flowing over a course of 1700 miles,        and draining 300,000

314                Proceedings of the Royal Society
square miles of country, enters the Black Sea by three separate
mouths    — the northern called the Kilia, the central the Sulina, and
the southern the St George's mouth.             The first duty of the Com
mission, with the advice of Sir Charles Hartley, who was appointed
their engineer, was to select one of the three mouths              for improve
ment, which was by no means an easy task, as each of them pre
sented advantages peculiar to itself, and after much              consideration
the Sulina or central channel was selected, and although consider
able difference of opinion existed as to the propriety of the choice
the result has shown that the course adopted was judicious.
   What gives professional interest to works on the Danube is their
object  — the improvement of        a bar harbour,    in all cases a trouble
some engineering problem, due probably, in some measure at least,
to the varying circumstances        which the engineer has to consider in
dealing with the formation and improvement of bars. In this
country, for example, we find bar harbours at the Tyne, the
Wear, and other similar localities, caused by the storms on our
coasts, which, by the action of the waves on the bottom, throw up
sand and shingle, and but for the scour produced            by other agents
a continuous line of beach would soon be formed across the mouths
of our tidal rivers and inlets.      But this action of the    sea   is counter
acted by the scouring flow       of the tidal and fresh-water currents,
which, in spite of the waves, tend to keep open a deep channel
through the beach. In this way the antagonistic action of the
waves of the sea on the one hand, and the currents             of the estuary
or river on the      other,   produce the well-known        feature    of a sub
merged beach or sand-bank extending across our inlets, and having
a channel through them        of more or less depth, according to cir
cumstances,     which channel is termed " the bar."           The conditions
under which such       accumulations      are formed    are as      I have  else
where stated : — *
   1s<,  A bottom composed of materials easily moved            ;
    2d, Water of depth so limited       as to  admit of the waves acting
on the bottom     ; and
    3d, Such exposure      as  shall allow of waves being generated of
 sufficient size to operate on the submerged materials.
    But in such places   as the   Firth of Forth, for example, before the

first two of these necessary conditions occur, viz., sufficient shal
low water and presence of sand, the sea, owing to the configuration
of the coast, is so landlocked            that waves of sufficient               size to pro
duce the third condition cannot               be generated,               and hence in the
Forth there is the phenomenon of               a    barless river.
      At   the Danube,      a large      river, discharging in ordinary flood no
less than twenty         millions of cubic feet of water per minute, enters
a tideless sea,       and we have a totally different class of phenomena
to deal with.         The river brings down an amount of detritus which
has been ascertained by Sir Charles Hartley to be equal to 27 cubic
inches per cubic yard, and to be equal to no less, in cases of high
flood, than 600,000 cubic yards of solid deposit in 24 hours.                                 Like
the Mississippi and the Nile, the Danube owes its extensive                                   delta
to the gradual accretion of this sedimentary deposit, and the bar at
its mouth is due          to the same     action.        It   therefore       differs entirely
from the bars in this country, as is well exemplified                               in the fact
that, whereas in our harbours the bars are always deepest when the
sea is calm and the rivers are            in flood, and therefore most efficient
as scouring      agents, at the Danube the bar                 is,   on   the contrary,         in
variably      shallmoest    when the river          is   in flood,        because   it   is   then
charged with      alarger amount of deposit.
      Another feature of difference in the treatment of such                         a   case as
the Danube            to be found        in the circumstance              that there            no
                                                                                          it is
                 is
reversal of the current         due to tidal influence,               and therefore               is
unnecessary, in fixing the direction of the piers, or indeed in de
signing any of the works, to provide for the admission of tidal
water to act as scour on its return to the ocean, provision which
                      a                                                   a
always demands special attention              in designing            tidal works        on    our
coasts.
      The works executed at the Sulina mouth consist of                        a    north pier
4G40       feet in length,     and   a   s0uth pier 3000 feet in length, both
built of pierres perdues surmounted by    timber staging, with an
                                                         a
entrance between of 600 feet, and the slightness of their structure
indicates the modified character             of the waves to which they                        are
exposed.
      The works, which       are understood to have cost about £100,000,
are  highly creditable to the talent and energy of Sir Charles Hart-
loy, and have now been completed for five years, aud their effect

316               Proceedings      of   the Royal Society
has been most satisfactory,      as proved by the      fact, that previous to
their construction the depth           on the bar never exceeded 11 feet
and frequently fell to 8 feet       ;  whereas, according to the last ac
counts   from  Sir Charles Hartley, the depth for the last five          years
has never been less than 15 feet, and has often been as much as
17| feet.
   It  is obvious, however, that        as the  Danube must continue         to
bring down an enormous mass of detritus,           so,  in course of time  the
works which have proved           so successful     must be extended — an
event which has been       fully anticipated by its projectors,         and in
this respect  we  find an interesting difference        between    such works
as the    Danube piers and the harbour works of this country, for
here the object being to prevent the waves from acting on the bot
tom, the engineer extends         his works out into        a depth   of water
where there is   little or no disturbance of the bottom, and if this is
once secured he may calculate on the increased              depth of water re
maining permanent,       whereas,      at the Danube the       piers must    be
projected to keep pace with the gradually increasing delta at the
river's mouth.

    Number of the        "  Proceedings" of the Koyal Society of
    Edinburgh. By Prof. Piazzi Smyth, April 20, 1868.
   On the 10th of March last         I had  the honour of receiving, in the
usual course of publication,          a copy  of the 75th Number of our
Society's Proceedings.
   Within that Number's few pages, there are no less than two
distinct essays, mainly, if not entirely, on " the Great Pyramid,
"and     my views respecting   it."
   Both these essays, though by able and ingenious men, are yet
unfortunately based to such an extent on needlessly imperfect data,
that the superintending Secretary might have justifiably returned
the MSS. to their respective eminent authors, with suggestions for
 improvement    in the improvable particulars, before publishing them
 under the auspices, and at the expense of the Society.
   This course, however,     was not followed ; and the words of friendly
 advice,  which   might before have been offered in private, require

been    distributed       amongst           the    members,    but one copy            having
reached the       " Medical Times" of London,                 was commented on thus
definitively in its impression               of March 28, 1868 : —
              "   SIR J. Y. SIMPSON ON THE PYRAMIDS.
     " It is characteristic of the brilliant and diversified gifts of the
" great Northern Professor, that he should have taken in hand the
" demolition of a curious notion about the Great Pyramid of Egypt,
" which has been promulgated by Professor Piazzi Smyth, and has
" found favour with many religious persons. That notion is, that
" the Pyramid was constructed under Divine guidance, to show to
" all time a correct standard of
                                 weight and measure, and that the
" coffer contained in the central chamber is an
                                                inspired measure of
"
  capacity, and the Base of the Pyramid an inspired measure of
" length, having a definite relation to the earth's             Sir

" James
           Simpson shows, in a paper read before the Royal Society

  of Edinburgh, that the Pyramid has all the characters of the
"

my name is printed no less than 85 times; and there are not fewer
than 70      cases     of extracts           in inverted commas, from some one or
another of my several Pyramid writings during four years past,

  Such                  against one individual, was probably never
            a masked battery
before opened in the pages of a journal intended for the advance
ment of science alone              ;   and yet,   if its   fire had been directed against
actual and positive errors, not only might the previous masking of
the battery under another title have been condoned, but great praise
and extensive thanks would have been due to its engineer — so all-
important in the present day of earnest prosecutions of science is                               it,
that the pathways of knowledge should be cleared of every fault,
slip, or mistake of each of its previous cultivators. After having,
however,   carefully read the twenty-four accusatory pages,    am                         I
sorry to say, that the general effect on my mind,   not admiration           is
at the clear proofs of error afforded, so much as astonishment at the
ingenious and intricate manner                    in which an opposite meaning                   is
given to the majority of those very numerous extracts just alluded
to, than what     I        had intended them to convey.
  This fact may imply, that my style of writing                         was imperfect     ;   and
perhaps     it   was   ;   seeing that, like most scientific authors,               I   wrote for
those only who were anxious to understand me.                           Sad loss of time too
would   it   be, and needless         extension of treatises, to attempt anything
further;     for we        see    elsewhere, that after the best lawyers of the
land have striven to make the wording of some Act of Parliament                                  as
exact and stringent as possible,                    common          report    tells that other
clever men, but of rather perverse inclinations, very soon contrive
to find out how to drive       "coach and four horses" through
                                             a
that    very,      and      the    self-same,      expensive         piece        of parchment.
And    if   those clever          men are further allowed               to cut up the one
Act of Parliament they                 are   attacking, into quotations of any num
ber of words, from one, to two, three and upwards, and distribute
them confusingly among similar shreds of certain abrogated                                 Acts,
and other still more extraneous matter also, — you may easily ima
gine what an erroneous view of the existing law of the land could
easily be prepared but also how totally unusual such
                             ;                            method                      a

 would be considered        among      scientific   men      in   the     cause      of
  science.
     Yet something closely approaching the above has been enacted in
 the second Proceedings' treatise ; where little extracts of my last
 and completest book, are mixed up, generally without distinction or
 reference,   with   portions of my earliest,     crudest,     and    now super
 seded books and papers, on the same subject           ;   and with bits of the
 late  Mr Taylor's   book, which bits    I never   accepted at all.
     To prove each and every one of the almost innumerable                 cases    of
altered    meaning thus     produced,    would require         more time than
either the Society is likely to grant, or      I have     to spare  ;  but    I will
attempt to separate and exhibit a few, as samples of the rest                 ;   and
also, point out whatever of new and important matter for our know
ledge    of the Great Pyramid, the essay appears in my judgment to
possess.
                           LITERARY POINTS.
                                      ao
    Among      more  purely literary matters,       I    would   mention        first,
and with much commendation,            the author's reminder at p. 260,
of both Cassini (in a book published in Amsterdam in 1723), and
Callet (in Paris in 1795), having proposed " that the Polar axis of
the earth should be taken as the standard of measure."
    I was not   previously aware of their having so done ; and have
not even yet been able to obtain a sight of Cassini's book.* But a
friend in London, who has kindly searched for it at the British
Museum, informs me that the statement              is not quite exact, — for
Cassini does not allude to the Polar axis or semi-axis for the pur
pose,   but merely to   a general semi-diameter       of the earth      ;  and he
appears to have shared in the scientific uncertainties of most or all
men of the period, as to whether the earth              is flattened      or elon
gated at the Poles.
    The case is interesting, therefore,     as  setting limits to the date
at which modern science could have begun to single out the                   Polar
axis   as  a  unique length in the earth and appropriate               to form a

in Edinburgh, my venerable and learned friend Dr Daun has found it
amongst his collection of valuable French mathematical works ; and having
kindly lent it to me, I can verify the account which follows.

322                       Proceedings      of     the   Royal Society
reference for linear measure. But it does not touch the completely
independent question in the latter-day theory of the ancient Great
Pyramid,        as to whether        such a standard was known to the primeval
designer of that monument 4000 years ago.
     All   the parties mentioned do, indeed, propose to divide o quantity
ohtainable from the earth, into ten million                       parts; but the rod or
cubit developed in that manner was not                      still further proposed             to be
subdivided by either Cassini or Callet, in the very peculiar manner
now        attributed      to the architect            of the Great Pyramid           :   and his
method,       if it   can be proved, must have had a character, origin, and
priority entirely its own.
     Next, Sir,       I   have to confess, that when speaking                  of that ten-
millionth part of the earth's Polar radius, as realised for its length
only, by a cubit rod of 25 inches ±1, — when speaking of it in
that sense and in some stray sentence, in some one or another of my
books,      I know not        which, nor by what accident'the              error occurred,
— the word extraordinary was printed instead of extraordinarily!
   At least so I gather, because the author of the paper, at his
p. 260, drags up the word extraordinary, prints it conspicuously in
italics, puts a sic in a parenthesis after                 it,   and publishes            that de
nunciation of his, of what he would                       indicate   as the      abominable
vulgarity in        me, viz., of saying that something was
                                                                           " extraordinary
                    " and he
convenient      ;             publishes the shocking phrase                 as   a    necessary
part of his treatise on          a   scientific    subject.
     Mr Chairman, and gentlemen, — acknowledge before you all, that

seem, both detected the error, and made                     a    scare-crow      of           before
the public.           An error light     as   air perhaps, but admirably adapted
on that very account to act as                a   wind-vane   ;    and thereby,           even to
react on the acute individual, so as to show the world whether the
current of his thoughts was setting purely towards                         the promotion
of science for its own sake, when he was writing the remarkable
essay now printed in the Society's Proceedings.
     As    to myself,     I   should, of course, like amazingly to correct this
sad error      in my books, wherever              it   exists; but unhappily, no refer

come upon a passage in the 3rd volume (p. 135) of my last book,
" Life and Work at the Great Pyramid," identical almost word for
word with the passage accused, except in this, that                   it has not the

    For the more complete understanding of my version of the ori

of its paragraph in its own book — I have inserted, in parenthesis, the

words " as a linear standard                                     because a main pur
port   of the whole is to show, that the modern French metre, being
nearly 39 inches in length, is too long ; and the ancient Egyptian
cubit, only 20-7 inches in length, too short ; but the Great Pyramid
cubit, being 25 inches long, is most appropriate and handy to use
as a measuring rod.                I
                           And have called attention above by italics to
the words
               " either to the length of," which are found in my book,
and assist the above intended meaning, but are omitted in the
 condemnatory       Proceedings'     edition.

    Lastly,   I would remark under           the literary heading,        that, in the
general description given by the Proceedings'                  author of the present
exterior of the Great Pyramid,             I am    specially quoted for the words

324               Proceedings of the Royal Society
" now it is so injured as to be, in the eyes of some passing travellers
" little better than a heap of stones."       And the essay then pro
ceeds, in the spirit of that statement,   utterly to confound the true
figure and peculiar structure of the Great Pyramid, with sundry
mere    rounded    heaps of loose or soft material,   sometimes having
rude chambers inside them, and sometimes not, in various parts of
the world.
   It may be quite true, that in one portion of my largest book,
where    I was  anxious to let every side of the question       appear in
order, the above few quoted words are to be found.         But are there
not also pages, and pages, and pages giving much         broader   records
of the other side of the question   as well; giving my own experience,
for instance,    through months of patient observation, on the me
chanical excellence and conscientious      performance    of the masonry
courses,   both   composing the Great Pyramid's        present faces and
general body, and contributing towards one of its most important
symbolizations    ?
   How many times, too, have        I  not had exhibited before      large
public meetings, both in Edinburgh and various cities of Scotland,
amongst     other   of my own    photographs    of the Great Pyramid,
several which were specially adapted to display that astonishing
regularity which extends, with     a purpose,   throughout each of the
gigantic courses of squared, cemented, horizontal, hard masonry?
And yet all this accumulated evidence of various kinds, in favour
of an ancient excellence, is to be annihilated, — for what? For
half a dozen words attributed to, merely "some passing travellers;"
and the accounts of passing     travellers at the Great Pyramid, are
again and again shown, in the same book, to be almost always           un
trustworthy and liable to gross mistake.
   Hence, it is quite clear that the damaging extract to the Great
Pyramid,     picked   out of my   book  and printed as above, does not
exhibit the general sense and total conclusion of my whole book
on the particular point concerned, but rather the very opposite.
And the superabundant literary acumen which induced              a gentle
man    to make     so  much  use of the word extraordinary instead       of
extraordinarily in a minor and rather problematical case, has failed
him totally on a grander occasion.

    Nor do     I see  any prospect of that gentleman ever understanding
the mode of construction of that noblest work of the world 4000
years ago, viz., the Great Pyramid          ;  and how vastly     it differs from
all the moats, tumuli, howes and barrows which he will insist on
comparing it to, and confusing it with,* until he has himself both
ascended and descended the ancient monument,                  climbing up each
of the steep steps of its colossal masonry courses (without any
assistance from Arabs or other attendants),              and measuring every
such step carefully, from bottom to top of the pyramid, and top to
bottom    ;  and    comparing such collections of measures,              made on
every face, and every arris line of the structure.
   A long      and painful process, and perhaps          a little dangerous; —
but one whose teaching cannot be ignored by any unwilling
scholar,    so  easily   as the contents  of  a printed book.
   * As   to the total diversity in quality of construction between the Great
Pyramid of Egypt, and the little more than mounds of mud and pebble stones
forming the barrows of Ireland, frequent testimonies are borne in the volumes
of Colonel Howard Vyse— volumes known to the Proceeding!' author, but
seldom quoted by him, when they tend to elevate one's conceptions of the Great
Pyramid.       As an example of the very important character of some of these
omitted witnesses to exceeding perfection of work in one of tho earliest, if
not the very earliest, of stone buildings now existing, or ever existing, upon
the earth ; and which has stood there through all the human historic period, —
an august witness of what took place under the sun in primeval ages of
which we have no other contemporary record, I insert the following from
pp. 261 and 262 of the first volume of Colonel Howard Vyse's
                                                                     " Pyramids of
Gizeh."      The Colonel is speaking of the two casing stones which he dis
covered by excavating down, through the rubbish accumulated in modern
times, to the middle of the north side of the base of the Great Pyramid ;
and says of them —
   " They were quite perfect, had been hewn into the required angle before
" they were built in, and had then been polished down to one uniform sur-
" face ; the joints were scarcely perceptible, and not wider than the thickness
" of silver paper ; and such is the tenacity of the cement with which they
" are held together, that a fragment of one, that has been destroyed,
" remained firmly fixed in its original alignement, notwithstanding the lapse
" of time and the violence to which it had been exposed. The pavement
 " beyond the lino of the building was well laid, and beautifully finished ; but
 " beneath the edifice it was worked with even greater exactness, and to the
 " most
         perfect level, in order, probably, to obtain a lasting foundation for the
 " magnificent structure to be built upon it. I consider that tho workman-
 " ship
         displayed in the King's Chamber, in this pavement, and in the casing
 " stones, is
                perfectly unrivalled ; and there is no reason to doubt that the
 "
   whole exterior of this vast structure was covered with the same excellent
 "
   masonry."

                                           The Coffer.
  What has now been mentioned, is                    a    prevailing characteristic of        the
literary parts of this second Proceedings' paper                      ;   as readers,   who   can
spare the time,      will find on tracing up the quotations to the original
contexts in my books.   More quickly provable matters, however,
are alluded to under the headings dealing more particularly with
mensuration affairs.           Therein, too, although the author begins by
saying (p. 247), that he approves of the Society having conferred
the honour of their Keith Medal upon me, for my measures at the
Great Pyramid, — yet within          of pages after that, he attacks
                                               a couple
those measures bitterly, especially as touching the coffer in the
King's Chamber          ;   and he would make them out to be disgraceful,
rather than creditable.               For whereas           I   had cited, as he implies,
before    going to Egypt,                 twenty-five different observers, — whose
measures of the coffer differed                    irreconcilably, and by monstrous
differences,    — yet       when     I,    a    twenty-sixth        observer,     measured     it,
my     observations         also   differed        from     every    other      person's,   were
apparently no better than any of them, and made                              a   previous con
fusion only worse confounded.
  Now my measures did indeed differ from those of every preced
ing traveller, in this, — that they were perhaps fifty times more
numerous.    And, by multiplying them over every part of the
coffer, —I     was enabled both to show what were the limits of varia
tion in the structure itself; — and also, to prove that all those older
recorded measures which differed from certain mean quantities by                               a
whole inch, or even half-an-inch (and some of them varied from the
same in any number of inches from two, four, and upwards to so
many     as   forty), were sheer mistakes on the part of the observers                          :
some of whom,        it     should    be stated       in apology for them, lived far
back     in the 16th century, and                   had guessed the             lengths rather
than measured them            ;    not having any idea of the importance                       of
extreme accuracy, touching what appeared to them generally, —
merely as     a   burial sarcophagus or coffin.
                             Irregularities         of    the Coffer.

dimensions     being thus accomplished,      — I next    entered into an ex
amination of certain residual features, of the coffer.
   1.  The first of these consisted in modern breakages, lamentably
large, but sufficiently simple to inquire into.
   (They are shown in this model which is          -fa the  linear size of the
real coffer, also in the frontispiece to vol. i. of my " Life and
 " Work at the Great
                           Pyramid.")
    2. The   second    class was caused by traces of a ledge cut inside
the top of three sides, and all across the fourth side of the coffer.
   (In this    2nd model, the breakages       being restored, the ledge is
exhibited more clearly;        they are also shown in the frontispiece
plate  of vol. i. of above work.)
   Now this ledge has a little history connected with it.
   Trusting to Professor Greaves, the great French work on Egypt,
and other authorities,       I had unfortunately described         the coffer as
without any ledge, lefore        I  went to Egypt.         But on afterwards
seeing the coffer there, I found that it had traces of a ledge.               On
my return to this country,        I  discovered, in    a book  of thirty years
ago,*   a notice,  short and imperfect,     but still   a notice, to the same
ultimate effect.
   On finding these things,         I  both got that book added to the
College Library, — called much attention         to   it in my own Pyramid
book of last year    ;  and published my own observations           of the ledge
with numerous particulars, both in description and in measure,
down to hundredths of inches, in a manner, and with a complete
ness never before attempted by any one, so far as            I am    aware.
   After all this has been before the public for nearly              a year, the
Proceedings'    author republishes at page 252, — and as if elsewhere
ascertained — some of my own particulars ; and adds to them so much
of the defective notice in the old book just mentioned,             as to extin
guish   a very radical difference really existing between the ledge of
the coffer in the Great Pyramid, and the ledges on the sarcophagi in
all the other Pyramids of Jeezeh.            And which difference in form
produces this variation in effect.

    When      you put on the cover of one of these smaller pyramid
sarcophagi,     the combination of acute-angled grooves and falling
pins fixes and locks the lid, in a manner most suitable to the safe
preservation    of the contents of         a   burial sarcophagus or coffin.
   But when you put on, to a true model of the restored coffer of the
Great Pyramid, any sort of sarcophagus lid prepared suitably to
its rectangular grooves, — such lid has no fixing power, and can be
lifted up with the utmost            ease ;    or in   a manner      very unsuitable to
the usual duty of a pure coffin-lid.
    Moreover, such      a   lid seems most untoward to the coffer in its
place in the      King's    Chamber; because, while the doorway is of
such a height as only just to allow the coffer to pass through as a
lidless box, or in the state in which every known historian has
invariably described        it, — put on        a   lid, prepared in modern            times
according to the proportions of the lids of sarcophagi                                of that
period, and you can neither get the vessel into, or out of, the room                          ;
by an amount too of         5   or   6   inches     of solid granite, for that         is   the
space by which the doorway, more than 100 inches                             thick,   is   then
too low to admit the lidded or sarcophagised                      coffer.

sisted in certain small residual but original errors or defalcations
in its figure, from    a    pure geometric           form   ;    and these are generally
so slight, or are effected by curves of such long radius, as to have
escaped all my predecessors.
    Yet some gentlemen               at home, are not always                easy to please.

might present      a   notably different thickness to those who measure
to two places      of decimals           of an inch, — and then adds his own

when the     idea occurred    to me out     there,  the   unusual size     of
calipers that would have been      required,   by applying to the scanty
resources for civilized life existing in the Libyan desert.         But the
coffer sides were virtually so calipered,     by the measures      which    I
took both inside and outside, with such apparatus as        I had  with me   ;
and any one who is desirous       of ascertaining,    within small limits,
what the sides of the coffer would         actually caliper at the place
indicated,  has only to project my printed observations,        and see.
               CUBIC CONTENTS OF THE COFFER.
    My own chief object, however, was not       so much to get the    thick
ness of the coffer's sides at one special      point,  as to ascertain    the
whole cubical contents of the original vessel.
    Now those small residual features just mentioned, and which I, by
myself, have been chiefly instrumental in bringing to light, having
been used by the Proceedings' author out of my own pages, for the
purpose for calumniating the ancient coffer, and implying (p. 252)
that its cavity is " of a form utterly unmeasurable in a correct way
"                                     and pronouncing it to be (p. 254),
   by mere lineal measurement,"
" in simple truth, nothing more and nothing less than — an old and
" somewhat                 stone coffin," — a duty devolves       on me to
               misshapen
show, both within what limits        it can  be measured      in that lineal
way; and also, what remarkable         purposes some of those apparent
residual errors of figure, but really important adjustments of cubical
size, do subserve.
    We take the vessel therefore, restored from modern breakages             ;
fill up the ledge in the top of the sides, and then ascertain             the
cubical contents of the hollow, by multiplying         together   the mean
of all the observed internal lengths, breadths, and depths.            From
 hence we obtain 71,317 cubic      Pyramid inches;*       a quantity which
 is many thousands     of inches different from the contents         of any
known sarcophagus of the burial kind at the Pyramids.
    When future observers shall have visited the Great Pyramid, and
 measured the coffer with still more care than        I  have done, — their
 results will afford  a desirable   test as to my limits of error.       But
meanwhile the coffer itself may testify something, by having (when
   * Mean length = 7785 ; mean breadth = 26-70; and mean height            =
34-31 Pyramid inches.   See " Life and Work," vol. iii. p. 154.

its ledge is filled up, and only then) a certain inter-commensura-
bility of parts ; and which is not known to prevail in any Egyptian
sarcophagus,            or to be now, or ever to have been, a necessary prin
ciple amongst makers of mere coffins anywhere.
   The first of these commensurabilities — that within the limits              is,
of errors of measure, the inside contents of the vessel are just half
those of the outside (as per model shown at the meeting).
   And the second     that the cubical contents of the bottom
                                  is,                                                                                   are
similarly half those of the sides (as per model).
     But these distinct proportions would not have obtained within
many hundreds of cubic inches,                               if     the recently detected hollowing
of some of the sides of the coffer had not been performed of old.
So much pains do indeed seem to have been taken in that matter
at the primeval coffer, that we may be justified in adding beneath
our first quantity in the numerical table, half the observed con
tents of the outside of the coffer, = 71,160  and the sum of the                     ;*

of the sides:           from which my measures                  were scrupulously taken.
Indeed     I repel      that word imaginary, and fling it back to its author;
and declare that those traces of the original top of the sides were to
the best  of my testing and examination as unmistakably ancient,
finished, and precise as any part of the coffer whatever.
    I    have also been led              since then to perceive, that the frame
adapted to        fill up the ledge, seems to            be an independent                  confirma
tion of the sides' original height.                 It   is   so, at least,    within less than
three hundredths of an                 inch;* and that difference being introduced
into our first computation, gives us a fourth approach to the true
cubical contents of the coffer = 71,258.
    These four being combined, give 71,250 cubic Pyramid inches,                                  as
the      best     result of all         my   measurings,          true       probably,       for the
coffer     itself, to within            twenty cubic inches.                 And   I    venture    to
say this, notwithstanding that the author in the Proceedings attacks
me violently by means                   of some of the old and exploded twenty-
five observers          of former times, setting forth (at                    p. 250)       that one
of their results             differs   by 6000 cubic          inches, and another              by no
less    than 14,000 cubic inches, from mine.
    But Sir, is that to my, or to their, confusion                       ?
    If you      will examine the particulars, you will find that the 6000
inches of difference, arose from that party having made an absolute
error of 3 whole inches in the depth of the coffer- f While the
14,000 inches case rests on one Dr Whitman, who himself never
went inside the Great Pyramid, but depended on a friend.
    If   the author in            your Proceedings            will think        that Dr Whit
man could understand                   the coffer    better       without going near                  it,

 t  The faulty measure was that of the French Academicians in 1799, and
when reduced from the metre to British inches, = 37-285.
  Professor Greaves, in 1638, had previously stated the depth = 34-320

have published the particulars of my modes                                of measurement, the
nature of the apparatus                 employed,         the method         of comparing with
a   standard, the circumstances                  under which the observations were
made, and the actual numbers procured                          from         the measurings                and
remeasurings            arranged so as to test each other on various                               parts of

man's mind, as             of some weight or importance in     case where nexta
to nothing can be said on the opposite                          side,    I    can offer no more
to him either in explanation or defence of myself.
     But before the world,           I    must     still continue to maintain, that                          so
far   as both care and number               are concerned, no coffer measures have
yet appeared that can compare, on the usual principles for judging
measures amongst scientific men, with mine                           ;      that mine, therefore,
however much below                   ideal perfection,        have   a    practical claim to                re

attribute all the fault, and prove it heinous, to the coffer, whose
makers       and friends have been dead for 4000 years, would seem to
be the very object          of the Proceedings' author ; in order that he may
then take away the primeval vessel's power to symbolize                            a standard
of measure. For says he at p. 249, " Surely a measure of capacity
should be measurable  " that ought to be its most unquestionable
                                  ;
" quality; but this imagined               standard has proved virtually unmeasur-
"able, — in so far at least                as       its twenty-six different and skilled
"   measurers all differ from each other in respect to its dimensions."
     And as the same author repeats, at his page 252, that " the coffer's
" cavity seems really of a form utterly unmeasurable in a correct
" way by mere lineal measurement," — and indicates that though
" perhaps liquid measurements would be more successful,"*     the                      yet
object     is not     "of   the       slightest moment;" — it must                now appear
plainly, that the grand purport of that gentleman's essay is not to
ascertain more correctly than                   I
                               have done, or attempted to do, what
is the real capacityof the interior of the coffer, nor to furnish the
world with correcter numbers than mine, — but merely to damage
the ancient vessel's character,                      as to   being considered      capable of
showing any particular capacity, even within 14,000 cubic inches.
  He may argue that this is a mode of inquiring legitimately
into whether the Pyramid can                    be   possibly regarded     as a   metrological
monument,        or   a sepulchre   But seeing that the style of

surfaces, and close fitting joints,                  — seeing,I   say, that such good and
simple mechanical           work in a hard material              is   precisely what admits
being well        measured            by competent            men, — and     that Professor
Greave's length for the whole                       room 200 years ago, differed         from

actually, with time, alter its size                :   — alter it            too so hugely, that the
granite swelfB out sometimes to                a       length of 144 inches, sometimes
sinks down to 78 inches only, while                              still preserving the same
general rectangular box-like figure.
      Whether other persons may               be       inclined to maintain that hard
red granite      can undergo         such changes,                 I    do not stop to inquire.
I    only vouch that          I   saw no inclinations                   to    it,   on comparing my
measures, taken at the beginning of my stay at the Great Pyramid,
or in January, with my last on leaving                     it   in April.           Moreover   I    firmly
believe that any or all my twenty-five predecessors,                                   if,— instead of,
as    with the generality of them, remaining in the coffer room only
a   few minutes on        a   single occasion,         —   if   they had visited             it   day after
day, for hours each time, and during several months of the year, —
and    if   they had taken the same pains that                     I         did, to compare          their
measuring scales accurately with the Government standard yard                                            of
36 British      inches,    — they     would    have very nearly brought out as
their result for the coffer's cubic contents (before breakage had been
effected or    ledge had been cut into it), the same quantity which
               a
I    have found, viz., 71,250 cubic pyramid inches                             ;*   and that equally,
whether they look on the coffer               as       a   burial sarcophagus                 only, or a
a   measure    of capacity, or both combined.
     If/ consider    the coffer chiefly as   of capacity, — though-
                                                       a   measure
freely confessing that some subsidiary depositing of     mummied                         a
corpse in state, may once have been performed there,                                  — it   is   because,
after having found that the amount of cubic space, both in length,
breadth, but more especially in depth,                       is    much greater              than would
have been positively required for              a       mere coffin purpose,                  — consider
ably greater too, in depth, than in the manifestly burial sarcophagi of
other pyramids, — yet tallies exactly with an expression deducible,
                         it

the size and weight of the whole earth, for appropriately represent
ing   a   grand standard           of capacity,            and weight, measures.                      The
very essence     of the question turns, in fact, on whether there be a
neat and close correspondence between the one practically measured,
and this other theoretically computed, quantity.
     What then has not been my surprise                                to find the Proceedings'

  It      is,   that the Arabian writer,               Al    Hokm, states that Khaliph
Al Mamoon,           when he broke into the Great Pyramid, in or near to
830 a.d., found in the coffer an embalmed human corpse                               ;   proving,
therefore, as some will have                  it,   that the coffer had been from the

closer to that           Khaliph's times, having completely different stories
to tell   ;     and telling them too in the most positive manner.
  Yet the Proceedings'                     author will by no means give                      up his
selected Mohammedan latter-day tales (or those which Mr Day
had criticised in their newspaper edition of January 22, 1868);
and after adducing,             innote, two other Arab writers, to
                                     a                             similar               a
effect with         Al    Hokm, — but both of them living between 300 and
400 years after       Al Mamoon, according to the same either Howard
Vyse's or        Dr Sprenger's authority, — he virtually clenches up these
later Arab accounts on to, or makes them                           as good as   if   written in,
Al Mamoon's              own day, by stating, most remarkably, at the end of
the    same         note, — that
                                          " Colonel                         that the Arabian
                                                       Vyse   observes,
" authors          have given the same accounts              ofthe     pyramids, with little or
" no variation,
                for above a thousand years."
  Yet neither the words, nor the sentiments                               in the above juxta
position, are Colonel Howard Vyse's.                              The words are out of his
book, no doubt, but they are spoken by                        Dr Sprenger      ;   and, what       is
much more important, he                     is   applying them to authors of far earlier
date than any of those who mentioned                          Al Mamoon.
   That       it   was to these far earlier men, talkingof perfectly dif
ferent        matters,      that Dr Sprenger was alluding, — would have
appeared clearly enough in the Proceedings and even from the very

                       of Edinburgh,       Session 1867-68.                  837
sentence     which the Proceedings' author has quoted, — had not this
gentleman cut off the last half of it.
    Here, Sir, accordingly, from the note to Proceedings, page 253,
where the first half of Dr Sprenger's sentence is made to corroborate
statements      which the Dr never intended it to         be seen   in company
with, — is that which        is quoted there, or thus —
    "   '
          It may     be   remarked,'     observes Colonel   Vyse,
                                                                      '
                                                                        that the
" Arabian authors have given the same accounts of the pyramids,
" with little or no variation, for above a thousand
                                                             years.'     (Vol. ii.
"   p. 328.)"
    And here, from that page of Howard Vyse's book, is the full
sentence, as it appears in the whole note which has Dr Sprenger's
name conspicuously subscribed to it : —
    " It   may be remarked that the Arabian authors have given the
"   same accounts        of the Pyramids, with little or no variation, for
"   above a thousand years        ;   and that they appear to have repeated
"   the traditions of the ancient Egyptians,          mixed up with fabulous
"   stories and incidents, certainly not of Mahometan invention."
     In fact, the main purpose of the note is to explain what were
those unvaried stories of a thousand years; and it is attached by
Dr Sprenger directly to the account of one Masoudi, who, living
within 140 years of Al Mamoon, mentions him not, but abounds in
histories of the wonderful circumstances attending the building of
the Pyramids by certain kings before the Flood; and also of the
magical treasures and enchanted wonders which had been found
in the monuments in recent times.
    Neither Dr Sprenger himself, therefore, nor Colonel Howard Vyse
could have intended the sentence to apply, either partially or
wholly, to new contents              of the latter's subsequent pages, 351,
352; where he introduces,           in his chronological arrangement of Arab
writers,* the Proceedings'          author's  Al Mamoon authority, Ebn Abd
Al Hokm,       between Firazabadi, who died in 1438 a.d          , and   Makrizi,
who died in 1467 a.d.            Nor to his pages 333 and 355, where he
mentions the other two Al Mamoon-noticing writers of the Pro-
    * " The Arabic authorities have been translated by Dr Sprenger, and I
 " have endeavoured to arrange them chronologically ; a task which has been
 " attended with some difficulty, as
                                          many of them are only known by quota-

 produce out of Vyse's books an affirmative testimony to the con
 temporary      character   of   Al Hokm's relation touching        the  Khaliph
 Al Mamoon's        reported    discovery   of  a body in the coffer, — entirely
 breaks down.        And   as  it is of very little consequence for identifica
 tion with the original builders of the Great Pyramid and their
 intentions or work, what the Khaliph found in the coffer; — seeing
 that the Pyramid is now considered             to have been entered forcibly
 by men     of alien faith, some 1500 years after it was built, but more
 than 1400 years before the time of Al Mamoon, — we might leave
 the matter now at rest, but for an additional statement                made by
 the Proceedings' author before the Royal Society on              April 20.  For
on that occasion        he announced      having received a letter from the
British Museum, in effect completely ignoring his former autho
 rities, Col. Howard Vyse and Dr Sprenger; and affirming that                 Al
 Hakm lived contemporarily with the Khaliph                Al Mamoon.
     Whether that letter is to be regarded           as   throwing every other
authority into the shade,          I do not pretend to know ; but the whole
document should now be printed and submitted to the same public
opinion which has          so  long sat approvingly on Col. Howard Vyse's
and     Dr Sprenger's opposite and fuller statements). *f
           SIZE OF THE BASE OF THE GREAT PYRAMID.
     After stating in his page 254, in a singularly objectionable man
ner, some of my reasons for considering the determination of the

    t  This is the note referred to at foot of page 332, respecting Dr Whitman's
numbers for the cubic contents of the coffer inthe Great Pyramid.
    Having already shown in the note to pages 331, 332, how the 6000 cubic
inches, case of difference, from my coffer measures, is explainable by the
former observer, M. Jomard, having without doubt made an absolute error
(probably in copying his notes) of 3 whole inches in the depth of the coffer ;
(for these 3 inches being subtracted before the multiplications are performed,
the alleged difference nearly vanishes) : — I have now to show that the
other alleged case of a difference, or that under the name of Dr Whitman,
and to the horrifying extent of 14,000 cubic inches, depends mainly on a
blunder of still more transparent character.
    Its component numbers are published in Howard Vyse's second volume,

important problem in                a   metrological point of view,                  — the     Proceedings'
author thus addresses himself apparently to that question, under
the express title of " What, then, is the exact length of one of its
" basis lines?" but
                     really to the purpose of blaming me for nearly
everything which            I either have           done, or have not done, with regard
to both computations and measurements                                 in the matter.
   Apparently for the first purpose,    say, because          I
                                                        cannot find,                      I
after going through all his pages, that he has advanced the question
beyond the point where                   I left   it,   or come to any other distinct con
clusion, or discovered                   any new authorities.                     But really for the
second purpose,            from what follows              :       though       I     shall only touch
upon such of the                numerous          insinuations             as   may       tend,    in their
p. 287, as given to Dr Whitman by                 a   British officer of Engineers,               and appear
there as follows —:
                                                                      ].cct.    Inches.

     The general aspect of these measures, taken, as they are, either to whole
inches only, or mere halves and quarters, shows that no great accuracy
was aimed at by the said engineer officer. We may also conclude similarly
from the thickness of sides, ends, and bottom being all indiscriminately
lumped together as "thickness of stone;" especially when we find that
the difference of height (outside measure evidently from the term) and
depth (inside measure also evidently from the term, and from its likewise
being expressly so stated) makes the bottom thicker by more than one-half
of the previously stated general thickness of anything and everything about
the coffer.
   But the chief anomaly touches the Length. That        given only once, and   is
without any direct statement of whether    applies to outside or inside of the
                                                         it
vessel; while there    the indirect symptom that
                           is                        means outside measure,
                                                                          it
from its standing immediately above "Height" which          confessed outside   is   a
reference, and as far as possible from depth and width, both stated to be
insido.  Hence, looking to the given measures-list, per te, we can only take
the length given there, or 78 inches, as outside measure, — and when we sub
tract from  itdouble the " thickness of stone," there result 66 inches for the
inside length ; and that quantity used with the given inside width and depth
does undoubtedly give     capacity content, smaller than my determination by
                                a
about 14,000 inches.
  That 66 inches, however, for inside               length,    close upon
                                                                      is       foot smaller   a
than my measure, which              is   supported within   very small fraction of an inch
                                                                  a

    In     order to measure, then, any length of earth                              lines, in the
accurate manner of the best base-line operations of trigonometrical
surveys — in which                       I have myself, in former years, borne a practical
part — and which are                       a very fair ideal of accuracy to look towards
in Great Pyramid outside measurements,                             — it   is necessary
    1st,     To have well-defined and fixed terminal points at either
end of the line to be measured.
    2d,      To have the ground tolerably well cleared,                              levelled, or
reduced to gentle gradients,                       between the points.        And,
    3d,      To have scientific apparatus, by which the measuring bars may
be placed           in definite linear positions,                and to microscopic      accuracy
both absolutely                  level and parallel to the line joining the two ter

by Col. Howard Vyse, the French Academicians, Prof. Greaves, and many
others.  Wherefore arise the following questions :—
   (1.) Was the coffer really of a different length when Dr Whitman's
engineer visited    than in the times of the other measurers alluded to?
                               it,
   (2.) Supposing  that the above was not the case, then, A, did the engineer
officer make   mistake in his measures themselves, to the extent of    foot in
                    B, a
                                                                                         1
6 feet or,
         ?     did he, or perhaps Dr Whitman, merely misplace in his notes
what he had measured fairly as inside measure, and place      amongst outside  it
measures heedlessly                  ?
 I  incline, now that Dr Whitman's published numbers have been dragged
up as being a very high authority on tho coffer's size, to choose supposition
B   as being the most probable.                   And then have to take for his Length inside,
78 inches       ;                         and for Depth inside, 32 inches by
                    Breadth inside, 26-75 inches           ;
                           we subtract his " thickness of stone
                                                                "

   Reducing these values from British inches to Pyramid inches, we have
77-92 x 26-72       33-72 = 70,206 Pyramid cubic inches, where the alleged
                           x
14,000 inches of difference are reduced to nearly 1000 inches and even that      ;

              These Principles applied    to the higher Surveying.
   Requirements       ,1 and 2 are comparatively         simple   to most geo-
desists  ;  for these gentlemen     purposely choose out a plain already
nearly level, and insert at either end of the line they select therein,
a defining mark of their own, say a block of stone, — plugged near
the middle of its upper surface with a brass bolt, and that again
with a platinum stud, and the platinum further marked with a micro
scopic black dot in its centre. Then the horizontal distance from the
minute dot at one end of the line, say from 3 to 8 miles long, to
the similar minute dot at the other end of that line, is the practical
problem      to be solved    by the measurers, through employment             of
what we have indicated under head No. 3.
   But then comes the grand difficulty to them ; and it would be
fearful to tell the number of tens of thousands of pounds which
the Ordnance        Survey  of this country has expended, both directly
and indirectly, on various methods of base-line measuring instru
ments,     from    General  Roy's wooden bars, glass bars, and steel
chains, up to Gen. Colby's compound compensation bars, with their
microscopic and virtual, not actual, contacts.           This last description
of apparatus is now allowed to         be very near perfection       when pro
perly worked ; but to work it          as   it should   be,  requires   amounts
of officers, non-commissioned        officers, men, tents, camp-equipage,
measuring       bars, microscopes, bar-comparing        stations,  lining theo
dolites,    adjusting screw tripods,       wooden stands, ground-clearing
implements,       sun-warding means, &c., &c., — which          I believe even
still bring up the cost of a base line, either on the Indian or the
British Trigonometrical Survey, to several thousand pounds. Yet,
whatever the expense, it is cheerfully incurred there ; because the
accurate length of the line is required to be known, and               it cannot
be ascertained at a less cost      of labour, instruments, and money.
 How   the   Principles should  be  applied to Pyramid-base       Mensuration.
   Next we have to apply the same acknowledged principles to the
mensuration of the Great Pyramid, or rather, as at present the case
is presented to us, the four sides of its base.
   Under head No.         1, defining points     exist  there already     in the
shape of the outer corners of the sockets              cut anciently into the

342                     Proceedings of the Royal Society
solid rock of the hill, to receive the corner-stones of the exterior
casing of the Pyramid. These sockets are easy to find and uncover,
as    I
     have described in "Life and Work," vol. i. ch. 17; but they
cannot be       fully depended on for being such, until they shall have
been checked        by comparing them                 with traces, such        as    Colonel
Howard Vyse discovered in 1837 on the north side of the Pyramid,
in the shape of some of the casing-stones forming the middle of
that base-side of the Pyramid, and still in situ, or firmly attached
to the rock, or lower pavement             (see note to p. 325.)
                                             ;
      Equally therefore         to test the sockets found, being the right
sockets, and also to have the ground between them fit for employ
ing accurate measuring instruments upon, — must attention be paid,
to realizing our head No. 2, at the Great Pyramid. There, indeed,
this No.      2 becomes       the    most necessary beginning, and the most
expensive       part of the whole operation.       For every side of the base
is at present encumbered              by such huge hills of compacted stone
rubbish, that no accurate mensuration                  can be performed over them,
and they completely hide under their substance                      all the fiducial traces
of ancient workmanship which                     we require   to get at; and without
getting at which   cannot tell whether what we are measuring
                         we
was once the base-side of thePyramid, or perhaps something
else.
  If these      requirements        of No.   2,   should on some occasion           be some
how or other performed,              then    No.    3 must     be put into execution
with all the niceties,              and   abundance      of instruments and               men
described      under the same head for an ordinary trigonometrical
survey base-line.          The distance indeed to              be    measured would be
much less, but the attention of intelligent and educated men would
require      to be exerted          in an original manner on the marks and
meanings  left in the lower parts of the Pyramid, the pavement
surrounding       it,
                 and the rock on which      was founded by itsit
builders of 4000 years ago, — in             a    manner and degree never exacted
from Ordnance officers and men when merely measuring                          a   base-line
in a natural plain, for purposes of modern science alone.
  Hence      I   am rather disposed to make the rough estimate, that                       if
No.     1   at the Great Pyramid could be accomplished                   by an expendi
ture of L.10, No.        2    would require L.7000, and No.              3   L.3000   ;   and
the   fully accurate mensuration of the Great Pyramid will never                           be

petent parties, and simultaneously.
       Failure of efforts   to have the    Principles applied in 1864-5.
    I  need hardly say, therefore,        that when    I  went out to Egypt      in
1864, at my own private expense, and on the savings of                  a salary of
L.300 per annum,         I   did not contemplate, of myself or unaided,
measuring the base-sides of the Great Pyramid at an expense of
L. 10,000. Knowing, however, from my former experience on a
trigonometrical      survey,     how    the   scientific part of the operations
ought to      be performed,      I   did all    I could,   before    going to the
Great Pyramid from Cairo, to urge the adoption                  of the necessary
measures both on His Highness the Viceroy of Egypt and on
Egyptian Society.         But no one would look at the proposal.               The
expense     of carrying out the preliminary              head No. 2, frightened
them all.      They remembered that even Colonel Howard Vyse, who
spent his money       en   prince, had only made three crosscuts into the
rubbish-mound on the north side of the Pyramid's                    base, and   had
not attempted the far greater            work of cutting through the length
if  it ; while the similar mounds on the other three sides have re
mained unattempted in any way by any one for the last 700 years
at least.     And  if no one in Cairo would undertake              this operation
No. 2, of course it was futile to ask them to enter into head No. 3;
while it was likely to lead to premature and irreparable mischief
being done to the fiducial points of the Pyramid, to ask them to
undertake,      or sanction     my    undertaking,      what   is implied under
head No. 1, by itself.         I   had, therefore,     to go out to the       Great
Pyramid unaided for that work            ;  leave the proper measurement of
its base-sides    as a    legacy     to richer men and future times; and
address myself to what         I  could do, alone, with my own hands and
very modest apparatus.           That accordingly formed my daily toil *
from     early morning to late at evening, during the whole four
months I was at the Pyramid ; unassisted all that time by any
other measurer,      until the very last few days, when              a new    party

     The apparition of this new party, however,                            has furnished the

and grave insinuations, which he has availed himself of in the
following manner in               p. 255   :   —
  " At the time at which Professor

" its base-line ought to be our

     This paragraph          plainly begins with implying, that at, or dur
ing, the time     I    was       living at the Pyramid, Mr Inglis                  (a   young and
worthy, but poor, engineer's               assistant) visited made all the pre

not assisted by me, who, although there for the express purpose of
performing such         a    measure, yet "strangely" did nothing; and have
caused an opportunity to be lost, the like of which never occurred
before within history, and may be very long before      will occur                 it
again.  Wherefore, some of our members may remark, "          that                           is

   But       I   will now set forth how vastly different from the truth,
is the above statement of the Proceedings'                               author.
   1.   Mr Inglis' visit was not made during my stay at the Great
Pyramid, but close to the latter end of, and after, it. He arrived,
when     I
        was, in fact, preparing to leave, had many of my instru
ments already packed up for removal, and had even fixed a day
with the Egyptian                 government for removing, and had to keep
to that day            ;     and he not only outstayed me, but occupied my
rooms after          I had        left, and was much more my successor than con
temporary         at the Great Pyramid.
  2.    Mr Inglis did              not visit the Great Pyramid on his own scanty
means, as        I           or for his own purposes : he was sent
                       did on mine          ;
there, paid for being there, and furnished with funds for engaging
assistants by his employer, Mr Aiton, a weathy contractor with a
hundred times                the amount             of money that        I had.        A     very fearless
and     independent                man    too,       this   Mr Aiton — who                  had    obtained
from     the         Egyptian            government          greater          powers        for     explora
tion than         I        had received; held               his own ideas about the Great
Pyramid, and amongst others — as rumour said — wished to upset
everything that               I
                was doing or concluding about, touching the
ancient monument.                    And        I   do believe, from          all that       I have    seen
since, that       if Mr Aiton            's employe         who stepped into my place as
above described, when                I left
                                          April 1865, had found
                                                    the Pyramid in
anything materially wrong in my account of the same, Mr Aiton
was precisely the man to let all the                                  world know of          it,   and even
ring with        it,   long before this.              While,     if   he would open the sockets,
and expose them thereby to the chance of irreparable                                         mischief,   he
was the person morally bound to have them properly measured.
  3.    But Mr Inglis, with the Arabs whom he engaged with Mr
Aiton's money,                did not by any means do everything that was
required for the correct measure of the sides of the Pyramid base.
Indeed, they only executed No.                         1— the         least expensive of the three
necessary heads which               I     have noted under               p.   340.     And even one
half of that No.    they did not achieve without my assistance,
                              1,                                                                         as
narrated in " Life and Work," vol.      532-535.            i.   p.
  4.    When           all    the    four corner sockets                 were        thus    imperfectly
opened up,        Mr Inglis          and myself divided between us such obser
vations as       it        seemed possible            then to make        ;    he chose the linear

346                     Proceedings              of the Royal    Society
because         he had some          tolerable      linear, but no angular, apparatus               :
— and       I   freely left him with the linear duty, which                   I foresaw     could
only    be approximate,             and, in so far, could be as well done by him
as by me — while          I undertook            the angular work     ;   and which,     if I had
not undertaken, then and there, would not have been attended to                                at
all, on that occasion of the sockets being opened up. Moreover, my
time had become so limited that I could not have undertaken both
species of measurement               ;    nay, even with the angular measures alone,
I          only occupied with them from the time of the sockets
     was not
being discovered, to the moment of my being removed from the
Pyramid by the Egyptian government,— and then had to leave
some of those angular quantities very imperfectly observed and
some not at all, — butMr Inglis kindly assisted me in what I was
enabled to accomplish ; as fully described and gratefully acknow
ledged in
           " Life and Work," vol. i. And it was not until after
I had left the Pyramid altogether, that Mr Inglis found time
to complete his promised linear part of the measure, or the lengths,
and levellings, from socket to socket.                         He laboured at them,            as
I    believe, very conscientiously,               and sent me the results by a special
messenger when           I    was    leaving Egypt for Scotland                 :   and by me,
after having obtained               Mr Alton's consent and approval, they                   have
been published          to the       world in the name of that gentleman                     and
his assistant.
     What credit there              is,   therefore,      in those linear measures — the
first that had ever been taken from socket to socket round                               all four
of the sides of the               Pyramid — belongs, worthily              to Messrs       Aiton
and Inglis, and no one can take                    it   from them.        But what discredit
is   now sought to be attached                    to them by    a   certain     party, because
their measures          are not     of the exalted accuracy of              a   well-measured
trigonometrical survey base-line,   not theirs (Messrs Aiton ami
                                                     is

Inglis) much less        mine, as the Proceedings' author tries to
                              is    it
insinuate       — but   it   is   the necessary consequence, which                  I   expected
from the first, of the measurement being attempted on the strength
of No.         only having been performed, and no attention paid to
                1
Nos.    2   and    both of my
                    3           340, and of my representation, from
                                            p.

roy.

                           of Edinburgh, Session 1867-68.                                          347
                                         Libel    Second.
  Yet, Sir, however tar from the accuracy compassable by employ
ing methods             1, 2, and 3, simultaneously, may be Messrs                         Ailon and
Inglis' measures,            made on the strength               of method          1   alone, — they
are       vastly       above   anything that      in the present
                                                       can be done
ruinous and rubbish encumbered state of the outside of the Great
Pyramid, without the assistance of that No.                        1.
   After once, therefore, having obtained, from any observers, any
socket measures of the base-sides,                 I
                                     have deemed it waste of time
to try to get the true base-side length from any older measures
taken by observers who had no view of the sockets to guide them                                          ;
and       I have      condemned my own attempts as well as those of others
irretrievably, when taken under such impossible circumstances for
accuracy. Those ante-socket measures were well enough in their day,
as the          only approximations        then procurable          ;    but their day closed
the moment that the vastly better approximations,                                  caused by any
sort of measurings from socket to socket, had been obtained.
      Not       a   little surprised, therefore, am         I   to find in     a   paragraph ex
tending from             p. 255 to p. 256, that         the Proceedings'               author,     after
having begun to deal with                    socket measures,               goes   back to some
ante-socket measures, or the rudest possible approximation                                      of mine,
taken           merely to check a rumour               that two of the Pyramid                     basis
sides were 1000 or 2000 inches longer than the other two                                    ;    and he
enters into a long argument                  as to whether           I      am not egregiously
wrong in applying to them                    a correction          for      a double        thickness
of casing-stones, less              by the comparatively          insignificant quantity of
14 inches, than what he would have applied.
     shall not go into that argument at all on the present occasion,
      1
ur attempt to refute one chief insinuation involved, viz., that that
rude approximation                 is a sample of what my best measuring for final
purposes would be              ;   because— first,      I   have allowed               that my rude
observation             to be corrected,     may be in itself erroneous by many
times the amount             of 14 inches;       second,    I have       nothing final founded
on        it,
       having positively rejected the whole affair, observation, cor
rections, and all, as unworthy of being looked to for    moment, as                    a
unworthy of "any attention" for the theory, since Messrs Aiton
and Inglis' socket observations were procured                           :   as may be seen            in

      348                    Proceedings of the Royal Society
     my     " Life    and   Work," vol. iii. pp. 123 and 124.            And third,   I still
      think that the course           I followed was the        correct one to be pursued
     under the circumstances              then existing.*
         * Although I would not interfere with the current of the argument in the
     above pages, concerning the socket measures for the lengths of the base-sides
     of the Great Pyramid, by introducing there any refutations of charges
     brought against me on a different matter by the Proceeding!' author, — I had
     no intention of eluding altogether any Pyramid accusation by him, which
     implies faults of a most serious nature.
         Such an accusation       is this (pp. 255 and 256) — " But Professor Smyth has
     "  '          '
          elected (to use his own expression) not to take the mathematically exact
     "  measure of the casing stones as given by Colonel Vyse and Mr Perring,
     "  who alone ever saw them and measured                 them (for they were destroyed
     "  shortly    after   their discovery     in 1837), but to take them, without any
     "  adequate     reason,  and  contrary  to their mathematical measurement, as equal
     "  only  to  202   inches,         ."
        This   passage    evidently implies that I had taken as 202 inches only, what
    a mathematically accurate measure had made something more ; how much
    then? In the previous two sentences of the Proceedings' author (p. 255) we
    read that Professor Smyth
                                       " made each side of the present masonry courses
    "                                                 '
        (of the base of the Great Pyramid) between 8900 and 9000 inches in
    " length,' or                                       '
                      (to use his own word) 'about 8950 inches for the mean length
    " of one of the four sides of the base ; exclusive of the ancient casing and
    " backing stones — which last Colonel Howard Vyse found and measured to
    " be
            precisely 108 inches on each side, or 216 on both sides.              These 216
    " inches, added to Professor Smyth's measure of ' about ' 8950 inches, makes
    "  one side (of the base of the Pyramid) 9166 inches."
       Here then, evidently, we may see that what the Proceedings' author attaches
    216 to, is not the casing stones alone, as mentioned in the sentence previously
   quoted ; but, either the backing stones by themselves, or backing stones with
   casing stones ; yet whichever it was, he plainly says that Colonel Howard
    Vyse measured the quantity to be precisely 108 inches on each side, or 216 on
   both sides; and we must presume that this is the mathematically exact measure
   which he would have had Professor Smyth adopt instead of the quantity of
   only 202 inches, and which he declares was taken by Professor Smyth at that
   figure without any adequate reason.
       But Professor Smyth states in answer, —
       1. Colonel Howard        Vyse did most positively not measure casing stones on
    two sides of the Pyramid's base ; he himself does not say, or hint, that he did,
   and the condition of the rubbish mounds at the Pyramid, testifies to the
   error of any one who, like the Proceedings' author, makes the assertion for him.
       2. Colonel Howard Vyse did not measure any lengths about the casing
   stones which he found on the north side of the Pyramid with " mathematical
   " accuracy ; " for, the casing stones themselves, he and Mr Perring measured
   only to the nearest whole inch ; making the greatest base-breadth = 8 feet
   3 inches ; and stating elsewhere generally,              that the outside of the casing
   stones is distant from the Pyramid courses of rude and now broken masonry,
   at that particular part, " about 9 feet."            At least that is all that Professor
.-

                    of Edinburgh, Session 1867-68.                           349
                                    Libel Third.
     In his next   paragraph on p. 256, the Proceedings' author takes up
 all the known socket measures of the base-sides of the Pyramid ;
 and as they are precisely those which             I have used for the same
purpose, and are even taken           from my pages, — it might         be hoped
 that there at least, we might agree.
     But no ! for in the course of the paragraph         that author indulges
 both in a most damaging          (if true) accusation    against me for my
use    of the numbers, and in ridicule        against the building and its
 mechanical qualities, for the strange           accusation   of, — not   having
 been better measured by modern men.
     Now the charge against me lies within the simple rules of arith
metic.      Three observers, M. Jomard, Colonel Howard Vyse, and
 Mahmoud Bey, had each of them measured the north side only, of
 the Pyramid's base, making         it 9163, 9168, and 9162 British inches
 in length, respectively to each observer.
     But Messrs Aiton and Inglis had measured all four sides, and
made them respectively         to each side, beginning with the north one,
9120, 9114, 9102, and 9102 of the same inches long.
     From all these numbers        then, what shall we conclude to be the
length of     a mean side  of the Great Pyramid's       base ?
     When only the three first determinations were in existence, the
plain process was, to take a mean of them ; every computer assum
ing that the other sides of the base were of the same length.
But Messrs Aiton and Inglis' measures indicate, inter se, that
the northern side is longer than the others.          Can we, however, trust
their measures to the greatest difference indicated, viz.,           18  inches?
Smyth has      been able to find in the Colonel's books, — and he requests the
Royal Society of Edinburgh to ascertain from the Proceedings' author where
Colonel Howard Vyse has said anything about 108 inches being a precise
and mathematically exact measure by him of any part of the casing stones, or
backing stones, or both together.
    3. Professor  Smyth  under   the accusation   of having  had   " no adequate
         "               101 inches rather than 108, as a thickness
reason for employing                                                  to be added
on to a present masonry course, as he estimated it, to give the ancient bevelled
outside surface, — requests attention to pages 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, and 27, of vol.
iii. of his Life and Work where he had discussed the matter on the best
data known to him ; and in a work which was in the hands of the Proceed
ings' author when he composed his accusations.

 350                Proceedings of the Royal Society
    I  think not; both because of the necessary roughness                 of their
 measuring     without having made preparations 2 and 3 (of p. 340);
 and because their quantity for the north side differs by more than
twice that difference from any other person's measures of the same
side.      But then again, who will vouch for these other measurers?
Some persons maintain that civil-engineers of the present day are
so  superior to those of the past, that Mr Iuglis' measures must be
the best in the field ; others again rather hold the opposite.               How
then ought the mean of all the just-mentioned numbers be taken                     t
" Shall I take the mean of all four of Mr Inglis' sides as one
                                                                             side,
 " and so
             give him a weight of one only, against each of the three
" older observers?         Or shall   I take each of his sides as a determi-
" nation                          of theirs, and in that
             as good as each                                   case  give him     a
" weight of four, to their one each ?"              That, however, would not
be    paying sufficient     respect    to the    exceeding    care with     which
M.     Jomard,     and    the   Academicians       accompanying        him,    say
that they measured the north side              ; while again, to give Messrs
Aiton and Inglis the weight of               one only, would not sufficiently
mark a sense of approval of their having been the first known men
to measure all four sides of the Great Pyramid's base, from socket
to socket   ;  and  I  was bound    in honour, and     as a witness,    to testify
for them there.       So  I settled   to give them the weight of two.
   I   do not pretend to say that       I  was quite right in that estimation
of the probable worth of their measures.              But   I do mean to say,
that having first of all printed those measures pure, simple, and
complete — and then stated the principle on which I should take
the mean —      I took that mean honestly and            fairly; and its final
result, to the nearest whole inch, came out truly 9142 inches.
   But the Proceedings'        author implies that        I  did  not  take that
mean honestly and fairly        ;  and there is the difference between us.
His words are, " he (Professor Smyth) takes two of them (Mr Inglis'
"                                 —                                          — as
   measures) 9114 and 9102           (but strangely not the largest, 9120)
" data; and strikes a new number out of these two, and out of the
" three
           previous measures of Jomard, Vyse, and Mahmoud Bey."
   Now, if I had wilfully left out the largest number of the Inglis
series, where each member had been considered of equal weight, —
I  should     have   been   dishonest,      and  unworthy of fulfilling any
scientific    appointment.     But    I   did not do so,     either wilfully    or

accidentally. For this is how                I
                                 proceeded to take equal account
of each and every one of the Aiton and Inglis' sides, while I gave
their whole, the predetermined                   weight of two, against the one of
each      of the other three observers.

   Now here is no strange exclusion of 9120, when 9114 and 9102
are admitted; and, in fact, such an unwarrantable piece of cooking as
that would have been, never entered my head, until                           I read it charged
upon me by the Proceedings'                 author.       It   is,   in fact,    a   pure inven
tion of his,      so   far   as
                             I     know or can     see — though          I   must request the
Council of the Society, who have printed the erroneous accusation
to ascertain what its author has to say in his defence.

  After venturing the statement at the end of the same paragraph,
on p. 256 — that the above mean length of 9142 inches,        not                             is
derived by " direct measurement, but by indirect logic" — the Pro
                            " Life and Work "
ceedings' author adds to my                    data, the following
particulars from        a    subsequently    printed number of the Athenmum                        :—
   " Lately, Sir Henry James has shown that the length of one of

                such differences, we need not descend to fractions                        ;   except

 352                   Proceedings of the Royal Society
 principal head of the Ordnance Survey, may think that there is a
 new and very authoritative determination of the length of the
 base side   of the Great Pyramid.             But a little examination will soon
 show,—first,      a  slight inaccuracy     ;  for 360 times 25488, or 9175-68,
 is not the precise equivalent of 9168 inches            ; second,   that it (917568)
 does not lie within the limits of any of the known socket measures
 of the Great Pyramid ; and third, that the derah of 25-488 British
 inches long, is not known to be an ancient Egyptian land measure.
    For on what does the alleged statement that it is such                   a measure
 depend ?       So far as    I  can ascertain, merely this         :  that Sir Henry
 James saw the length and name mentioned — in one of Weales'
 rudimentary         treatises   giving    the     weights and measures           of all
 nations for Is and 6d — as       a modern     Egyptian measure. But more im
 portant works on modern Egypt,               as   Lane's and Wilkinson's,        do not
 acknowledge,        so  far as  I  can find, such a modern             land measure,
 neither do they mention it         as  belonging to past history. While all
of the works together, or Weales' also as well as these last, agree
 that the standard national cubit of ancient Egypt was very near to
 207 British inches in length, or totally different from 25-488 of
 the same inches.
    Hence    I   am inclined to      fall back after all on my former con
clusions from the Pyramid              socket observers above stated            ;  or to
believe that the true length of a mean side of the Great Pyramid,
when properly measured under guidance of the 1, 2, and 3                     of p. 340,
will   be  found to lie within           the     limits  of 9142 db 25 British
inches   : i.e. the present uncertainty is within            5|T of the whole.        A
large proportional error— compared to what                 it might be reduced to
any day,      if   the    Government were consenting to spend on the
measures the merest fraction of what the surveying                     of this country
costs them every year;          but only a small proportional error — as con
 trasted with what affected our knowledge of the Great Pyramid 100
years ago     ;   and sufficiently limited to enable us to test, with con
siderable approach to sufficiency,            several theories already before the
world.
                              SIZE OF THE EARTH.
    In the course of my investigations into the nature and objects
of the Great Pyramid, I have had — beginning with 1864 — to com

                             of Edinburgh, Session 1867-68.                                                353
pare its measured size in parts, with definite portions of the length
of the earth's axis of rotation.                             The length of that axis                 I have
taken, successively,            from means of the best determinations thereof
by the greatest geodesists of the age, giving their names, and gene
rally their original                quantities          ;   and my adopted mean has always
been within the limits enclosed by their several                                     measures    ;    these,
slightly differing from each other in the smaller numbers — but so
slightly as not to prevent the earth's polar axis being now con
sidered       an exceedingly well determined                            quantity.         That       is,   it   is
known within             a   very small fraction of the whole length                        ;    which          is
all that man with his merely finite powers can expect to attain to
in any practical problem, whether       refers to the length of it                                              a
moderate bar of metal, or the dimensions                               of   a   cosmical globe.

  Nevertheless, the Proceedings' author accuses me of having acted
s0 flagrantly as to have used in my researches

employed 500,500,000                  British          inches      for the length of the polar
axis, — have used fur                    that "which Captain Clarke did not find
                                    if it,
                                                                                                                it
" to be."          Let us     see            this charge        is   true, from the pages of the
Proceedings'                    He states that Captain Clarke found
                    author himself.
the length of the earth's polar axis by one mode of computation

354               Proceedings of the Royal Society
= 500,522,804     ; and by another mode 500,482,296             British inches.
The Proceedings' author does indeed considerably confuse his ex
planation of the principles of each method ; and wherefore the final
difference out of the same observational quantities to begin                  with,
— but his   numbers are correct, and are probably derived               from    my
own pages with their peculiar mode of expressing Captain Clarke's
results of feet or yards,     in inches,    and showing them,         sometimes
for the whole axis (vol. iii. p. 134) and sometimes for the semi-
axis (as in vol. ii. p. 450.)
    Now, Captain Clarke himself does not attempt              (as I had    already
shown in    "Life   and  Work," vol. ii. p. 451) to decide entirely between
the two calculated results he has given, — but he states each of
them, and seems to leave his readers to do as they like between the
two.    Anywhere between the limits of his two quantities, therefore,
is to be looked on as derived          from him, and as, in fact, his deter
 mination, rather than any one else's, especially           if with   some refer
ence to his limits of error or variation.
    Now the exact arithmetical mean of the Captain's two published
quantities,   stands thus —
                       First computation,      500,482,296
                      Second        „          500,522,804
                                    Mean,      500,502,550
 or differing from 500,500,000,        by only   ^th of    the amount        of the
 debateable    ground between         the    two  almost    equally important
 factors given by him.       If, moreover, a very    little increase of weight
 be extended     to   the first result,    on account    of the rather higher
 analysis by which it is brought out by Captain Clarke, the ten
 dency is to reduce even that small difference, or perhaps throw it
 to the opposite side.      Wherefore,     if any one   will only trouble him
 self with   as many rough       digits   as he can be certain     of, — Captain
 Clarke's whole result may be stated in a compendious manner                      as
 500,500,000 with a probable error of ± 20,000 British inches.
    If then  I  had stated the length of the earth's            axis   as   outside
 all Captain Clarke's debateable ground between his two results,                say
 at 500,550,000      or 500,450,000       inches,— the Proceedings' author
 might have truly said that       I had stated it at a figure which Captain

                         of Edinburgh,             Session 1867-68.                             355
Clarke did not find              it   to be   ;   but when     I   stated        it close to the
middle of his debateable ground, and after giving his two limits of
that ground,      — this    second charge of the Proceedings'                       author is no
truer than the first        ;    and appears to me a deliberate misrepresenta
tion of the numerical results before him.

    2.    2d part.   — Not content,               however,   with making the charges
indicated above, the Proceedings' author, on his p. 261, asks —
    " But      is there any valid reason whatever                      for fixing and deter-
" mining as an ascertained mathematical fact, the polar axis of
" the earth to be this very precise and exact measure (viz.,
" 500,500,000 British inches), with its formidable tail of nothings?"
    And then he answers, with implied crimination, " None, except
"   the supposed requirements                     or necessities of Professor Smyth's
" pyramid metrological theory."
    But upon which Professor Smyth remarks, that— first, he has not
done what the author describes                      in his question          ;   but,    as already
shown, has taken           his numbers from the results of computed mea
sures        of practical observers           ;    and second,         it is an uncalled for
calumny to say that Professor Smyth's pyramid metrological theory
requires,                that there should be any particular or
                or necessitates,
very precise number, and with many 0's at the end of the British
inches in the length of the earth's axis                     of rotation.          From his first
quotations       from Airy, Schubert, Herschel, Bessel, and others, down
to his last from the Ordnance                     Survey volume, Professor Smyth, in
prosecutionof the Pyramid metrological theory, has merely sought
to know how many British inches long, those who have measured
the said axis, by the nearest approximations that can be made, — have
found it to be       ;   and whatever             the latest and best measurers have
found and proved           it,   he has always accepted            ;   and he     is    still ready to
act in the same manner, for any geodesical                             results of the future,
if   they shall be proved intrinsically better than the existing ones.

     3.   Further on, however (at p. 263), comes                       a   more wide-sweeping
libel    ;   and now against, not Professor Smyth, but Captain Clarke,
Sir H. James, and all the greatest geodesists of every country

 356               Proceedings of the Royal Society
throughout the civilized world       ;  for after all their efforts during the
last fifty years, and notwithstanding the stupendously               large sur
veys they have been carrying on, at an enormous expense to the
nations concerned, in order to ascertain the size and shape of the
earth, — the Proceedings' author declares, that the length of the polar
axis thereof,    " is   still an   unknown       and   undetermined      linear
" quantity."
   Yet, if we   take even twice Captain Clarke's two limits, already
given, — the   difference     of their mean from either one or other,
amounts    to less than T-jri^th       part of the whole axial length:       —
a  proportional quantity, which, on         a foot-rule,   would   be equal   to
a lengthening       or   a   shortening    of it by much less than the
breadth of a hair of the finer human order.                 And inasmuch as
rules are sold in good opticians' shops as foot rules, or as being of
the known length of a foot, though they may differ from each
other in length by more than ten whole                hairbreadths,  — why, it
is plain that the length of the axis of the earth is to be considered,
even as compared with some modern measuring               rules, to be remark
ably well determined       and known.       The statement      of the Proceed
ings' author is therefore       an unfounded      slur on the work and       re
putation of the best astronomers, geodesists, and surveyors of many
countries,   both in the present and past generations ; men who
have deserved exceedingly well, both of the scientific and general
public, throughout the whole civilized world.

   4. That in the same Proceedings' paper, where the length of the
earth's axis has been declared by its author to be " an unknown
" and undetermined linear quantity," — there should be the follow
                   "
ing sentence : — The engineers and mathematicians of different
" countries have
                      repeatedly measured a meridian arc of a degree of
" sixty miles, in order to use it as a standard for linear divisions.
" As part of their standard, they measure off sixty miles of the ir-
" regular earth-surface of a kingdom with almost
                                                               perfect mathe-
" matical exactitude," —
                               may seem extraordinary.
   Extraordinary in the first place — because, though a project has
 been started from time to time, of using some special round and
 even subdivision of the length of a sexagesimal degree of the meri

                     of Edinburgh,   Session 1867-68.                   357
<lian for a standard     of measure, — it has certainly not become          a
common       practice  among   nations,  nay   I  doubt whether    a single
people has adopted it     : and extraordinary in the second place, be
cause,    if  such   degrees  of the meridian      can be measured with
" almost
              perfect mathematical    exactitude," — the length      of the
earth's axis can be computed from them to the same             proportional
amount     of most remarkable     perfection   ; instead of remaining as
the Proceedings' author says it does remain,        " an unknown and un-
" determined linear quantity."
    The question arises, therefore, why has the calculation        not been
made? And the answer must be — that no one but the Proceedings'
author knows of any such marvellous data for the purpose: and he is
either so inexpert at the computation        that he cannot, or so careless
of the state of geodesical knowledge        in his time, that he   does not
choose to, make the very great improvement,           which his statement
implies that he might do, in our physical knowledge, or in our idea
of the exact length of the earth's polar axis, — the most important
base which men can refer to for measuring the sizes and distances
of the sun, planets, and stars.
    No one else,    I repeat, knows of these almost absolutely perfect
data.     Such earth-axial knowledge as that represented by the last
volume      of the Ordnance     Survey,   is based certainly upon        the
measured lengths        of arcs of the meridian,     — but  not depending
on measurements of one degree only.            On the contrary, there is a
class of errors concerned,      whose proportional      effects increase so
rapidly, with the smallness of the arc, that the tendency of the age
has long been to measure an arc of as many degrees as possible,
instead of only one degree.         Hence,    both in India, and Russia,
Britain, France, and Germany, the arcs measured have             been made
to contain     even 10°, 30°, and 60°, by extending them, where pos
sible, across neighbouring countries.         Thus the Indian arc, begun
near Cape Comorin, is being pushed northward           over the Himalayas.
The Russian       meridian arc, commenced at North Cape, has crossed
 the Danube, and is approaching the Mediterranean ; while all the
 states of Europe are at this moment engaged in a grand arc of
 parallel,   stretching from Valentia in Ireland to the Ural Moun
 tains in Russia.
    Yet though both Captain Clarke's and other geodesists' results

858                 Proceedings of the Royal Society
are based on    all these large arcs, and which must give more accu
rate results than    if the same parties had measured          single degrees
only, — the Proceedings'      author pronounces     their final deductions
worthless, in so far as, in spite of them and the faultless formulae
                                                                     " still
of computation     employed, the length of the earth's axis is                an
" unknown and undetermined linear quantity;" — what, then, must
not be the overwhelming excellence         of the single degree arc-of-the-
meridian measures, which the same fault-finding author describes
in the same critical paper, as endued " with almost perfect mathe-
" matical exactitude?" Why, of course, they must be supernaturally
perfect, i.e., if they exist.      But do they exist? At present we
have only the word of the Proceedings'          author that they do.       And
why has he favoured the world, through the Royal Society of Edin
burgh, with his statement to that effect       ?
    " Because   he knows of their existence,      and can produce       them,"
ought to be the answer.           But  if that   answer be not rendered         ?
Why then      we have   only to look to the sentence following that          one
which we quoted near the head of this article 4 ; and there stands a
reason of a very exceptionable order, and which manifests its nature
 increasingly in the latter portions of the Proceedings' paper. That
                                      "
 reason is given in the words, — Professor Smyth holds that the
 " basis side of the Pyramid has been laid down by Divine authority
 "  as such a  guiding measure."
                               Accusation  Fifth.
    In  the above sentence then, we have touched at last on the origin
 of the unnatural excellence attributed to certain unknown surveyors'
 and mathematicians' measures of 60 miles long : viz., Professor
 Smyth holds that something about thedesigningof theGreat Pyramid
 was due to Divine inspiration afforded to its architect ;* and imme
 diately the Proceedings'      author insinuates that just such a some
thing is often accomplished       by unassisted man in the present         day,
   * Id the same manner as we read in the Bible, it did occasionally please
the Almighty to issue instructions for practical works, showing the pattern
thereof, pronouncing the sizes they were to be made in all their chief parts,
and sometimes even inspiring the workmen with tho requisite skill to prepare
them.     See Exodus xxxi. 1-11 ; 1 Chronicles xxviii. 11, 12, and 19. 20: Acts
vii. 44 ; and Hebrews viii. 5.

                       of Edinburgh, Session 1867-68.                                          359
and carried out by him both on a vastly larger scale, and with in
finitely more accuracy.
  Of course      line 60 miles long, is on a larger scale in mere
                   a
length, than one side of the base of the Great Pyramid, only }th
of one mile long. But then what is there similar, between measuring
60 miles' length of open country in the latter days of the world,
and the building of a transcendent monument in primeval times,
with an excellence of masonry never since surpassed, and able to
endure and bring down through more than 4000 years proof of a
pure mathematical            figure   of important       meaning,               besides      many
physical symbolizations            expressed in the size of the whole and its
parts, as well as in their astronomical               emplacement           ?
  The two things           are   evidently of
                                       totally different kind, and we
                                                  a
should have nothing more to reply to under the head of accusa
tion (5), unless the Proceedings' author had further propounded the
following depreciation of both the modern measures of the Great
Pyramid's base-side, and the said base-side itself; in the follow
ing words (p. 256) : —
  "
    Surely it (the base-side of the Great Pyramid) is a very strange
" standard of linear measure that can only be thus elicited and de-
" veloped — not
                 by direct measurement, but by indirect logic, and
"                                                                                     is,
  regarding the exact and precise length of which there                                     as yet,
" no kind of reliable and accurate
                                                  certainty."
  Now, the recorded and received measures of the Pyramid's base-
sides are,       no doubt, as we have already              seen        at       p.   351, sadly
rough and rude         ;   but then they are in so far true measures, made
by actual surveyors,             French, British, and Egpytian,                      at various
periods during the last 70 years, and not results                           ascertained         by
" logic."
  There     is   also, at present, as already shown at            p.   352, some amount
of reliable      certainty       as to the measured        length      ;    and      if   any one
desires to have that             amount     of certainty increased, — let them,
especially   if   they are rich men, adopt the necessary practical means
for obtaining      it  :   as indicated   on p. 340.
  The Proceedings' author, indeed, intimates that the length of the
Pyramid's base-side cannot                be obtained     by the ordinary                   human
means, viz., direct measurement,                but only by indirect logic.                   How
logic, whether direct or indirect,           is   to procure    it,
                                                                I      do not presume to
  vol. vi.                                                                           3
                                                                                     a

  360                Proceedings of the Royal Society
  know.      And equally am    I ignorant why direct measurement         should
  not be equal to the problem         ; for there,     defined  by the incised
  corner sockets, is a length marked in a levelled surface of founda
  tional rock, and capable, when certain modern, adventitious mounds
  of rubbish are cleared away, of being measured as accurately as any
  base-line   that modern surveyors have measured on any part of the
  earth's surface.
     Therefore,   if modern men do not yet know that Pyramid               base-
  side length accurately, whose is the fault, but their own       ; and instead
  of vilifying the character of the Great Pyramid, it would be more
  to the purpose, were they, even now at the eleventh hour, to take
  shame to themselves,       and send out     a  strong party of surveyors
 and measurers, to undertake       the work they have not yet performed,
 and with all those same means and appliances,             which they employ
 in any other case       where good lineal measures over long distances
 are required.
               THE SACRED CUBIT OF THE HEBREWS.
     In his  pages 257 and 258, the Proceedings'         author states, rather
 ambiguously, that Professor Smyth believes that the length of the
 base-side of the Great Pyramid, when measured with a standard
 whose     length is the ten-millionth      part   of the semi-axis of the
 earth,* exhibits the number of days and parts of           a day in the year;
 that that standard      is the Pyramid Cubit     ;  that it is the same in
 length as the Sacred Cubit of the Hebrews          —   such cubit measuring
 25 Pyramid inches,        =  25-025 British inches ; and that the whole
 idea, apparently, of the metrical theory of the Great Pyramid, is
built upon the correctness of this Hebrew cubit datum.
     The author then goes on more distinctly to attack that datum,
and to show that      it is exceedingly incorrect    :   That Sir Isaac New
ton came long ago to the conclusion          that the true length of the
Sacred Hebrew Cubit was 2482 inches,            from which     it must not be
altered   :   And that Professor Smyth, in taking the means of Sir
Isaac Newton's original quantities, and representing            them as 25-07
    * According to Captain Clarke's two limits already given, such fraction
must lie between 25-026 and 25-024 British inches ; wherefore I have usually
taken 25025 ± -001 British inches aa the practical quantity to apply : in
so far I belicvo iu accordance with the eminent and exemplary authority of
Sir John Herschel.

                          of Edinburgh, Session 1867-68.                                          361
±   -10    British inches, made             a gross       mistake       ;   for the mean, of cer
tain intermediate numbers printed by him, is really 25-29.
   Now, in the first place, it must be seen pretty clearly by most
persons that the length of the Sacred Cubit of the Hebrews cannot
be really necessary,            in    a   direct way, to the metrical theory of a
building erected long before the time of Abraham.                                     And, indeed,
the modern Pyramid scientific theory was elaborated without any
dependence upon           it,   and    still stands on its own foundation and refer
ences to science.           But after the Pyramid theory was                          so   far worked
out, and had produced            a     Pyramid cubit of           a   particular length, — then
that length         was    compared         with other cubits               :   and, though found
utterly different from the cubits of Egypt, Babylon, Assyria, and
other pagan Gentile nations, — yet came very close to what Sir
Isaac Newton had deduced for the length of the Sacred Cubit of the
Hebrews.
    Sir Isaac Newton's treatise was therefore examined, and while                                   it
was found that he looked                    upon his adopted                result    as    only tem
porary, imperfect, and even distinctly to be replaced at future time                  a
by some other person's completer researches, — a careful re-examina
tion of his data, according to modern methods, led Professor Smyth
to a     slightly different quantity,                as   being   a   better approximation to
the truth therein enveloped, viz., the length of the sacred Cubit of
the Hebrews, than that quantity which Sir Isaac had employed.
This difference           was not of an amount                    to alter our most eminent
philosopher's grand conclusion                    as to the           total difference        between
that Sacred Cubit of the Hebrews, and the profane                                         cubit of the
Egyptians,     — but only            to affect   a   residual question of             a   much minor
lineal difference, and which had not occurred to him, or to any one
in his day.
I    fully believe, therefore, that Sir Isaac Newton himself, were
he still alive, would allow that my deduction      of 25-07 ± "10
British inches, from his several data, expressed chiefly in Roman
unciae,
           is
           a    truer result than his of 25-6 Roman                             unciae,    interpreted
variously      by   modern           authors     as anywhere            between 24-75, 24"82,
and 24-89      British inches.
    In    order that there might be no mistake about what                                    Sir Isaac
Newton's opinions and data were,                      I     reprinted in the 2nd vol. of
" Life and Work," the whole of his original paper                                 :   and only com

362                 Proceedings of the Royal Society
menced the discussion             upon them           in   a subsequent       part of the
volume.        In that portion of my               work,    it has recently been dis
covered that there is an unfortunate                  misprint of certain intervening
computed        quantities, between Sir Isaac's original data, and my
final deduction from them              ;   some erroneous          slip of paper having
apparently got introduced into the MS. finally sent to the printer.
I   acknowledge      that there is such an error, thank those cordially
who have discovered            it ; and have already rescinded               it from the
volume by printing          it as an error in a         list of errata, of which list I
place a bundle of exam pies on the table, so that any member who has
a copy     of " Life and Work," may supply himself with this addition.
    A   very little attention in collating and comparing, would have
indicated to the Proceedings' author that these intermediate figures,
as they are printed in the 2d vol. of my " Life and Work," p.
458, are simply misprinted           :   for, they are neither correctly derivable
from the original quantities, nor is the following                         mean derived
from them.         But he has chosen rather to suppress the fact of my
having given, in the same volume, Sir Isaac Newton's original
numbers, and given them correctly and completely,                          to the extent
of several pages       ; omits Sir Isaac's statement that he looked on his
one chosen and adopted              quantity        as temporary,     — parades in Pro
ceedings,    p. 258,   my misprinted intermediate figures, as if they were
all important original ones              ;  and glories in pointing out that the
mean put by me underneath                 them, is not the correct mean of those
numbers.         Of course it is not           ;  because    it was derived from other
numbers.         And   as both    that final mean of mine is rightly printed,
as intended,      and the original quantities are also correctly printed, —
 what occasion was there for bringing up this accidental misprint of
 some intervening         figures    so very        prominently, and alluding to it
 as  something radically subversive of the whole theory of the Grt,it
 Pyramid     ?
     To assist those who may try to ascertain,                   I subjoin, in a note, a
 description of the numerical particulars of the case, prepared origi
 nally for the errata list in
                                     " Life       and  Work ; "* and now         I pass on
 to the consideration        of the next principal section.
  *
     Sir Isaac Newton' t Numbers for       the   Length of the Sacred Cubit of the Hebrew:
    At p. 458, vol. ii. of Life and Work at the Great Pyramid, there is an unfor
 tunate misprinting of the calculated numbers representing in British inches,

                      of Edinburgh,           Session 1867-68.                        363
               SIGNIFICANCE OF CYPHERS AND FIVES.
    Under the above head,              p. 264, the Proceedings'        author has some
remarks       as to certain   persons, in their comparisons              of lengths in
the Great Pyramid, with the size of the earth, imagining                         " that if
the quantities from which the mean " 25-07, =t "10 Britiah inches," for a new
statement of the length of the above cubit, was derived.   This final mean is
correctly     given, as intended   ;    so likewise    are the original terms, expressed
chiefly in Roman       Unciae, in Sir Isaac           Newton's  Dissertation  on Cubits,
reprinted at pp. 354-366.     No important mischief therefore is likely to have
accrued, from this error in printing one of the intermediate steps. But as
the error is an undoubted blemish, which              I
                                               much regret, have cancelled in
the list of errata, and sincerely thank those who have called my attention t0
it, — I hasten to give the following discussion de novo.
    At p. 365, of Sir Isaac's treatise above mentioned, he assumes 25$ Roman
unciae, to represent the length of the Sacred Cubit of the Hebrews, — a cubit
which he had elsewhere shown, there were grounds for believing that that
people possessed before they went down into Egypt, and had had specially
brought to their attention again, for religious matters, after leaving Egypt
under Moses.
    But Sir Isaac Newton was not at all confident of having obtained the pre
cise length, to the last figure put down in his arithmetical expression.   And
he particularly and almost prophetically says, —
    " This is what I thought proper to lay down at present with regard to the
" magnitude of this cubit.        Hereafter, perhaps those who shall view the
.' sacred mount, and the monuments of the Chaldwant,
                                                           by taking accurately
" the various dimensions of the stones, bricks, foundations, and walls,
'
  and comparing them together, will discover something more certain and
"   exact."
  Now what Sir Isaac laid down at that then present time, was abundantly
sufficient for his then purpose ; or to prove, that there existed a most sensible
and positive difference in the length of that sacred (or 25j unciae) cubit of the
Hebrews, — and, of the profane cubit of the Egyptians, whose length, expressed
in the same Roman unciae, was hardly more than 21-3. And in this last
conclusion, he is so eminently borne out by all subsequeut investigators, that
that subject — or the length of the profane, or ancient Egyptian national cubit —
need not be stirred again.
   But within the last few years, another, and a more refined, or a residual
question has arisen, which apparently never crossed Sir Isaac Newton's mind,
viz., was the Sacred Cubit of the Hebrews, taken by itself, accurately the ten-
millionth part of the length of the Polar semi-axis of the Earth ? And as
this quantity in Nature, according to modern science, is something very close
to 25-8 Roman unciae, — Sir Isaac's determination of 25 .and }, i.e., 25-6 of
the same unciae for the Sacred Cubit, is, to say the least of       so near —
                                                                           it,
especially for a confessed imperfect approximation, from   portion only of the
                                                                   a
materials collected, — that    becomes intensely important to submit all the
                              it
data to   amore rigid scrutiny than before with the caution moreover in view,

not a proper method there ; because, not only has Sir Isaac Newton evidently

 "
     ciently, give equally startling strings of 0's ;" and he then goes
 on to    furnish three such examples       ; the first being made gratuitously
 shown     that he had most confidence    in his two last determinations   ; but his
 first, by its very wide limits, shows that it is by far the least trustworthy of
 all. Some decrease of weight, therefore, for No 1, and increase for Nos. 6
 and 7, require to be made.        How much precisely, it is impossible to say : but
 perhaps     } for the former, and 3 for each of the two latter, the intermediate
 quantities being reckoned at 1 each, — may„be considered fair and probable.
 In which case the mean comes out, 25-05 British inches.
    While, simply, — and in fact as I did on the first occasion, using then a
 slightly different value of the Roman uncia, — throwing away the one very
 objectionable observation, and taking a mean of the rest, unweighted, gives
 25-09 of the same inches.
    But neither     25-09, nor 25-05 are fully safe, either in the second, or per
 haps the first, place of decimals ; — for — besides the uncertainty      connected
 with the proper weighting of each of the results, according to the different
 kind of documentary          evidence obtained by Sir Isaac Newton on each
occasion, — there is considerable uncertainty in the value of a Roman uncia,
expressed      in British inches. We have assumed as above, that the former
=    0-97  of the latter : but modern scientific and architectural authorities are
found anywhere, between Zach at 0-9681 and Penrose at 0-97286 ; and might
require us to reduce our final quantities by — -05, or increase them by + -06
of an inch ; or by any intermediate figure.
    Wherefore, the statement already printed at p. 458 of vol. ii. of Life and
 Work at the Great Pyramid,— i.e. 2507 ± -10 British inches, for the best
result deducible from all Sir Isaac Newton's approved approximations for
the    length of the Sacred Cubit of the Hebrews, — is, if not as good a
statement as can be made. — at least a great deal better than the 24-82
inches, absolute, which has been hitherto current in most English works ; and
beyond comparison better than the 207 inches, nearly, of the ORDNANCE
SURVEY Map of Jerusalem.
    This Ordnance quantity of 20-7 inches is evidently not the tacred cubit at
all, but the profane cubit ; and in the explanations of the scale at the foot of
the above map, the revered names of " Sacred," and "Cubit of the Taber
nacle," are given to precisely what Moses was so anxious to keep them from
being confounded with — viz., the cubits of idolatrous Egypt and other Gentile
nations ; the inscriptions at one end of one of the Ordnance-map scale-lines
being — " Egyptian,      Hebrew, Babylonian" and at the other end of one and the
same    line — " Royal or Sacred Cubits, also named Cubits of the Tabernacle."
    If this map is one of those prepared, as believed by some, at the expense and
to the orders of the Fathers of the Palestine Exploration Association — such
a radical error with regard to the sacred cubit of the Hebrews may well excite
surprise.      But if, on the contrary, the map is purely the work of the several
Ordnance officers whose names are conspicuously engraved upon it — the
nation must regret that they should have so entirely ignored the researches
of Sir Isaac Newton, the greatest philosopher their country ever produced, and
in one of the most important of all questions that have ever been brought
forward in either the science or history of metrical standards.

together      with       a   measuring      scale,     on    his reading        desk    by    an
assistant, before the lecture            began), and then finding, with smiles
all over his countenance,                before the         members assembled,               that
the larger diameter of said hat's brim was just half of the                            " Sacred
Cubit!"
  This act, — much to              be regretted,      — has crowned itself with            con
fusion in the Proceedings' paper, and at the performer's own hands,
by all his three examples failing miserably.
  Thus the misguided, though in other things learned doctor, says
—that his hat's brim of 12 inches in length,
                                        4       l-20,000,000th of   is
the earth's polar axis, that being taken at 500,000,000 inches                           ;    but
any school-boy may see that                 it   is   rather the 1-40, 322,581st part
thereof   ;   a   result where there are few 0's, and               a    very large differ
ence at the beginning.
   Next, he says that "            a   page of the print of the Society's                Trans-
" actions     is    l-60,000,000th          of the         same."       Here, indeed,          he
prudently avoids giving the measure of the said page       but                    ;            I,
having measured    on the same principles as his third case indi
                             it
cates,   find the limits           as being      not less than      8   37, nor more than
8-43 inches,        on complete         pages of       a    recent volume.        Wherefore
taking the mean               =    8'4 inches, — that
                                       will be found, not the
l-60,000,000th even, but the l-59,523,810th part of the same
axial length.

    And finally he states that " a print page of Professor Smyth's
"
    book, 6-2 inches in length, is l-80,000,000th of this great
" standard;           &c." But 6 2 inches                             not that
                 &c.,                             form, evidently,
even fraction, but the l-80,645,161st part of the same 500,000,000.
A length, however, this last, in British inches (and no others               are
there alluded to by the British Proceedings' author),          which    neither
Professor     Smyth    stated, nor Captain     Clarke, nor any other known
geodesist, ever found, the earth's axis to measure.          Nor is the length
24'82 inches, as shown in the previous             section, the length which
Professor Smyth has deduced, or considers to be deducible from all
Sir Isaac Newton's         numbers, taken together according to modern
scientific principles,     for the length of the Sacred Cubit.
    All  the three examples        thus given by the Proceedings' author
have totally failed in producing        his promised    "startling strings of
" 0's : " and though he        does put
                                         " &c., &c." after his last case, — yet
if  these symbols refer to other examples of the same order as his
previous ones, they       will not strengthen his    case.
    With   a  very little cleverness in looking out through         the world,
no doubt other persons might find some trifle coming more nearly
to an even fraction       of the earth's polar axis than any of the Pro
ceedings'    author's given examples.        But then it must be remem
bered, that when the        length of that said axis has already been as
certained by national efforts, — there is no more difficulty in finding
 a practical equivalent to a small fractional part thereof, than in
performing      a sum    in simple arithmetic: and after this little thing
should have been done, it would really possess no similarity with the
 alleged case of standards of measure in the Great Pyramid, — de
posited or built in there, on a gigantic scale, 3000 years before any
 accurate determination        of the length of the earth's polar axis had
been    made by men, — and yet found now to           be an apparently    exact
and even decimal and quinary fraction thereof.
    This    really astonishing      geodesical   character   of the Pyramid
standards, is a matter to be disproved, only by still more accurate
measures of both the Great Pyramid and the earth being instituted;
and then, perhaps, found not to be commensurable                by quantities
larger than the limits of error of the measures.         At present there is    a
coincidence within the limits of errors of the best modern measure
ments of both     ;  but in the case of the Great Pyramid these are not

therefore,        for both religious minded,             and scientifically       inclined,
persons       is,   or should be,      not to take to " scoffing and deriding,"
but to visit the Great Pyramid in               a    calm and working philosophical
spirit, and to remeasure more exactly all those still existing fiducial
markings which have marvellously descended to our latter times
from primeval ages, closed long before history began.
  With regard, next, to the Proceedings' author's termination of his
section   ;    or, that many arrangements               in fives are to be    seen    in the
rooms   of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, — i.e. in a modern
building of    most confused multiplicity of parts, and made up
                     a
in design           by copyings from          several   foreign, and some ancient,
architectures, — and his conclusion that the arrangements were not
carried       out there          for any special      purpose     of symbolizing       five;
and   " that        there   is   not the slightest ground for any belief that the
" apparent
           fiveness of anything in the Great Pyramid had                      a   different
" origin " — can only spare time to remark that the
          ;         I                                                           two cases
are almost awfully different             ;   for —
   1st.The Great Pyramid was built 4000 years ago, in the sym
bolic ages of the world, according to many indications in Biblical
history, and we have no other guide for those very early times.
   2d. The Great Pyramid's whole mass and whole surface, — and
those so huge as rightly to have procured  the title from all the
                                                            it
                        "
nations of the world of the Great Pyramid," — are arranged so as
to make two most colossal representations                   of fives   ;   and have been
beheld by nearly all peoples from the beginning of history                        ;   and —
   3d. Compared to the above, either in size, entireness, or publicity
— the few fives here and there inside the very modern Royal Insti
tution building of Edinburgh, and in one part merely of which the
Royal Society of Edinburgh meets and the fives are said to be
chiefly found, — are only like the fives which any child may dis
cover in   modern multiplication table
              a                          i.e., they are small both

  against one    particular final quantity — which is           the mean       of the
  largely varying results of four          different observers, — that it is " an
   "  exact measure which certainly none of its many measurers ever
   " yet found it
                     (the thing itself measured) to be
                                                              "

  only hold up my hands in astonishment.
      For here is a person criminating utterly the simple arithmetic pro
  cess of taking arithmetical means in physical science ;and bringing
  up the special accusation, equally applicable, if at all, in pure, as
  well as applied, arithmetic, — that the mean does not come out
  exactly the same      as one   of its component numbers.
     This is surely something worse than advocating perpetual motion,
 spirit-rapping, or any other absurdity which would not be permit
  ted to enter the books of the Royal Society of London                 :  and indi
 cates that the Proceedings'        author is running a-muk, in the manner
 of certain of the Javanese, against the method of averaging                      em
  ployed in every scientific, commercial,         and insurance     establishment
 in every country throughout the civilized world.               And if the Royal
 Society of Edinburgh has permitted such sentiments to                    be uttered
 at their meeting and printed in their Proceedings,               —  I  would beg
 them to explain, through their Council or otherwise,               —if     they be
 lieve the sentiments,     — how they maintain        them  ; and   if they do not
 believe     them, — why     they give them        honourable      publicity,     and
 against the Pyramid subject alone            ?
      (In  the meanwhile* that there may be no doubt               of the fact      as
 held by the Proceedings' author,             I subjoin, in a note,f an extract
 from one of the daily papers of April 21, — expressing the gentle
man's sentiments as delivered            to the Royal Society of Edinburgh,
on    April 20, more fully     ;  and   I   hope completely relieving         me of
any necessity for answering him on the point.)
      MINUTENESS OF MODERN PRACTICAL STANDARDS
                                  OR GAUGES.
     Under the above heading the Proceedings' author has tabled some
    * This paragraph in parenthesis, was added after the reading of the paper.
    t " It was an erroneous method of procedure to take the mean of different
"
    measurements.     Such a method of procedure Sir J. Y. Simpson alleged
" was childish :
                   it was a species of mathematical aberration, and it ran
" through the whole of Professor Smyth's book." — Scotsman of April 21.

370                       Proceedings         of the Royal          Society
objections to results deduced from the Great            Pyramid, — but the
objections       are      founded on such erroneous principles of practical
science, that        I
                notice them only for the sake of the Royal Society
of Edinburgh, in whose publication they now appear.
   The first objection    that the theoretical and actual sizes of
                                   is,
the supposed standards of the Pyramid " are made to vary in
" different
            books, which                it   is   impossible     for an actual standard to
do." (p. 265.)
    Yet   itis   a   notorious fact that the theoretical and recorded sizes of
the actual national             standards do vary in different                books and even
sometimes in the same book                    ;   and this, whether we take the pages
of micrometric            measures for the length of our standard yard from
the Philosophical Transactions,                    or the Memoirs of the Royal Astro
nomical Society, and compare these with the different ideas of the
savants  of various countries, at different times within the last 100
years, as to the true length of    pendulum vibrating seconds in
                                                  a                                           a
particular position              on the earth,     (the British yard's theoretical
reference)      ;    or whether         we enter into the conflicting ideas of the
French         nation,       at successive epochs, as to the real length of                   a
ten-millionth of the earth's meridian quadrant, and its proportion
to their standard metre, at different temperatures.
   Thanks to the exertions of the many great men who have
laboured splendidly in the cause both of the theory and practice of
such standards,           — the differences of the modern standards alluded
to, are now reduced   within very narrow limits. But differences
to some extent there are still, and will be for ever, according to the
nature of things, touching all practical standards, their theoretical
references, and every subsequent, additional determination                                of the
numerical           value of the same,            —   if   pushed to sufficient refinement,
and whether by one or many observations.
    The more man strives after practical perfection,                              the more im
possible   it       is   found to attain           to it.       An uneducated countryman
thinks     he       has      the time perfectly,           if   he knows     it   to the nearest
minute.         But       an astronomer,          though        he obtains   the time by ob
servations          to   a   fraction    of   a    second, yet always finds his results
attended by some still smaller fractional portion of error.                              Again,
a   carpenter compares two specimens of three-foot rules, and                            if they
agree     within half of •jijth of an inch, he at once pronounces                          them

                              of Edinburgh, Session 1867-68.                                              371
perfect    :   but   a   learned man who measures their respective lengths to
          of   tVu       of an incn, can seldom or never reach perfect decision
in his last place of figures; and finds anomalies of expansion, imper
fections of the eye, or the touch, plasticity of the hardest metals,
and all the powers of nature interfering between him and his pro
posed goal of perfect aceuracy.
     Well therefore has one of the best men whom Cambridge has
sent forth within this century,                           summed up these ruling facts of
all the higher natural                    philosophy,— by stating
                                                                                    " that no human
" hand or machine ever yet drew a straight line, or erected                                           a per-
" pendicular, or fixed an instrument in perfect adjustment."                                              And
in truth it is           an    attribute higher than man's, to perform any prac
tical mechanical operation with perfect exactness.
   To acknowledge this fact and work within it,— tends                                         to lead men
on to that old and beautiful confession                         of Sir Isaac Newton,                i.e., that
all that       even he had been able to do, through                            a long       life spent in
scientific observation,                  — was,      to   pick up   a   few pebbles on the shore
of the boundless ocean of knowledge.        It tends, in fact to keep
man in his proper place, in humility of mind, but in earnest con
templation of a high ideal, and in efforts always to rise above his
last endeavour,               — assured that there is hope for                       some      further im
provement, when the distance between himself and ideal perfection
is infinite.
   But to deny the fact of man's incapacity for perfect performance
of problems in practical science, and to refuse its evidences — is
either to exhibit an uneducated ignorance of what accuracy    —                                           is,
or to endeavour to apply to the creature that which an attribute                          is
of the Creator.
     Hence, when the Proceedings' author (at 265) lays  down, that       p.                 it
     " Measures, to be true counterparts, must, in mathematics,'be

     tical,
we may well ask,                Is       the gentleman         showing simple ignorance                         of

 372                Proceedings of the Royal Society
 the difference between         pure mathematics         and applied ? or,      Is  he
 unjustly   and    knowingly        stating against the Pyramid's deduced
 standards,   as an acknowledged          metrological fact, that of which           he
 knows    the very contrary has been found to prevail by all those
 men who have devoted themselves specially to the most accurate
 possible mensurations.
    Into this nice question       I shall not   attempt to penetrate,     — but will
 pass on to a statement at the foot of the same Proceedings'                     page,
 asserting  that " our   real practical standard         measures are infinitely
 "  more refined and many thousand-fold more delicate than any in-
 " definite and
                  equivocal measures alleged to be found in the Py-
 " ramid by even those who are most enthusiastic in the pyramidal
 " metrological theory."
    This is clearly stated there, and then its writer brings forward
as   proofs   of that infinitely        superior accuracy,       refinement,       and
delicacy, the thickness-gauges           of Mr Whitworth.
    Now these gauges are no doubt very admirable things in their
way and in their own place         ; and as they range generally from 0"2 to
 60 inches in diameter, they are exceedingly useful for testing the
thickness of iron rods and plates in engineers'                 workshops.        But
they are not yet employed             by the Government          as   the standard
length of the country      ;   they would form also       a most awkward        shape
for a standard      to refer to, in measuring           any long length on the
surface    of the    earth   ;   and from      their shortness,     would    require
to be multiplied      so often as to lead to serious chances              of error     ;
while finally comes the question, are they adapted to last               ?
   A national or scientific       standard ought to hand down the national
measure unchanged for thousands of years.                But will  so  oxidizable     a
substance as iron, and this is what           Mr Whitworth       employs, be safe
through such long       ages ?      When    so  little of the iron of the Greeks
and   Romans,     and less of the Egyptians,             has come down        to our
time — grave    fears may be entertained              for the Manchester iron
plugs and sockets.
   Now the standard of the Great Pyramid, on the contrary,                     comes
before us with the proof on its brow                 of having   stood that test,
which Mr Whitworth's thickness gauges have not yet gone through                       ;
— viz., of having     lasted before the world, and in spite of conquer
ing and insulting nations, for 4000 years.             In spite too of conquerors

                       of Edinburgh,              Session 1867-68.                         373
who did everything they could                     to annoy and crush              the patriotic
spirit of the Egyptians, by ransacking their tombs, polluting their
temples, overturning their statues.                    And certainly, if by leaving out
to rust in the dewy night-air a few iron gauges, the Persian Cam-
byses     could            nay destroyed, the Egyptian national
                   have spoiled,
measure of length, — would he not most assuredly have done so?
  This first point of comparison                     then,   is no problematical, but a
certain and proved, superiority of the Great Pyramid over any little
iron gauges for national standards.                     And      a second    similar point   is,
that taking account of all the various lengths which man has to
measure, and the importance     for accuracy of having to multiply the
standard as little as possible, —    length like a  side of the Great a
Pyramid base, of more than 9000 inches, and that in material pre              a
served by nature         at   a    practically equal temperature                  and constant
length,   — must     be preferable to something that                  a    man might put into
his waistcoat           but have proportionally large temperature
                     pocket    ;
and other corrections to apply to it.
  In    the third place,not right to say that our modern practical
                               it   is
standards are many thousandfold more delicate, and infinitely more
refined, than those           of the Great Pyramid.                  For while some of the
modern standards,         when they have passed out of the hands of their
makers, have been found on testing after                         a   few years to be from
TT&inrth to Tinsl!nnr';b. wrong, and while the ordinary divided scales
in opticians' shops may be found from -gfo to TifWth. wrong, — the
base-side of the Great Pyramid, according to the description of its
masonry  by Colonel Howard Vyse (see note p. 325), must have
admitted of measure to less than 0"0l of an inch at either end, or
equivalent to CTlWirth of the whole i.e.    in all justice, the
                                                             ;       if,
same refined means of now making the measurements were to be
employed      there,     as are          so   freely spent on our ordinary modern
standards at home.
  Evidently,         in fairness,             either the     Great Pyramid's          base-side
should be as carefully measured, and with reference to the state in
which its builders left              — as are our modern standards with regard
                                   it,
to their makers      ;   or the modern standards should be treated as the
Pyramid's         base-side    has been hitherto, and have                    a   few thousand
tons of rubbish accumulated                     over them    ;   in which     case who could
even guess what size they might or might not be.                               In either   case

374                 Proceedings of the Royal Society
the powers of the Great Pyramid's base-side, for accuracy and last
ing quality combined, would probably               be  found vastly above those
of any standard       of measure at present known to              be possessed by
any nation in Christendom.
  PYRAMID ALLEGED TO BE A SUPERHUMAN, AND MORE
      OR LESS AN INSPIRED, METROLOGICAL ERECTION.
    To the above very serious title the Proceedings' author arrives in
the last section      of his paper (p. 268) ; and seems to decide that
Khaliph Al       Mamoon by breaking in, " upset the supposititious
" miracle,"
                (of the Great Pyramid,           as begun    to be interpreted    by
the late John Taylor), " a thousand               years ago ;" also, that some
thing else was recently discovered              in the building, " some thou-
" sand
          years too late for the evolution of the alleged miraculous
 "arrangement;" and finally, that Professor Smyth has been
" wrongously and
                        disparagingly attributing to Divine Inspiration
"  and aid, things that are imperfect and human."
    When from nearly first to last, in that over remarkable                    paper
in the Proceedings         (the second of the two papers on which I
have been discoursing this evening),* there has now been shown
proof that it is characterised          by erroneous        statements, perverted
meanings,     unworthy insinuations, and denials of some of the most
commonly      known principles of arithmetic, and most widely followed
 methods of physical science, — the members                of the Royal Society
may see, that there is no possibility of my discussing                the Pyramid
question generally with that gentleman               on scientific grounds.
    As little can   I  attempt to do so on a religious foundation.             Allu
 sion indeed to all religious argument the Society ordinarily eschews,
 though the Proceedings' author was allowed to introduce                 it into his
pages 267 and 268, besides inserting several rather scoffing                     and
derisive passages at pp. 254, 256, 260, and 264.                 But even though
the Society should give me equal liberty to answer, — no discussion
of   a peaceful,  improving kind can          be   instituted without some first
   * Tho present   essay, especially in its latter half, was much shortened on the
occasion of reading before the Society on April 20, in order to bring it within
the limits of time allowed.      All the leading remarks of it were, however,
noted, and are now again brought        forth   with  fuller materials  for proof or
disproof.

                         of Edinburgh,         Session 1867-68.                             375
 principles being agreed on.             And    as the     rationalistic doctrines, and
 a   priori   theories laid down         by the Proceedings'            author, are totally
 opposed to my inductive gatherings of what are the characteristics
 of the only generally admitted example of Divine Inspiration, viz.,
 the Sacred Scriptures, — I decline to argue that part of the question
 with that gentleman at all.
   To the Society, therefore, only would                   I   appeal, — after what they
 have already printed and published,                — earnestly inquiring of            them
 why they patronize arguments                  which,     if   of force against the sup
 posed primeval, and pre-Biblical, Inspiration                        of the design of the
 Great Pyramid, are of equal force against the Bible itself?
   How, for instance, can it be justly maintained by those who hold
 to the Bible, that       Al Mamoon's breaking into the Great Pyramid,
 and exercising a        power over      it,
                                      to injure   — proves the structure
                                                               it,
 not to have been built originally by Divine Inspiration,                     — when the
 Bible relates that the Temple of Solomon, though actually built.                  so
 or according to plans furnished in number and measure by Divine
 Inspiration,        was nevertheless     destroyed by the Babylonians, and its
sacred vessels carried away, to be used in the service                       of idols   ;   and
 now, together with the Ark of the Covenant,                          they have vanished
from the surface of the earth            ?
     Does any one venture           to assert       that       Al Mamoon "      upset the
" miracle of the Great Pyramid by, as some say, unveiling, thou-                   a
" sand years before the appointed time, the contents of the King's
" Chamber?" Let such persons first prove that Al Mamoon did
unveil,       or even    see,   any of   those contents          which    are supposed       to
have been above the powers of unassisted men to have constructed
intentionally at the date of the Pyramid's foundation, — viz., the
earth and heaven commensurabilities of the Pyramid's several parts.
These proportions have only begun to be thus recognized, so far as
I    know, within the last         10 years     ;   and    Al Mamoon         no more saw
them or published them to the world,                           when    he broke into the
Pyramid      brute violence in 830 a.d., — than did Pompey, when
                by
he burst into the Holy of Holies in Jerusalem, see that presence
into which he would have forced himself impiously.
   Does the critic object, — that modern men find such exceeding
difficulty in trying to ascertain the exact lengths and breadths of
the various symbolical parts of the Pyramid, — that they settle, and
     vol. vi.   •                                                              3c

 376                  Proceedings of the Royal Society
 consider     themselves      entitled to settle thereby, that the structure
 could not have had an all-wise prompter,          planner, or designer   ;
                                                                            — let
 the critic confess whether there are not many words and passages
 both in the Hebrew and Greek Scriptures, on which neither divines
nor scholars       have yet been able to come to a         full understanding,
and where they are          still bringing forth their various readings!
   Or, because the Great Pyramid has not been successfully inter
preted by mankind during so long a period as 4000 years; or because,
during all that space of time its presumed mission               has not been
accomplished        in the world,       and so many centuries     have passed
away      fruitlessly since the       seed was sown, in an age before any
human       intellectual history began, — shall that be considered       a good
Biblical reason against there having been Inspiration at the begin
ning, and against a Divinely intended result still to appear, — seeing
that the Bible has announced many prophecies, which are not yet
fulfilled ; and tells us repeatedly of mysteries which were prepared
for, from      the very     beginning of the world, and yet only made
manifest in latter times?
   But    I will  not attempt to follow any further, or to set in order,
the arguments of which there are so many, connected with Revealed
religion    ;
              — for I am   too much grieved and humbled to find, that the
most conscientious         labours    and the justest deductions   that I   have
been working at for years past, and whereby          I had  hoped to be instru
mental in affording to some other earnest thinkers a ray of light
on a sacred, as well as a scientific, topic,       — have issued before the
Society merely in this, that my labours, their subject, and my friend's
religious convictions have all been dragged contemptuously in the
dirt, and made a mockery of, in the fearful manner accomplished
by the Proceedings' author.
   Of Revealed Religion therefore          I will not presume to say more in
this assembly       :   and   I  hope pardon    may be extended      to me for
what    I  have said,    if  imperfectly, or mistakenly, yet with the best
intentions.
   But    I would     beg, before concluding, to remind the members, one
and all, of a remark          by the notable     Kepler, bearing on Natural
Theology. The existing state of our Great Pyramid knowledge is
very similar to what prevailed with regard to astronomy in the time
of that acutest genius of mediaeval Germany ; for, observations were

                    of Edinburgh, Session 1867-68.                                   377
then rough,     and rude hypotheses            succeeded each other           as   found
from time to time best adapted to explain all the known facts, and
were not yet worked up into a complete theory.
   So many failures had at that time already taken place, that when
success did come at last, hardly any one would believe                         Kepler's
brilliant discovery of the elliptical motion of the planets.                         His
friends would hardly allow that he was sound in his mind; and yet
his discovery proved the morning star of the epoch of the Law of
Gravitation.     They ridiculed and despised              :  but thus he comforted
himself in    a knowledge         of the reality, and        a presentiment       of the
importance,     of what     he had        learned   ;  and with      an   intellectual
enthusiasm,    not often     seen to an equal degree in the present day
of a more delicate education, he thus breathes forth his noble
spirit : —
   " Nothing holds me.              I will                                       If
                                             indulge my       sacred  fury  !        you
" forgive   me,  I rejoice       if                     I   can bear it.    The die is
                            ;        you are angry,
" cast.    The book is written, to          be read   either now, or by posterity.
"  I care not which.       It    may well wait a century for a reader, since
" God has waited 6000
                                years for an observer 1"
   Not more than 4000 years has the solution of the mystery of the
Great Pyramid waited          ;   but yet what an interval is that, as mea
sured by nations and peoples, and languages and tongues.                      Through
all that mighty period, what other building than the Great Pyra
mid has brought down to us in the present day a symbolical lan
guage of forms, and accurate             details  capable of      still giving forth
exact, contemporary,       and high scientific information of that early
time?
   Surely the Great Pyramid building                  is unique in its majesty.
Take it all in all, it is solemnly alone          !
   The second author in the Society's Proceedings referred to does,
indeed, indicate in his very last sentence, p. 268, that he knows
of just  as good traces    of equally advanced " architecture and astro-
" nomy " belonging         to the       same age,      " in various parts
                                                                                  of the
" East."    I  can only hope that the Council will examine him on
that point ; — for, according to the best of my researches among
the writings of those who have explored the Eastern lands — no such
examples have there been found.

    F.L.S.
   In  the first part of this paper the anatomy        and physiology of
the Ommatopleans       is described from the typical form 0. alba, the
variations and peculiarities presented by other genera and species
being contrasted therewith. The descriptions are grouped under
the   following    heads   : — Dermal Tissues   ;  Proboscidian      Sheath  ;
Proboscis;    Digestive, Circulatory, and Nervous Systems ; Cephalic
Furrows, Pits, and Glands ; Organs of Reproduction and Develop
ment.
   The second part consists of the structure and physiology of the
Borlasians, under the same (or similar) heads ; together with such
anomalous genera as differ from both great groups of Nemerteans.
   The third division treats chiefly of the structure of certain         (up
 wards of forty) Annelids new to science or to Britain.

392              Proceedings of the Royal Society
                     Monday, 1th December 1868.
Professor Christison, the President, delivered the following
                           Opening Address : —
    Gentlemen, — It ia now nearly five -and -forty years since          I first
opened my lips in this Society, a venturous young man, undertak
ing to instruct both practical men and men of science,             as well   as
the   public    at large,   all at the time keenly interested          in the
inquiry, — What      were    the  principles for properly constructing
burners for combustion      of the light-giving gases?       What the rela
tive values of oil-gas and coal-gas for giving out light, and which
of the two should thenceforth be used for illuminating the world?
At that time it    was assuredly the farthest thing of all from             my
dreams that a period might come round when, by the voices of my
 Fellow-Members,      I should be promoted to an office, the highest in
learning or science, as the case may be, which Scotland can offer
to their votaries, — held last by Sir David Brewster, and previously
filled by the Duke of Argyll, Sir Thomas Brisbane, Sir Walter
Scott, and   Sir James Hall.
    All these eminent men have been Presidents of the Royal Society
of Edinburgh during the period of my Fellowship, except the last :
 whom, however,     I  often met in the literary and scientific circles of
 which my father was       a member.     When    I  recall the remarkable
 services of these five men to learning and science        ; their contribu
 tions to the meetings and Transactions of this Society          ; their bear
 ing among its Fellows, and the universal homage paid to them as
                        I
 our official heads, — am apt to ask myself why it is that am now   I
 in the place previously adorned by such men           as these ?     To this
 question  I have  but one answer, and     it may be an inadequate        one.
 The office was not of my seeking.          It was not within the range
 of my hopes, or even of my thoughts.          But when my appointment
 to the Presidentship of the Society was spontaneously         recommended
 to the Society by the Council,      I felt that  I  could not but bow to
 their decision, as being the persons best qualified to know what is
  most for the advantage of the Society, and having undoubtedly
 reasons, sufficient to their own minds, for placing in me, for the
 due discharge of the duties of your President, a confidence             which

                    of Edinburgh, Session        18(58-69.                 393
  I can  truthfully say   I do not myself entertain.        And nevertheless,
  having undertaken     these duties, and possessing some knowledge          of
  what they are,   I must hope to discharge them to your satisfaction,
  with the help of a    willing mind,    a grateful heart, and your indul
  gence.
     While pondering over these reflections,           it occurred   to me to
 inquire whether any mark had been left on the work of this Society
 by my several predecessors in office.        It  was,   I confess, some com
 fort to me to find that at all periods     the work done in the Society
 depended more on the Vice-Presidents,             the Secretaries,    and the
 other members of Council, as well as the Fellows at large, than upon
 your President for the time being;          who may have felt, perhaps,
 that, having generally done good work previously in an inferior
 capacity, he might be allowed to repose a         little on his dignity, and
 transfer    much   of the arduous      labour of literary and scientific
 research to those enjoying the inestimable advantages of greater
 vigour of life, and   a younger enthusiasm.
    In the   course of my searches into this matter,       I had to go farther
 back than my personal         recollections, even to the Presidency of
 Henry, Duke of Buccleuch, and thus was imperceptibly led into
the midst of the earliest      proceedings   of the Soeiety, when it first
 started into existence     in 1783  as the  Royal Society of Edinburgh,
 under the leadership of that distinguished nobleman.               The study
of the      Proceedings and Transactions of the Society during his
Presidentship, which lasted         for the long term         of twenty-eight
years    till his death   in 1811, seized upon me with a fascination
which no one can thoroughly understand                without following    my
example.       But it has seemed to me that      I  might convey some por
tion of the pleasure of that retrospect were        I  to summarise and cull
the interesting and very diverse materials thus presented to view,
and offer you, as my Address on the present             occasion, a history of
some portion at least        of the Life of the Royal Society of Edin
burgh.
    The History of our Society has never yet been written. But it
is a duty owing to our predecessors, who earned for it a great
reputation, that some time soon such          a  history should be written.
The task, however, is one which will need the labour of several
hands— the materials being, as already said, so very multifarious.

All I  can pretend to do, with the small        ability and little leisure of
which   I can avail myself,   is to attempt, in a desultory way, as much
at present as my time admits of my overtaking, and yours               of your
listening to.      But   I have some hope, nevertheless, that so much
may be said as to induce my able coadjutors,           who annually in suc
cession address you from       the Chair, to look also a      little into the
materials   I have   been examining, and to show, by each taking up
that branch of our history which is most allied to his pursuits and
congenial to his inclinations, the various branches of learning and
science on which our Society has more or less shed its rays during
the last eighty-five years, — the most eventful era, probably, that
has occurred in the literary and scientific history of this nation.
   It is scarcely necessary to remind you that the Royal Society of
Edinburgh was created mainly through the influence of Principal
Robertson,    from a pre-existing     association   of the most illustrious
Scotsmen     of the time, called the Philosophical          Society   ; which
again had arisen, through the exertions of Colin Maclaurin, from a
combination of learned and scientific men who published between
1731 and 1739 the       " Medical Essays    and Observations."
   The Royal Society, in its early years, was chiefly composed of the
following remarkable galaxy of genius and talent: — Between 1783
and 1805 we find,       in the branch   of Literature, and most of them
taking their share in the business of the Society,            the names of
Principal Robertson, the Rev. Drs Hugh Blair, Carlyle, and
Henry; Professors Hill, Dalzel, Ferguson and Fraser-Tytler of
Edinburgh, Beatty of Aberdeen,         Hunter of St Andrews, and Young
of Glasgow     ;  Dr Doig of Stirling, Henry Mackenzie, and William
Smellie.     In    Philosophy — Adam Smith,         Thomas Reid, Dugald
Stewart, and     John Bruce. In Mathematics and Physics — Professors
Matthew Stewart, John Hobison, Robert Blair, John Playfair,
John Leslie, and William Wallace, of Edinburgh ; John Anderson
of Glasgow, and James Ivory. In Chemistry — Black, Rutherford,
Hope, Roebuck, and Lord Dundonald.              In  the  Natural Sciences —
Professors Walker and John Hope, Hutton, Playfair, and Colonel
Imray. In Medicine — Cullen, the second Monro, James Gregory,
Francis Home, Andrew Duncan, Sir Gilbert Blane, and Benjamin
Bell ; and to these must be added a host of conspicuous lawyers

                    of Edinburgh,       Session 1868-69.                  395
and country gentlemen          of the time, all more or less conversant
with literary or scientific pursuits, among whom               the most con
spicuous    were Lord-President        Dundas, Lord Justice-Clerk Miller,
Lords Meadowbank and Glenlee, Barons Montgomery, Norton, and
Hume, Sir Henry          Campbell, Sir James Hall of Dunglass,             Sir
George Clerk Maxwell of Penicuick,           Sir Alexander Dick of Preston-
field, Sir George Mackenzie of Coull, Sir James Hunter Blair of
Dunskey, Sir William Forbes of Pitsligo, and John Clerk of
Eldin.
    It will be acknowledged       to be difficult to discover in any country,
and at any period, united in a single association, sixty names more
remarkable than these for the impression              they have made on the
peaceful part of the history of a nation.
    The medical element of the Society was in those days peculiarly
rich in great names.          This was the element, too, from which the
Society originally sprung.          We should therefore naturally expect
medicine to flourish in a Society descended                from   the medical
essayists of the middle of last century.           But medicine makes only
a rare, and for the most part insignificant appearance in the busi
ness   of the Royal Society.        It is a matter of curiosity, however, to
see how, even so far down as 1792, when very much                smothered by
literature and pure science, medicine still sometimes cropped out
in naked simplicity.       Among the early papers read in the Society,
Dr Hope      describes   a disagreeable case of death from impaction of
a gall-stone in the bile-ducts      ; Dr Butter of London proclaims hem
lock to be a sovereign cure for St Vitus's dance ; Dr Duncan inti
mates that he had cured an inveterate hiccup with a single dose of
diluted sulphuric acid      ;  at a later period,   Mr James Russell, after
wards    Professor Russell, a well-known colleague, communicates a
singular case of hernia, and Dr Francis Home treats of the disease
Amaurosis.       If  this be all which medicine         could do in its most
palmy days in Edinburgh to hold up its head in the Royal Society,
I confess    it is not   a subject of regret that, by gradual        and tacit
consent, papers on pure medical practice have been allowed to drop
from our Proceedings.           For assuredly there is nothing at all       so
remarkable or peculiarly instructive in death from an impacted
gall-stone, or from any form of hernia, as to deserve being re

 396              Proceedings of the Royal Society
 corded in the Proceedings of a Royal Society      ; nor would    I advise
 patient or physician to trust much either to Dr Butter's cure for
 St Vitus's dance, or to the remedy which seemed to Dr Duncan to
 put an end to inveterate     hiccup.  The first volume of our Trans
 actions,  however,   contains one able paper on      a  subject of pure
 practical medicine — a treatise by an eminent English physician of
 last century,   Dr Hamilton of Lynn-Regis,      upon the Mumps, or
 Cynanche parotidaea,    a disease  which had previously been little
 studied  in England.     But this treatise was originally produced to
 the Philosophical Society in 1773, and the Royal Society, deeming
it worthy of publication, printed it in the Transactions.
    In the more congenial fundamental sciences of medicine, ana
tomy and physiology, the work done in the Society in its early
years presents features of greater interest.    Mr Blizard of London
gives an account of an extra-uterine foetus;      Dr Monro describes     a
 remarkable    male monster; investigates    the anatomy     of hydroce
phalus; inquires into the communications existing between the
ventricles of the brain — a field in which he had long before been       a
 famous discoverer; explains the action       of those muscles      which
consist   of oblique fibres; and narrates the results of experiments,
among the earliest made in this country, in 1792, confirmatory of
the immortal discovery by G-alvani of galvanic, or, as it was then
called, animal electricity.   The investigations of Dr Francis Home
on the relative strength of tonics, and his medical experiments        on
foxglove, read in the Society, but published in a separate treatise,
show that there is another fundamental branch of medicine proper —
therapeutics,   which may be cultivated,   as a science,   by physiologi
cal experiment,    as well as by mere observation    of empirical facts;
and   until this view be taken generally by physicians of the true
method of studying the action of remedies, medicine will make but
little progress in this the most important of all its departments.
    There  are  other medical inquiries of interest to   be found in the
Society's early Proceedings and Transactions, such      as  Dr Alexander
Wilson's paper on the action of opium      on animals,    and that of Dr
James Johnston      on the functions and diseases of the lymphatic
glands.    But  I hasten from these and other inquiries, which might
be usefully put in detail before a medical audience, to other topics
of more general interest.

                    of Edinburgh,      Session 1868-69.                     397
     Before doing so,    I  will venture to touch for one moment on a
                          —
  rather delicate topic the connection of the Society in its early
  days with theological subjects of discussion      — because    I find at that
  time an incident which might have helped the Council                  and the
 Society when     a question was lately raised as to this matter.            In
  1791 and   1792 the Rev.      Dr Ogilvy of Midmar read no less than
 three successive papers on the Theology of Plato, whereupon              there
 occurs the following minute :— " The Society observed with regret
 that the discussion     of  a religious nature, contained in this learned
 communication,      rendered    an admission     of it among their papers
 inconsistent with their plan ; and therefore it was not put into the
 hands of the Committee for publication."             If it was found neces
 sary to discourage such discussions in 1790, it is not less so in these
days, when     religious differences     are not less general, diverse, and
 keen.    Appealed to on a recent occasion to state the law or usage
of the Society on this subject, the Council had only one difficulty ;
 which was to define what amounted to the nature of a theological
communication.        It   would   be clearly absurd, for example, to say
that when a scientific observation or inquiry threw light upon a
scripture   fact,  or some incident in scripture         history, the author
should be debarred from calling attention, in passing,               to such a
practical   application of his inquiries.         On the     other   hand,   no
Fellow of the Society would probably ever dream of introducing
into it an express dissertation        on a pure theological theme.         Be
tween these extremes there must be a           limit which ought not to be
crossed, and which      it must be left in the first place to every man's
discretion   to observe ; but if it be passed,       I  apprehend that it is
still the duty of the Society, or its Council acting by its authority,
to see   that the offending communication,           as  of old,  " be  not put
into the hands     of the Committee for publication."
    The first twenty years of the life of the Society is rich in literary
inquiries.    I  venture to hope that some time soon, a literary Vice-
President will undertake to tell us something of these communica
tions, both on account of the information they contain, and for the
sake of the   light they throw upon the character, in point of learning,
of their authors,     who were among        the most learned Scotsmen of
the period.     It appears    that no fewer than thirty-eight        papers on

398               Proceedings of the Royal Society
literary subjects were read at the Society's meetings, and are in
general either summarised or published at length in the first six
volumes of the Transactions.        The most material are ten Gramma
tical papers by Dalzel,    Hill, Hunter, Young,     and Gregory, chiefly;
one Etymological by     Dr Jamieson ; three Critical, on the ./Eneid, by
Beatty, the character of Hamlet by Dr T. Robertson, and the
German theatre, by Henry Mackenzie ; three on Historical Com
position by Hill and Fraser Tytler ; three General Dissertations
connected with the subject of poetry, by Dalzel and Hill ; on the
Standard of Taste, by Dalzel      ; on the Principles of Translation,     by
Fraser- Tytler;    on the Argonautic       Expedition,    by the Rev. Mr
Marshall of Cockpen ; on the Origin of the Hellenes and of their
name, by Dr Doig, of Stirling, who traces the Greeks to Chaldea;
on Written    Language    as a Sign of Speech, by Dr Hutton ; four Eth
nological papers,  —  1. By Dr Gregory, on a Lacustrine Fort in Loch
Urr, Kirkcudbrightshire ; 2. By Colonel Montgomery, on an Ancient
Sculptured Stone in Coilsfield; 3. By Fraser-Tytler, on the Vitrified
Forts in the Highlands;     4. By Dr Anderson,     on the Ancient Circular
Buildings, or Houses of Scotland      ;  and last, and one   of the chief of
all, the elaborate researches of Chevalier into the Plain of Troy,
read by the author himself to the Society in 1791, and published
in   extenso in the French      language,   in the third volume of the
Society's Transactions.      I   must leave to the literary members        of
your number to say, whether there is not, in these diversified papers,
rare materials for such a historical summary of the work done at
our meetings of old     as I have   indicated.    I  myself can only aim
 for the present at  a brief allusion to the remarkable      investigations
of Chevalier.
    Doubts have often been raised, and keen controversy has arisen
 among the learned, as to the reality of the existence of a Homer in
poetry, an ancient Troy in geography, and a Trojan war in history.
 Chevalier, by his careful personal survey of the plain of Troy and
its neighbourhood, contributed much to dispel these doubts, in so
far as he ascertained    that the leading incidents described        in the
Iliad fall in exactly with the remarkable structure of the Plain and
surrounding country ; thus furnishing internal evidence that the
composer of the Iliad must have been intimately acquainted with
 the district where the Trojan war was carried on.         It is only in the

                     of Edinburgh,    Session 1868-69.                  399
  most recent times that writers of romance have thought it worth
  their while to know and portray the natural features of the places
  where the incidents they invent are represented to have occurred.
  It is a matter of doubt, whether even the most recent and scrupu
  lous works of the kind could stand successfully       so minute   a topo
  graphical scrutiny    as that to which the Iliad has been subjected    by
  Chevalier and others since his time.       But it is scarcely to be sup
  posed that a composer       of mere fiction, in  so remote   a period  of
 antiquity and barbarism, and when intercommunication between
 countries was rare and difficult, would, as must be held by the
 advocates    of the Iliad being a romance, undertake      so troublesome
 and unnecessary      a condition in those days, for  a work of the ima
 gination,    as a  minute personal   study of a wide and complex field
 of strife, which he chose for the theatre of          a romance.     It  is
 impossible, therefore,      to deny that the researches     of Chevalier
 added greatly to the pre-existing      probability that Homer was an
 entity, and the siege of Troy an event, in real history.
    The main features of Chevalier's Tableau de la Plaine        de Troye,
 remain undisputed to the present         day, save one, and rather an
 important one, the actual site of ancient Troy itself.           Our late
 much-esteemed       Fellow,    Mr Charles Maclaren, without having
visited the plain (though he did so subsequently), called in question
the conclusion at which Chevalier arrived as to the position of the
town    for the possession of which Homer's heroes fought. The
district may be briefly described as a plain about eight miles long
and five miles     in breadth, stretching from the westerly       spurs of
mount Ida to the ^Egean Sea, bounded on the north and south by
ridges of moderate elevation, and separated from the ^Egean by a
line of low heights, except at the mouth of the river Mindere or
Simois.      Chevalier placed the site of ancient Troy near the south
east angle of the plain, in the lower region of the bounding ridge
on the south, and describes traces of ancient walls in this locality,
close to a modern        Turkish village, Bounarbashi.      But Maclaren
points out that this position, — nine miles from the coast, where the
Greeks were encamped, with their vessels drawn up on shore, — is
much too great for the time allowed by Homer for certain incidents
of the war which took place between the two limits, the town and
the ships; and bringing to his aid the knowledge of a skilful geolo-

gist to explain changes, evident to such an eye, which in the
course of ages may have taken place in the channels of the rivers
and the structure of their banks        since the time     of the siege, he
arrives at the result, that the site   of the ancient town was the     same
with that of Strabo's    Novum Ilium.       There is a long tongue         of
wide, elevated    land, steep on the sides, but not precipitous,      which
stretches from the lower heights of mount         Ida for more than two
miles westward      into the very heart of the plain of Troy.           The
western terminal portion of this ridge was the site of Novum
Ilium   ; the ground-plan of which is      still indicated by remains of
walls, and by such an accumulation of broken          bricks and shattered
porcelain all over the surface, that when friends of mine visited the
place, while    in the army medical service at Renkioi Hospital,
during the late Turkish war, they found it a troublesome matter to
measure the ground, by pacing through the covering of loose frag
ments.     Now, it is scarcely to be conceived that, when the people
of the country, represented by Homer to          be  well acquainted with
the art of defensive fortification, determined to erect a fortified
town for the protection of their territory, they would overlook this
conspicuous    spot, eminently suitable for all the conditions of refuge
and defence in these early times, and would choose rather a remote
corner of their land, leaving the whole       cultivated plain between it
and the sea open to sudden        piratical incursions.      But on other
grounds than this     Mr Maclaren has proved, to the satisfaction of all
scholars who have studied the subject since, that Troy and Novum
Ilium must have stood on nearly the same site.             I may mention,
as a new argument       in support of that view, that Dr        Kirk, one of
the visitors referred to, found Chevalier's supposed foundations       of an
cient walls at Bounarbashi to     be  really the remains of trap-dykes.
    So far Chevalier has been corrected.       But the criticisms of Mac
laren do not take away from the light which Chevalier was the first
to throw over the most interesting of all events described as occur
ring in remote secular history.
    Among the literary labours of the Society must           be  arranged a
crowd of authentic biographies       of the most eminent Scotsmen          of
the time,    Fellows of the Society, written by men generally not
less distinguished than those whom they have commemorated.
Th is is  a branch   of the Proceedings of the Society which it is im

possible to summarise.        But  I  have alluded to   it on account of    a
very surprising statement       in the biography of Sir George Clerk
Maxwell     of Penicuick, father of our lately deceased Fellow, Sir
George Clerk, which was read in 1784 by John Clerk, junior, of
Eldin, afterwards Lord Eldin of the Scottish bench. The author
says, Sir George
                    " had an excellent taste for the fine arts, and was
solicitous to encourage them.        As one instance of this, he had the
principal concern in establishing and procuring an endowment for
the drawing-school in the University of Edinburgh, where twenty
pupils are instructed gratis in the art of designing.            These are
selected from among such young people of either sex as give signs
of genius, who are destined to apply to those professions in which
a skill in that art is requisite. This institution has contributed
more than any other circumstance to the great improvement of
ornamental manufactory which this country has made during the
last twenty years. And who ever recollects the old patterns of
carpet,   damask,    gauze,   and other manufactures      of that sort, and
compares     them    with those of the present day, must allow the
superior elegance of design now exhibited in these productions,
and which may be reasonably ascribed          in  a great   measure to the
happy effects produced by the institution we have mentioned." —
Trans- i. 51.
   It  is impossible    that Mr Clerk,     himself an ardent admirer of
art, and addressing      a Society composed largely of Professors of the
University, could      be  mistaken in making this precise statement.
 Nevertheless,    I  never heard of such a school in the University.
There was most assuredly no such school in existence when I first
joined it  as a student    in 1811.    It cannot have merged in the pre
sent excellent School of Design, because that school, as now con
stituted, was founded       only in recent times   ; and to several    of its
governors this passage from       Sir George Clerk Maxwell's biography
has seemed quite as novel and surprising as to myself.                What,
then, has become of the University School?            When did it expire ?
 How did it vanish?         Above all, what has become of the endow
ment? All I can say upon the last head is that positively it has
 not been swallowed      up by the Senatus Academicus since       I  became
a member     of that body in 1822.*
   * The statement of Mr Clerk    seems to be explained  by an observation, to

402               Proceedings of the Royal Society
  Philosophy seldom ventured to appear before the Royal Society.
In 1784 Dugald Stewart read an essay on Cause and Effect, an,l
in the same session Dr Gregory read another on Cause and Effect
in Physics.      But of neither is       there even an           abstract      in    the
Society's Proceedings.
   The Chemical papers produced before the Society during the
first twenty years of its existence— sixteen in number — are not so
numerous as we might expect, when            it is considered that the             great
discovery by Black of the composition of the carbonates, and the
nature of carbonic acid, was still of rather recent date. But some
of these papers are of interest, and retain their value in the                      pre
sent day.      The most important of them are as follows             :—
   That remarkable      genius,   Lord Dundonald, father of the lately
deceased naval     hero, read in 1784 a characteristic inquiry into the
purification of sea-salt.    Having found that           a concentrated            solu
tion of common sea-salt      possesses   the property of dissolving a large
quantity of the magnesian         salts, which are always to be found in
it in small proportion, — rendering       it,   however,      attractive of mois
ture in damp air, and less fit for the curing of meat, — he placed
the salt to be purified in conical filter, and passed through
                             a                                 two             it
or three successive portions of   concentrated hot solution of the
                                    a
same impure salt, with the effect of removing almost entirely the
salts   of magnesia.     This method was plainly applicable to                      the
large manufacturing scale     ;   and the       inventor had only,        as   in the
purification    of loaf-sugar by pure           syrup,   to   displace       the last
saline liquor remaining in the interstices of the salt, by               a   solution
of pure chloride of sodium, when the whole of his product would
have been quite pure.
  Drs Black and Hutton being appointed with                   Mr Russell       a   com
mittee to examine and report on          a   process proposed for manufac
turing spirit from carrots by two enterprising experimentalists,
Hunter and Thornby, they find that twenty tons of this root yield
which my attention has been turned in Hugo Arnot'a " History of Edin
      "
burgh    (1789, p. 323), that the Board of Trustees   for Encouragement of
Manufactures appointed an artist in 1772 to teach twenty boys or girls draw
ing, and obtained for the purpose, from the Town Council, the nse of two
rooms in the University. (Dec. 14.}

                    of Edinburgh,         Session 1868-69.                        403
two hundred gallons of proof-spirit, equal in quality and cheapness
to the best sort of corn-spirit.         It   is easy, through action of recti
fied spirit on extract of carrot-juice, to crystallise from            it fine cane-
sugar,    which    will   account     for this result.         But the       Society's
records do not state anywhere           what success the inventors attained
with their new manufacture.
    Dr Kennedy, well known              and    esteemed     at  the   period     as a
chemical analyst, contributes          a   careful analysis of      u new      Zeolite
from   the greenstone of Salisbury Crags,             showing that       it   consists
ulmost    entirely of silica, lime, and        S J- per cent- of soda       ;  and   in
1798 he communicates           a much       more    interesting account of the
composition of basalt, greenstone,             and lava.     In  the latter paper
be comes to the conclusion, that the basalts and greenstones around
Edinburgh,      and   the   lavas    around      Etna, all agree both in the
nature and the proportion of their main constituents, which are
silica, alumina, and oxide of iron, with, in all, about              4 per cent-     of
soda.    The interest of these facts, in their application to the pre
vailing geological doctrines of that period,            as well as  of the present
time, will be seen presently, and, indeed, is obvious                  on the bare
mention of them.
    In  1791  Dr Black presents his last communication to the Royal
Society, his famous analysis of the spouting hot springs of Geyser
and Rykum in Iceland.           In  the Transactions this important paper
is accompanied       by another     from     Mr Stanley of Alderley, M.P.,
from whom Black obtained            the waters for examination, and who
himself collected them during            a  visit to Iceland in 1789.           There
has appeared      since   that time no better account of these extra
ordinary springs than that given by Mr Stanley, and in some                        re
spects it surpasses more recent narratives             in complete and graphic
description.     I  know not, indeed, that any subsequent visitor has
added much to our knowledge            until our deceased Fellow, Mr Alex
ander Bryson, communicated            to this Society his excellent thermo-
metric observations      on the very high temperature             attained by the
waters at great depths in the funnel whence they are projected.
In Black's    time geologists      and chemists were puzzled to account
for the solution in the water of the great amount of silica neces
sary to form the extensive        deposits of hard siliceous         sinter around
these fountains.       Black's analysis gave the explanation.                  Of the

404                    Proceedings of the Royal Society
eight grains in the Rykum water, and ten grains in the Geyser
water, of solids in 10,000, Black showed that about one-half con
sisted of silica dissolved           by soda    ;    that the soda amounted to half
a grain in the former, and a whole                     grain in the latter       ;    that it
was the means          of dissolving more than six times its own weight
of silica; and he conjectured              that this great dissolving power              was
partly communicated              by very high heat, existing where the process
of solution was constantly going on.
   In 1793, in a postscript to the Proceedings of the Society for
that year, Dr Hope produces his well-known discovery of the
mineral strontianite, his analysis of his discovery of the new
                                                       it,
earth,     strontia, and his investigation                   of the properties        of the
earth itself and its compounds.                 This paper, which at once estab
lished for him         a   great name among chemists, and was given to the
world when he was quite              a   young man, supplies internal evidence
that Dr Hope possessed in an eminent degree all the qualifications
for   profound analyst and discoverer — patience, inventiveness,
      a
accuracy,        and acute       discrimination.         The wonder        — which all
                                                                         is,
his scientific friends have felt, but no one has thoroughly explained
to his own satisfaction,          — that with this first-rate investigation,             and
at the mere outset of scientific life,                Dr Hope's career    as an analyst
both began and ended.                New earths, new alkalies, new acids, new
metals, were constantly announced from all sides around                              by those
engaged on the same field which he had shown he could                            fruitfully
cultivate.         But Dr          Hope    never       undertook     another     chemical
analysis.
   In     1788    Sir James Hall read an exposition of Lavoisier's new
Theory of Chemistry, being probably                      the first account       given in
Scotland of that philosopher's great discoveries.                     Soon afterwards
Hutton read        a   reply to Lavoisier and Sir James Hall, in an                     essay
on Phlogiston.  Both papers are lost to the world for, at the time   ;
when they were read, authors did not desire to print, and the Society
did not publish, either in its Proceedings or its Transactions,
scientific papers of         a   merely critical nature.         We can easily under
stand, however, how stoutly Hutton would at that period                              stand up
for the existence of phlogiston             ;       which, nevertheless, was doomed
to die    a   sudden death at the hands of the French executioner.
   In     1796    Dr Hutton, in                          "
                                      a   paper entitled         A   New Phenomenon

                    of Edinburgh,      Session 1868-69.                      405
in the Sulphurating of Metals," proves that when sulphur and iron
are heated together, and combine to form the sulphide of iron, tho
process is one not of inflammation,        as  might appear on     a hasty sur
vey of the phenomenon,          but of incandescence,       which    lasts only
during the short time combination goes on, and without any of the
essentials of combustion.        He annexes some inferences in respect
to the connection       between heat and light, which          I  may have to
 revert to under a future     head, as in some measure anticipating a
 great modern doctrine.       The experiment, a striking one, has been
 rendered long familiar in consequence of Dr Hope, who assisted
 Hutton in this inquiry, having constantly made it the subject
 of brilliant demonstration       in his lectures,     as many     of us must
  well remember.
      In  1800  Sir George    Mackenzie        presented   to   the    Society   a
  very conclusive     inquiry  as to the      combustion     of the diamond.
  It   had been burnt,    and its nature deduced from the product,              in
  various complex ways, by several eminent            chemical    philosophers.
  But Sir George had the merit of showing how it might be con
  sumed in a simple muffle with unaided heat at 15° of Wedge-
  wood's pyrometer, — that steel might be made by heating iron in
  contact with its dust, — and that, by duly heating a mixture of pul
  verised iron with a fourth of its weight of diamond dust, a fused mass
  may be obtained which is quite undistinguishable from cast-iron.
       I conclude   these chemical     notices with a second        original in
  vestigation    of great excellence and interest by Dr Hope.               It ha3
   been long well known that, as water cools down from a mean
   temperature,    it contracts, and consequently         the cooled particles
   sink until the thermometer indicates about 39°-5 Fahr. ; that on
   farther cooling, however, this general law which regulates the
   cooling of liquids is upset ; that the water then actually expands,
   and consequently the cooled particles         now rise  ; and that this ex
   pansion continues,    till at 32° a much       greater expansion suddenly
    takes place, when the water is converted into ice. The contrary
    phenomena,     of course, occur    as water heats from        32°.     It con
    tracts till the temperature     rises to 39°-5, and after that        expands
    according to the general law.       But the fact of the density of water
    thus deviating from the general law which governs the influ
    ence of heat on liquids, had been often called in question by high

406                         Proceedings of the Boyal Society
authorities in chemical physics ; and among those who acknow
ledged the reality of the deviation there was irreconcilable dis
agreement            as    to    the    temperature          at    which in the          descending
scale the deviation begins.                    Hope in 1804 settled both                      points
by a set of               admirably contrived experiments, in which he took
the temperature              in various parts of a long column of water, — at
the bottom,           at the middle, and                near the surface,          — cold or heat
being applied              variably at these several                  points to         produce    the
necessary intestine movements                       among         the particles of the water.
The whole             paper       on    this subject is an                 admirable example        of
experimental reasoning,                   which         definitively         settled,   as   we now
know      it,   a   great fact in nature's laws              of much practical value in the
economy          of this earth, relative to the freezing and thawing of
water, and the influence of these changes                              in its condition on the
air, the land, and animal life.                      This was the second of Hope's
original researches, and the last                   ;    and again           our astonishment       is
raised that         it    should have been the last.
     In   the highest walks of Mathematics and Physics, the Proceed
ings of this Society have always abounded with important investi
gations.         No one can doubt that such must have been the                                    case
when      Robison, Playfair,             Leslie, Ivory, and Wallace took a large
share in the Society's business.                     But this         is
                                                                      a       branch    of my sub
ject to which        I      cannot myself do full justice                    ;   and time has not
sufficed for me to complete my undertaking by asking aid from my
well-qualified colleagues, who,                I     am sure, would have cheerfully
granted me their assistance.                   The papers are chiefly researches in
geometry and algebra of the most abstruse                                  kind.   But there       are
two of     a    different stamp         — on   the confines           between chemistry and
physics    — which          may be here shortly noticed, as they are the work
of one whose labours will call presently for                           a     larger share of our
attention.
     In  Dr Hutton communicates
          1794                                               a    dissertation " On the Philo
sophy of Light, Heat, and Fire."                                 In this inquiry         he reasons
against the existence of radiant heat, apart from light, which had
been      announced             recently before         as    an     important discovery by
Saussure and Pictet.                   Hutton maintained that the real radiation
is   of "invisible light"— light               so   faint         as not    to be cognisable by

                   of Edinburgh,        Session 1868-69.                  407
our senses.    In   the course    of his argument      he advances the pro
position that light is the     " immediate    cause  of burning," and that
the light which appears in combustion is         " the extrication of phlo
giston, fixed light, or    a certain modification of the solar substance
which had existed in the inflammable bodies, chemically united
with their elements."        Finally, he winds up with the doctrine that
"light,   heat,   phlogiston, and electricity,      are   so  many different
modifications of the solar substance."             Converting these "sub
stances" into qualities of matter,         and striking    out the lingering
remnant of phlogiston, we have here the modern                  doctrine that
heat, light, and electricity are mere varieties of the same quality          of
matter, and that the Sun is the primary source of them all.
   Theother chemico-physical paper is " on the Force Exerted by
Water in Freezing," deduced from some experiments made in Canada
in 1786 by Major Williams of the Royal Artillery.              He exposed to
intense frost   a thirteen-inch shell filled with water, and plugged by
an iron bolt.     The metal of the shell was about an inch and a-half
in thickness round the fuse-hole, and two inches and a quarter
opposite the hole    ;  and the plug, which weighed        two pounds and a
half, was driven into the hole with great force.           At  the moment of
freezing the plug was driven out with such violence           as to be carried
325, 387, and even 415 feet        ; and at the same moment         a  column
of ice was thrust out of the fuse-hole of the length of four, six, and
even eight inches and a half.         If the plug, however, was secured by
means   of springs, like spiking nails, the shell was split, and the ice
was thrust out in plates from the fissure.
   From its first foundation the Royal Society of Edinburgh has
been lavish in its contributions to the several departments                  of
Natural Science.        At least forty papers were read during the first
twenty years, and many of them have been published in the Trans
actions, on the branches of Zoology, Botany, Topography, Meteor
ology, Mineralogy, and Geology.
   In  the branch      of Zoology, however, there was extreme barren
ness at that period in the Society.           Mr Kerr, in 1790, notices an
"Animal ignotum" in the University Museum                ;  and this is all we
learn of the animal.         That astounding personage, the Great Sea
 Serpent,   makes his appearance once on our boards, under the
   vol. vi.                                                        3 a

and his mate, off the east coast of Scotland, on 5th August 1786.
This is all that the Society contributes before 1803 to the science
of Zoology.
    Belonging to Botany there are only six papers, of which five
possess interest.     Dr James Anderson of Madras describes, in 1791,
the Oldenlandia umbellata, from the root              of which is obtained in
India a valuable        red dye-stuff.      The Transactions for 1785-90
contain an excellent paper,            with   illustrative    drawings, by Dr
Wright, Physician-General            of the Army in Jamaica,              on   the
 Quassia   simaruba     of that island.      The root of that species,        now
the Simaruba officinalis,       was strongly recommended            by him    as a
 remedy for chronic dysentery,         and has   still great credit with many
 in the treatment        of that disease.      Dr Wright was the first to
 identify and accurately describe the tree, and did            so  in this  paper,
 which was read in 1778 in the Philosophical              Society, but was first
 published in the second volume of the Royal Society Transactions.
    In 1791, Mr John Lindsay, surgeon in Jamaica, communicates
 a paper connected      with the subject of the last-mentioned inquiry,
 on the Quassia      polygama      of Jamaica, describing the plant           as a
 magnificent tree       100 feet     high and     10   feet in   girth,  and    re
 presenting it to possess all the virtues of Quassia wood, the pro
 duce of the Quassia amara of Surinam.                He adds, he is credibly
 informed that the former is sold in London for the other.                 This is
 a curious   fact, as fixing the time when the true Quassia wood of
 the Quassia amara of existing botanists was displaced               in the mar
 kets of Europe by the wood of Lindsay's tree, the modern Picrama
 excclsa,  without either druggist or physician having noticed any
 difference in their virtues, or observed, until a few years ago, that
  the wood of a great forest tree had been substituted for that of a
 low bush about twelve feet in height.                Different views     may be
  taken of this apparent       blindness of the medical        profession.     For
  my part,  I recognise     in the whole incident an interesting proof of
  the resemblance      in action     on the   human      body among      different
  plants belonging to the same natural family.                For the great    tree
  of Jamaica, like the little bush of Surinam, is           a powerful, simply

bitter, tonic stomachic; and           I  believe    the two may be used in
differently for all medicinal purposes.             Mr Lindsay       is not so fortu
 nate  in   a  notice he has given          in the same paper of Cinchona
brachycarpa,      a   new Jesuits'-bark tree, and cure for intermittent
fever.    This is now known to be no true cinchona at all, and to
be  immeasurably behind the true cinchonas                  as a   febrifuge.     The
tree is now the Exostemma brachycarpa ; and,                 like all other species
of Exostemma, its bark is more emetic than anything else in point
of action — a property which, it is fair to say, had been recognised
in it by Mr Lindsay himself.
   Dr Hutton described in 1778,* and endeavours to explain, a
phenomenon of vegetation on Arthur's Seat, which still remains open
to further inquiry.        It   is well known to those who frequent                 the
upper regions of the       hill, that on various parts of the slope towards
the east are to be generally seen          grey zig-zag stripes on the grass,
very conspicuous        if the general     herbage     be   fresh,   almost   always
tending downwards, from a foot to two feet in width, continuous
in some places, but interrupted in others, and stretching for many
yards, occasionally for more than a hundred yards.                    On examining
these marks, the grass is found to be completely withered to the
roots; the roots themselves are destroyed; and many years elapse
before the vegetation          is restored.      They    are   most frequent       and
well-marked in the hollow to the south of the basaltic                      summit,
descending to Dunsappie Loch, but rather to the right towards
Duddingston,        and also on the subsidiary broad eminence                 north
east from the summit.            Dr Hutton tries various theories for ex
plaining these
                    "  Fairy footpaths," but cannot satisfy himself with
any of them.        Among the rest, he rejects lightning; which, how
ever,  I   suspect is the only agent which will account for them.
Many years ago, when wandering over the upper part of the hill at
midsummer,       I   remarked     that these marks        were unusually scanty
and imperfect.         A thunder    storm brewing in the south-west              com
pelled me to effect        a hasty retreat     ;  and was followed by a very
severe storm which passed over the               hill, the city, and all the sur
rounding country.          A  few days afterwards       I  found    the east slopes
of the hill presented many extensive,             recent-looking marks of the
nature now described.

  The remaining Botanical inquiry               I
                                     have to notice is one well
known to naturalists, and of more general interest than the pre
ceding.    Great doubts had been long entertained among                            good
authorities about the nature of the motion of the sap in trees.                      Dr
Walker, Professor       of Natural History in the University of Edin
burgh, undertook       a series   of well-devised      and precise experiments
to determine how the sap moves in trees in the spring; and having
with philosophical caution           repeated them          in several successive
years, with the same results, he communicated                   the whole inquiry
to the Royal Society in 1783 and 1785.                This inquiry is still held        to
be authoritative     proof, that the movement of the sap in trees, on the
arrival of genial weather in the spring, is not a movement of circu
lation, by ascent and descent, as many had before contended, but
invariably a simple movement of ascent ; that the sap ascends
neither in the pith, as some had maintained, nor in the bark, as
insisted on by others, but in the wood, and between the wood and
bark   ;   that the date of its commencement, and its rate, both depend
on the earliness and geniality of the warm season                    ;   that the ascent
varies in rate, from six to nine inches daily, according                     to the pre
vailing temperature of the air ; and that those buds always open
first into leaves which the sap first reaches, so that its arrival is the
essential     cause of their growth.
                                   The author, however, points out
that his experiments fix only the nature of the motion of the sap
in the spring, when the tree has no leaves, and takes no account of
what the movement may be when the leaves are developed.                            He   is
inclined, indeed, to presume that it may then be different; and
accordingly ulterior inquiries have shown that, when the tree is in
leaf, the sap moves downwards as well as upwards, observing now                           a
circulation.
   In Meteorology, if       a man     be   only a good looker, he may               one
day become an original observer.           It   is,   therefore,   a     favourite study
with those fond of Natural Science.         Accordingly, we find upwards
of twenty communications,           and not   few of them very valuable,

on the subject of meteorology in the Society's early Proceedings.
  Playfair in 1784 acutely investigates the causes which affect the
accuracy      of Barometric Observations.              In     1790       Dr Rutherford
describes-    a   self-registering thermometer,          by   which the maximum

and   minimum of temperature may be ascertained between any
given periods of time ; and this is still the method usually preferred
for ascertaining the daily maxima and minima.                  In 1795, Mr
Alexander Keith, afterwards our benefactor Sir Alexander Keith
of Ravelstone, describes both      a thermometer     and barometer, which,
by the application of the same kind of contrivance          to each, may be
made to register the state of these instruments continually, with
the aid   of clock-work.   Mr Macgowan contributes            meteorological
observations    for six years, ending with 1776, made at Hawkhill,
near Lochend, in this neighbourhood;             the Duke of Buccleuch,
President of the Society, contributes the observations of ten years,
ending with 1783, made at Branxholme, his seat in Roxburghshire;
and   Playfair adds abstracts of observations,          made at    Windmill
Street, in the city, for six years, ending with 1798.           In 1796, Dr
Balfour of     the  Bengal Medical       Service   reproduces    an  inquiry
made a good many years previously, in which, by regular half-
hourly observations,    he was   the first to ascertain    that at Calcutta,
near the equator, the barometer observes a double diurnal revolution
of about a tenth or twentieth of an inch, the highest positions
being at ten in the forenoon and evening, and the lowest at six in
the morning and afternoon      ;  and in 1799     Playfair points out that
this result had been also obtained in 1785 by independent           observa
tions made near the equator by Lemanon,            a  naturalist attached to
the ill-starred expedition of    La Peyrouse.
   Mr Hall of Whitehall       describes   a remarkable      lunar halo, con
sisting of  a small concentric ring, of about ten degrees in diameter,
round    the   moon,   and a great     ring, seven or eight times that
diameter,   which passed through the moon, cutting the concentric
halo in two. Playfair describes a rare rainbow which he saw over
 the sea from Dunglass, consisting       of a  lofty perfect primary arch,
almost a complete semicircle, and a secondary bow springing from
the south limb of the other, and bending outwards             in a southerly
direction.     The Reverend Dr Graham of Aberfoyle notices an
Aurora Borealis which he observed at that place in the day-time on
February 10, 1799, at half-past three, and states his belief that
this was only the second on record, but conjectures that such
observations    would not be infrequent, if frequently searched for in
the circumstances      he describes — viz., "when the sky, being- for

 412                  Proceedings      of the Royal       Society
 the   most      part cloudless, is      suffused     with thin pale         vapours
 especially in longitudinal        streaks."
     I beg here      to be allowed to make a short                digression.       The
 phenomena of the aurora borealis in this country have often been
 minutely described on the occurrence of unusually fine displays of
 it.   But no      one, so far as    I  am aware, has studied           carefully     its
 prognostications.         Thoroughly inquired into, however, these may
 prove practically valuable, as the following illustration will serve
 to show.      Every     one knows that when the aurora first begins                   to
 exhibit in the autumn it        is regarded as a sign          of broken weather
 following.       But at that period of the year it supplies            a prognostic
 of far greater precision       and   importance.       I  have repeatedly men
 tioned to my friends the observation             I  have invariably      made,    that
 the first great aurora after autumn is well advanced, and following
a long tract      of fine weather, is   a sign    of  a great storm     of rain    and
wind on the forenoon of the second day afterwards.                     I must     have
noticed this fact very early, because            I applied   it on the occasion of
the first meeting       of the British Association         in Edinburgh on 8th
September      ]  834.    There had been a long tract of very fine weather,
for a fortnight and more, when on Saturday evening, the 6th of the
month, there appeared           the widest, brightest, and most flashing
aurora   I have     ever seen.   Next day      the weather     continuing remark
ably fine, Professor Sedgewick described, at breakfast at Dr Alison's,
in glowing language, the magnificent exhibition which the philo
sophers of Edinburgh had provided for their southern visitors.
Presenting then to him the dark side of the picture,                     I told him
that the Association        meeting was to be inaugurated with a great
storm.      He   was surprised at this, and appealed to the continuing
cloudless sunny sky against me            ;  but   I told him the particulars of
the prognostication, and that the storm would not begin                      till   the
middle of the following day.                Next morning the weather               was
equally splendid.         But  soon after eleven the eastern sky began to
be overcast,       an   ominous low north-easterly           black cloud rose by
degrees   ;  at twelve, as the offices of the Association opened, rain
began to    fall from that direction, and in           a short time there com
menced     the most incessant and heaviest fall of north-east rain                     I
ever   witnessed, lasting       without     intermission      till one o'clock       on
Wednesday the 10th, when the fine weather was again restored                         to

                    of Edinburgh,      Session 1868-69.                     413
lis and our visitors.      I have often made the same prognostication
since, and with invariable accuracy         ; and several friends to whom
I  have mentioned       it have made the same observation — viz., that
the first great aurora occurring after a long tract of fine autumnal
weather,     foretells  a storm   commencing between twelve and two
o'clock in the afternoon of the second day thereafter.               I   restrict
the prognostication to these conditions. It is evident how valuable
the knowledge of it may often         be  to agriculturists.     Nevertheless,
I never    met with farmer or farm-servant who knew it.                  On one
occasion    it was the means of saving the corn crop of            a  friend in
Dumfriesshire, whose farm-steward was about to leave his corn
half led on the day after      a  very great aurora, and, deceived by the
beauty of the weather, was on the point of taking his labourers to
other work not at all pressing.         His master, trusting to my positive
assurances, ordered him to make haste in leading and thatching
everything, and great         was   the   steward's  astonishment       when    a
furious three days' storm set in on the forenoon of the second day.
   In the pneumatic branch of meteorology three papers were pro
duced to the Society, in the latter part of last century, on topics of
great interest to us.
   Mr    George Wallace,     a member      of the bar, read, in 1787, " A
Dissertation on the Causes of the Disagreeableness and Coldness of
the East Wind ;
                     " but as the notice in the
                                                      Society's Proceedings
 merely informs        us  that  " the author did not       incline that any
abstract should be given of his dissertation," and          I cannot   find that
it was published elsewhere, we are left in ignorance what were
the discoveries or opinions of Mr Wallace on this knotty question,
in which we must all take a lively personal            interest.    It   may be
that this gentleman has withheld from the world one of the most
valuable practical discoveries which remain to be made in meteor
ology.     It  may be, however, that he was deterred from having any
notice taken of his lucubrations by learning certain views enter
tained of the same subject by Hutton ; who communicated them to
the    Society in an able paper
                                         " On our Vernal       and Autumnal
Monsoon Winds," in February 1791.
    In  this paper he points out that winds are shiftings of the air,
occasioned by changes in its temperature          ; that these changes arise
from the alternations of day and night, the alternate crossing of the

414                 Proceedings of the Royal Society
equator by the sun northward and southward,              the different degrees
in which the     sea and    land are heated by the sun's rays, the effect
of cloud in interrupting the heating action of the sun, and the
influence    of rain in cooling the air by the evaporation of its drops
in descending       towards    the earth   ; and he argues that we might
explain all     the phenomena         of the winds, could we thoroughly
appreciate in each instance under investigation the interference and
relative energy of these and other subsidiary disturbing forces.               He
then illustrates these principles of inquiry by reference to our East
winds in spring, and our West winds in summer and autumn.                     For
the sake of brevity,     I  shall confine myself to the former topic, which
is investigated     with Hutton's characteristic force and simplicity.
In spring,    says he, easterly      winds prevail here, because the cold
wintry air of the polar regions is drawn southward over the warmer
continent of Europe and westward by the warmth of the German
Ocean.      For some time after it begins to blow in March and April
it occasions in us a cold, uncomfortable feeling, because it is
thermometrically cold, and also unduly dry. Its lowness of tem
perature, compared with the west wind, which occasionally inter
rupts  it for  a short period at     this season, no one can dispute       ;  and
Hutton     had    frequently remarked        a thermometric       difference    of
10°   F. in favour of the            interpolated west wind.           The cold
feeling thus occasioned is aggravated,            he says,     by the warmth
created by the sun's rays in sheltered places          ;  but, in particular, it
is increased by the withering dryness of the wind, — for the common
notion    that an east wind is a damp wind is quite                  a mistake.
During    a  long period of the spring it is a dry, parching wind, on
that account alike disagreeable to the human race and blighting to
vegetation.     He tells us quaintly that he "never had a hygrometer;"
but he improvised         one, being nothing else than a somewhat            rude
wet-bulb thermometer,         such as is now in constant        use in a more
perfect    form  ;  and he tells us that in the east winds of early
spring he sometimes          found   a difference   of   10°  F. between the
wet and dry thermometers,            while he never could observe a dif
ference of more than 4-          F. in the driest days of summer.         In  the
month of May, however,          a change takes    place in the character        of
the east wind.       Still dominant, it encounters in its passage across
the German       Ocean a more and more powerful              sun,  which both

 raises the temperature       of the air   as it approaches    this island, and,
 hy warming the sea, raises watery              vapour to moisten      the lower
stratum of air.        Hence the May east wind arrives both warmer and
less dry.    It is now therefore     for the most part much less unpleasant
to the feeling than in March and April.               Towards evening, how
ever, as the sun's rays fail in force, the air, cooling down, parts with
moisture to form mist, which creeps up our Firth, spreads over the
 neighbouring land, prevails all night, and lasts into the next fore
 noon,  till it   vanishes under the renewal of the heat of the air from
the sun's rays. During the misty time the uncomfortable impres
sion on the human frame is renewed in spite of the air being now
moist, partly because the temperature is lowered, partly because
mist — being a form of water in the liquid state — is a more powerful
conductor of heat from the body than the same water dissolved in
the air    as gas.      Accordingly,     as the   mist is dispelled with the
advance of day, the sense of discomfort vanishes,               because the air
is warmer,     and is loaded      merely with perfectly dissolved aeriform
moisture.       It is remarkable,    he adds, that the unpleasant      influence
of these east winds on man do not then correspond with their
influence on vegetation.         In March and April the cold, dry east
winds wither up and destroy leaves prematurely unfolded. Later in
the season an east wind, equally cold, but loaded with moisture,
does them no harm, because it loses its parching, withering property.
This important difference every careful observer must have noticed.
In the case of the animal frame, however, the mere cold of an
easterly    mist    is adequate    to cause discomfort,      and  injury to the
health.     Thus Hutton maintains that all the disagreeableness and
injury occasioned by our east winds, both in spring and in early
summer, may be adequately            explained by reference simply to their
condition     iu point of temperature and humidity, without our
requiring to take account of any other agency, hidden and mysterious
in its nature and operation.          I have dwelt a    little on these simple,
yet profound,        views  of Hutton,      because, like other inquiries of
his, they have been too much            lost sight  of in our time, and they
may    help to clear up and satisfy many minds which have been
hitherto much obfuscated and discontent in respect of the present
matter.

hurricanes.      If   he had, it is not too much to say that his profound
penetration    into Nature's laws would scarcely have failed to recog
nise those which govern the mightiest of atmospherical movements.
It  is not likely, for example, that he would           have left in a state of
dry detail of bare facts the luminous description by Sir Gilbert
Blane, communicated            to the Society in 1785, of the terrible
hurricane at Barbad oes in 1780 ; — -a description containing incidents
which nothing but the modern theory of cyclones can explain, and
which, duly considered, might have led so acute a mind as that of
Hutton to the right solution, even at that early period. This storm
lasted the greater part of two days, and raged with unexampled
fury for twelve hours, destroying the fort at Bridgeton, levelling an
immense number of houses, laying waste the whole crops of the
island, and occasioning the sudden death of at least 3000 inhabi
tants.      Notwithstanding, however, its uncommon            swiftness, people
were surprised at the comparative slowness with which             it passed from
 island to island.       They evidently confounded the impetuous whirl
wind within the cyclone itself with the slower progress made by the
 whole cyclone from place to place.           Ships at   sea, adds   Sir Gilbert,
 found that the storm blew from             all points of the        compass  ; a
 phenomenon       explicable only by the theory of the cyclone.              The
 fate    of one vessel is particularly mentioned           as   unaccountable;
for being blown from her anchorage              in Carlisle Bay, and losing
all her compasses, she was driven before the blast,                 as  her crew
 supposed,    to   a    distance   of at least   a   hundred leagues in two
 days, when,      to   their   astonishment,   they found themselves         very
 near the place from          which they set out.       There was enough in
 these striking      facts to direct an acute and inquiring            mind to  a
 true theory of hurricanes,       as now viewed    by meteorologists.
    In    the department       of Thermometric Meteorology, Mr Hall of
 Whitehall records          a precise  fact as  to   the   great    cold of the
 winter of 1795, having observed the thermometer              so low   as — 6° F.
 on the 22d of       January in that year.        In  order to appreciate duly
 the great intensity of this cold for a Scottish locality, it is           neces
 sary to know that the station where the observation was                    made
 is ten miles from the sea at Berwick, on the north bank of the
 Whittadder, certainly not more than 150 feet above high-water
  level.    About this time the winters in Scotland were very hard.

  In 1781 Professor Wilson observed in the Observatory Park at Glas
  gow a cold of — 4° Fahr., and in 1780 actually one of —14° Fahr.
    Dr Guthrie, one of many Scottish                physicians of the time who
 settled   in Russia, describes in          a dissertation    read to the Society in
 1789 a remarkable         phenomenon        he had observed in the thawing        of
 thick ice.     When ice on the river Neva had been reduced by thaw
 to two-thirds of its thickness, it became so brittle as not to bear
 even the weight of a dog, though             still eighteen inches thick.       The
 cause he discovered         to be that the ice is then composed of solid
            " like
 crystals           organ-pipes," about eighteen inches long, and with
 scarcely any cohesion among themselves.                 This appears a structure
 somewhat      analogous on the large scale to the loss of cohesiveness
 among the minute particles of ice, which gives occasion to the
 downward descent of glaciers.
    The only original inquiry in Thermometric Meteorology produced
 to the Royal Society of Edinburgh in its early life, is one of great
 importance in       a  scientific respect,     as well   as   practically by reason
of its bearings on atmospherical             thermometric observations.         This
is the dissertation        well known to learned           meteorologists,   but lost
sight    of by too many others,              of Patrick Wilson, Professor of
Astronomy in Glasgow,             "  On a remarkable       cold which accompanies
 the separation       of hoar-frost in      a clear  air."     This inquiry, read in
1784, and carried on during several previous winters,                   in continua
tion of researches of the same kind communicated                       to the Royal
Society of London in 1780 and 1781, is the germ which ultimately
produced in the hands of            Dr Wells the true theory of the formation
of dew and hoar-frost;             and the author approaches           so near  that
theory   as to create regret that,         having stepped on the right path,
he had not the luck to follow it to the end.                   Wilson was the first
to   observe     the    difference     in clear frosty weather         between   the
temperature      of snow, hoar-frost, sand, and many other objects, and
the temperature of the atmosphere a few feet above.                   He frequently
observed     a difference      of   4°, 8°, 12°, and even on one occasion 16°
of greater cold on the surface of snow, than in the air four feet, or
even only two feet and a half above it. He also noticed that this
difference    is always attended with an increase of weight from the
deposition     of hoar-frost    ;  that the difference is always greatest when
the atmosphere         is clearest     and stillest  ; that wind, even in clear

418              Proceedings of the Royal Society
weather, annihilates the difference    ;  and that such is also the effect
of the atmosphere becoming hazy, or the sky overcast with clouds.
Wilson laboured to account for all these variable phenomena on            the
assumption   that the deposition     of hoar-frost occasioned the cold.
But it is easy to  see that,  in spite of some ingenious suggestions
upon that basis, he did not succeed in satisfying entirely his own
mind.    Had he begun with the converse assumption, that cold             was
the cause of deposition   of hoar-frost, he would probably have antici
pated more modern discovery.         He was indeed very near doing so.
For, speaking of the influence of     a passing cloud    in putting an    end
to the formation of hoar-frost and depression of the thermometer,
he uses these words,
                         " When     the atmosphere      becomes suddenly
clouded, it is certain that this change       must be attended with the
extrication of much sensible       heat in the     higher regions,     wheie
these vapours are congregated.       A   store of heat so produced must
soon affect the mass of air which lies below."        But how   ?  he might
have asked himself.     Not surely by the process of conduction, be
cause heated air rises; it does not sink.       Not, then, by the process
of conduction, but by that of radiation, which, instantly darting
heat from   the clouds, replaces    the loss which in clear weather is
sustained  by snow and other objects         on the surface of the earth
through radiation of heat from them into the cold attenuated           atmo
sphere of the far firmament.        Unfortunately, however, the theory
of radiant heat was too little advanced to suggest to him this ex
planation, — obvious and easy after the discoveries of Pictet in
1790, and the admirable     researches of Leslie fourteen years later.
   No one could investigate carefully the theory of the winds with
out having his attention directed to the Theory of Rain ; and, ac
cordingly this is one of the branches of meteorology which Hutton
was the first to investigate   successfully.    This he did in    a disserta
tion read in 1784 and enforced in 1787, in reply to adverse criti
cisms by the philosopher De Luc. The power which the atmosphere
possesses of dissolving or suspending        moisture  in invisible vapour
as transparent  as the  air increases with the temperature.        Hutton's
discovery  was the proof, by mathematical        demonstration,    that rain
or mist could not be formed when two masses of air of different
temperatures   are mingled, unless      the power to dissolve       moisture

increased      in   a greater     ratio than the          increase   of temperature.
Hutton's mathematical deduction                has been since proved experi
mentally to be true.             As the solvent power of atmospheric                  air
increases in a greater          ratio than that at which the temperature
rises, when two masses          of transparent air of different temperatures
are   mixed together, more moisture is present than suffices to satu
rate the mixed air at the intermediate temperature                      which is pro
duced   ;    and hence the excess must separate in the form                  of either
mist,   if   the excess be slight, or rain,      if the    excess be considerable.
  In the topographical            branch    of Natural History the early Pro
ceedings      of the Society present         several      papers which must have
possessed at the time            much      interest, such as an account         of the
Caves of Elephanta by Dr Buchanan, of Prince of Wales' Island
by Mr Howison, of the Trinidad Petroleum Lakes by Mr Lochead,
and of the Natural History of Guiana, and of Madeira, by the same
gentleman.          But these narratives have been rendered obsolete by
more elaborate descriptions published             since.
  It    remains for me, under the head of the Natural Sciences, to
take notice of the early labours of the Royal Society in Mineralogy
and Geology.          In this    department      the Society,        during the first
twenty years of its life, shone with a brilliancy unsurpassed by any
of the scientific academies of Europe                 ;   for during that time were
produced       Hutton's    Theory of the Earth, and the illustrative ex
periments of Sir James Hall.
  The Society's papers on Mineralogy and Geology                         are eleven   in
number, but of three of them the Proceedings contain not even an
abstract.
  Colonel Imray, in         a   well-told description       of the " Mineralogy of
Gibraltar" in 1797, corrects some prevailing errors                  as to the species,
composition,               position of the famous deposit of bones
                    and geological
in various parts of the Rock, and         believe, the first to point
                                                is,
                                                 I
out that the hill must have been at one time for          long period   a
covered by the sea to the height of at least 900 feet, as he found at
                                   "
that elevation       numerous          pot-holes," formed by trituration under
water with shingle-stones kept in motion by currents.
  Dr Richardson, in 1803, describes three remarkable bnsalts which

420               Proceedings of the Royal Society
be found on the coast of Antrim, not far from Portrush                    :   one an
ochrous basalt, apparently     undergoing decomposition           ;   another con
taining fossil shells, but    a dubious      basalt; and    a   third containing
bladders of compressed liquid.          "This basalt,"   he says, "contains
small cavities in its interior, many of them full of fresh water,
which gushes out when the stone is broken by the hammer, as if it
had been in a state of compression."  Here we have, I apprehend,
one of the earliest notices of the presence of liquids in the interior
of perfectly solid minerals.
   In 1791 Dr Hutton explains the cause of the flexibility of the
Brazilian stone, or flexible sandstone. " When a stone," says he,
" of   any considerable    thickness is said to have flexibility, we              are
led to think that here is something            very extraordinary, and we
wish to know upon what depends that quality, nowise proper to a
stone." Accordingly he set about inquiring, and, after being for
some time much puzzled with his problem, he considers that the pro
perty is owing to a certain structure,       recognisable   only with the aid
of the microscope, constituted by minute particles of thin mica
thickly disseminated through the mass, and always parallel to one
another, by which a certain jointed character is given to the stone.
  The Rev.    Mr Christopher Tait, minister of Kincardine               on Forth,
has delineated with much care the condition in 1792 of the great
Flanders and Kincardine mosses in Stirlingshire and the adjacent
eastward coasts of the    Firth.   Extending on both sides of the Firth,
from the line of Kincardine westward           as far up the Carse        of Stir
ling   as Cardross, the unredeemed        desert of peat covered in 1770 a
territory   22 miles long,     between       three-fourths of a mile and
seven miles wide, and not less probably than 30,000 acres, assum
ing an average width of two miles, which           I
                                           take to be within the
mark. He describes the composition of the moss, notices an ancient
corduroy road through part of       it,   shows that at one time its place
                                   by
must    have been occupied         a    forest of great trees, proves that
these had been mostly cut, probably by the early Roman invaders,
in order to destroy   a   retreat and place of assembly for their native
enemies, and gives    a   good succinct account of the famous design
of Lord Kames, which had been in successful                 operation         during
twenty-two years, for clearing away the peat, uncovering the under
lying soil, and converting the moss into agricultural fields.            I      wish

I   could   state in contrast, which must be very great                           indeed,    the
present condition          of that territory after seventy-six years more of
enterprise.      My limited time has not sufficed to ascertain this point.
    I do not    know at how early                 a period we possess a       scientific record
of the Comrie earthquakes                   ;   but there is a precise one by       Mr Ralph
Taylor in the Society's Transactions, read in 1790, with additions
in 1793, describing several visitations, but especially one in 1789,
during market-day on 10th November, which made the earthen
ware vessels clatter in the market-place, terrified horses, and caused
the people to         think the surrounding mountains were falling on
them.
     In March       1785    Dr Hutton commenced the reading of his theory
of the earth, under the title of " Investigation of the Laws observ
able in the Composition, Dissolution,                             and Restoration of      Land
upon the Globe."                The Huttonian theory may be shortly stated as
follows : —
   Providence, for the wise purpose of preserving and maintaining
the excellence of its works, has ordained that all creation, so far as
we can study         it,   shall   be   subject to alternate decay and renovation
arising out of that decay.                       For this purpose are provided suitable
materials and the necessary forces.                              The earth itself   is   not ex
cepted.       Its   present stage           of decay       is   obvious to all eyes on survey
ing its surface;           a    prior renovation            is    almost   equally obvious on
examining into its crust                ;       and   a   decay antecedent     to that renova
tion   isabundantly evident on careful inquiry in the same quarter.
     Under the force of the waves, currents, and alternate flow and
ebb of the sea, we may observe that the waters are gradually steal
ing upon the land, sweeping into their depths the waste so                                    oc
casioned    ;   but much           more under the action of alternate frost and
thaw, rains and winds,                  rivers and floods, earthquakes              and     other
forces, we may behold              a    never-ceasing             wear, slow indeed, but con
tinual and universal, going on over the surface of the dry land                                   ;
the result being that the waste, along with that of animal and
vegetable       forms,     is   constantly carried by the rivers into the ocean.
In   the depths of the ocean the waste settles down in stillness;                            and
we may safely assume that                   it   settles in the shape of layers, varying
in nature and kind, in different ages and at different places, with
the prevailing         soil, rocks, and vegetable and animal remains from

422                 Proceedings of the Royal Society
whose wear upon land the waste has been derived.                     So much     we
may discover from what is now going on before our eyes.
   If  we   next assume that at some former epoch a similar waste
had been carried on, so long and so far that the earth became less
and less suitable for the maintenance            of vegetable and animal life
on its surface, we then find that a provision exists for renovation
of that surface to its pristine condition through the agency of sub
terranean fire.       This power, of whose existence in tremendous
energy we have sensible          proof in many regions of the globe, had
only to approach       the subaqueous beds of waste matter in order to
fuse them     ;  and then, with a     little accumulation of force, to raise
them    high out of the ocean from its bosom, and even to burst
through them,        driving far upwards        into light and air immense
masses of fused materials,          long pent up in that state deep in          the
interior of the earth.
   In conformity with this         theory, we should find in the present
dry land the stratiform portion of the earth's crust presenting in
its deepest beds a crystalliform structure corresponding with the
laws which govern concretion          from a state   of perfect fluidity under
very slow cooling.         On approaching the present             actual   surface
from these deep beds, we ought to find in the superimposed                    beds
rocks   presenting signs      of agglutination       merely,    from    softening
rather   than downright fusion.           Close to the present        surface    we
should remark        perhaps   little   more than that        amount     of loose
cohesion among the particles composing the rocky beds, which may
be fairly ascribed to mere compression           sustained while the beds lay
under an enormous         mass of superincumbent         sea.    We ought      also
to remark, that the remains of animals and vegetables are most dis
tinct and least altered by heat from below in the uppermost layers
of the stratiform rocks, less and less        so as we descend, and at length
unrecognisable      in the deepest, most perfectly fused beds, — not            be-
c mse vegetable and animal remains were not there deposited along
with the earth's waste, but simply because their form was entirely
destroyed,      and their substance       completely incorporated        through
perfect   fusion with the matter         in which they lay.        If cavities   be
formed from any cause in the beds of consolidated              rocks, we should
expect    to find in the deep, highly fused beds, but not in those of
stony   matter     agglutinated by mere softening, that these cavities

are lined with crystals in point of composition                       much simpler than
the matrix, or even consisting of a single element only, and yet
deriving     their ingredient or ingredients from                        the matrix — such
being     a law    generally of crystallisation from composite mixtures in
a state    of fusion or of solution.               We should moreover expect to find
where      the melted matter itself of subterranean                      fire has burst up
wards through the stratiform rocks, that it carried broken masses of
these rocks        along with        it,   and on cooling showed them included in
the invading and now concreted liquid.                        We should         see the    dis
rupting      liquid mass diffusing itself in veins                    in every direction
through the shattered                beds, and even insinuating             itself between
the beds, separating them from each other, and now itself forming
beds betwixt them.     We might also expect to see in the huge
masses of subterraneous                    matter which had been thrown up in a
melted     state, that, by virtue of their perfect
                                            fusion and very slow
cooling, they now present us with the most crystalline texture of
all rocks, show even           a   separation       into crystalline bodies totally dif
ferent from one another in composition, and display, in accidental
cavities in their interior, lining crystals of the most perfect form,
and     of the simplest materials which the matrix of rock can yield.
  Now, all the phenomena                    thus described,    as   it   were by anticipa
tion,    we do     actually witness on examining carefully the several
rocky beds and masses which form the present crust of our earth.
Therefore there can be no doubt that this crust has been formed
from the crumbling              of   a     more ancient dry land, deposited in the
sea, and afterwards           fused and raised above the sea by the agency of
subterranean        fire.
  Such     is   in brief terms       summary of the main points and proofs
                                     a
of Hutton's theory,             beautifully but tersely set forth in his own
dissertation in our Transactions.                   I   might have taken this sum
mary from the admirable extension                      and illumination      of the theory
in the classical            work of his pupil and friend, Professor Playfair,

124                 Proceedings of the Royal Society
   Two subjects of reflection have been forcibly brought before               me
in lately renewing,        after a long interval      of time, my acquaint
ance with Hutton's own treatise.           Firstly, Though he was cultivat
ing a field of inquiry almost entirely new, and developing a vast
multitude of new argumentative facts and views, there is scarcely
a proposition made from           first to last to which a well-instructed
modern geologist may not give his assent.              Secondly,  In his   essay
of ninety-six       quarto   pages,    he has given his successors        in all
branches     of science    a remarkable     lesson — a most luminous narra
tive on   a most     novel subject, without coining a single new term,
or quitting plain English words, unless in the case of a very few
German names for rocks previously in universal use among
geologists.      Much of the repulsiveness of many branches of science
to the general student of the present time is no doubt owing to the
apparent     necessity   of   a recondite    and mysterious     nomenclature.
Hutton has shown that the most novel and profound inquiries                 may
be propounded       with precision, in his day at any rate, without         such
aid.
   The Huttonian        theory,    though welcomed by many able pro
selytes,  likewise encountered         not a few equally able adversaries.
These    belonged     chiefly to the followers of Werner, or Neptun-
ians, who recognised nothing but the force of water in all the
apparent      revolutions on the earth's         surface.    The controversy
against Huttonianism           was   for several    years carried    on at the
meetings     of this Society with great talent and energy under the
leadership of Professor Jameson, a favourite pupil of Werner him
self, and    the greatest     adherent    ever gained     to the side   of that
philosopher.       Huttonianism      may therefore     be truly said to have
attained    its highest triumph when, in the apartment where we               are
now met, Jameson, not many years before his death,              as some    of  us
must well remember, publicly renounced             the creed he had taught
for half  a  century, and paid      an  uncompromising tribute to the truth
and profoundness       of the Huttonian theory of the earth.
   While Hutton's theory was undergoing probation                  in its early
days, some rather       troublesome     objections were brought against it
by its ingenious adversaries.          Among these may      be here mentioned
two, and two only, because they directly gave birth to certain able
experimental      researches by Sir James      Hall, who became our      second

                    of Edinburgh, Session 1867-68.                           425
 President, about twenty years later, on the death of Henry Duke
 of Buccleuch, in 1811. It was objected that many of the rocks,
 whose structure was ascribed to fusion by Hutton, become, on cool
 ing from fusion, a slag or        a glass,    and cannot afterwards recover
 their crystalline texture.        It  was also objected     that carbonate of
 lime, which constitutes      a large   proportion of the stratiform beds in
the crust of the earth, cannot be fused, because, long before the
 heat is raised high enough, it parts with its carbonic acid and
 becomes lime, which proves            refractory under the most intense
artificial heat which can be applied.              Hutton's answer was that
 Nature's operations in this matter are carried on upon a vast scale,
with unlimited heat, and under enormous pressure — three condi
tions wholly unlike those in which all experimental imitations
must be attempted.           Hutton, in his Dissertation seems to have
anticipated these      objections.      But    though   a  skilful and inven
tive chemist,    he did not venture         to meet them by experimental
evidence.      He even threw discouragement over the proposals of
his enthusiastic disciples to find a reply by during to drag Nature
 into their laboratories.       " What ! " said he, in a different essay,
 "judge     of the   great    operations     of the mineral kingdom from
 having    kindled   a  fire   and    looked    into the bottom     of  a  little
            "
crucible  !
    Sir James Hall, however, resolved not to be thus discouraged.
Such    was  his veneration for his friend and teacher, that he tells us
he would not execute his plan during the lifetime of Hutton.                 But
after Hutton's     death    Hall kindled his fire, and looked into his
little crucible; when behold!          Nature at work there, exactly       as  in
the vast profound.
    In a paper on granite,       read to the Society in 1790, he pointed
out, that, although the quartz, felspar, and mica, which make up
that rock, are fused into glass by artificial heat, there is no reason
why, under slow cooling, the crystals of felspar, quartz, and mica
should not separate and crystallise apart, in the same way                as the
crystalline particles of salt and ice separate in the freezing of sea-
water, or like the crystallisation which renders transparent           glass an
opaque,   rock-like body, when from            a state of fusion it is made to
consolidate very slowly by gradual cooling.
   Sir James tells us afterwards         that,  at the time    this paper    was

426                 Proceedings of the Royal Society
read, undeterred by the taunts of his friend, he determined to subject
these opinions to the test of experiment.           The issue was his        essay
in 1798, entitled " Experiments on Whinstone                  and   Lava."     He
first by fusion and quick cooling obtained           a   black vitreous      mass
from basalt,      greenstone,   porphyry, and greywacke; and on again
fusing these glassy bodies, and cooling them very slowly, he re
covered stony masses, " entirely crystalline, with facets appear
ing in the solid parts," much resembling            the original rocks.         In
the case of basalt from our Castle         rock, the resemblance was "so
strong in colour and texture, that it would be difficult to distinguish
them." Extending these experiments to lava, he tells us, in the
first place, that travellers have given rise to erroneous ideas of the
characters of lava, by bringing away with them only the superficial
scoriae, and     that the deeper parts present very much the appearance
and texture of our trap rocks.        Specimens     of this kind he     accord
ingly found to comport themselves           exactly like greenstone           and
basalt, according to the rate of cooling.         The lava of Mount Etna,
near Catania, he found to resemble         closely the columnar basalt of
Arthur Seat, and that near Santa Venere was very like the                 basalt
of the Castle rock; and both of them presented the same varying
phenomena        as these   rocks, when fused and then cooled quickly or
slowly.
  But Sir James Hall's greatest triumph was his subsequent                     ex
perimental inquiry, not produced to the Society till 1805, and                con
sequently a little beyond the period included in my present sketch,
" On the Effects of
                     Compression in modifying the Action of Heat."
By a series of difficult, dangerous, costly, but skilfully contrived
experiments,       he ascertained   that carbonate of lime is a fusible
body,     if,   while exposed to intense    heat,   it   be   also subjected to
powerful pressure,      so as to prevent   the conversion       of its carbonic
acid into gas. He also found that, according to the degree of heat,
and consequently of approach to perfect fusion, he could produce,
under proportionally high pressures, varying from 52 up to                    173
atmospheres, the latter of which corresponds to    mile of     a              sea,
every essential character which carbonate of lime variously assumes
in the mineral world, from the slightly cohesive chalk to the firm
solid structure of opaque secondary limestone, the crystalline struc
ture of translucent marble, and even the transparency and rhoai

                   of Edinburgh, Session 1867-68.                     427
 boidal form of calcareous spar. Sir James valued these striking
 results chiefly on account of their irresistible bearing on the Hut-
 tonian theory.     But, however important they may       be in that rela
 tionship, they possess high intrinsic merit; and it seems surprising
 that his method of inquiry has not been extended to other sub
 stances.
    Hutton made a collection of specimens for illustrating his theory
 of the earth.    This collection was presented to Dr Black by Hut-
 ton's sister and representative;    Black made it over to the Royal
Society; and   as the Society had determined   not to keep up a museum
 of its own, Hutton's collection was transferred      to the  Museum of
 the University.     It must be a subject of keen grief to every lover
 of geological science, and to every man who feels the respect which
is due to the great men of former days, that there is great reason
to fear that this collection has been lost sight of, and may not now
be capable of being identified.     It must have been extensive;        for
I  find in the old manuscripts of the Society's Proceedings, that a
committee    of Fellows, appointed to conduct its transference to the
University Museum, asked no less than a twelvemonth to arrange
it.   We can scarcely doubt that it was transferred; for it certainly
has not been in this Society's possession since     I  became a    Fellow.
But it has never been displayed in the University Museum; for
indeed it was a perpetual complaint of the late Professor Jameson,
that he had no space for exhibiting any collection of rocks at all
in the museum.       Mr Archer informs     me that no such collection
has yet come to    light in the course of the examination of the vast
geological accumulations during the keepership of Jameson, now
in the National Museum of Science and Art; and that he doubts,
from the state of the portion already examined,       whether   it will be
possible to identify any special part of it.     The Society will con
fidently rely on his zeal and care in this matter; and          I  submit
whether it is not the Society's duty to consider what it can do to
save geology from a calamity so deplorable      and so discreditable     to
the scientific history of Edinburgh,   as would be the loss  of Hutton's
own collection which illustrated the Huttonian theory.
    The summary now given of the Proceedings of the Royal Society
of Edinburgh during the first twenty years of its existence, does not

 428               Proceedings oftlie Royal Society
 include   a few papers of a kind which cannot be well brought under
 any of the groups adopted in the preceding arrangement.                But
 some of these merit attention.
    Dr Donald Monro describes in 1783 the mode at that time
 followed in India for obtaining attar of roses without having re
course to distillation.   This method consists simply in exposing for
six or seven days to the sun picked rose-petals, merely covered with
 water, in an earthenware    jar, and removing with      a pellet of cotton
on a stick, the volatile oil which gradually forms         on the surface.
Roebuck communicates       in 1798 experiments      on the effects of com
pressed air, made by him in the air-vault of the blowing apparatus
of the Devon Iron-works.        Only one man was found so venturous
as to go   with him into the air-vault while the steam-engine           was
working.      The vault was 72 feet long, 14 feet wide, and 13 feet
high   ; and the compressing    force was   275 pounds per square inch,
by which a mercurial column was raised between five and six inches,
adding, therefore, nearly    a fifth to the mean pressure of the atmo
sphere.     He observed  a sense   of pressure on the ears, great increase
of sound, no perceptible     augmentation     of heat, but  a damp   sensa
tion which speedily passed off.       No inconvenience was felt during
the hour that the experiment lasted.        Sir James Hall, in a disserta
tion on the Origin of Gothic Architecture, deduces ingeniously the
Gothic arch from the form assumed by tree poles bent at the top
to meet or cross one another, and the florid ornaments of the arch
from spontaneous fractures and outward bending of the tree bark on
the curves of the arch as the bark dries.        Sir Gilbert Blane endea
vours to trace the Arabic figures for numerals to India. Lord
Ancrum proposes improvements in the arms and accoutrements                of
cavalry, principally for lessening the weight on the horse,            and
facilitating the movements of the horseman.          Clerk of Eldin shows
his well-known nautical propensities,        by proposing    a scheme    for
raising sunken ships.
   According to custom,    I  annex a statement of the changes which
have taken place during the last twelve months in the membership

    The following Communications were read                  : —
  1. On the      Colour of Aerial Blue.          By Sir George Harvey.
    This paper is intended       to prove that the colour of blue in the
sky and in the landscape is simply the result, in the former, of             the
darkness of space, as seen through the white           light contained in    the
atmosphere     ;  and, in the latter, of the same cause as shown in the
dark and distant portions of the landscape being viewed through
the interposed medium of air filled with white light.              The colour
of aerial blue being due in both cases to the same cause, namely —
a  dark body neutralised      as to its darkness    by being seen through a
white and transparent medium.
  2   On the Rotation of a Rigid Body about a Fixed Point.
                            By Professor Tait.
                                   (Abstract).
    This paper contains an attempt to exhibit the mutual relations of
some of the more important of the various processes which have
been employed in solving one of the most celebrated problems of
Dynamics.        The Quaternion analysis has been throughout used,            as
far more briefly comprehensive          and more suggestively      expressive
than the ordinary Cartesian        analysis.
    A brief sketch of the kinematical relations of the problem is first

                  of Edinburgh,         Session 18G7-C8.                      431
given, partly after Hamilton       ;  and in it the main object        sought is
usually the quaternion,     q, on    which depends the operator
which turns the body from any initial position whatever to its
position at time    t.   The investigation of the axis and amount of
the single rotation by which the body may be thus changed in
position was first suggested by Euler, but it was greatly simpli
fied and extended       by Rodrigues and Cayley.             The fundamental
kinematical formula of the present             paper,     which connects       the
quaternion,   q, with the instantaneous       axis of rotation,   t, is
                                c = 2Yqq~l,
and had been obtained        by Cayley, though not in this very simple
form,  as   a quaternion translation         from some of his Cartesian
results.
   From this equation the formulae, connecting the angular velocities
about the principal axes with the various sets of three angular
co-ordinates which have been employed to determine the position
of the body at time     t, are deduced,      mainly to show how complex
are these systems      as compared       with those suggested at once by
quaternions.
   Hamilton has pointed out that,         if w be   the vector  of an element

3.    An Investigation           into some previously undescribed
    Tetanic Symptoms produced by Atropia iu Cold-Bloodcd
    Animals.         By Dr Thomas R. Fraser.
   Authorities in toxicology appear to agree in including convulsions
among the effects of belladonna and of its active principle — atropia
— on man. Convulsive and tetanic symptoms would appear to be                 also
nearly constantly produced when fatal doses of this poison are admin
istered    to dogs, rabbits, and other         animals,   and to various birds.
The recent remarkable progress of our knowledge of the exact                 and
intimate physiological action           of various   medicinal substances       is
greatly due to investigations that have been made                 on animals of
a lower type      of organisation   ; and, accordingly, numerous observers
have instituted        experiments with atropia on such animals,            and,
especially,     on frogs.     Hitherto, however, tetanus has not            been
described as one of the effects of atropia-poisoning in cold-blooded
animals.*
    In  some experiments         undertaken     to determine      the minimum
fatal dose of atropia for frogs,       I was  surprised to find that increased
reflex excitability, convulsions, and tetanus occurred, occasionally,
at a certain stage in the poisoning.               Since   first observing these
unexpected        symptoms,    I  have made a number of experiments             to
   * Since this was written, 1 have communicated with Dr John Harley of
 London (the author of several important papers on the physiological action
and therapeutical employment of belladonna), and have had the pleasure of
 learning that he has also observod tetanus- and other symptoms of abnormal
 n-fl,x activity, in frogs during protracted atropia-poisoning.

                   of Edinburgh,         Session 1868-69.                      435
determine, accurately,       the character of these convulsive effects, to
ascertain the dose necessary for their production, and to differentiate,
as far as possible, the structures           on whose affection    they depend.
   Soon after a small fatal dose, or one rather less than fatal,              uf a
salt of atropia is administered         to a frog, a slight degree of weakness
occurs in the anterior extremities,              the respiratory    movements     of
the chest cease, and the motor power becomes                  gradually more and
more impaired, until, at length, all voluntary and respiratory move
ments cease, and the animal lies on the abdomen                    and chest, in a
perfectly flaccid state.      If     the condition of the heart be now exa
mined,    it will be observed that the cardiac impulse is scarcely
perceptible, and that the contractions are reduced to a very few in
the   minute.    At this    time, the application of various stimuli shows
that the functions of the afferent             and efferent    nerves   and of the
spinal   cord are retained,        though in a greatly impaired condition.
Several hours afterwards, it may be on the following day, the action
of the poison      still further advanced ; for the functions of the
                  is
afferent and efferent nerves and of the spinal cord are completely
paralysed, while only an occasional and scarcely perceptible               cardiac
impulse      can be discovered,        the    only signs of vitality being this
imperfect cardiac action and the continuing             irritability of the striped
muscles.  This state may last for many hours or for several days —
in one experiment it continued for as many as five days. Previous
observers have apparently            mistaken    it for one of death, and have,
therefore,    failed to observe the symptoms that subsequently appear,
and to which     I wish more particularly          to draw attention.     The first
of these symptoms      is,   usually,    a    change that occurs in the flaccid
condition of the animal      ;   the anterior extremities becoming flexed,
and gradually more and more arched,      until, at length, they are
rigidly contracted, while tonic spasm occurs in the muscles of the
chest also.  At this time, touch of any portion of the skin increases
                                 a
the tonic spasm of the anterior extremities and of the chest muscles,
and causes some slight spasmodic movements                    in the posterior ex
tremities.     In varying    periods after this, the respiratory movements
reappear,     and the cardiac impulse improves greatly in strength and
in frequency, while the posterior extremities assume an extended
position, with the webs stretched. If the skin be now touched,                    a
violent attack of opisthotonic tetanus occurs, which may last for

436                 Proceedinys of the Royal Society
from    two to ten seconds, and which is succeeded by a series of
clonic spasms.       During the tetanus,        the posterior   extremities      are
often more or less abducted, and immediately after               it they   become
flaccid; but the anterior extremities almost always remain rigidly
flexed.    As   a somewhat      later period, tetanus of     a still more violent
character may        be   excited; the attacks        are now emprosthotonic,
and during them,         the posterior      extremities are rigidly extended,
while at their conclusion, not only do the anterior extremities
remain arched, but the head is bent downwards                 by tonic spasm of
the muscles     of the abdomen, chest, and neck.
   A succession of such attacks may be produced by repeated                touches
of the skin, but, after      a number have been excited in quick            succes
sion,   the subsequent      convulsions become shorter and rather               less
powerful, though they reacquire             all their former violence       after  a
period of rest.
    When the animal is not suffering from an attack of tetanus, it
may execute        various     movements,      but these are performed         with
difficulty, even when they do not themselves                 excite spasms      and
convulsions, and it is apparent that the power of voluntary                  move
ment is   still considerably impaired.
    The period during which this tetanic condition remains                      was
found to vary greatly in different                experiments.       It  has   been
observed to continue       for only    a few hours, or    for several days,    and,
in one experiment,       for  as  long   as fourteen   days.
    This description indicates the usual characters and sequence of
the phenomena with such a dose of atropia                  as produces    tetanus.
Experiments have, however, been made in which the functions of
I he cerebro-spinal    nervous system were not observed to be completely
paralysed, in the stage of the poisoning antecedent to the appearance
of tetanus.     Only impairment of these functions            was observed, but,
as the state   of flaccidity often lasts for several days, it is obviously
impossible   to make observations           so  frequently during this period
as to  authorize the assertion that total destruction           did not occur.
   It is almost superfluous        to allude to the resemblance between the
tetanic symptoms        of atropia and those of strychnia.              There   are,
however,    certain    peculiarities connected        with the tetanus which
atropia causes — altogether         apart from the remarkable       fact that this
tetanus   succeeds     paralysis   — which distinguishes it from that of

                   of Edinburgh, Session 1868-09.                        437
strychnia.     After poisoning with atropia, and during the stage of
exaggerated reflex excitability, the attacks of tetanus cannot be
excited by the very slight stimuli which are sufficient to do so in
strychnia-poisoning.       Various irregularities,     also, are frequently
met with in the tetanus of atropia.     Some of these have been already
described, and of the others     it is sufficient  to mention      the occur
rence of tonic spasm of one group of muscles          in one limb, and of
another group in another;      of tetanus in the posterior       extremities,
with only slight increase of reflex excitability in the anterior; and
of contractions of unequal force in the muscles at the sides of
the chest and neck, causing lateral curvature during a tetanic con
vulsion.
   The numerous       experiments that have been made have             so  far
solved the problem of the dose required         to produce    these remark
able phenomena, that they may now be almost unfailingly produced.
Tetanus, or, at least, a state of greatly exaggerated reflex excitability,
nearly invariably     occurs when a dose of the sulphate           or acetate
of atropia, equivalent to the one-thousandth         of the weight of the
frog, is administered by injection, either under the skin or into the
abdominal     cavity.    Doses varying from the one eight-hundredth
to the one   twelve-hundredth of the frog's weight, may also produce
these effects.    The larger doses always produce the most violent
tetanic symptoms,     if they are not fatal during the stage of paralysis     ;
and   they may be given with confidence to very small animals, and
to  such as have been kept in a laboratory for several months.            The
smaller doses are best adapted for large frogs, and for such as have
been    recently obtained from their natural      habitats.    If   a dose be
employed smaller than those above indicated,            impairment of the
 functions of the cerebro spinal nervous system and of the heart may
be caused, but general tetanus will not follow, although spasms
 restricted to certain regions may occasionally appear.           The tetanic
 state resulting from the administration of the largest doses usually
 terminates   in death, that from the smallest in recovery.
    There are some special difficulties to be overcome in determining
 what structures are concerned in the production of this tetanic
 action   of atropia; for in following the only available plan, that,
 namely, of preventing the poison reaching certain regions while it
 has access to others, it is essential      to remember      that important

438                  Proceedings of the Royal Society
fallacies might arise because of the long interval that often                    elapses
between         the administration of the poison              and the appearance         of
tetanus.        Experiments were made in some of which the blood
vessels of one posterior         extremity, and in others of both, were tied
before atropia was administered,                and, by frequently modifying            the
dose, tetanus was on several occasions produced sufficiently soon to
give results that were not materially influenced by the previous
ligature of vessels. It was observed, in these experiments, that
spasms and tetanus occurred in the limbs to which the access of the
poison      had been prevented, during the stage in which the nerves
of the poisoned         regions were regaining their functions.                  This is
sufficient                 that the tetanus does not depend on an
                to demonstrate
action on motor or sensory nerves, nor on muscles ; and it  there            is,
fore, apparent       that   it   must depend on an action on the central
nerve-organs.   The predominence of cerebral symptoms during
atropia-poisoning in animals of  higher development, suggested
                                                a
the possibility of the tetanic symptoms being caused in frogs by an
influence originating         in the cerebral lobes, or, more probably,                  in
the ganglia at the summit of the medulla.                    Accordingly, on several
occasions,       the cord of     a   frog in the stage of tetanus was divided
immediately below the brachial enlargement.                      After this operation,
however, the tetanic condition continued in both the anterior and
posterior       segments.    Violent tetanus could be readily excited                    in
either segment      ;   and this condition frequently lasted for many days
after the division of the cord.
     There can, therefore,           be no doubt that these tetanic symptoms

                                           a
                             By Professor Allman.
     Professor Allman described            a   new genus of Polyzoa, obtained            by
the Rev.        A. M. Norman and Mr              J.   Gwyn Jeffreys, from    deep-sea
dredgings in Shetland.
     Its   coBnceeium    consists     of   a   branched tube, partly adherent and
partly free, the free portion forming tubes of egress, through
which the polypides move in the acts of exsertion and retraction.
In   the walls      of the adherent portion            a   rigid chitinous rod     is   de

                   of Edinburgh,     Session 1868-69.                   439
veloped along their attached      side, and to this rod the     polypidos
are connected from distance to distance each by a flexible cord or
funiculus.
    The polypides are hippocrepian, and each carries         a shield-  like
process on the haemal    side of its lophophore      external to the ten
tacular series.
    The development of the bud was traced, and it was shown that
 in an early stage   the   polypide is included between two          fleshy
plates, which are placed, one on the right and the other on the left
side, and are united to one another along a portion of their circum
ference, while they are disunited along the rest.      For some time the
two plates keep pace with the general development of the bud, but
ultimately they cease to increase in size, and then remain as the
shield- like process carried by the lophophore of the adult polyzoon.
    The author regarded these plates as representing the right and
left lobes of the mantle in a Lamellibranchite mollusc, from which
it followed that the relations of the Polyzoa are more intimate
with the Lamellibranchiata than with the Brachiopoda, with which
of late years they had been associated, but whose mantle lobes lie
dorsally and ventrally, instead of lying right and left, as in the
Lamellibranchiata.     The lophophore of the Polyzoa was considered
by the author as having its representative     in the labial palps of the
Lamellibranchiata.
   The following were given     as the generic and specific diagnosis of
the new Polyzoon : —
                    Genus RnABDOPLEUEA, Allman.
    Coenceicum consisting of a branched    adherent membranous        tube,
in whose     walls along their adherent     side   a rigid chitinous rod
extends, and whose branches       terminate each in a free open tube
through which the polypide emerges.
   Lophophore hippocrepial, with a shield-like process on the haemal
side of the tentacles.     Polypides connected      to the chitinous rod
by a flexible cord or funiculus.
                  Bhabdopleura    Normani, Allman.
   Ccenoecium sub-alternately branched,       delicate, transparent,    and
colourless ; free portion of the ccencecial tubes of the same diameter
as  the adherent portion, and very distinctly and regularly annulated.

   Though     we cannot expect,       in spirit specimens, to demonstrate       by
direct observation       the presence of an epistome, we may yet take
for granted that Rhabdopleura, like all other polyzoa with hippocre-
pian lophophores, is provided with this organ, and belongs to the
Order Phylactolaemata.          Its structure, however, is so peculiar as to
justify us in assuming it as the type of a special section of the
Order, which may be thus divided —

—  I need   not say that I allude   to  Principal Forbes. This Society
is intimately identified with his life and labours.       Long our Secre
tary, he did all that was in his power to promote its success.         As a
man of science, we are too intimate in this place with his researches
to render it necessary that, on the present occasion, I should make
a  detailed  allusion to them.     His early and his latest researches
were upon heat.      He established the polarisation   and double refrac
tion of the heat ray, and proved the identity of thermal and lumi
nous radiations.     His last published research is upon the conduc
tion   of heat by iron.      In this     he  has  established   that,   like
electricity, heat passes more slowly through           a bar   of elevated
   vol. yi.                                                     3s

the absolute conductivity of a metal for heat might be measured.
   But it is probably in connection    with his researches on glaciers
that Forbes's name is best known to the general public.           His first
Memoir on the veined      or ribboned  structure of Ice was published
in our Transactions in December 1841.           Reading that memoir
with the light of recent researches, we rise profoundly impressed
with the accurate observations    and clearness of judgment        of their
author.     As he himself observes in that paper, it is astonishing
how little we see until we are taught how to observe.          This veined
structure   of glaciers is intimately connected     with their mode of
formation, and with the remarkable phenomena which render them
so  interesting to all investigators;   and yet no one observed with
the eyes   of science this important veined structure until Forbes
described it.    Even with the new experiments of James Thomson
on the lowering of the freezing point of ice under pressure, and
of those of his brother, Sir William Thomson, on the rupture pro
duced in a viscous    solid by continued shearing, we could scarcely
at the present    day observe the phenomena       more     accurately than
was done by Forbes twenty-nine years ago, or connect           them more
lucidly with the occurrence and position of the cracks and crevasses
of the glacier.
    But this and all his subsequent     researches on the motions of
glaciers   as a viscous   mass exhibit  the peculiar characteristic of
Forbes's     mind — scrupulous   conscientiousness     in    his scientific
labours, scrupulous conscientiousness    in his life as a man.
    It is not my duty to say more than    I have   done  ;  but at the first
 meeting of the Society which has occurred after his death,      I thought
it right to allude to our own loss  ; and  I now move that the Society
instruct the Council to express to Mrs Forbes and her family our
 sympathies   for their bereavement, and our sense of the loss which
 science has sustained    by the death of this distinguished         philo
 sopher.

 I. Notice of         a  Heart in which the Superior Vena Cava
     possessed a       Valve at its Auricular Orifice. By Professor
     Turner.
     Whilst examining the heart in the body of one of the male sub
jects undergoing dissection           in my practical rooms, in the early
part of this session, the large size and fenestrated condition of the
Eustachian        valve attracted     my attention.       When the heart        was
removed from the body, and the auricle submitted                 to a more care
ful scrutiny,      I observed   that  a valve    was situated at the mouth of
the superior vena cava.
     As  I have not, up to this present time, seen any record in the
various anatomical works which            I   have consulted of the existence
of    a valve    in this locality,    I am induced      to bring the specimen
before the notice of the Society.
     A  membranous valve, formed by a reduplication of the endocardial
 lining membrane, lay across the anterior and inner border of the
 auricular orifice of the superior vena cava, and hung pendulous in
 the auricular cavity.        It measured     1| inch in its long or transverse
 diameter, but was scarcely        J an inch deep;   so  that when drawn across
 the mouth of the vein, it did not cover over much more than one
 third of the orifice.         Its free border was almost         straight.    The
 attached border was semilunar in form, and connected                 to the wall
 of the auricle, close to its line of junction with the anterior wall
 of the vein, not by a continuous membrane,                   but   by numerous
 slender    fibrous    bands.     Between     these bands were       apertures   of
 various sizes, one of which, larger than the rest,              was   situated  at
 the upper and inner part of the valve, which consequently                   had a
 fenestrated appearance.         From the outer(right) end of the valve, and
 continuous with its free border,         a fibrous cord   (*) arched downwards
 beneath     the    lining membrane of the right wall of the auricle,
 and became continuous with the right border of the Eustachian
 valve.*      The inner (left) end of the valve was connected to a short
 papillary muscle, which was continuous with the muscular wall of
     * Since the specimen was shown to the Society I have recognised in two
  hearts, which have come under my notice in my dissecting room, a similar
  fibrous cord, extending from the Eustachian valve along the right posterior

the auricle.     There did not appear to     be any deficiency  in the thick
ness of the muscular coat of the superior cava.
    The Eustachian valve projected for upwards of an inch into the
auricular cavity, and presented in a remarkable degree the fenes
trated   character    which that valve occasionally exhibits in            the
adult heart.      At its left extremity it subdivided into two           parts,
one of which passed in the usual way to the auricular septum,
and became continuous with the annulus ovalis, whilst the other
was blended with the valve at the mouth             of the coronary sinus,
which also exhibited      a fenestrated  appearance.

                                                      Coronary sinus- — From a
drawing of the sprcimtn by Mr T. D. Nicholson.
   Owing to its fenestrated       condition, and small size, when com
pared with the orifice of the superior cava,         it is obvious that the
valve   situated    at the mouth     of that great vein could have had
but little influence in preventing the regurgitation of blood during
the contraction of      the auricle in      the adult heart.       But it is
probable that in the foetal stage of this heart the backward              flow
wall of the auricle, almost as far as the orifice of the superior cava, but no
valve existed at the mouth of the superior cava.

 into the vein would       have been very considerably impeded       by its
 presence  ;  for there is reason to believe that the fenestrated state,
 not only of this, but of the other valves at the mouths of the great
 veins, is due to atrophy taking place after birth.       As the muscular
 coat of the superior cava possessed its usual thickness, the valve
 was   obviously not developed to compensate         for any deficiency in
 that portion of the wall of the great vein.
    As the Eustachian valve at the mouth of the inferior cava serves
 in the foetus to direct the current of blood passing upwards along
 that vein through the foramen       ovale,  it is possible that the valve
 at the  mouth of the superior cava may have exercised some direct
 ing effect on     the blood which entered      the auricle by the latter
 vessel.   From its position it would,        I think,  have directed   the
 blood   of the superior cava away from the auricular septum, and
 thus have aided       in preventing, during the foetal condition, the
mingling of the blood of the two       cavae  in the auricular cavity.
    The occurrence      of such a valve is not, however, of interest
 merely in its physiological relations : it possesses also a morpholo
gical value.      For it may be regarded as presenting in the human
heart a rudimentary example of an arrangement which is met with
in the heart of the bird.       If the heart of a large bird, e.g., the
ostrich   (Struthio camelus),   be examined,     it may be seen that the
sinus, into which the venae     cavae open, is separated from the   auricle
proper   by  a large double  muscular valve.     The right segment of this
valve is related not only to the mouth of the right superior cava,
but extends down the wall of the auricle to the mouth of the inferior
cava, and     is then prolonged as far as the mouth of the left supe
rior cava, which may be regarded         as  representing in position the
coronary vein in the human heart.           Now, in this specimen it will
be remembered        that the valve at the mouth of the superior cava
was   continued, through the intermediation of a fibrous cord (*), into
the Eustachian valve, and that the latter again was directly united
with the valve at the mouth of the coronary sinus.
    As additional illustrations of the tendency to the development
of rudimental structures in this individual, it is of interest also to
mention that he had in each upper            arm a processus supra-condy-
loideus humeri interims, the relations of which to the supra-condy-
loid foramen of various of the mammalia, more especially of the

458                        Proceedings            of the Royal Society
carnivora,             in 1839 by A. W. Otto, and in 1840 and
                  was described
1841 by Robert Knox, and many examples of which have since
that time been recorded by other anatomists.  From the tip of
this process       of fascia passed down to the inner condyle, so
                        a band
as to complete the boundary of the foramen, through which the
median nerve and the ulnar artery passed ; for in both upper arms
a high division of the brachial artery had taken place ; and whilst
the radial branch closely followed the inner border of the biceps,
the ulnar was deflected from its course, and passed, along with the
median nerve, behind the supra-condyloid                                     process.

    Atropia. — Atropia is     a nitrile  base.   All   we   know of its consti
tution is, that by the action of strong acids and bases it is decom
 posed, in accordance with the equation.*

So that atropia may        be considered    as tropia,    in which one atom of
hydrogen     has been replaced by tropyl, the radical of tropic acid.
Tropic acid belongs to the aromatic series, and is considered by
 Kraut to be phenylsarcolactic acid— HO . CHS- (^(CyEJCOOH.
 Of the constitution of tropia we know nothing whatever, except
that it is a nitrile base.
    Iodide of methyl-atropium. — Iodide of methyl acts very readily
on atropia, a good deal       of heat is produced, and after the reaction
is over, the iodide of methyl-atropium            remains     as a   white mass.
From this the excess of iodide of methyl was removed by a current
of air, and the dry salt dissolved in water, filtered, and evaporated
at a temperature not exceeding 40° C.             The concentrated solution
thus obtained, on cooling, deposits the salt in prismatic crystals,
apparently belonging to the monoclinic system ; sometimes part of

 the salt separates as a heavy oil, which soon crystallises.               These

 When they are powdered,           or when     their solution is warmed,          a
 pleasant fruity smell is observed.
    Sulphate   of methyl-atropium. — The sulphate was prepared               from
 the iodide by the method formerly described for the preparation of
 sulphate of methyl-strychnium, &c.           It  is a white crystalline      salt,
 very deliquescent,    and very soluble in water.
    Iodide   of ethyl-atropium.
                                   — Iodide of ethyl acts readily on
 atropia, but not so energetically as iodide of methyl.          In preparing
 the iodide of ethyl-atropium, atropia was treated with a consider
able excess of iodide of ethyl in sealed tubes at 100° C. for an hour.
The remainder of the process, and the preparation of the sulphate,
are the same as in the case of the methyl derivative.
    The authors intend, on some future occasion, to describe these
substances more minutely ; for their present purpose, the descrip
tion given above     seems sufficient.
    Atropia has   a somewhat    complicated      physiological action,     for it
directly influences the functions of the cerebro-spinal,        and also of the
sympathetic     nervous system.
   The action of the methyl and ethyl derivatives on the                cerebro
spinal nervous system is different        from that of the natural          base,
while the action on the sympathetic         system is essentially the same.
    The principal effects produced by atropia on the cerebro-spinal
nervous system are excitation of the spinal cord,* and paralysis of
the motor      and  sensory nerves.      In  a previous   paper, the authors
showed     that the spinal stimulant action            of strychnia,     brucia,
thebaia.codeia,    and morphia, is not possessed by the salts of the         am
monium bases derived from these alkaloids, but that in its place these
derivatives    possess  a markedly different paralysing action           on the
peripheral terminations of motor nerves. They now announce that
a similar change occurs in the methyl and ethyl derivatives of
atropia.    These derivatives are more powerful paralysing substances
than atropia itself.
    A considerable     amount   of spinal stimulant and of           paralysing
action   may be produced      by a non-fatal dose      of atropia  ;  and it   if

 probable      that the one action      is,   to   a   certain extent, antagonistic to
 the other.       As the methyl and ethyl derivatives,                  however, combine
 with the ordinary paralysing action of atropia, an additional amount
 of paralysing action bearing some ratio to the absent spinal stimul
 ant action      of the natural      base,     these derivatives        affect the motor
 nerves much more         powerfully than atropia itself. Probably, for these
 reasons,      the salts of methyl- and ethyl-atropium                       are fatal to the
 lower animals in much smaller doses than the salts of atropia itself.
   Paralysis of the vagi nerves                    and   dilatation of the pupil are
 caused     by these derivatives of atropia.

mixture of two bases, to which they give the names of conia and
"

physical       properties.      Their composition             is   represented            by the
formulae       CgH^N and C9H,.N.              The chemists above named investi
gated     very completely       the action of iodide of ethyl on conia, and
proved that conia (or, as         it   is     called in the present paper, normal
conia)    is   an imide base, and that methyl-conia                is   a   nitrile   base.
   The substances examined in the present paper are —                        :
   1st, Conia — samples of which were obtained from Messrs Duncan
and Flockhart,       Macfarlan     &   Co., and Morson.            The authors are also
indebted       to the kindness of       Dr Christison for the opportunity of
examining the action of          a   specimen of conia which he prepared                       in
the year 1835.

iodide    of methyl and the methyl-conia contained                               in conia      as
obtained       from the plant.
  Iodide of methyl acts readily upon conia, producing                                 a   syrupy
or crystalline substance, which    mixture of hydriodate of methyl-
                                         is   a
conia and iodide of dimethyl-conium, — the former produced from the
normal conia, and the latter from the methyl-conia.                           The action of
caustic     potash   decomposes the hydriodate               of methyl-conia, setting
the base free, while the iodide of dimethyl-conium                           is   unattacked.
The two substances can thus            be     readily separated from each other.

464:                 Proceedings of the Royal Society
   The authors find that the salts of conia and of methyl-conia                very
closely resemble each other in action and in poisonous activity.
Their action agrees with the descriptions of the effects of conia by
the    more    trustworthy of previous          observers.    Among the        most
obvious of the effects on rabbits were stiffness of the limbs, causing
difficulty in moving about         ;  spasmodic     starts ; distinct increase    of
reflex excitability; gradually increasing paralysis with diminution,
and afterwards         disappearance,    of the increased reflex excitability;
and, finally, death by asphyxia.            Shortly before death a few        starts
and feeble convulsions usually occurred, but these symptoms were
apparently       caused by the advancing asphyxia.
    The symptoms          in frogs were mainly those of paralysis,         and the
authors confirm the observations             of Kölliker and Guttmann, that
this paralysis in the        case  of ordinary conia is due to       a curare-like
action.      They further find that methyl-conia also acts by paralysing
the terminations of motor nerves.
    The salts of dimethyl-conia differ from those of conia                   and of
 methyl-conia        in never directly producing convulsant              effects  or
 other symptoms of abnormal            activity of the reflex function,      and in
being much less active         as poisons.     In  rabbits and frogs, the symp
toms were invariably those of paralysis; and, in the latter animal, the
 authors have demonstrated           that this paralysis is due to an action      on
 the terminations of the motor nerves.
    The samples of conia which have been examined by the authors
 were found to contain very varying proportions of normal conia
 and of methyl-conia;           but as these two substances          appear to    be
 about equally active as poisons,         it is probable that the very     variable
 potency of commercial         conia is due to its adulteration     with  a greater
 or less amount         of water, and, possibly, also to the          presence     of
 varying quantities of ammonia.*
    * When      the authors had nearly concluded their investigation on conia,
 they   received  a communication from MM. Jolyet and Cahouraof Paris, inform
 ing   them   that  these physiologists were ready to publish a paper upon the
 relative action of the salts of conia, ethyl-conia, and diethyl-conium. In order
 to secure simultaneous publication, it was arranged that the two papers should
 be communicated       on the same day — the one to the Academy of Sciences        of
 Paris, and the other to this Society.

2.   Note on the Determination                 of Heights, chiefly in the
     Interior of Continents, from Observations of Atmospheric
     Pressure. By Alexander Buchan, M.A., Secretary of the
     Scottish Meteorological Society.
     The weight or pressure of the atmosphere is ascertained by the
mercurial barometer, the aneroid, or from the temperature of the
boiling point of water.  The height of a hill is measured baro
metrically, from observations           made simultaneously at its base and
top,      and   the   application of certain        well-known        formulae.       The
height of       a place     at no great distance from another            place whose
height is known, and at which observations                  are   made about the
same time, may similarly be ascertained with a close approximation
to the truth.
   But, with regard to places far from any place of known elevation,
or from any place at which meteorological observations are made,
it is plain that the height can only be computed by assuming                              a
certain pressure as the sea-level pressure at that place.
  In the Table giving the reductions of heights from Captain
Speke's observations,           it is stated (Journal of the Royal Geographical
Society, vol. xxxiii.) that           a mean pressure      of 29"92 inches             was
assumed as the mean sea-level              pressure,   — that   is,
                                                                  if    those parts of
Africa visited by Speke had been on the same level with the                            sea,
it   is   assumed that the mean pressure of the atmosphere would have
 been 29-92 inches.
     In the last       "Hints to Travellers," prepared
                      revised                             theRoyal        by
 Geographical Society, and published in the Journal, vol. xxxiv.,                        it
is stated at page 286, " When the boiling point at the upper
 station alone        is   observed, we may assume 30-00 inches, or               a   little
 less, as the average height of the barometer at the level of the sea.
 The altitude of the upper station             is   then at once approximately
 obtained from the tables." So far            as
                                              I      have been able to ascertain,
 this mean height of the barometer has been generally accepted by
 travellers as applicable to all seasons, and to all parts of the globe at
 great distances from Meteorological Observatories.                   Unfortunately,     it
 has hitherto been generally the practice for travellers, or those who
 have been intrusted with reducing their observations,                    to give only
 the heights deduced from the observations,               with    a   curious minute

ness of accuracy, and not the observations                       themselves.        Since the
tables which have been prepared for travellers                     are calculated      on the
assumption            that   29-92    inches, or 30-0 inches, is the zero point for
heights, there can             be    little doubt that, by this method, the heights
of many            plateaux and mountains of the globe have thus                         been
determined.
  From my paper, read before this Society in March 1868, on the
Mean Pressure of the Atmosphere over the Globe, illustrated with
three charts, showing the Mean Isobaric Curves for                      July, January,       and
the year,         it may     be seen     that   a pressure   of from    29"9 to 30-0 inches
is very near the mean annual pressure over the greater part of the
globe, particularly over those portions of                     it explored by travellers.
But when we examine the months, it is at once apparent that 29-9
inches is very far from the mean pressure in many regions.  This
point will be illustrated by the pressures at Barnaul, Siberia, which on
an average of 19 years are, reduced to 32° and sea-level, as follows : —
Mean atmospheric                pressure at Barnaul in          July,       29-536 inches.
                  „                  „               „          January, 30293           „
                                                                Year,       29-954       „
Suppose, now, it be proposed to ascertain the height of Lake Balkash
on some day in               July,   the pressure at the time being the average
of the month.        Let the observed pressure be 288 inches reduced to
32°      F., and the temperature of the air be 70°0, then if the sea-level
pressure be assumed to be 299 inches, it is plain that the difference
due to height is 1-10 inches; in other words, the height of the lake
would       be,    in round numbers, 1080 feet.                  But since the sea-level
pressure of this locality, which is nearly that of Barnaul, is 29-536
inches, the difference of pressure due to height is only 0-736 inch;
the height, therefore, is only about 730 feet.                     Again,    if in January,
when the barometer is the mean of the month, the pressure at Lake
Balkash was observed to                  be 29-42 inches, and the temperature          of the
air l°-0, assuming that 29-9 inches is the mean sea-level pressure of
January,0"48 inch is the difference of pressure due to height — that                          is,
the lake      is   about 400 feet above the sea.             But since the mean pressure
        nearly 30-3 inches, 088 inch            is   the pressure due to height; the lake
is is   therefore nearly 730 feet above the sea.                  Thus in    July   the lake
would be made 350 feet too high, and in January 330 feet too low — the

                       of Edinburgh, Session 1868-69.                                 467
 difference of the two observations,             each being here supposed to be
 taken under the most favourable circumstances, and with the greatest
 accuracy, being 680 feet.*             Observations       made in the first      half of
 April, or in the latter half of October, when the pressure is the mean
 of the year, supply the best data for the calculation of heights. ..
    If   the     best  physical atlases        be    examined,    and     the heights,
given by different authorities,              of table-lands and mountains,                of
 Central Asia, Central Africa,              and    the   highlands of the United
 States   and     British America be compared, considerable                   confusion
 will  be  found to prevail.
    One or two examples may be given to show the application of all
 this.    From barometric        observations        made on the 28th November
 1838, the      level of the Dead Sea below that of the Mediterranean
was calculated        to be 1429 feet.         The real depth of this         sea below
the    level     of the Mediterranean,          as   determined     by the English
engineers        by levelling,     is 1296 feet.           Now,    since     the    mean
pressure    of the atmosphere over the region of the Dead Sea in the
end    of November is about 30-035 inches, it is seen, if the sea-level
pressure was assumed to be 299 inches, how the lake came to be
lowered 133 feet.
   Much interest is at present attached to the heights of Central
Africa.       The following mean pressures at             32° and sea-level bear on
this interesting question        : —
                        January.      July.                        January.        July.

   Thus the difference at Graff Reinet and Maritzburg between the
January and July pressures amounts to about 0-30 inches.                            From
this it may be inferred that, in calculating heights along the
Zambesi, from observations made at different seasons,                  if no  allowance
be made     for the monthly variation, but            if 29-92 inches be assumed as
   * The height of Lake Balkash, according to the Russian explorers Ssemonoff
and Golubefl", may be anywhere between 530 feet as given by the former, and
1200 feet as given by the latter. For a large number of heights made use of in
writing this note, the author is indebted to Mr Keith Johnston, jun.

468                Proceedings          of the Royal Society
the height for all seasons, the results             from observations       made in
January will differ from 250 to 300 feet from those obtained                     from
observations     made in       July    at the same place.         If no account be
taken of the daily variation of the pressure, the observations made
in  July   at 9 a.m.  will give       a difference   of from 350 to 400 feet         in
height    as compared       with results from observations made in           July    at
4 p.m.     All this    large error is avoided when the monthly and the
daily variations     are allowed       for.
   It  has been seen that the summer              pressure in Central Asia falls
in  July   to about 29-500 inches.             It might    be  inferred by   analogy
that the pressure in Central Africa also falls considerably below
29-92 inches over those regions where the sun is nearly vertical; and,
as a consequence,         that this space of low pressure moves north and
south with the sun, attaining its northern limit in July, and its
southern     in January.           The figures in the table given        above fully
bear out this supposition.              Thus, in   July     at Algiers    the  mean
pressure is 30-06       ;  but   at Laghouat, between 280 and             300 miles
inland, the pressure is only about 29-86 inches               ; at Alexandria it is
2980    ; and at Aden, only 29-69 inches             ;  and since, in      the  same
month, according          to Speke, the wind in Central             Africa  near the
equator and long. 32° 20'            E. is almost constantly S.E., it is          pro
bable that the pressure there is lower than at Aden.                     Taking    the
whole facts into consideration,             it can scarcely      be less than 29-70
inches, though probably            it is lower.    Again, in January the        pres
sure at Cape Town being 29-97 inches, at Graff Reinet 2991 inches,
and at Maritzburg           29-89 inches, points      still further to a diminu
tion of pressure in the centre of southern Africa at this season, in
creasing     from the coast — falling, probably            to between     29-70 and
 2980 inches.      Hence,       if  we assume 29-70 inches          as the low pres
sure which accompanies             the sun over those parts of Africa          where
 he is nearly vertical, we shall not be far from the truth.
    Let us apply this reasoning to the determination of the height
 of Albert Nyanza from Sir Samuel W. Baker's observation of the
 boiling point of water.          The observation      was made in lat. 1° 14'N.,
 long. 30° 50'   E, on 14th March 1864, between                  8 and 10 a.m., pro
 bably at 9 a.m. The boiling point of the thermometer was 207°-8,
 but as it changed while in Sir Samuel Baker's possession, it is
 supposed that the true reading was about 207°-3, which corresponds

                      of Edinburgh,        Session 1868-69.                    469
to a pressure      of 27-231 inches.*           But since the observation      was
made about      9 a.m.,  when the pressure is about the maximum of the
day, subtracting -043 inch            as   the correction      for daily range in
July,   we obtain      as the    mean pressure of the day 27-188 inches.
If we   assume the sea-level pressure to be 2970 inches, the differ
ence due to difference        of height will      be 2"512 inches, and the tem
perature     of the air being at the time 84- 0, the height of Albert
Nyanza will be in round numbers about 2550 feet, or considerably
under the height usually given.
   Similarly, by the same reasoning, Gondokoro, calculated from Sir
Samuel W. Baker's observations to be 1999 feet in height, will be
only about 1800 feet above the level of the              sea.
   Considering the small difference within the tropics in the mean
pressure of any month, say July, from year to year, it follows that
if  recent    African    travellers had been provided with good ther
mometers       for determining the boiling-point of water, and had
made      carefully    conducted      observations      with    them,   noting  the
precise     hour and month of the observations,                  one of the great
problems of African travel would have been already solved, viz.,
whether Lake Tanganyika does or does not flow into Albert
Nyanza, unless the difference of level between these two lakes is
comparatively small.            But    since    travellers have been given to
understand that the heights deduced from their observations may
be in error to the extent of from 300 to 500 feet, less care has
been bestowed in making such observations                   than would otherwise
have been the       case.
    In extra-tropical      regions    the height of the barometer is much
more     fluctuating, and the pressure during any month from year
to year varies more than within the tropics.                     But even in these
regions the limits of error        are much less than are         usually supposed,
if  care be taken to make the observations               full and precise, so that
when     they come to        be  reduced it may be in the power of the
meteorologist       to value them at their proper worth.              This remark
may require a little explanation.
    In  temperate      regions   barometric      fluctuations    are more frequent
and of greater amplitude in such countries               as  Great Britain, which
 are situated    between     a continent     on   the one hand and an ocean on
                      * Regnault's   Tables, revised by Moritz.
    vol. VI.                                                             3 p

470               Proceedings of the Royal Society
the other, than in the interior of continents in the same latitudes.
Now, since it is to the interior of continents, viz., Asia, Africa,
North and South America, and Australia, that these remarks on
the discussing of heights are intended        to apply, the limits   of error
of single observations, or groups of observations, of the pressure of
the atmosphere, are much less than one accustomed to observe
barometric    fluctuations in Great Britain       might be led to   suppose.
Hence,   if  the mean monthly sea-level        pressure of the part of the
earth's   surface where the observation        is made be kept     in mind,
the difference between this pressure       and the observed pressure will
be a tolerable approximation to the true difference of pressure due
to the elevation    of the place.
   But a still closer approximation may be reached.           All examina
tion of weather on a large scale shows, in the most conclusive
manner,     that barometric fluctuations are always attended with
changes of weather of a well-marked and determinate character.
Hence, conversely,     if travellers  kept a careful record of the weather
some time before and some time after they made their observations
of the pressure of the atmosphere, some idea could be formed            as to
whether the observed pressure was above or below the mean pressure
of the season at the place.
   Thus, suppose that for some time before and after the observa
tion the weather was fine and of          a steady character   throughout,
the nights not much        colder   and the days not much hotter than
usual, the winds light, or     if moderate, continuing in one direction,
and the state of the sky with respect to cloud much the same from
day to day,    it might  be assumed     that the pressure was the average
of the season.     Observations    carefully made under these conditions
are entitled to be ranked in the first class, as being the most trust
worthy that can     be obtained.
   But   if  the nights have been for a day or two colder, the days
 hotter (in the sun), the air drier, and the winds lighter, and calm
weather more prevalent than usual, then it is probable that the
pressure at the time of observation was above the average of the
season.
   Again, suppose, in the north temperate zone, the air to              have
become warmer       and moister, the sky clouded, rain      to have fallen,
and the wind veered from         E. or S.E., by   S. and S.W. to N.W.,     or

                     of Edinburgh,        Session 1868-69.                        471
 suddenly shifted to        W. or N.W., and the weather then to have be
 come  colder and clearer and the air drier, it is certain that a storm
 of greater or less magnitude has passed over the region, and since
 such storms are attended with great fluctuations of the barometer,
 it is plain that      if   the observation      of pressure   was   made during
 these changes,     it is worse than useless        as a datum    for the determi
 nation of the height of the place.               It  should, therefore,    be alto
 gether rejected.
    These   cases are given as examples              of the   method     by which
observations, as made by travellers,             should be critically examined
before they are made use of in calculating heights.                      It   is pro
 bably from inattention to these             simple directions — travellers not
recording     the required        data, which can all be recorded without
instruments,      and computers not giving weight to such observations
when recorded      — that     a large number      of the grosser discrepancies,
given in works of Physical             Geography, have arisen.        Many of the
larger errors are, of course, due to the use of imperfect instruments
and a   want of practice in the observer.
    An illustration of errors in the statement of heights may be given.
The following places are situated in the neighbourhood of the Ural
Mountains      ; the heights are those given by the most recent author

the averages of mean annual pressure have been calculated                   : —

From the above annual mean pressures it is evident that the height
of Nijni-Tagilsk is over stated, the true height being, probably
about 250 feet less than what has hitherto been assigned to it.
   Since it has, unfortunately, been the general                   practice    not to
publish the original observations, but only the heights deduced from
them,   it will be impossible, except in         a comparatively small number

to past observations.
   Observations    for the ascertaining of heights must, to           be satis
factory, include the following particulars     : —
   1. Latitude and longitude of the place.
   2. The date of the observation, giving exactly the                year,   the
        month, the day of the month, and the hour of the day.
   3. The observation itself exactly as made ; if with a barometer
        or aneroid, the pressure to be given      ;  if with  a thermometer,
        the boiling-point to be given, and not merely its equivalent
        in pressure.
   4. The temperature of the air in shade.
   5. The weather for two days before and after the observation,
        showing the temperature of the air, its probable humidity as
        made known by the feelings or by its effects on surrounding
        objects,  the amount     of cloud,  the rainfall,      the direction,
        veerings, shifts, and force of the wind, together             with any
        striking phenomena that may occur.
To these might     be added,  if  possible, observations      of the  wet-bulb
thermometer.
   It will be evident    from  these remarks        that the Physical      Geo
grapher    will require the practised Meteorologist to aid him                in
settling the important physical problem          of heights for large       por
tions of the earth's surface.
3.  Notice of a Remarkable Mirage Observed in the Firth of
                      Forth.     By Dr Christison.
   Some years ago, when visiting on the 31st            of May the beautiful
scenery of Dalmeny Park,      I  observed about three in the afternoon,
from the terrace on which stand the ruins of Barenbougle Castle,
some remarkable      examples of mirage on the        Firth of Forth, which
are perhaps   worthy of record.
   The atmosphere was uncommonly clear in every direction, sun
shiny, warm, calm ; and what little wind there was came from the
south west.     But  a black, sultry-looking cloud was forming            at the
same time in the north-west,        from   which in an hour and          a half
afterwards, as   I was  on my way home to town, a severe thunder

storm    gradually spread south-eastward          over the whole          Firth and
surrounding country.
    Looking   eastward       towards   the mouth     of the Firth, while the
weather    continued very fine,        I  was surprised    to observe that the
northern edge of the cone of North Berwick Law, twenty-four miles
distant, at about one-third of its slope from the summit, suddenly
ceased, and     had given place to a sheer perpendicular precipice,
overhanging its base.             At  the  same    time   the   spit of land of
East Lothian, which           is usually seen  to extend     more than a mile
from the Law towards the           Fife coast, had disappeared        ;  the ocean
had taken its place, and           the   overhanging precipice          of the hill
seemed to dip into the water.            I carefully examined these appear
ances with a Ross's telescope of very sharp definition, and could
easily ascertain that there was no mist anywhere             ; and the apparent
precipice and apparentsea presented no character different from those
of the true sky-line of the hill above, or the true sea north
ward    from where Gullane         Point terminates the land        as seen from
my station.
                Fig.   1. — North  Berwick Law, twenty-four    miles.
    I then  also noticed       that what appeared to be the south point of
 Inchkeith   as seen     from Barnbougle, eight miles distant, had thrown
out southward      a   line of three detached rocks,~with          sea separating
them from one another, and likewise with sea apparently passing
under them,     as   if  they were suspended in the air a few yards above
 the water; and that in like manner the water seemed, as                  it were, to
 have passed to some distance          under the point of the island itself,
 raising  a long low line of dark land          a  little into the air.        It was
 impossible   to put an end to this illusion with the telescope              ; on the
  contrary, it was rendered more distinct and apparently                real.

 474                 Proceedings of the Royal Society
     But the most remarkable          transformation was effected in      a sloop
 which was sailing obliquely across my line of vision from south
 west to north-east,       apparently at the Granton Ferry, about four
 miles     off.   From the set of its sails, and the darkness of a great
 extent of the Firth around, the vessel was evidently carrying with
 it  a  brisk favouring breeze from the south-west             ;  and during the
 fifteen or twenty minutes         that my observation       lasted  it must have
 changed its place by two miles.            But during all that time it pre
 sented the appearance of a narrow gap in its entire hull immediately
 before its single mast, and a very much wider one behind the mast.
 The     sea was    visible through both gaps      ;  and with the telescope it
 was easy to observe the helmsman at the            tiller on a poop completely
 and widely separated from the forward part of the vessel.                   The
 ferry steamer appearing          from   Granton on her passage to Burnt-
                           Fig. 2. — Vessel six miles  off.
island,    I was    anxious to   see   what might happen to her when she
arrived     in the same water with the sloop. But when she came
into a line with the sloop, it was at once apparent that the sloop
was about two miles farther off; and she had previously appeared
to be nearer, in consequence of the sheet of dark broken water in
which she had been sailing being apparently raised above the level
of the calm white water surrounding it on all sides over the rest of
the    Firth.
     During     a period   of about twenty minutes, spent in watching
these alterations of form in North Berwick Law, Inchkeith, and
the sailing vessel, I could not detect the slightest change in the
character of the appearances.
    I  am    unwilling to attempt an explanation of these singular

deviations from optical rectitude,          because     I do not see how recog
nised theory     will explain them all. But            I may venture to suggest
that such instances of mirage in our Firth and elsewhere may
deserve    attention     as    possible  prognostics      of weather.        On the
occasion in question there were evident signs of a widely extended
disturbance      of the usual condition of the atmosphere                ;  and   the
occurrence of a violent thunderstorm afterwards,                  which lasted far
into the evening, is not unworthy of notice.
    Often as   I have   been at Barnbougle Castle in beautiful summer
afternoons, and often          as  I  have been on the shores of the            Firth
in all parts, as well as on its waters,            I  never happened to notice
any mirage      before.        Subsequently,    however,     —I   do not recollect
from what position, but         I rather think from Leith Pier, —I observed
that Aberlady Bay seemed to lead to a strait with perpendicular
cliffs on either side, the promontory on which Gosford,                    Dirleton,
Gullane, and North Berwick stand, being converted into a beautiful
and extensive      island   ;  and the illusion was rendered complete            by a
vessel    under full sail bearing to all appearance directly for the
mouth     of the imaginary strait.
    My son also informs me that on another occasion he observed
with the naked eye, but still better with the aid of a telescope,
from Leith Pier, the same promontory cut into eight or ten islands,
apparently      reflected     in an apparently       calm sea, which joined by
a  well-defined margin the real            sea   itself, much    disturbed     at the
time by a brisk         breeze.        The   appearance      of these islands,      as
seen    through the telescope, was exceedingly beautiful, as they
seemed to be clothed with fine trees, and, reflected in the calm
ocean,    were suggestive       rather of  a  tropical than    a northern scene.
    It  is probable     that such appearances            are  not   infrequent — so
frequent, at least, as to give adequate opportunities for studying
them ; and that we do not hear of them merely from inobservance ;
for my     son adds that,         although many people, sailors          as   well  as
others, were walking           on the pier at the time, not one seemed to
take notice of the remarkable           phenomena,       which strongly attracted
his attention and that of his brother who accompanied                   him.

he should be cut off in the prime          of life, and the scientific    world
deprived   of his services at     a time when his appointment        as  Princi
pal of St Andrews University           had placed him in a position where,

   1.  Practical Note on Intensified Gravity in Centrifugal
            Governors. By Professor C. Piazzi Smyth.
   This paper, after   a short   introduction upon previous publications
and experiences,     describes     in a plain and practical manner        four
steps of improvement       recently made in the centrifugal governor of
an equatorial driving clock      ;   and touches on
      1.  The number of the pendulums            ;
      2.  Their weight and momentum            ;
      3.  Their chronometric principle       ;   and
      4. The    intensification     of the effect of gravity upon them,
             chiefly to increase the promptitude and energy of the
             centrifugal action.
   This last improvement the author regards as the most important
to draw attention to, because it is capable of imparting extreme
quickness and sensibility to the actions of all kinds of centrifugal
governors ; and although not absolutely new, it does not seem
yet to   be sufficiently known or employed           in many practical cases,
where it might be of the utmost use,           as  in preventing some classes
of disasters which are in these days happening far too frequently
to sea-going screw-steamers.

2.  Mr Mill's Theory of Geometrical Reasoning Mathemati
   cally Tested.        By W. R. Smith, Esq., Assistant to the
   Professor of Natural Philosophy.                      Communicated by
   Professor Tait.
   An amusing and instructive example of the way in which logicians
are accustomed to dogmatise upon the theory of sciences that they
do not understand,        is afforded    by Mr Mill's explanation of the
nature of geometrical      reasoning.
   Those who remember that           Mr Mill     assures  Dr Whewell that he
has conscientiously studied geometry (Logic, 7th ed. I. 270), will
probably find some difficulty in believing that the demonstration of
Euc. I6, which Mr Mill offers as an illustration of the justice of hia

 478               Proceedings of the Royal Society
 theory of geometrical      reasoning,   depends on the axiom, that tri
 angles, having two sides equal each to each, are equal in all respects.
 Such, nevertheless,    is the case   ; and when one sees this absurdity
 pass unmodified     from    edition to edition of Mr Mill's Logic,         and
 when even Mansel, Mr Mill's watchful enemy, tells us that " against
 the form of the geometrical syllogism, as exhibited by Mr Mill, the
                                                 "
 logician will have no objections to allege        (Mansel's Aldrich, 3d ed.,
 p. 255), one cannot but think that logic would make more progress
 if logicians would give a little more attention to the processes they
 profess to explain.
    It  may perhaps    be  worth while to show how Mr            Mill  was led
 into this extraordinary        mistake.    We shall find that Mr Mill
 chooses   rather to sacrifice     geometry    to his philosophy, than to
 modify his philosophy in accordance with the facts of geometry.
    Mr Mill holds that all general knowledge is derived from experi
 ence  ; meaning by experience the comparison of at least two distinct
experimental facts. In other words, all knowledge is ultimately
gained by induction from a series of observed facts. That any general
truth can be got at intuitively, by merely looking at one case, Mr Mill
emphatically denies. The fact that two straight lines cannot enclose
a space, is not   self-evident   as soon as we  know what straight lines     are
[i.e., can mentally construct such lines]; but is got at only by experi
ments on    "real "or " imaginary "lines (Logic, I. pp. 259, 262). Now
it is certain, that in the demonstrations of Euclid,        we are satisfied  of
the truth of the general proposition enunciated,          as soon as we have
read the proof for the special figure laid down.           There is no need
for an induction from the comparison of several figures.                  Since
then one figure is as good as half a dozen, Mr Mill is forced to the
conclusion    that the figure is no essential part of the proof, or that
" by dropping the use of
                               diagrams, and substituting, in the demon
strations,  general phrases for the letters of the alphabet, we might
                                          "         " the axioms and defini

                                 "
tions in their general form (p. 213).
    We may just mention, in passing, that this view, combined with
the    doctrine that the definitions of geometry            are purely hypo
thetical, leads Mr    Mill  to the curious opinion that we might          make
any number of imaginary sciences as complicated              as geometry,    by
applying real axioms to imaginary definitions.             We mention this

merely to illustrate            Mr Mill's position — our                 present business is to
see how these views             of geometry work in practice.
      Mr Mill's                           Euclid F, which he under
                      example, as we have said, is
takes to deduce from the original deductive foundations.  We have
first (p. 241) some preliminary remarks,
which afford a remarkably happy instance
of the way in which Mr             Mill    is accustomed
to keep himself safe from                 all opponents,
by alternately supporting each of two con
trary views of           a subject.        " First,"
                                                     says
he,    speaking of the angles               ABE, CBE            ;
 ACD, BCD, " it could                   be perceived       in
tuitively          that their differences          were the
angles at the base."              If    this intuition         is
really a step in the proof, then, since in
tuition is just actual looking at the figure, what becomes of the
doctrine that the figure is not essential, or of the still more funda
mental doctrine,              that no general         truth can flow from                  a   single
intuition?*            In this,   however,     Mr Mill only falls foul of himself.
A more serious matter             is,   that when he sets about his regular demon
stration, he falls foul of the truths of geometry.
  Having shown that AD = AE, Mr Mill proceeds                                     thus: —"Both
                             "
these pairs of straight lines [AC, AB      AD, AE] "       :                      have the pro
perty of equality which         mark that,    applied               if            to each other
                                         is
                                         a
                          ;
they will coincide.    Coinciding altogether, means                                  coinciding in
every part, and of course                  at their extremities,             D,   E. and       B,   C."
Now, "straight lines, having their extremities coincident, coincide.
BE and CD have been brought within this formula by the pre
ceding induction          ;    they will, therefore, coincide."                [!]    If   Mr Mill
generalises         this conclusion,      I   think he will find             it   to be that two
triangles, having two sides of each equal, are equal in all respects                                 ;
and from this theorem he may at once conclude, by his own fourth
formula       ["    angles having their sides coincident, coincide                           "],   that
     * This   is   no mere slip on Mr     Mill's
                                             To show that the angles at the

figure, we must have   new axiom [proved, of course, by induction
                           a                                         viz., that         !]

with the opposite angle falls wholly without the triangle.

480                 Proceedings of the Royal Society
angles contained      by equal straight lines are equal            ! It  is clear that
Mr Mill did not        see   that the point is to show that,            the triangles
ABE, AGD, remaining rigid, AB may                        be applied     to   AC,   and
AE to AD at the same time. But this                     can only be brought out
by figuring      to oneself     AB moved          round    to coincide with AC,
and then the triangle          ABE     rotated about      AB through two right
angles  ;  and this process was not             competent to Mr Mill, whose
theory bound him to prove the equality of the triangles by pure
                                                 "
syllogism     from    the two formulas,            equal    straight lines, being
                                                   "
applied to one another, coincide," and straight lines, having their
extremities coincident, coincide."
   But Mr Mill may say, "          I  have only to add, that equal angles
applied to one another coincide."
   Very well, you have then three syllogisms : —
Equal straight lines coincide           if    Equal straight lines coincide           if
                applied    ;                                 applied  ;
          AC, AB,    are equal.                       AD, AE, are equal.
                       Equal angles coincide         if applied  ;
                              CAD, BAE,        are equal.
   Logically these three syllogisms can give only three independent
conclusions : —
   AC, AB coincide if applied.               |     AD, AE coincide if applied.
              The angles CAD, BAE coincide if applied : —
but by no means the           one conclusion that the rigid figures             ABE,
ACD coincide if applied.            If   Mr Mill still contends that there            is
no need for intuition here, let him substitute for the words                   " equal
straight lines,"
                    "                                         The premises of his
                       equal arcs of great circles."
syllogisms are still all right ; but, owing to circumstances that
must be seen to be understood,             the spherical      triangles cannot       be
made to coincide.
   There    are   only two courses open to Mr Mill — either to confess
that the attempt to square geometry with a preconceived theory has
forced him into a grossly erroneous demonstration, or to invent a
new formula — viz., that if in two plane figures any number of con
secutive sides and angles taken one by one may be made to coincide,
they may also be made to coincide as rigidly connected wholes.                     But,
 then, Mr Mill must maintain that the man who reads Euc.                         I4 for

                         of Edinburgh,            Session 1868-69.                                 481
the first time does not at once conclude                     the general           truth of this
formula from           the    one figure         before   him, but either brings the
formula with him to the proof as a result of previous induction, or
requires to pause in the proof, and satisfy himself                          of the truth of
the    formula by       a comparison   of figures.
                                            of   a series
  It is easily shown, by the same species of analysis as we have
adopted here, that wherever a real step is made in geometry we
must either use the figure or introduce a new general                                 axiom [not
of course in mere converses, as Euc. I1',                   I"]. All        geometrical            con
struction       is in the last resort a means of making clear to the eye
complicated relations of figures.
  Now,       if we    can at once and with certainty conclude from the one
case   figured in the diagram to the general                    case   —   if,   that    is,   axioms
are proved       not by induction, but by intuition, and are necessarily
true — there      is   no difficulty about geometrical           reasoning        ;     but   if   each
new axiom       gained by
                  is        new induction (and that on Mr Mill's
                                        a
              " inductio per enumerationem simplicem,") we get a
showing an
difficulty which Mr Mill curiously enables us to state in his own
words    p. 301) —
         (I.                 "If
                         were necessary," in adding second step to
                                   it                                        a
an argument,   " to assume some other axiom, the argument would
no doubt be weakened."                   But, says    Mr Mill,     it   is   the same axiom
which    is    repeated at each step.            If this were   not so,      " the deductions
of pure mathematics could hardly fail to be among the most uncertain
of argumentative processes, since they are the longest." If now we
do call in new axioms whenever we construct an essentially new
figure, must not             Mr Mill admit, on his own showing, that every
advance in geometry involves an advance in uncertainty                                  ;   that the
geometry of the circle             is   less certain than that of the straight line,
solid geometry than plane, conic sections than Euclid, &c.?                                    Surely
this   isa     reductio ad absurdum of the whole theory.
  The principles of geometry involved in the question are                                      so im
portant that we may profitably separate them                                from        Mr Mill's
blunders in special case.
                  a
 I. The proofs of geometry are clearly not inductive. There                                          is
no mental comparison of various figures needed during the proof.
The inductions involved (if any), must have been previously
formed.
  II.       The proofs then must            be reduced      either to actual perception

  482                Proceedings of the Royal Society
  (intuition), or to deduction from axioms.             But since the proof is
  general,    the  former assumption        involves the reality of general
  intuition, i.e., of  a general  judgment from       a single perception.
     III.   The theory of intuition is sufficient, but is disputed          in two
  interests  :—
     fa)  In  the interest of syllogism, which claims to give indefinitely
  extensive conclusions from limited premises [but many, as Whewell,
  hold that these premises are intuitive axioms].
     (|3) In the interests of empiricism, which makes all arguments             be
  ultimately from particulars to particulars.
     Mr Mill    combines the two objections.
     Now we have seen that       if objection (a) falls    (i.e., if the premises
  of geometry are not reducible to a limited number of axioms from
 which everything follows analytically), the security of geometric
 reasoning     can be established     only   if  each premise       has apodictic
 certainty.      To overthrow Mill's whole theory, it is therefore enough
 to show the fallacy of the limited-number-of-axioms hypothesis.
 On this we observe : —
     1st,  The axioms     are more numerous     than   Mr Mill thinks, for     his
 proof of Euc. I5 is lost for want of more axioms.
     2d, The indefinite extension       of geometry depends on the power
 of indefinitely extended construction [but where there is construc
 tion there is intuition — nay, mental         intuition is mental construc
 tion]. Now here our opponents may suppose [A] that the general
conclusion really flows from the particular construction, which, in
 the language      of logic, supplies the middle term.            But since the
construction is particular, we should thus         be  involved in the fallacy
of the undistributed middle.           Again, [B] it may be said that the
construction is only the sensible representation of a general axiom.
But    as the  construction is new and indispensable,        the general axiom
must be so also.         Therefore,  if  geometry is proved from axioms,
these axioms must be unlimited in number.
    3d, Obviously     it is not by logic that we can satisfactorily deter
mine how far geometry           contains   synthetic elements peculiar to
itself.    We have, however, in analytical geometry a ready criterion
how far geometry can be developed without the addition of new
geometrical     considerations.
    Now    we find  that   we cannot begin    analytical geometry from the

                     of Edinburgh, Session 1868-69.                        483
mere axioms       and definitions.      We must by synthetic geometry,
by actual     seeing, learn the qualities of lines and angles before we
can begin to use analysis.           Then, given     so   many synthetic pro
positions, we can deduce others by algebra             ; but only by a use of
actual intuition, first, in translating the geometrical enunciation
into algebraic formulae ; and, second, in translating the algebraic
  result (if that result is not merely quantitative) into its geometric
meaning. The answer to a proposition in analytical geometry is
simply a rule to guide us in actually constructing, by a new use of
our eyes or imagination, the new lines which we must have to inter
pret the result.      Analysis does not enable us to dispense with syn
thetic constructions,    but simply serves to guide us in these construc
tions, and    so to dispense    more or less completely with the tact re
quired to find out the geometrical solution.             This is true in every
case, but most obviously in the investigation of new curves.               The
tracing of curves, from their equations, is        a process in which no man
can succeed by mere rule without the use of his eyes.                  Suppose
asymptotes, cusps, concavity, everything else found, the union of
these features in one curve       will remain    a synthetic process.
    Still more remarkable      is the use made in analysis of imaginary
quantities. To the logician an imaginary quantity is nonsense, but
 geometrically it has     a real  interpretation.     The geometrical power
ga ined bya new method like quaternions, is radically distinct from
that gained by the solution of a new differential equation . The latter
 is a triumph of algebra, the former is a triumph of synthetic geo
 metry   — the discovery of   a whole class    of new guides to construction.
    Professor Tait remarked that an excellent and interesting instance
of the incapacity of metaphysicians to understand               even the most
elementary mathematical demonstrations,             had been of late revived
under the auspices of Dr        J.  H. Stirling.     His name, with those of
Berkeley and Hegel, formed         a sufficient  warrant for calling attention
to the point.
    It  is where   Newton, seeking the fluxion of a product,             as ab,
writes it in   a form   equivalent to
         I  V(a +   I ddt) (b + i bdt) - (a - £ ddt) [b -       £ bdt)~\

 484                Proceedings of the Royal Society
 which gives, at once, the correct value
                                    ah + bd    .
Now       Berkeley,   Hegel,    Stirling,    and  others,   have   all in   tarn
censured this process as a mere trick (or in terms somewhat similar)
and say, in effect, that it is essentially erroneous.          The fact, how
ever, is that,     as  in far greater matters,      Newton here      shows    his
profound knowledge         of the question in hand      ; and adopts, without
any parade, a method which gives the result true to the second order
of small quantities. The metaphysicians cannot see this, and Dr
Stirling speaks with enthusiastic admiration of the clear sighted-
ness and profundity of Hegel in detecting this blunder, and for it
"harpooning" Newton !
   What Newton seeks is the rate of increase of a quantity at a
particular instant. Instead of measuring it by the rate of increase
after that instant (as the metaphysicians        would require) he measures
it by observing,     as  it were, for equal intervals of time        before and
after the instant in question.
   Any one who is not       a metaphysician can      see at once  the superior
accuracy      of Newton's method, by applying both methods to                 the
case   of   a rapidly varying velocity     ; such as that of a   falling  stone,
or  of  a  railway train near   a station.
   In   reference to what Professor       Tait had said, Mr Sang remarked,
that the line of argument attributed to Newton had               beeri used by
John Nepair before Newton's birth.             Nepair's definition of a loga
rithm runs thus (Descriptio, lib. i. cap. i. def. 6), (Constructio,
23, 25) that if two points move synchronously along two lines, the
one with a uniform velocity (arithmetic^), the other (geometrice)
with   a  velocity proportional to its distance       from a fixed point, the
distance passed over by the first point is the logarithm            of the   dis
tance of the second from the fixed point.           In  order to compare this
variable velocity at any instant with the constant velocity, he            takes
a  small interval of time preceding,           and another    succeeding      the
given instant, shows that the true velocity is included between
the two velocities thus obtained, and (28, 31) takes the arith
metical mean as better than either, and as true (inter terminos).
   It may be added, that Nepair devotes several sections of his

                    of Edinburgh, Session 1808-69.                  485
Constructio    to the discussion  of the doctrine of limits (dc uccura-
tione); that his logarithms were denounced by the metaphysicians
of his day    as  founded on the false system of approximation, but
that, fortunately for the progress    of exact science, their objections
 were unheeded.
   Sir W. Thomson said, that the metaphysicians, wishing to find
the speed of a vessel at 12 o'clock from an hour's run, would choose
the   hour from     12 to  1 ; whereas Napier, Newton, and the rest of
the world,   would take it from 11-30 to 12-30.

At     the request      of the Council, Mr Geikie gave the fol
    lowing Address on the Progress of the Geological Survey
    of Scotland*
    Before proceeding to the special subject of this address,           I have
thought that it might         be  of interest to the Society to lay before
them    a brief outline of the history of geological map-making in
Scotland, previous to the time when the task was undertaken                  by
the Geological Survey.         I do not,  indeed, presume to enter upon any
general retrospect      of the literature of Scottish geology,        but  will
content myself with selecting for remark a few of the more eminent
contributors, on whose labours the present general geological             maps
of the country     are based.    These maps are compiled from the results
obtained by many different geologists, working independently dur
ing the last fifty or sixty years.       Some of the men whose researches
have in this way been made use of, never themselves             produced any
map, but their descriptions       of the districts traversed by them served
afterwards     as a basis  for the maps of others.

they appear in the proper official form.     When, however, the Council of the
Royal Society requested me to give an account of the progress of the Survey,

and on referring the matter to the Director-General,   Sir Roderick Murchison,
he took the same view, and cordially gave his assent.

Scotland    in considerable      detail, was  Dr MacCulloch.     During   a
series of years he employed          himself in carrying on a geological
survey of the Western Islands, and published the results from time
to time in the Transactions of the Geological Society of London.
At length, in the summer of 1819, he collected             these  scattered
notices, rearranged and enlarged          them, and published them as his
well-known work          on   the Western Islands.     Accompanying the
text was a volume of plates, including detailed maps of the islands,
with sections explanatory of their geological structure.            This is
one of the most important            contributions ever made to Scottish
Geology.       It  laid down with some detail, and for the first time,
the geological structure of the long chain of islands from the Isle of
Man to the Butt of Lewis, along with a portion of the adjoining
mainland.       It  was accomplished,     too, at a time ere steamers had
been established, and when travelling in that region           entailed  no
little inconvenience,       and even personal risk.
    In  the early part of this century there existed at Edinburgh a
flourishing School of mineralogy and geology, under the leader
ship of Professor Jameson.             That able and enthusiastic teacher
infused    into his pupils much of the zeal with which he himself
pursued his favourite path of science.            Though he travelled far
and near over Scotland, and gave frequent notices of his labours
to the various       learned societies with    which he was connected, he
liublished    but a small part of the mass of information which he
bad accumulated.          It   was indeed to his class at the University
that he made known his observations and deductions, and he lived
to see the seed which he had there sown bear goodly fruit            in the
career of not a few eminent          naturalists.  One of his early pupils,
to whom the cause           of geology in this country stands largely in
debted, was     Dr Ami Boue, a native of Hamburg, who had come
to Edinburgh to study medicine,          and who took his degree in the
year 1817.        During his residence in Scotland Boue greatly dis
tinguished himself by his zeal in the prosecution of geology.            He
made long and frequent            journeys in almost every part of the
country, comparing the rocks of one district with those of another,
and gathering together from his own observations, as well as from
the recorded       researches of others, a large and valuable      mass of
information     regarding the geology of Scotland, which he published

                    of Edinburgh, Session 1868-69.                        489
in Paris in the year 1822       as an  " Essai Geologique      sur l'Ecosse."
This volume, besides its detailed descriptions of the rocks of the
country, contains a coloured       geological map, and     a series  of plates
of illustrative sections.      The map has       a peculiar interest in our
present    inquiry.    The outlines of the geological       structure of the
kingdom are there broadly sketched.            He traces the general area
occupied     by the gneiss,     and  what he calls the       " chloritic and
quartzose    rocks" of the Highlands, the position and extent of the
great coal-field of the Midland Valley, and the limits of the
"greywacke" of the Southern Uplands.                 He distinguishes the
granites, syenites, and porphyries, and roughly separates the rocks
of volcanic or trappean origin, according to their respective ages.
In  this latter subject his observations were far in advance of his
time.    He had studied some of the extinct volcanic districts of the
Continent, and gained a familiarity with volcanic phenomena which
gave him a great advantage over his Scottish contemporaries, who
were   still disputing whether or not the trap-rocks of their country
had really a volcanic origin. The map on which Dr Bouo inserted
his broad generalisations      was of course merely an outline or sketch,
necessarily full of inaccuracies      and omissions.      But in some im
portant respects it foreshadowed the maps that have succeeded it.*
   While the Edinburgh School of Geologists continued to furnish
descriptions, and sometimes also maps of different geological dis
tricts, Dr MacCulloch carried on his own independent researches,
and brought them at intervals before the            Geological Society of
London.       He had been required by the Board of Ordnance to make
some special investigations, partly with a view to discover some one
mountain, the geological structure of which might afford a prospect
of repeating with greater reliability the experiments made by Dr
Maskelyne upon Schihallien to estimate the weight of the earth.
In  the course of these and other journeys he had noted upon a
map the geological structure of each district examined; and find
ing at last that    a considerable   area of the country had been thus
delineated,    he represented    to the Board of Oidnance the propriety
   * Dr Bou6 still retains his youthful enthusiasm. He is resident at Vienna,
from which place I have recently had some interesting letters from him, full
of gossip about Edinburgh in the early part of this century, and of references
to his own wanderings in Scotland.

of securing     a    grant from Parliament to ensure                    a complete          geolo
gical map of the whole country. This application was eventually
acceded to by the Treasury, and Dr MacCulloch was empowered
to extend and complete              his survey at the public cost.                     The map
on which he laid down his geological lines was that                                   of Arrow-
smith, on the scale of   quarter of an inch to a mile. It was
                                    a
published in 1832, and the memoir descriptive of it appeared in
1836, the author having meanwhile died from a melancholy acci
dent in 1835.
                Geological Map of Scotland has long taken its
     MacCulloch's
place among the classics of geology. The outlines of the geolo
gical structure of the country are much more fully traced than
Boue attempted          on his little sketch-map              ;   and although, like the
latter, it    is,   and could      not fail to be,         full of errors and omissions,
it   must ever remain         a   remarkable      monument of the industry of                   a
single observer.         It   would have been well for MacCulloch's repu
tation had he lived to            see   through the press, the memoir explana
tory of the map.              We can hardly believe that, though he had
written, he would in his calmer moments                       have published, so much
intemperate  invective against possible critics of his map, or so
much special pleading which showed only too well how thoroughly
he was himself aware of the shortcomings                          of his work.        He would
doubtless have come to see that the only course open to him was
to show      simply what he had done, what he wished                          to do had his
materials and opportunities permitted,                     and to confess that his map,
with all its imperfections, could only                   be   regarded       as   a   first rough
draft of what he conceived              a   geological     map of Scotland should be.*
     The Transactions of the Geological Society of London, besides
the numerous         contributions of Dr MacCulloch,                     were likewise en
riched       with some valuable papers                   in   Scottish geology            by   Sir
Roderick (then Mr) Murchison and Professor Sedgwick.                                  Such were
     * Inspeaking of future corrections and improvements of his map, Dr
MacCulloch remarks, that they will not require the energies of " refined                a
geologist."
              " The rocks are few, and
                                              easy to learn to recognise them

their memoirs on the Red Sandstones of the northern counties, on
the Structure    of Arran, and Sir Roderick's first important essay —
that on the Secondary Rocks of the north of Scotland.
  Shortly after the publication of MacCulloch's map, the Highland
and Agricultural        Society of Scotland, impressed with the necessity
of more detailed and accurate geological                information than had yet
been given, began to offer liberal premiums for surveys and de
scriptions of various parts of the kingdom.                   The result of this
scheme was the publication of a series of prize essays and maps of
different counties       and districts,     full of valuable information, and
much more in detail than anything which had been before attempted
for the same parts of the country. The first essay in the order of
issue was that of       Mr Milne-Home on Berwickshire, which appeared
in 1836, and afterwards             there   came at intervals memoirs         on the
counties of Roxburgh, Peebles,              Sutherland, Banff, Renfrew, Dum
fries, Kirkcudbright,         &c.
     The Wernerian Society, also, about the same time, proposed                     a
series of geological essays, with premiums for the successful com
petitors.    One of the subjects            for competition was       a   geological
account and map of the three Lothians, and the prize was awarded
in 1836 to   Mr Hay Cunningham for his                  now well-known      memoir
on that subject published in the Society's Transactions.
     The published journals of the different scientific societies con
tinued to receive occasional            contributions in descriptive        geology
with    accompanying maps, such              as   Mr Milne-Home's         account   of
Roxburghshire, Mr Stevenson's Geology of Cockburn Law and of
the Eastern Lammermuirs,             Sir R. Murchison's Geology of Carrick,
and others   ;   while now and then             there appeared a separate work,
such as Mr Maclaren's Geology of Fife and the Lothians.
   Using MacCulloch's map as a basis, amending                  it,
                                                     and adding to
it the work of the different subsequent labourers in the field, Pro
fessor Nicol published    Geological Map of Scotland in 1858. Its
                              a
scale was ten miles to an inch.             Among the improvements            which
distinguished      it   from all preceding maps of the country was the
separation of the red sandstone of the north-west coast from the old
red sandstone of the rest of the island —           a   change rendered necessary
 by   the results of the conjoint researches of Sir Roderick Murchison
and    Mr Nicol.        In   the year   1859,     Sir Roderick, who since 1826

492               Proceedings of the Royal Society
had from time to time published important contributions on the
geology    of his native country, gave to the world             a  geological
sketch-map of the Scottish Highlands, based upon the results of
the labours of several summers spent by him in the north-western
counties.     In this map the crystalline rocks of the Highlands         were
for the first time brought into recognisable         geological  relationship
to the other rocks in the British         islands.   Taken along with the
different memoirs of which it       was an embodiment,      it may indeed be
said to have revolutionised the geology of the northern half of the
kingdom.       Subsequently, after an exploration of the Western and
Central Highlands       by Sir Roderick and myself in company,             we
published in 1861     a first sketch of    a new   geological map of Scot
land, in which the geological        structure   of the Highlands (as dis
tinguished from the mere distribution of different kinds of rock)
was more definitely traced      ;  the subdivisions of the old red sand
stone and carboniferous      formations were put down, and an attempt
was made to arrange        chronologically the different trappean rocks
of the kingdom.       The map was on a very small scale, and was
necessarily imperfect, and in places erroneous, being offered only
as a rough outline to show in a graphic form our views of the
general geological structure      of the country.
   The necessity of    a detailed   investigation of the structure of the
United Kingdom was recognised by Parliament                in 1835, and Sir
Henry de la Beche, who had at his own charges made some pro
gress in a survey of the south-west           of England, was empowered
to employ some assistants, under the Board of Ordnance.                   His
small staff was called the Ordnance             Geological Survey.     Subse
quently, in 1845, the great advantages of such          a survey  having by
that time been more fully perceived by Government, the number
of geologists     was increased,     and the staff transferred      from the
Board of Ordnance to the Board of Works.              Since that period the
geological   survey has grown      still further, and is now under the
Department of Science and Art.
   The object of this national Survey is to ascertain in detail the
geological structure of the country, to publish illustrative            maps,
sections,   and   descriptive memoirs,        and  to collect   and    exhibit
specimens of the rocks, minerals, and fossils met with in the course
of the inquiry.     The maps on which the field work is conducted

                      of Edinburgh,        Session 1868-69.                         493
are those prepared by the Ordnance Survey.                     Hence   as these maps
must be obtained before geological surveying can go on, the pro
gress of the Geological is necessarily in a great measure dependent
upon    that of the Ordnance           Survey.        Owing to the want of the
Ordnance maps, it was not possible               to extend the Geological Sur
vey to Scotland until the year            1854, when a beginning             was made
by Professor Ramsay.            Only two geologists could be spared for the
Scottish survey,       and this continued for several years to be the
whole of the staff employed in this part of the United Kingdom, the
backward     state of the Ordnance         Survey rendering any considerable
increase of the geological surveyors                impossible.     At    last, a more
liberal Parliamentary grant enabled the Director of the Ordnance
Survey to proceed much more rapidly with the publication of the
Ordnance maps.          It  therefore became desirable to expedite               at the
same time       the progress      of the Geological Survey,             and    the late
Government, after        a  full consideration of the subject, towards the
close   of the year 1866 resolved             to     reconstruct    the staff of the
Geological Survey, and largely to increase its numbers.                        Hitherto
the establishment had consisted              of   two branches      — one for Great
Britain, with head-quarters           in London, and one for Ireland, with
head-quarters     in Dublin.       It   was now determined         that there should
be   three branches,       each under a separate            resident    director, and
with an adequate staff —one for England and Wales, under Pro
fessor  A. C. Ramsay        ;  one for Ireland, under           Mr Jukes     ; and one
for Scotland, under my own charge                 ;   the three branches        still re
maining under the control of the Director-General, Sir R. I. Mur-
chison. With this great increase of strength, the Geological Sur
vey of Scotland is now making rapid progress                 ;  and as the Ordnance
maps of the whole of the southern              half of Scotland are published,
no hindrance is anticipated            in  the completion of the geological
investigation of that part of the country.
    On  a former occasion,*        I   had an opportunity of laying before
the Society a narrative of the progress                 of the Survey during the
first ten years of its existence.            I pointed      out that,    commencing
in East Lothian,         it gradually crept westward to the borders of
Stirlingshire, and southwards to those of Dumfries, Roxburgh, and

Berwick    ; that its further advance into the central    coal-field being
impossible    for want of the Ordnance      maps,  it was transferred to
Fife, and spread over the whole of that county and Kinross to
the Firth of Tay and the confines of Perthshire ; and that the
maps of the Clydesdale and Stirlingshire coal-field still failing,
the geological surveying was at last commenced         from a new centre
in the south of Ayrshire       during the autumn      of the year 1863.
Since that time the work has advanced steadily northwards and
eastwards.     The large county of Ayr is now surveyed, and the
maps of    it partly published, and partly engraving. Half of Ren
frewshire is finished, and the survey of the Clyde coal-field under
my colleague     Mr Hull, is advancing     round  Glasgow.      The work
of the Survey is now extended across the island from sea to sea,
and is at present     diverging  from  this completed belt, northwards
through the rich mineral-fields of Lanarkshire         and Stirlingshire,
and southwards over the counties of Wigtown,       Kirkcudbright, Dum
fries, and Peebles.
    The field-work is traced upon the six- inch maps of the Ordnance
Survey, and is then reduced and engraved upon the one-inch maps            ;
the general geological map of the whole       kingdom being published
on the scale of one inch to a mile.        But wherever     any workable
minerals occur, in addition to this general map, there are likewise
issued sheets on the six-inch scale, on which all necessary geologi
cal details are inserted.     In this manner all coal-fields      are pub
lished on the large scale, though also included in the general
geological   map on the smaller scale.     In  order, however, that the
large   amount    of detail necessarily accumulated as the Survey
advances may be made as useful to the public as possible, manuscript
copies of six-inch maps, which are not to be published, are furnished
under certain conditions.     Landed proprietors, engineers, and others
thus obtain    detailed  geological surveys merely at the cost of the
manual transcription of the original field-maps.
    The area which has now been mapped amounts in all to about
4100 square miles.        Of this area, 2269 square miles have been
published on the one inch scale. About 800 square miles are uow
in the course of being engraved, and the rest is in progress.         Nine
sheets of the one-inch map have been published, comprising the
whole or parts   of the counties of Edinburgh, Haddington, Linlith

                    of Edinburgh, Session 1868-69.                                  495

mile, thirty-six     sheets of the coal-field maps, on the scale of six
inches to a mile, have been published, including the coal-fields of
Mid-Lothian, East Lothian, Fife, and Ayrshire.                      A   considerable
number      more,   now     in the hands of the engraver,              embrace       the
northern half of the Ayrshire coal-field, with part of the great
coal- basin    of the Clyde.       In addition    to the maps, sheets of hori
zontal sections       are    published, to explain         the structure of the
country, and also vertical sections,           to illustrate the strata of the
different coal-fields.       Descriptive memoirs       are  likewise issued along
with the maps, giving the detailed evidence on which the geological
lines have been drawn, list of fossils, and all important information
obtained in the course of the survey.*
    I  shall now proceed to indicate some of the more important
scientific results which have been obtained by the Geological
Survey of Scotland during the four years which have elapsed since
I last addressed the Society upon this subject. Beginning with the
oldest rocks we have examined,            I may   remark that the complicated
Silurian geology of Carrick has been mapped, and a large suite of
fossils collected from that district.           From the south-west of Ayr
shire the lower Silurian rocks have been traced across Nithsdale and
Clydesdale      into the valley of the Tweed.            In    the prosecution        of
the work, within the last few months an important discovery                          has
been made by one         of the younger members of the Survey,               MrR. L.
Jack — viz., the occurrence of         a bed   of fossiliferous conglomerate,
which has been traced for about five miles among the Leadhills.
The fossils have not yet been examined, but there seems much
probability that this bed will prove to be a prolongation of the well-
known Wrae limestone, and thus define the age of the strata of the
Leadhill district.       A   large area of Old Red Sandstone has now been
examined, including the whole region between St Abb's Head and
   * In  the course of his remarks, the speaker pointed to a large map of the
southern    half of Scotland, on the scale of one inch to a mile, on which all
the area yet surveyed     by the Geological Survey was coloured.          There were
likewise   suspended   on  the  wall specimens   of the  maps    of the  coal-fields  of
Fife and Ayrshire, on the scalo of six inches to a mile ; specimens of the
horizontal and vertical sections, and of the duplicate manuscript maps pre
served in the oflice of the Survey.

ferous formation, well seen in East Lothian            ;  a middle group, exten
sively developed, to the south of the town of Ayr; and a lower
group, which reaches an enormous thickness, and passes down into
the Upper Silurian.         In this lower division,         as  it approaches its
north-eastern      limit, a remarkable local unconformity has been
ascertained by the recent researches of Mr B. N. Peach and myself.
In    the Pentland    Hills   the conglomerates      and sandstones rest upon
the vertical abraded edges of the Upper Silurian rocks                ; while only
 a few   miles distant, in the parish of Lesmahagow, there is no such
 break, but the one series passes regularly into the other.                    The
 Pentland Hills, therefore, contain two groups of strata, both belong
 ing to the lower Old Red Sandstone, but the one lying quite
 unconformably on the other.            It   seems not improbable that the
 great    development      of contemporaneous        igneous      rocks associated
with these strata in the Pentland area may have had something to
do with the origin of this local break in the succession of the
 deposits.*      Much attention has been bestowed by the Survey dur
 ing the last few years upon the lower members of the Carboniferous
 system.       The result is that a twofold division has been made of that
 hitherto vaguely defined        set of strata called by the late Mr Charles
 Maclaren the Calciferous Sandstones, and lying between the top of
 the Old Red Sandstone and the base of the Carboniferous limestone.
 New light has consequently been thrown upon the history of the
 earlier portions of the Carboniferous period in Scotland. The lower
 part of the Calciferous sandstones           consists of a thick but variable
 group    of red sandstones extensively developed in Ayrshire, Arran,
     * In Vol. V. of the Proceedings of this Society, p. 360, 1 have given a sec
 tion of the Pentland Hills, which remains true, though I have since learnt more
 of the relations of the rocks there shown to the structure of this country at
  large.   The series in the section marked c is stated to be " a middle division
  of the Old Red Sandstone," which is locally true, though more extended
  researches show that the great discordance between c and b, disappears in the
  course of a few miles,     c is in reality only an upper unconformable     portion
  of b.    Again, the relation of the strata marked e to those below is cor
  rectly shown in the section, but I am now convinced that the red sandstones
  of the Cairn Hills («) are only a prolongation of that great band of red sand
  stones which forms the base of the Carboniferous       series throughout the west
  of Scotland.

and Bute, and stretching, as        I   have now ascertained,      across the
island to the coast of Haddington and Berwick. Between these
 lower sandstones and the base of the Carboniferous limestone comes
a group of strata possessing much interest from the variations which
it exhibits in thickness and in the nature of its component strata.
In some districts it is altogether absent, and then the limestones
and the red sandstones come together.           But again, at no great dis
tance,  it reappears, and soon acquires a considerable thickness.          In
the western part of the country, it consists of grey and white sand
stones, pale grey, green, or mottled marls and shales, with bands of
cement    stone,  sometimes     with dark     shale   and  ironstone.    The
Ballagan beds of the Campsie Hills belong to this group. In the
eastern half of the country, throughout the Lothians, it is made up
of thick white sandstones, black shales, ironstones, some beds of
limestone,   and even of coal, its most important components            being
those bituminous      shales from     which oil is now       so  extensively
obtained.    In  the east of  Fife it contains     a great   many bands of
limestone, having the fossils and general aspect of true carbonifer
ous limestone beds, while in Berwickshire          it reassumes the aspect
 which it shows in Ayrshire and the west.
    During the progress of the Survey in Ayrshire, we have been
fortunate enough to bring to light a new page in the history of
volcanic action in this country — viz., the existence of a remarkable
series of melaphyres,   porphyrites, ashes and volcanic agglomerates,
interbedded in the Permian series of that county and of Dumfries
shire.   These rocks are of Permian age, and prove the existence of
a  group of active volcanic vents at that geological period in the
south-west   of Scotland.*     In  connection     with this subject,   I may
mention that    we have now accumulated          a large  body of evidence
regarding the dates and extent of ancient volcanic action in Scot
land.    The oldest volcanic rocks     we   have yet encountered      belong
to the Lower Old Red Sandstone        ;  they are well seen in the chain
of the Ochil Hills, and in the range of broken heights which stretches
from the Braid    Hills at Edinburgh       south-westward     across Clydes
dale and Nithsdale, almost to the coast of Ayrshire.            Then comes
a group    which seems to form      a   middle division in the Old       Red
Sandstone, and is seen      in the south of the county of        Ayr.    The

 Upper Old       Red    Sandstone       shows   traces   of contemporaneous
 volcanic   activity in Berwickshire.          During the early half of the
Carboniferous period the volcanic forces were amazingly busy all
over central Scotland.         To that time must be referred the hills of
the south    of Arran and of Bute, the north of Ayrshire, Renfrew
shire, the Campsie Fells, and most of the craggy hills which
roughen the basin of the Forth from Stirling to the May Island
and the Bass Rock. Then come the Permian volcanic rocks of the
south-western      counties.      And lastly, we have those strange          per
sistent   dolerite dykes, which cross all the other rocks and even
 large faults, and which range from         south-east to north-west, or from
east to west towards the great mass of dolerites and basalts stretch
ing from     the south       of Antrim along the western            seaboard    of
Scotland.      Those dykes      I  have formerly shown to the Society to be
probably    of miocene age.*
    Several   areas of metamorphic         rocks   have been mapped.         The
gradual passage of ordinary sedimentary rocks into crystalline com
pounds, and thence         into various porphyries, syenites, and granites
has been traced, particularly by          Mr James Geikie, both among the
Lower Siluran and Lower Old Red Sandstone                  series of Ayrshire.
The details which have been gathered in the course of these inves
tigations will, it      is   hoped,    throw considerable      light upon the
metamorphism       of rock-masses.
    While the structure of the rocks underneath is thus delineated
on the maps, attention at the same time is directed to the superfi
cial deposits, which are all mapped out in the same detail.                  The
various divisions of the         Drift series are traced, and      as the   work
advances    the movements          of the ice of the glacial period become
from month to month more clear.              We   are now at   work among the
uplands of Galloway, and          I anticipate thence a large accession of
information regarding the history of the Ice Age in Scotland.
    It is impossible that, while these various          investigations are in
progress, attention should not often be called to the relation between
the structure of the rocks underneath            and the form that they as
sume above ground.           The nature of our work necessitates frequent
reflection   upon this subject,        and implies the      accumulation    of  a

the country may be deduced.                   These data        are   published upon the
maps and sections.    They seem to me to prove irresistibly the truth
of the doctrine, which was first propounded within the walls of this
Society by Hutton, that the existing contour of the land is not to be
traced back to the operation of earthquakes,                    upheavals,   and depres
sions, but mainly to the eroding influences                      of rain, springs, rivers,
ice, and the sea.              In illustration, I       would   point to the map        sus
pended upon the wall, and show how the lines of large fracture
ascertained by the Geological Survey are not marked at the surface,
as a general        rule, by any corresponding valley or depression               ;   while,
on the other hand, the existing valleys and ravines, instead of coin
ciding with lines of fault,               as is too often       assumed, in reality run
across these lines in all directions, and without any reference                           to
them at all.         It       subject of congratulation among the
                           must     be a
Fellows of this Society to find that the views propounded here by
their illustrious predecessor Dr Hutton, after being almost lost
sight of for more than half                a century,     are now everywhere gaining
ground rapidly, and that there is                 a   growing recognition of the genius
of that great man. Hutton,                   asit appears to me, is the true father
of modern physical geology.                   Only now are we coming abreast of
him,     so   far was he in advance of his time.

On Traces in the Adult Heart of its transitions in form
     during Foetal Life.                 (Part    I.)    By P. D. Haudyside, M.l).
     (With      a   Plate.)
     In this paper the author described in the adult human heart
certain       vestiges    of   structures which, during foetal          life, exist in an
entire and perfect              state.    At birth, however, these, ceasing to           be
of   use,     generally disappear.
     In allusion, first,         to the Eustachian          valve,    he exhibited (and
illustrated by the annexed sketch, fig. 1), an apparently unique
specimen — obtained in his dissecting-rooms about six years ago —
namely,       a   very    large    and reticulated       Eustachian valve, prolonged
at its   middle third in the form of              a   semi-insulated cribriform fibrous

  500                Proceedings of the Royal Society
  lamina, taking a crescentic form continuously throughout, and after
  a valvular manner ending at the distance of three-sixteenths of                an
  inch from the crest or rim of entrance of the superior vena cava.
     After alluding,      secondly, to     the    significant  case   shown     and
 described to the Society on the 4th ult. by Professor Turner,                   Dr
  Handyside showed (fig. 2), and gave            a sketch  of —
     Thirdly, another specimen from his rooms, which presents                    on
 the posterior wall, and at the rim of entrance, of the superior cava
 a well defined      and deep lacuna, within which open five large The
 besian    foramina.     The caval half of the patulous            border   of this
 lacuna is protected      by an oblique semilunar valve, one quarter of
  an-inch in breadth and of        a  like depth.       This valve is composed
 of a duplicature of endocardium,               and   is evidently   designed     to
 secure the entrance of blood into the auricle.*
     The author next compared shortly these three abnormal                   cases,
 demonstrating how they formed at once a graduated scale or an
 atomical series mutually illustrative, each specimen introducing
 to the mind its own peculiar features               of morphological interest.
 He considered, however, these cases as chiefly interesting — when
 compared with the results of certain changes undergone by the
 human embryo between the third and the seventeenth weeks after
 conception — in relation with the structural affinities they present
 to permanently impressed         forms      in some cold and warm-blooded

 In fig. 3 a valve (J inch broad by inch deep), formed of endocardium with
an intervening lamina of striped muscle, lay within and parallel to the pos
terior segment of the rim of the superior cava. In fig. 4 is an unusually
large persistent Eustachian valve, continuous at its left insertion with a still
more remarkable     Thebesian valve. The former, which is very large, has an
insulated   fibrous offset from its left extremity, which runs half-way across
the sinus venosus towards the tubercle of Lower, and then dichotomously
divides and subdivides thrice before it is implanted into the arched lino
between the right cornu of the Eustachian valve and the right segment of
the rim of the superior cava. Fig. 5 represents, in a male foetus of 6} months,
presented to Dr Handyside's museum during last summer, the occurrence of a
complete semilunar valve situated at the termination of the upper vena cava,
its convex border being attached to the anterior and right wall of the vein, its
concave free border projecting into the auricle.       The right crus of this valve
is inserted into the auricular wall on a plane \ of an inch behind, and de
cussating, the right ascending cornu of the prolonged Eustachian valve.

of fishes    as a permanent     form of structure,  and yet presents itself,

 tures evolved progressively, and corresponding at given points to
certain permanent states      in  the vegetable and hrute creation, may   uni
formly    be traced in man at      fixed periods of his embryonic and foetal
existence ; and accordingly, — 2, that vestiges in the adult heart of
 early arrested and merely temporary structures — such as those nar
 rated by the author in this paper — record distinctly, in his opinion,
 the existence    of definite stages of embryonic and foetal development in
 man, through which stages he invariably passes towards his perfect
 adaptation    for higher functions.

     At  the request of the Council, Professor Allman gave an
  account of the Anthropoid Apes, chiefly with reference to
  specimens      recently acquired by the Edinburgh Museum of
  Science and Art.
     In taking cranial     capacity as a ground of comparison between the
  Anthropoids and Man, he gave some measurements of skulls con
  tained in the Museum.          The capacity of the cranial cavity in the
  Gorilla skeleton belonging to the Museum is          29 cubic inches.   Con

502                 Proceedings         of the Royal     Society
siderably   larger gorilla skulls, however, have been measured.                The
smallest healthy adult human skulls in the Museum                    are  those of
two Andaman Islanders.               Of these, one has      a cranial capacity    of
75"5   cubic   inches,    and the other a capacity           of 72 cubic   inches.
 Next to these comes         a  Peruvian skull    ; its cranial cavity   measures
76 cubic inches.      The smallest healthy adult human skull             measured
 by Morton was also that of a Peruvian, whose cranial capacity                mea
sured only 58 cubic inches.
    In taking   the other points of comparison          of the Anthropoid     Apes
with Man, it     was shown how most          of the alleged differences of     con
formation disappear           on   a   strict examination     ; and   the author
defended the views of          Huxley and those anatomists who insist on
the development of the posterior lobes of the cerebrum and their
associated structures       in the Quadrumana,        as  in Man.
    A  question, however,       still remains for determination.         After  eli
minating all the tenable points of divergence, what value                   are we
justified in assigning to the characters which still remain?
    It is quite certain,    as has been urged       with great force by Huxley,
after an exhaustive       comparison,      that in physical conformation Man
approaches more nearly to the             Gorilla and the Chimpanzee           than
 these do to the lower Quadrumana.               Must we, therefore, while       the
 Gorilla and these lower Quadrumana are included in a common zoolo
gical order, unite Man with them as another member of that order?
    He believed not.         It  had been already urged as an argument in
 favour of    the unity and generally accepted limits of the order
 Quadrumana,      that while the Gorilla graduates by intervening forms
 into the lower monkeys,            there are no connecting forms yet dis
covered between Man and the Gorilla.                 He considered      this argu
 ment, so far as    it goes,    a  valid one, but another might be derived
 from a comparison         of the Lemurs, or lowest Quadrumana with
 other Mammalian orders.             Such a comparison will show that man
 is more widely removed from the higher apes than the Insectivora
 are from the Lemurs, and as long as the Lemurs are retained among
 the Quadrumana        there    will  be less tenable grounds      for admitting
 man into the same zoological order with the apes than there would be
 for admitting into this order the insectivorous moles and hedgehogs.
     The relations here insisted on are rendered apparent by the
 following diagram, in which the Lemurs and the Gorilla are taken

same series through the Gorilla is indicated by diverging arrows.
     Insectivora    »  * * « Lemurs, Monkeys, Gorilla -e-c»— Man.
    From these facts, the author found himself compelled to retain
the zoological group Bimana as a legitimately constituted order
distinct from that of the Quadrumana.
    But after all, it is not in any recognisable physical conformation,
but in psychological phenomena, that the grand differences are to be
sought for between man and even the most intelligent of the brutes                ;
and the author       argued,     that though    there be some        intellectual
endowments which are undoubtedly common to man and the higher
brutes, there are others which are exclusively man's, which                 differ
from those of the brutes not only in degree but in kind, and of
which, after the most careful analysis, not even a rudiment can be
detected in the intellectual phenomena of any animal below man.
    It was maintained that a resemblance between certain acts per
formed by brutes, and others met with in man, may occasion an
erroneous    interpretation     of the former, while      a  rigid comparison
would show that the resemblance was only superficial                  and  decep
tive.   Such, for instance, as the apparent faculty of conceiving the
relation between cause and effect, the acts which so frequently seem
to indicate   a conception of causation in the lower animals being the
result either of instinctive impulse or of suggestive association.
    Among the faculties which the author thus regarded as eminently
distinguishing man, there was one which did not appear to have
hitherto obtained the attention it deserves.          He alluded    to what may
be termed imitative        delineation   and imitative     constructiveness,     or
the faculty of imitatively expressing the forms of objects by draw
ing and construction.         While    a faculty of imitating gestures and
sounds    is possessed     by many brutes, and while instinctive con
structiveness     is almost universally found throughout the animal
 kingdom,    the faculty of imitative delineation          and imitative con
structiveness is eminently a human            one ; we find     it in the lowest
and most undeveloped           savage, and almost the very earliest evi
dence we      possess    of human      intelligence — the intelligence of         a
    vol. vi.                                                           3 v

    1.   Motion of a Palladium Plate during the formation of
        Graham's Hydrogenium.               By James Dewar, Esq.
                           (Received 1st March 1869.)
    Graham, in continuing his exhaustive             researches on diffusion,
 has recently examined        the relation  of gases to various colloid   septa.
 The remarkable discovery of Deville and Troost of the permeability
 of platinum and iron by hydrogen at a red heat, he has expanded
 into a general       examination of the relative rates of         passage,    at
 high temperature, of the various gases through different metallic
septa.       Further,   he   has   proved   that different metals      have     a
 specific occluding power over certain gaseous elements, retaining
 them in combination at low temperatures,           although the absorption
 took    place at a red heat.       Of the many astonishing discoveries
 made during the course of these investigations, probably the most
remarkable is the occlusion of hydrogen by palladium.              This  metal,
whether in the form of sponge or hammered foil, when heated and

                        of Edinburgh, Session         18(38-69.                 505
cooled     in   an   atmosphere of hydrogen,         absorbed between      six and
seven     hundred       times    its volume — increasing to the          enormous
occlusion     of 982 volumes, when the metal used had been deposited
by voltaic action.         This occlusion of hydrogen, Graham has shown,
can be easily effected at low temperatures             by making palladium the
negative electrode         during the electrolysis of water.          He has also
shown that the metal, charged with hydrogen,                 has increased greatly
in volume, and that its physical properties                are  entirely modified.
So marked is the change in the physical, electrical, and magnetic
properties of the combination, that the only class of compounds                   we
can compare it with are the metallic alloys.                In  the occluded state
the chemical intensity            of hydrogen     is increased, many reactions
being effected by its agency beyond the power of the element in
the free state.          Graham,    as a general     result of his experiments,
considers      the occluded       gas to exist in the form of a solid, with
all the physical properties of a metal.                During the course of an
experimental exhibition of Graham's discovery,                    I  noted several
phenomena associated with the occlusion of hydrogen by palladium,
when     it is made the negative electrode during the electrolysis of
water; and        as   they illustrate, in a new form, the results          already
arrived at by the Master of the Mint, with his permission                 I am in
 duced to bring them before the Society.
    If  a palladium plate, used        as the   negative    electrode   during the
 decomposition        of water, be arranged at right angles, instead of
 parallel to    a  similar platinum plate, the hydrogen in            a short time
 is evolved at the edge of the palladium plate nearest to the platinum
 electrode — no trace of hydrogen coming from any other part of the
 plate.     Gradually,      as  the   saturation    takes   place,  the  hydrogen
 seems to travel slowly along the plate, and only after saturation is
it freely evolved from the whole surface of the electrode.                     If we
 now reverse the current, so as to evolve              oxygen    at the palladium
 plate, immediately the nearest edge begins to evolve gas, the rest
of the plate remaining tranquil, the evolution of oxygen moves
 along the plate in          a gradual manner.         This gradual transference
 depends on the time necessary to effect the occlusion,                and on the
 relative intensity of the lines of force.
    When a palladium plate, charged with hydrogen, is brought in
 contact     with    a   platinum electrode      freely   evolving oxygen,        the

506                Proceedings     oj  the   Royal Society
evolution of gas is immediately arrested over the entire surface of
the electrode.     The same plate, free from hydrogen, when brought
in contact with    a  platinum electrode evolving hydrogen, shifted         the
 evolution of gas only on the same side on which it was firmly
pressed.    In order to examine the action of mixed electrodes, the
palladium plate     was welded    with    a  similar platinum plate into      a
V shaped electrode, when the apex of the combination could                   be
placed in or out of the liquid.        If the   platino-palladium    electrode
is made the negative       pole, hydrogen      makes its appearance imme
diately on the platinum plate       ; no gas is evolved by the palladium
for some time.      If, after saturation,    by reversing the poles, oxygen
is thrown on the mixed electrode,              no gas is evolved     from the
platinum, and when         the gas began        to be evolved,    it appeared
simultaneously on both plates.          The same result is observed what
ever may be the position of the compound plate relatively to the
other pole in the liquid, relative distance from the other pole having
no effect.    This proves that the whole of the oxygen that ought            to
be evolved on the platinum is transferred          by a polar chain, through
the liquid, on to the palladium plate, so long as this plate contains
occluded    hydrogen.      The presence of the strong electric current
is shown by connecting the hydrogenised palladium with a platinum
plate in an acid liquid, the circuit containing a galvanometer.              If
the apex of the     V electrode is placed in the acid liquid additional
phenomena are witnessed, depending            upon which side of the com
pound electrode     is next to the other electrode.          If the platinum
side of the  V electrode is firmly clipped in a stand, a glass rod keep
ing the apex in the same position in the liquid, and if the palladium
plate is next to the positive electrode, we observe the following
change during the course of the hydrogenation. The angle of the
V continually diminishes by the motion of the palladium towards
the perpendicular,      the hydrogen       evolved   coming only from      the
outer surface to the compound           plate.    After some time the plate
returns to its original position, and would curve beyond it if the
action was continued.        If oxygen    is now evolved on the compound
plates, the first effect of the oxygen        is to curve  it beyond its first
position, or to increase the angle of the        V.   If the  palladium plate
was   furthest  from    the positive electrode,      the first  effect of the
hydrogenation     is to increase   the angle of the compound         plate by

                  of Edinburgh,     Session 1868-69.                 507
the  palladium     moving    outwards  ; after some    time   it returns.
Similar observations, as with the palladium clipped in stand, but
made with the junction out of the liquid, showed a decided move
ment depending on the relative position of the plates.            Seeing
the palladium moved, although firmly clipped in a socket out of
the liquid,  it was evident the motion could     be examined     without
the use of compound     plates.
   After devising several arrangements in order to examine with
ease the motion of the plate, the following plan was found to be
the best in practice : —
   The electrodes of palladium and platinum were firmly clamped
in the little vice represented by D, and arranged as shown in the
figure, where   A  represents the palladium and    B the platinum.     To
the lower edge of the palladium plate a narrow        strip of the same
metal is fused by the oxyhydrogen blow-pipe       ; the strip is of such
a length  as to  project above the level of the acid liquid when the
plate is immersed.      To the end of the strip of palladium a thread
of glass is fused so as to have a radius in all of 40 or 50 centi
 metres ; the arc of a divided circle of the same radius, on a piece
of cardboard, is supported by    a stand at the extremity of the index.

 508                  Proceedings     of the Royal    Society
 By this apparatus the small deflection of the palladium plate is
 greatly magnified, and the direction of motion well defined.               Sup
 pose the palladium         plate,  A in the figure, is connected with         the
 negative pole of the hattery, the glass index,           after a short time,
 begins to move from left to right on the plane of the diagram, to
 the extent of 8 or 10 centimetres on the scale.           As the saturation
goes on, the index begins to move backwards from its first position,
going towards the left even to a greater extent than its first de
 flection towards the right.        Continuing the action, it again returns
to  near its original position.        The power of being able to return to
the position     it had at starting     seems  to depend on the position         of
the plate, as regards the distribution of tensile strain, produced by
 rolling ;  at least, after repeated use the plate lost the power of re
turning, after having        passed   towards the left.    If  the plate, after
saturation, is connected with the positive pole of the battery, the
first effect on the index is to move quickly towards the left, then
to return to where       it was — this double motion taking place         before
any gas makes its appearance on the palladium.                If the platinum
electrode B is placed on the opposite side of A, and the saturation
of the plate repealed, the index goes through the same series of
positions, but the direction of motion is reversed.           The direction of
motion depends, therefore, on the relative positions of the electrodes,
but is constant for the same position.             This is easily shown        by
allowing the index to commence its motion, say from left to right;
then, by moving         the positive electrode to the other side of the
palladium plate, the motion immediately             commences in the oppo
site direction, although the saturation was far from being complete.
The motion of the index, when oxygen is thrown on the hydro
gen ised plate, depends also on the position of the electrodes.              The
index has also       a motion    at right angles   to the plane   of the   scale,
the resultant motion being compounded of the separate               flexures of
the plate.     Many other devices could be used to show the             motion,
such as   a plate bent into the form of a cylinder with a narrow        channel
left  between    the two edges, which should shut and open alternately,
according     as    the   positive   electrode   is without    or within      the
cylinder.
    Graham     has shown      that the formation      of the alloy of hydro
genium and palladium           is attended   with  an enormous increase         in

                   of Edinburgh,       Session 1868-69.                     509
the volume of the metal.          He found that     a wire of palladium 100
millimetres in length became        101"5  millimetres when saturated with
hydrogen.     Now,   if a  uniform hydrogen atmosphere             surrounds   a
symmetrical piece of palladium, there is no reason why it should
penetrate with a greater rapidity one surface rather than any
other.    But if the absorption is not uniform on all the surfaces,
from want of uniformity in the hydrogen atmosphere,                 the surface
absorbing must produce       a  flexure of the plate from the expansion
of the metal.    If a thin   plate of this rigid metal can be so arranged
as to induce absorption     on one side rather than the other, then, as
a necessary consequence, the plate         will become convex on the side
where the greatest     relative absorption is taking place        ;  and as the
saturation approaches      uniformity, the convexity should disappear,
the plate   regaining its original form       if the elasticity of the    metal
is not changed      during the action.        A plate of palladium,        when
it functions   as the negative     pole during the electrolysis of water,
is subjected    during    the   course    of the    action to   the    supposed
non-uniformity of the gaseous atmosphere            — if  the surface    of the
plate is parallel to a similar platinum          electrode.   The amount of
chemical action effected by the unit surface of the electrode, and
its distribution, depends upon the position of the plate relatively
to the lines of force emanating from the poles.             Now, of the two
surfaces   of the palladium plate, the surface next to the positive
pole has the greatest concentration of the lines of force, and there
fore the greatest evolution      of hydrogen takes place on this surface,
so that   the quantity of alloy formed in the first instance is in
excess of the amount produced on the other side.              The plate, from
the great expansion      on the outer side, becomes convex,           until the
progression   of the action from the other side is able to compensate
this flexure by a corresponding expansion, thereby bringing the
plate to its original form. But        I  have already explained how this
backward    motion   goes beyond       the original position, producing a
flexure in the opposite direction, only in some cases returning to
its normal shape.       This, in all probability, arises from the com
bined effect of expansion and compression.               Graham has shown
that this tenacity of the alloy is considerably diminished as com
pared with that of the palladium, so that in the first flexure            of the
plate the expansion     has to compress the rigid palladium, whereas,

510                     Proceedings of the Royal Society
when      it begins to return, the compression                       is effected on the         less
rigid hydrogenium already formed on the other side, the elasticity
of form being also probably relatively small.                             This is the general
explanation of the motion of the plate, but it must be remembered
that the smaller flexures produced by different forms and positions
of the electrodes are the result of non-homogeneity or excessive
strain. This is one position, at least, of the palladium relatively
to     the other electrode, where               the plate should have                no lateral
motion — that        is,   when    it   is   at right angles          to the surface of the
positive plate; but all the attempts made with the small palladium
plate at my disposal failed to prevent lateral motion, probably from
want of uniformity of surface producing different rates of penetra
tion.
     Effect on the Current during the Formation                      of the   Hydrogenium.
     In order to determine the effect on the current during the                                 oc
clusion of the hydrogen and its reoxidation, two Bunsen's cells
were connected, through              a    tangent galvanometer,               with   a     plate of
palladium and platinum                  as poles     in   a   cell containing acidulated
water.      The intensity of the current was determined                         — 1st, during
the decomposition            of the water, when the palladium pole evolved
oxygen; then during the absorption of hydrogen, when the current
was reversed; and lastly, when the oxidation of the occluded hydrogen
was     taking place.

   The diminution in the intensity of the current during the forma
tion of the hydrogenium arises from the strong current, generated
in the decomposing            cell by the secondary polarity of the electrodes,
acting in the opposite              direction, whereas the oxidation of the
hydrogenium reduces            a   current acting in the             same     direction as the
battery.         The intensity of the current during the oxidation of the
hydrogenium         is     nearly doubled,      so    that    if   we consider       the resist
ance in the circuit to remain constant, the additional electro-motive
force added by the oxidation                 of the hydrogen          is   equivalent to two
cells of Bunsen.            The great increase in the intensity of the cur

rent during the oxidation of the hydrogenium may be shown in the
following manner : — Use two palladium plates in the decomposing
cell, with index to show the motion of the plate attached to each,
as in the figure formerly given, and include in the circuit a com
mutator and      a fine   spiral of platinum wire.         During the occlu
sion of hydrogen        the platinum     spiral may     be   made of such      a
length   as to  remain dark, the motion of the index proving the
absorption    of hydrogen.      If the direction of the current is now
reversed the spiral of platinum becomes red hot, the index moving
rapidly back to its original position, while the index of the other
plate begins to move.        The oxidation of the occluded hydrogen is
the limit to the brightness of the platinum spiral, so that          a reversal
of the current produces       a renewed     brightness.      By this arrange
ment we keep both indices moving along the scale, and the plati
num spiral alternately bright and dark. If the electro-motive force
is really equal to a Bunsen's cell, this arrangement must produce a
current far more intense than any similar gas-battery, where oxygen
and hydrogen are the reacting elements          ; but as the resistance in the
circuit might vary, several indirect experiments were made.              When
a  palladium plate, saturated with hydrogen, was associated with a
platinum plate in an acid solution of permanganic acid, and con
nected through a voltameter,         the   arrangement      could   decompose
water.   A similar result    was obtained when a platinum plate coated
with platinum-black saturated with oxygen was employed; but the
action in this case was very slow, and sometimes did not succeed.
A platinum plate covered with peroxide of lead                was   opposed to
the hydrogenium; the combination decomposed water with facility.
Grove found two pairs of his gas- battery could effect a slow decom
position of water, and a single pair did as well if the oxygen was
replaced by peroxide of lead.          (The intensity of palladium and
peroxide    of lead combination must           render   it particularly    well
adapted to form secondary piles of great intensity, by substituting
it instead of    a lead plate    in the arrangement        devised by M.     Gr.
Plante).     The transformation of gaseous hydrogen               into the   oc
cluded state would       seem to have    little effect in reducing its total
chemical energy,       so  that the occluded       hydrogen must retain        a
relatively   large   proportion of      the   total   gaseous    energy   in   a
potential form.       If  we compare     the occlusion      of gases to work

512                 Proceedings of the Royal Society
done on the gas, the elaborate         researches of Joule and Thomson
on the    " Thermal Effects of Fluids in Motion," would lead us to
believe that hydrogen of all gases would in this new condition retain
the greatest     amount    of its original store of energy.       But before
a   just comparison      can be made with the results of Joule and
Thomson, careful determinations must be made of the electro-motive
force, latent heat,    &c, of hydrogenium.        Professor Tait has    deter
mined by a new process the electro-motive force of platinum and
palladium covered with oxygen and hydrogen, and the result will
be communicated        to the Society in a short time.
2. Some Observations           on Free, An-atomic, or Transmissible
                      Power.     By R.    S.  Wyld, Esq.
    This is an abstract of the first of two papers on the subject,        pre
pared for the Society.
    Physical bodies may be held, in accordance with chemical science,
to consist of aggregations, either of material atoms, or of atomic
circles, or centres of force.
    There   are certain   exhibitions of physical power observed in       con
nection with those atomic bodies, the laws and actions          of which    are
in the highest degree worthy of study.          Mr Wyld calls power exhi
bited in this way, free an-atomic or tranmissible power.
    Mr Wyld called attention       to seven   exhibitions of this free power,
viz. —
    1st, The attraction of gravity    ;  2d, cohesive power  ; 3d, the power
of chemical affinity;       4th, animal power; 5th, the momentum             of
moving bodies      ; 6th, the electric force set free on the mechanical
disintegration of quartz and many other crystals ; 7th, the force
obtained alike through the decomposition, the dissolution, and the
combustion      of simple and compound bodies.
    The consideration of the nature and source of animal                power
Mr Wyld reserved to his second paper.
    In the present paper Mr Wyld directed attention to the         momentum
or force of moving bodies, and to the law of its transmission             from
one body to another, as illustrated in the case of one rolling             ball
 hitting another and imparting its force to it — and in the            case of

                    of Edinburgh,        Session 1868-69.                   513
those atmospheric       and ethereal     vibrations which affect us with the
sensations of sound and light.
    When   I roll  a  ball along the ground      I communicate     force to it  ;
this force carries it forward    till it  encounters a body at rest, to which
it communicates      this force, and the force which came from me, may
thus be transmitted or handed            over, from   ball to ball, through    a
lengthened    series, subject only to such decrease as may arise from
friction or other accidental obstructions.
    Mr Wyld called attention to the circumstance — first, that the balls
successively    received something which we call force          ; second, that
it is force which causes their movement, and not their movement
which gives them their momentum or force.                   Their movement,
however, seeing      it is the result of the force, may     be taken as a just
measure of the force applied.
    Another instance of the transmission          of force we  have when     we
direct, what has for convenience          been called the electric or galvanic
fluid, through wire conductors.           The transmission    of this manifes
tation of force may be explained on nearly the same principle as
 the transfer of the momentum of moving bodies, and of the me
chanical vibratory force transmitted from molecule to molecule of
the ethereal medium, which vibratory force we call light, and which
reaches us after a passage of more than ninety-one millions            of miles.
    Mr Wyld      considered    these to be instances       of the action, and
transmission of what may be called free, an-atomic, or transmissible
 power, which is not to be viewed as a substance or fluid, but either
 as an imponderable       immaterial agent, or simply       as the action  of an
 unseen cause.
    Neither the nature of its origin, nor the nature of its transmission,
 nor the variety of its actions and operations,         permit us to consider
 it as a substance.      When   we  disintegrate crystals, when we separate
 the parts   of fluids by evaporation,         when   we dissolve    metals,  or
 decompose     compound       bodies,   organic or inorganic, we seem to
 obtain that force which held their parts together, in the form of
 free transmissible power.       To this power     we can by  certain arrange
 ments give a definite direction, and can transmit it through wire
 conductors.     We can thus make it available for the production of
 many of the most important natural phenomena, for instance —
    1. The production of intense artificial light.

5  14               Proceedings of the Royal Society
    2. The production       of heat.
    3. The decomposition of compound bodies.
    4. The volatilising of metals and other bodies by the                sheer
violence of its movements.
    5. The production       of magnetic attraction.
    6. When transmitted through the animal frame it overpowers our
natural voluntary movements, and produces spasmodic muscular
contractions.
    To these different phenomena,         for purposes of convenience, we
give different names, but they are         all the action of the same agent,
viz., of power operating under different circumstances.
    We very much simplify and clear up our conceptions of nature
when we attend to these two facts — first, that every change observed
in the physical world, — whether         effected by natural or by artificial
means, and whether           connected   with animal or vegetable        living
organisms, or with inorganic matter, may be described as a move
ment either of physical bodies in mass, or as a movement              of their
constituent parts or atoms ; and second, that all these movements
are effected by free an-atomic power, and by the transmission of
it from one body to another.
    Mr Wyld further summed up his views thus —
    1. In the physical world we have a manifestation of                   power
working uniformly according to physical law, i.e., it is measured in
amount, and       it is fixed in its modes of action.
    2.  Physical     power we ascertain      by an examination of physical
 phenomena is subject neither to augmentation nor to diminution.
 Were it not     so the world    would  be  entirely different from what      we
 observe   it to  be.
    3.  Power in all physical operations is transferred from one object
 to another, but is never lost.
    4.  We may regard physical power as an immaterial agent, or we
 may be satisfied to consider it simply as a mode of action brought
 about by a cause unknown.           But whether we view it as an agent or
 as an action, and in whatever way we may account           for its existence,
 it is evident that     as it conducts every change in the physical world,
 it must act according to invariable physical law.
    5.  Physical power manifests itself in two distinct forms— namely,
 in the form of atomic bodies, which are discoverable by the senses,

                               of Edinburgh, Session 1868-69.                      515
and which consist of aggregations                      of atomic circles or centres of
force; and in the form of free an-atomic or transmissible                         power
which is not discoverable               directly by the senses, but is known only
by its effects on atomic                bodies.    The question whether the chemi
cal atom is a material atom, or is purely dynamical, does not affect
the truth of the writer's statements.
     6.    The mind seems conscious of possessing power, and of being
able to exerciseit for the production of physical movements.       It
has evidence of this when it exerts itself in the production of those
muscular efforts which are subject to the control of the will.                     The
mind is thus the agent in the production of voluntary movement
through the free transmissible power which it sends to the muscle,
as will be explained in the subsequent paper on this subject.
      Free power effects the various important physical phenomena
     7.
alluded to, e.g., the production of motion— and the continuance of
it   as momentum,                 on which depends, not only the movements            of
the earth and planetary system, but the transmission                       of light and
sound as above explained.
     Mr Wyld explained that                by the words physical law he meant         to
express simply the invariable modes of action observed in physical
phenomena.                The existence of action, however, always infers the
existence of an agent or actor.This is not the most suitable place
to inquire regarding the origin or cause of power, but it will be
admitted that             we      discover nothing in atomic bodies to account for
its existence.                 These seem rather to be the subjects of power than
the cause of                   for all their movements and changes seem regulated
                      by it,
and caused                 it.    They are therefore       quite insufficient to account
for       it,   or to explain it.
     This inability to discover             a   visible cause for the laws of nature
compels us to believe in an invisible cause, adequate to account for
them.    When, therefore, we discover power acting in the produc
tion of order, beauty, and enjoyment — and when we recognise our
selves as moral and intelligent beings brought into close connection
with this physical system, we are drawn all but irresistibly to the
conclusion that physical power    the sustained action of
                                                  is         mighty           a
 Being, possessed of the self-consciousness                      and   intelligence with
 which we find ourselves to be endowed.

4. On a       New Synthesis of Ammonia.                   By A. R. Catton, Esq.,
     late Fellow, and P. T. Main, Esq., Fellow of St John's
     College, Cambridge.
     It   having been shown by one of us that formic acid is produced
by the union        of carbonic acid and nascent hydrogen, it occurred                  to
the authors        to try whether other             gases might    not be made          to
unite directly with nascent hydrogen.                  Such experiments gave the
prospect     of being of especial interest in the           case   of nitrogen,       as it
was possible the synthesis of ammonia                   might thus     be effected by
the direct union of nitrogen and hydrogen.
     With this view pure nitrogen and aqueous vapour were                        passed
over sodium.  The nitrogen was prepared in the usual manner, by
passing atmospheric air over heated copper, and was freed from
ammonia        by passing       it through sulphuric acid.          Not a trace of
ammonia,       however,        was obtained        in this way.    When, however,
nitrogen and aqueous vapour were passed over heated magnesium
ribbon, a very appreciable quantity of ammonia was produced, and
the quantity appeared, within certain limits, to be greater the
higher the temperature to which the magnesium was heated. The
ammonia was recognised              in the usual       way — by the smell, by its
browning considerable quantities of turmeric paper, and by the for
mation of the double chloride of platinum and ammonium. The
theory of this reaction evidently            is,   that the magnesium decomposes
the aqueous vapour, and that the hydrogen                  thus produced, when           in
the nascent state, combines with some of the nitrogen, and forms
ammonia.           Only   a   small part of the nitrogen, however,          is   in this
way converted into ammonia.                One cause of this evidently           is   that
the magnesia produced during the reaction forms                    a   coating on the
surface of the magnesium               ribbon, and so protects      it   from further
action.      For this reason      it   has occurred     to the authors that larger
quantities of ammonia may be obtained by using powdered mag
nesium, either by itself or mixed with fine sand, as in Larkiu's

                    of Edinburgh,     Session 1868-69.               517
magnesium     lamp.      The authors, however, have no hope of modify
ing the process in such a manner as to convert any considerable pro
portion of the nitrogen of the atmosphere into ammonia, a problem
of the highest practical importance.        Nevertheless,  the formation
of ammonia in this way is of considerable theoretical interest, espe
cially when viewed in connection with the source of the ammonia
in nature,   a question     to which no satisfactory solution     has yet
been given.
    We purpose, when circumstances         permit, to continue our expe
riments on the subjects indicated in this paper.

    The following Communications were read : —
 1.  On the Present State of the Sun's Distance Question                —
    continued.     By W. Petrie, Esq.         Communicated by Pro
    fessor C. Piazzi Smyth.
    This paper is a compilation and discussion of all the best deter
minations of the sun's mean distance and parallax within the last
few years, and up to the present        time.  The comparative    weights
to be given to the different observations     or results are entered  into

518                Proceedings of the Royal Society
at length, on principles which       are stated, and a final mean of     the
whole    is arrived at, giving   for the solar parallax 8""877.      This  is
then compared with the result       of the so-called Great Pyramid      Sun
Distance, which, combined with the best modern determination               of
the size and shape of the earth, gives a parallax      of 8-"876.
   The direct results of modern science for the solar parallax         vary
anywhere     between 8""80 and 8-"96;      and to assist in apprehending
the present state of a very contested question as to one of the        most
important of all physical facts, Mr Petrie added to his          paper two
very instructive diagrams,       in one of which the chief       data were
 arranged chronologically, and in the other quantitatively.
      2.  On Chemical Structure.           By Dr A. Crum Brown.
    In this   paper   the author drew attention to the nature of         the
process of Chemical      Exchange    (including substitution,   double   de
composition,     and some oases of direct addition and subtraction),       as
a process by      which the number of relations in which any given
atom stands is unaffected.       He pointed out the connection between
this process and the notion of chemical structure, and       discussed the
nature of those chemical     processes in which the number of relations
of an atom is increased or diminished.            He concluded     by some
remarks on the ambiguous        structure of such bodies as aldehyde, the
sulphites, and hydrocyanic acid, which from some points of             view
may be represented as —

3.   Observations on the Temperature of Newly-born Child
    ren. By T. J. Maclagan, M.D., Dundee.                   Communicated
    by  J.  Matthews Duncan, M.D.
   That the temperature of the child is not the same            as that of the
adult has long been       a  generally acknowledged        fact, but wherein
and to what extent      it differs is a point on which definite informa
tion is wanting.     With the object of determining this point, the
author took advantage of the opportunities afforded by             a residence
in the Edinburgh Maternity Hospital, to note the temperature                of  a
number of children at the time of birth, and at frequently repeated
intervals during the first few days of extra-uterine life.                  The
result of these observations       was to show that       the child at birth
partook of the temperature of the mother — that           as soon as    it com
menced its separate existence the heat imparted            by the parent was
no longer maintained, but was rapidly lost,        till, in  a few hours    (the
exact period varying in different cases), the thermometer indicated
a temperature one, two, three, or even six degrees below the normal
standard of the adult.      A  rise then took place, and generally within
twenty-four hours      after   birth the range     might be regarded           as
normal.     This normal range of the child, however, was about one
degree lower than the adult range of health.           The rapid fall which
was shown to take place immediately after birth, was believed to be
due to the refrigerating      influence of the external air on the blood
in the lungs, the nervous influence which is requisite              to give to
the respiratory act its heat-producing effect, not being in          full force
at the time of birth.      The lower range which existed           during the
first  few days, after the primary temporary           depression    had been
recovered    from, was believed     to be caused, in part at least, by the
defective purification of the blood, consequent on the patent condi
tion  of the foramen ovale and ductus arteriosus.
   In  delicate and premature children all the peculiarities indicated
were observed in an exaggerated         degree.
4.  On the Growth, Development, and Situation of the Human
              Foetal Heart. By Professor Macdonald.
   The earliest condition of the embryonic              vascular   system,     as
described by Wagner and other          embryologists,    consists   of  a veno-
   VOL. VI.                                                         3 T

 520                Proceedings       of the Royal Society
 vascular chain    of sinuses along the ventral surface of the        serous or
 animal lamina of the embryonic germ disc, which, being              suddenly
 arrested   by a large projection of the germ vesicle at the anterior
part beyond the vascular and mucous lamina, causes a stagnation               in
the form     of  a conical    sac, whose     apex points   forward  below   the
head of the embryo at that time consisting of the mesocrane                 and
procrane, with the visceral segments of the face-kist, and exhibiting
 three facial clefts.
    1.  The ophthalmic, under the procrane, forming the roof of             the
orbit, and completes its floor resting on the antrum highmorianum.
    2. The olfactory cleft, the nasal passage beneath the antrum, the
ethnoid and turbinated bones, its floor being the hard palate.
    3. The oral cleft, below the palate, forming the roof of the mouth,
 while the    hyoid and tongue form           the floor, and the maxilla    and
muscles of the cheek complete the cavity of the mouth.
    I.  As soon   as the  conical   sac   of the venous sinuses and    azygeal
veins from the chorda centralis(the future spinal column) extend
to the upper angle of the first formed embryonic heart, where two
tubes or inferent veins enter from the lower angle of its base, a single
efferent tube — the ductus venosus — leading backwards, and sending
forwards from      the umbilicus a vein on each side (in birds towards
the circular sinus, from which a fringe of minute capillaries extend
below the chorion).         In   the capillary area, where the veins and
arteries communicate,        the venous blood becomes oxidised, and          re
turns by the arterial area to the embryo;          the minute arterial rootlets
becoming larger and larger,          till the blastine artery from each side
enter the lower part of the embryo above the highly upturned coccyx,
the lower orifice of the future umbilicus, when the abdomen is closed.
From this point these arteries           (the future umbilical of the foetus)
descend to the iliacs, which unite opposite the promontory of the
sacrum, and carry the arterial blood upward along the chorda cen
tralis,  as high   as the    fovea cardiaca,     or pharyngeal hollow, from
whence the double        aortae each     divide into two terminal branches,
which unite behind the        base   of the heart to form the arterial aortic
bulb, quite unconnected        with the cavity of the heart, the top of      the
bulb   seen rising higher than the heart, has misled embryologists to
fancy it was a part of a twisted tube, which has sometimes been
described as the first form     of the embryonic heart.      Pander, Prevost,

                       of Edinburgh,          Session 1868-69.                          521
and Dumas, as well as Wagner and                    Allen Thomson, describe the
first heart    as a   conical   sac,   having its apex anterior beneath the head
of the embryo, with two inferent veins entering from above, and only
one efferent tube, the ductus venosus.               Wagner mentions             a certain
amount of motion among the blood-discs, previous to the contraction
of the conical heart, having only a single cavity.    It is at first
transparent and membranous,                  but contractile,     and filled with a
yellowish or pale orange fluid, the plasma or liquor sanguinis. As
soon as the punctum saliens in the base of the heart starts its
contraction, its fluid is forced               down the   ductus    venosus        to the
oxidising      area of the chorion, where            it is fully arterialised, and
follows the course, already shortly described, to the aorta, its ter-
miual branches, forming the aortic bulb, terminate in the carotid and
subclavian arteries to the head, upper trunk, and extremities. From
thence the blood, reduced to a venous condition, is returned by the
jugular and subclavian                 veins forming the superior          venae    cavae,
which flow into the single cavity of the primary heart.                          The thin
condition of its transparent walls might                   lead    us to view          it   as
analogous       to the lymph heart of the frog and tail of the eel, so
well described by Mr Wharton Jones, F.R.S., in a communica
tion published in the last volume of the Philosophical Trans
actions, forcing on a column of dark venous blood discs.
  II.     Soon after the blood has circulated once or twice,                     there      is
a ventricle added to the base of the auricle, which is then perforated
by the auriculo-ventricular              orifice.   Still there is only the same
outlet for the venous blood from the heart, which                    is,   during    foetal
non-breathing existence, entirely connected alone with the venous
circulation.
   III.    The next change in the structure of the heart             is    the dividing
the ventricle by  muscular septum, which, till
                         a                           complete,      it     is
allows the venous blood to enter freely into both ventricles                                (a
system which continues in some reptiles), from which                  it    is   instantly
returned to the auricle by their systole,                  and     forced down the
ductus venosus to be oxidised and returned as arterial by the umbi
lical arteries into the iliacs, and upwards by the                aortae, as already
described.

after birth, leaving the foramen ovale soon partially covered            by a
valve.   Even subsequent to the formation of the quadrilocular heart
of the foetus, still the ductus veuosus is the only outlet of venous
blood sent to be oxidised and returned by the arteries to the aortic
bulb for circulation.     The foramen ovale (rationally explained) per
mits the free passing of the blood to and from the ventricles, and
                                                        "
readily explains what Dr Churchhill could not — That the pulse de
tected by the stethescope, when applied to the maternal abdomen,
indicated twice the rapidity detected at the cord in cases of             pro
lapsus or turning."        The systole of the auricles preceding that
of the ventricles may be detected by the ear; but being imme
diately followed by the stronger contraction of the ventricles tilting
the apex against the sides of the chest, as in the adult, impresses
the finger when      applied  to the cord with     half the rapidity of    the
pulse indicated by the stethoscope.
    V. Towards the close of pregnancy a much greater change is
 being inaugurated preparatory to the inflation of the lung-cells.
 The very beautiful demonstration           by Dr Tonge by a well-con
 ducted   series of experiments on the aortic bulb         of the chick,     in
 a paper    communicated      to   the Royal Society last year       by Pro
 fessor Beale.
    Dr Tonge describes, towards the close of incubation, that there
 may be traced, extending from          the upper   left angle of the bulb,
 below the entrance of one of the left terminal branches        of the aorta,
 the commencement       of  a fine  film of its lining membrane descend
 ing diagonally to the lower right corner (the right aorta and its ter
 minal branches having disappeared).           This division into two tubes
 he describes   as being closed by three semilunar valves, preventing
 the flow of the arterial blood into the ventricles.
     While these changes are going on in the bulb, the right ventricle
 pushes a horn over the auriculo-ventricular          septum   and   auricles,
 from the right margin of the heart upwards to the left side           of the
 bulb, and passing behind it ramifies into right and left pulmonary
 trunks. The left ventricle, in like manner, pushes its horn behind
  the mitral valve, under the right auricle, and, rising over the upper
  part of the aortic bulb, carries off the innominata, carotid and sub
  clavian arteries, as well as crushing off the last upper left terminal
  branch of the aorta (leaving a small portion, which quickly become?

which has really no existence) between its own trunk and that of
the right pulmonary artery, forming the arch of the aorta, it con
tinues  its course by the left embryonic ascending          aorta (as soon
as the first inflation of the lung-cells permits the flow of blood from
the ventricles by their new outlet).        The now arterialised blood
flows  down    the thoracic and abdominal        aorta   to be distributed
through the system.

   The following Communications were read : —
1. The Mean Pressure          of the Atmosphere, and the Prevail
   ing Winds for the Months and for the Year.                    Part II.
   By Alexander Buchan, Secretary of the Meteorological
   Society.
   In Part I., read 16th March 1868, in which was discussed the
Mean Pressure of the Atmosphere over the Globe for July,
January, and the year, the method by which the Isobaric Charts
were constructed     was detailed  at length.   Since March 1868, valu
able additional information has been obtained from Australia, New
Zealand, Tasmania, Africa, South America, the west coast of North
America, Iceland, and from       a few isolated   stations  in Europe and
Asia.   The period for the British Islands has been extended          so as
to include the eleven years from 1857 to 1867.
   Part II. gives the complete set of Charts for the twelve months
and for the year.    In this Part  the prevailing winds were shown from
good averages collected or calculated      for upwards of two hundred
places over the globe.     The general result is that the surface winds
of the globe flow round and inwards       upon regions     of low pressure

524               Proceedings      of the Royal Society
on every siile from which observations have been obtained, and that
surface winds flow out of spaces of high pressure in every direction.
Tiiis outflow of the winds from regions of high pressure, and           inflow
upon regions of low pressure, may be explained by the principle of
gravitation.     Indeed, so strongly is this force marked, on compar
ing isobaric lines with prevailing winds, that        if there be any other
force or forces concerned         in setting the winds      in motion,     they
must hold a very subordinate place.           The influence of    a mountain
range in diverting aerial       currents   from their normal      courses was
illustrated by the prevailing winds in Norway; and an explanation
 was offered of the anomalous direction of the winds on the coast of
West Greenland.
    The relation of the data, graphically delineated on the charts,
to climate was pointed out; for since winds bring with them the
 temperature of the parts of the earth's surface they have traversed,
 the charts may be regarded as furnishing the key to the climates
of different countries.      Their relation to the rainfall of the different
mouths of the year was adverted to.            Thus, by   a  careful study of
the isobaric lines, and the prevailing winds, in connection with the
 isothermal lines, the climate       of any region    may be more closely
approximated      to than has hitherto been possible.
    It was pointed out that the position       of the isobaric lines in     the
different months appears to be entirely determined            by the sun    and
the geographical      distribution of land and water; and since          these
lines, in their turn, determine       the climates   of the globe, there      is
here evidently a principle applicable not only to the present             state
of the earth, but also to other distributions of land and water in
past times   ; in other words, there is here a principle of the utmost
importance to the geologist in attempting to account for glacial
and warm periods through which the climates of Great Britain and
other countries are known to have passed.            If  this conclusion     be
just,  we are now     in a position to give     an approximate     numerical
statement of    Lyall's idea of the effect produced on climate by the
displacements      of continents.

 2.   On the Rectangular Current Theory of Storms, illustrated
     by two Storms which passed over the United States, from
     the 13th to 19th March 1869.               By Eobert Eussell, Esq.
    The author's former views on American storms were first alluded
to  —   i.e., that the phenomena could only be accounted for on the
supposition      that there were two distinct currents.     Instead of these
being parallel, they were more nearly at right angles to each other.
 The southerly current on the eastern axis of storms brought up
 heat and moisture          from   the  Gulf of Mexico, causing the baro
 meters to fall.      The west or north-west wind, on the other hand,
cleared the southerly current away, causing the temperature every
where to fall and the barometer to rise.
    The storms under review were then examined by M. Le Verrier's
mode of laying down isobarometric             lines on charts, but for every
tenth of an inch of pressure instead         of two-tenths.   The southerly
current was shown to have distinct lines of contour and order from
the other— the west or north-west at right angles to it.
    The minimum line of the barometer where the currents meet, or
where the west flowed into the southerly, was described and pointed
out   ;   the barometers      obtaining their lowest reading, and thermo
meters their highest on that line, on any latitude, from          the Lakes
to the       Gulf of Mexico.       As formerly defined, in the Proceedings
of this Society,      " the latitudinal line of minimum barometer repre
sents that space where the air, from the surface of the earth to the
top   of the atmosphere, is warmest on any latitude, and consequently
lightest."
    The charts of 13th and 14th March 1859 were first exhibited,
showing that thunder storms with rains prevailed up the Mississippi
valley, as far north as the southern border of the State of Michigan.
At the same time         a severe snow storm from the   north-east prevailed
over Minnesota, Northern Wisconsin, and Northern Michigan — a
foot of snow       falling over    a large extent of country.   The line of
minimum barometer was greatly curved, or, what is the same thing,
stretching from south-east to north-west in its northern part. The
remarkable       analogy     between the main phenomena of this storm
and that of the      "  Royal Charter" storm of 1859, was pointed out by
the author reading a passage which he had formerly written regard

 526                Proceedings    of  the  Royal Society
 ing that storm, and merely substituting American dates and places
 for British.
     The chart of 15th showed that the cold west wind, which              was
 first felt in Texas at 9 p.m.   of the 13th, and was at first travelling
 faster in the south than the north, had swept the whole              country
 as  far east  as  St Johns in South Carolina, and northwards           as far
 as Oswego at the east end      of Lake Ontario.      The line of minimum
 barometer was then nearly straight from St          Johns to Oswego, cold
 winds prevailing on the west, and warm on the east side of it.
     The author then drew attention to the phenomena of calms that
 appear in the front and rear of all the American storms, as well as
 our own.     The calms stretching southwards from Toronto, on the
 night of the 13th March, advanced eastwards at the rate of 10              to
 12 degrees    of longitude  a day.     On the morning of the 15th the
 calms were east of Nova Scotia.           At the very same time another
 series of calms was produced         on the west from       Texas north    to
 the west end of Lake Superior.           Frost now visits Texas, where
thirty-four hours before the thermometer stood at           82° in the shade.
 This series of calms was the forerunner of another and more severe
storm then to the west of them.           On the morning of the 16th the
central axis of the calms        was   over   the   85th longitude, having
again    advanced     10 to  12   degrees    in twenty-four hours.       The
calms,    then seen where       there   were   a   multiplicity  of stations,
showed that they were of the form          of  a  pyramid, rounded at the
top, but wide at the base.       Along the shores of the Gulf of Mexico
the region of calms was at least 700 miles broad, but not more than
200 miles on the Lakes.          The advance eastwards of these calms
from    day to day, with the storm to the west of them, was then
traced.
    The storm on the west of the calms of the 16th was traced out.
Charts were exhibited"of the morning of the 18th and night of the
18th, showing its progress from west to east over the States, and
that the west wind advanced faster over the Southern States than
the Northern.       As a consequence, the minimum line of barometer
was largely bent over the Eastern States, stretching from north
west to south-east    — this direction being exactly reversed from that
of the morning of the 15th March.
    The author then pointed out the relation which the winds to the

                    of Edinburgh,        Session 1868-69.                   527
west of line of minimum barometer bore to the winds on the east,
according to the direction of this line with respect to the meridians.
    1st, When the minimum line is straight, or nearly so, on the
meridians,    as on   morning of 18th March, the winds change from a
southerly or easterly direction to west or north-west.               This holds
true   as far to the northwards        as the pressure  decreases from south
to north on the line of minimum                barometer,    as  it did over an
extent of the line, on the morning of 18th March, for upwards of
800 miles.      Under these conditions, a calm            or   lull of the wind
occurs    along the line before the wind changes suddenly to the
west or north-west.
    2d, On the northern border of the storm, where the line of mini
mum barometer is curved, or            lying from south-east to north-west,
as  in Scotland during "Royal Charter"             storm, the wind does not
calm down, but veers from north-east to north and west.
    3d, On the southern border of the storm, when the line lies from
north-east to south-west,         as in common in the valley of the Mis
sissippi west of the river, the winds are more northerly there and
along the Gulf than in any other part of the United States. When
this direction of the line occurs in Scotland, we are liable to such
eruptions of northerly winds          as wrecked the
                                                       " Ivanhoe" in Decem
ber 1867.
    ilh, When      the    minimum line of barometer            on the southern
 border of the storm        lies from south-east     to north-west an oppo
site state of things occur.          The winds do not lull or veer at first     ;
 the cold current from the west rushes in behind the south-westerly
 warm     winds, and causes the temperature to fall and the barometer
 to rise.    The terminating winds on the east and west sides of the
 minimum line on the 15th and the 19th March were contrasted in
this respect.
    The relation     as well    as  want of conformity in contour between
the isobarometric       lines of the cold west winds and those of the
 warm southerly winds were pointed out.              The phenomenon of the
 kneeing-in of the isobarometric          lines on the west of the minimum
 line was exhibited.         The phenomenon was parallel in principle to
 that formerly shown by the author, as existing in the south of
 England and north of France on morning of 3d December 1863.
     The author then pointed out the extraordinary different results
    vol. vi.                                                           3 z

528                Proceedings of the Royal Society
that were obtained  in measuring the rate at which storms pro
gressed, but taking either the minimum line or minimum point.
The French, and indeed the common method, is to take the mini
mum  point, while Espy took the minimum line.    Neither the
one nor the other can be relied on to show the actual rate of
progress       of the storm.
                          Taking either of these methods, the
storm of the 14th advanced eastwards from Border Plains in Iowa
to Oswego in New York State, about 900 miles in twenty-four
hours, or upwards of 37 miles an hour.               That of the 17th, by either
of these methods, from Dubuque, in Iowa, on the Mississippi, to                           a
little to the east of Lake Michigan, 240 miles, or 10 miles an hour.
The further progress of this storm by either of these methods was
20 miles an hour.   The author then maintained that the rate at
which the calms shifted their place in front and rear of these
storms furnished the true measure of their rate of propagation.
     The author then gave his views           as to the mode        in which storms
are propagated.     The idea still maintained by the French, as well
as   by most meteorologists, that the falling barometers, high tempera
tures, and rains on the east side         of storms, were actually translated
from west to east, was quite indefensible.               It   was argued     that the
calms along the      Gulf of Mexico, which were propagated in front of
storms, at the rate of nearly 600 miles               a day, or about 25 miles
an hour, could not possibly be imagined to travel or be pushed along
from west to east.        If they were   so, there    could be no calm.          So the
red lines on the charts, showing the falling             barometers        and    rains,
like the calms, apparently travel from west to east.                    There can    be
no translation however.         These phenomena are the effects of               causes
which    are    acting on the spot.        On the morning of the 18th               the
southerly winds to the east of the line of minimum barometer, over
an immense area, were all light, mixed with calms, and from almost
every point of the compass.  They could not possibly be in a state
of translation from west to east at the rate of 20 miles an hour.
The explanation       is,   the southerly winds bring in moisture, which
is   condensed by the cold of expansion,             as the   air over the region,
swept by the warm southerly winds, ascends.                   It   is
                                                                    a   process which
once begun        tends   to perpetuate    itself.     An inch of rain on            an
average fell over an immense          area.     According to Espy and Tyn-
dall,   as much    force would    be evolved on 50 square miles                  of any

                          of Edinburgh,    Session 1868-69.                 529
of these States (a mere spect on the charts) than the 100,000,000
of tons of coals that Great Britain raises in a year. The vapour,
as    it becomes condensed in rains, converts the atmosphere into                 a
vast caloric engine, and produces vast effects.             Twenty-five    miles
of calms         on    the west side of the calm region are every hour con
verted into easterly winds, which blow towards the line of minimum
barometer, and 25 miles              of calms are produced every hour on the
east side        ;   and besides, the air, as seen in chart of 16th March, is
tossed over the calms, as an upper current from the west, and as                 it
cools by radiation, descends and supplies             the cold and dry winds
that blow in the rear of the minimum line of barometer                    on the
west side of the previous storm.
   The rate at which the calms are propagated along the latitudes
is the true index of the rate of a storm's progress. Whatever may
be the         particular character of the disturbance    within, the calms on
the east and on the west contain the whole body of the storm
within their bounds. Their rate of propagation is the true rate
of that of the disturbances within.             With all deference to Espy,
storms must be propagated faster along the south ; for so long as
the central axis of the calms is meridional, it must move more
rapidly in the south, for the simple reason that the meridians are
wider there.
3. On the Boulder-Clay of Europe.                  By D. Milne-Home, Esq.
      It   was explained that this deposit, known in Scotland as          Till   or
Boulder-Clay, prevails also in Ireland, the Isle of Man, England
(north of the Thames), Denmark, and Sweden, though much less
abundantly in these last countries. It exists also in the Hudson's
Bay districts, and at the south extremity of South America.
      It   had been a subject of perplexity           to geologists ever since
attention was drawn        fifty years ago, by Sir James Hall of
                                to   it,
Dunglass, whose papers are in the Transactions of this Society.
  About the year 1840      theory was started to account for the
                                     a
boulder-clay, and other phenomena               allowed to be connected with
it,   by the action of glaciers.
     At    first, local glaciers were proposed    ;   but latterly there seemed
to be      a   disposition among Scotch geologists       to adopt the startling

530                 Proceedings      of the Royal Society
speculations     of Agassiz, that     a   gigantic glacier formerly existed,
emanating from the North             Polar regions, and flowing over the
whole northern hemisphere.
  The author said he did not adopt this view. He held that the
boulder-clay was not a land deposit, but one which had been
formed     at the bottom    of the    sea   ;   that it originally consisted    of
the ordinary beds       of mud, sand, gravel, or boulders, such           as are
found generally at a sea-bottom;                and that these beds were in
vaded by icebergs,      which ploughed them up, and mingled them
all together,    so as to   produce       what is called boulder-clay.         His
reasons for    thinking   so were these —
  1.     True boulder-clay is not found in Switzerland, though,              if its
formation is due to the action of glaciers,              it ought to be found
there.
  2.     Boulder-clay   is found in many places          where   it is not    con
ceivable any glacier could have existed, or, at all events, have had
any connection with the deposit.
  3. An examination of the materials composing the boulder-clay
showed that these materials had been in motion ; and as it appeared
that the motion was everywhere from the same direction, viz.,
from the west or north-west, it was impossible to explain such a uni
formity of direction, extending over                         without sup
                                                so large an area,
posing that there had been a        great oceanic current, which operated
in producing that motion.
  4.     The circumstance, that almost everywhere.boulder-clay is asso
ciated with marine Pleistocene strata, and that in very many places
in Scotland,    Ireland, and England it contains marine             fauna, is a
strong proof that it has been formed at the bottom of the             sea.
  5.     The boulder-clay shows, however, from the absence of strati
fication, from the broken state of the sea shells, and from the un
natural mixture in it of littoral and deep-water              shells, that some
agent     has operated on    it,   causing great disturbance,       and   acting
with immense mechanical        power.
  6.  The accounts given by voyagers to the arctic regions, show
that icebergs there disturb the sea-bottom, and produce operations
very analogous to those which are inferred to have occurred in the
production of the boulder-clay.

associated beds, as well as the nature of the animals whose bones are
found in it and in these beds, shows that at this epoch the climate
of North-Western Europe was arctic; and the height at which
shell beds of that period, as well as other marine strata, have been
found, shows that Scotland must have sunk to the depth of at least
3000 feet below the present sea-level.
    When the land was        so submerged,     icebergs   came over  the sub
merged land, and grating upon the sea-bottom,              converted many of
the beds into boulder-clay.
    The phenomena         of smoothed ridges and water sheds, the posi
tion of   blocs percds, and the    transport of boulders generally, can be
better explained by floating ice than by glaciers.
    8. The arctic climate of North- Western Europe was probably
caused — (1.) By the Gulf-Stream flowing in some other direction
than that now followed by it; (2.) By an arctic current flowing
from the west or north-west ; (3.) By the existence of high land
in the North Atlantic, which increased the cold, produced glaciers
and icebergs, and gave an easterly or south- east direction to the
arctic current.
4.   On the Development of the Flower of Pinguicula vulgaris,
    L., with Remarks on the Embryos of P. vulgaris, P.
    grandiflora, P. lusitanica, P. caudata* and Utricularia
    minor. By Alexander Dickson, M.D. Edin. & Dublin.,
    Kegius     Professor of Botany in the University of Glas
    gow.
    The affinities of the order Lentibulariaceae        having hitherto been
somewhat      obscure, the author undertook         the investigation of the
floral organogeny      of  P. vulgaris, in the hope of being able to throw
some   light on the subject
    A plant of P.    vulgaris,   examined    during the flowering season,
                                 "         "
exhibits a short axis with         radical    leaves spreading as a rosette,
and terminated      by an unstalked umbel         of ebracteate flowers.  In
the axil of the last leaf is produced a bud, which, after the matur-

hcul been submitted   to the Society.

 at ion of the fruit, supplants      the now decayed main axis and forms
 the " autumn rosette."        This autumn rosette, on the approach of
winter, loses its expanded outer leaves, its central portion remain
ing as a firm bulb-like winter-resting bud, the outer leaves of which
are developed as somewhat         fleshy scales.       In this bulb-like  bud the
rudiment of the inflorescence for the next season, along with that
of the axillary bud of the last leaf, is to          be seen.    On the return    of
warm weather, towards the end of spring, the winter bud expands
as the   flowering rosette, while the axillary bud of the last leaf is
being developed so as to form the autumn rosette as above described.
    The author's principal results are         as  follows : —
     1. The    receptacle   exhibits      irregularity     before  there   is  any
         appearance     of floral    parts,   its extremity being obliquely
         flattened downwards        and posteriorly.
    2.  The calyx, corolla (apparently), androecium, and ovary appear
         first in their anterior part or parts.
    3. The androecium      in the young flower consists            of two fertile
         stamens superposed        to the anterior sepals, and two stami-
          nodes   superposed    to the      lateral ones.       The   staminodes
         usually disappear at an early period.
    4.  The pistil originates as a semilunar elevation to the anterior
         side of the receptacular         centre.     Its extremities gradually
         extend themselves around that centre until the ovarian wall
         is completed posteriorly.
    5. The placenta is strictly        " free-central "
                                                            being always uncon
         nected with the ovarian wall.            It has no barren apex corre
         sponding to that in Primulaceae;            and the ovules (which are
         anatropal   and present a single integument) appear             in basi-
         petal   succession   over its surface.
    The author drew attention to several monstrosities, chiefly affect
ing the pistil.     In   some of these the posterior (small) lip of the
stigma was bipartite, and in others the anterior (large) lip was
tripartite.     Combining these monstrosities,           he drew the inference
(which he held to be quite in harmony with the developmental
facts) that the pistil of -P. vulgaris consists of five connate carpels;
its bilabiation being comparable to that of the corolla in Utricularia
minor, where five parts are united into a structure               with two   entire
lips.

                    of Edinburgh, Session 1868-69.                          533
    The author is inclined to set aside the ordinary idea of            a close
 affinity with Scrophulariaceae.     If  the supposed correspondence in
 the number of carpels has no reality, the orders have actually
 nothing    in common      save bilabiation   and didynamy;         but these
 characters   are found in so many different types that they are of
 very small value     in determining the affinities of        a given plant.
 On the other hand, he showed that Lentibulariaceae, in having a
 free-central placenta and (probably) five carpels, differ little from
 Primulaceae     except  in the superposition      of the stamens to the
 sepals, and the exalbuminous character of the seed.
    The author thought that Salvadoraceae should be placed near
 Lentibulariaceae,   as  had been done by Payer         in his " Lecons sur
 les fam.    nat. des plantes,"   and   suggested     that Salvadora,      with
 oppositisepalous    stamens    and  solitary exalbuminous seed, bears
 the same relation to Lentibulariaceae      with numerous exalbuminous
seeds, as Plumbaginaceae       with oppositipetalous      stamens    and soli
 tary albuminous seed, bears to Primulaceae          with numerous        albu
 minous seeds     : Salvadoraceae    with Lentibulariaceae,     on the      one
hand, and Plumbaginaceae        with Primulaceae on the other, forming
two parallel, nearly allied series.
    The author also drew attention to the embryos of Pinguicula
vulgaris,   P. grandiflora, P. lusitanica,   and    Utricularia   minor.      A
very brief statement        by him of the      differences   between      those
of the two first had already appeared in the report of a meet
ing of the Dublin Microscopical Club, on 21st November 1867
(Microscopical Journal, viii. pp. 121-2) ; but a more detailed
account was now submitted along with figures.                He was able to
confirm St. Hilaire's     statement   as  to the dicotyledony of       P. lusi
tanica, which, when contrasted        with the monocotyledony           in the
two first named species of the genus, is very remarkable          ;   and in a
Mexican species,     P. caudata, the author has also found two cotyle
dons.    In Utricularia minor the   embryo is somewhat globular, and at
first sight appears to have    a smooth    undivided surface    ; on careful
inspection, however,    a remarkable    conformation is to    be observed    of
that end of the embryo which is remote from the hilum of the
seed, viz., a minute punctum vegetationis surrounded by four very
slight elevations forming the somewhat incurved sides of a square.
He was not prepared to call these four elevations cotyledons, but

                          Dr W. Lauder Lindsay.
   The author's      "Observations"        relate  mainly to the Microscopic
Anatomy of the reproductive           tissues and corpuscles of about fifty
Lichenicolous Parasites — apparently new species — referable partly
to the true   Fungi, and partly    to the Fungo-Lichenes.      These parasites,
themselves microscopic, have accumulated in the author's Herbarium
during the last twelve or fifteen years          : or were examined    by him

while determining the species of various British and foreign Lichen-
collections submitted for that purpose during the same period.

                   . Nephromii.
   Detailed observations are included on the variations of Torula
lichenicola and Coniothecium lichenicolum.
    The group of parasites described (accompanied with two plates
of seventy figures illustrative of their minute structure) is repre
sentative     of a large   and important section     of obscure and little
understood organisms that are midway in character between Lichens
and    Fungi, and which have been scarcely studied by either Lichen-
ologists    or Fungologists.     The observations     made upon      them by
the author illustrate several      points of great interest in the physio
 logy, anatomy, morphology, and classification of the lower orders of
 Lichens and Fungi,      e.g. —
    1.  The extent to which Lichens           are  affected   with parasitic
          growths.
    2.  The external resemblance      between    these   parasites — whether
          Lichens, Fungi, or Fungo-Lichens — and the

          degenerations    of the Lichen-thallus or apothecia.
    4.  The closeness of the alliance between Lichens and Fungi: the
          impossibility of drawing lines of demarcation.
    5.  The fallacies of supposed diagnostic characters or differential
          tests between Lichens and     Fungi: especially the iodine- reac

He contributes also to        a  fuller knowledge of the minute anatomy
of various lichenicolous parasites, whose names and specific char
acters have already been published, but which are nevertheless
as   yet little known, e.g. —

6.    On the Theory of the Formation                   of Ammonia         when
        Nitrogen     and Aqueous Vapour            are passed      over   Mag
        nesium.      By A. K. Catton, M.A.
     In   a paper recently communicated          to the Society by    Mr Main
and myself,       we showed      that when nitrogen and aqueous vapour
are     passed over magnesium ammonia is formed.                  We took for
granted the theory of the reaction           to be that the magnesium       de
 composes the aqueous vapour,            and that the hydrogen        thus pro
 duced,      when   in the nascent     state, combines      with nitrogen and
 forms ammonia.         In  a   discussion which followed the reading of
 the paper,     Mr Dittmar maintained that such was not the theory of
 t he reaction,    but that nitride of magnesium        is first produced,  and
 then      decomposed    by    the   aqueous     vapour   into ammonia      and
 magnesia.
      I  gave what appeared to me a conclusive answer to this suppo
 sition — which I was certainly surprised to find seriously maintained
  — for it seemed in every point of view so entirely untenable, that
  I did not    think it worthy of notice in our paper.
      As, however, the formation of ammonia in the                  manner   we

                    of Edinburgh, Session 1868-69.                       537
described is a point    of considerable interest,  I have thought it right
to embody the remarks which          I then made in the note now pre
sented to the Society, in order to remove the doubt which             I find
exists in the minds of some as to the theory of the reaction.
   That the ammonia is not due to the action of aqueous vapour
on nitride of magnesium        is, I think,  clearly shown by the follow
ing considerations    : —
   (1.) Nitride of magnesium is a very unstable compound, and is
stated to decompose water with such violence that it makes the
water boil.    A priori it is   a very  strong objection   to an explana
tion which assumes the formation of a body under the very condi
tions which decompose it. To say that nitride of magnesium could
be formed in the presence of aqueous vapour, is pretty much the
same thing as to say that potassium could be formed in the pre
sence of water.     It  is certainly the duty of those who make       a sup
position  so entirely at variance,     as  I think, with dynamical con
siderations, to support it by some experimental evidence.
   (2.) Nitride of magnesium is only formed when magnesium                 is
heated   to  a  high temperature in presence of nitrogen.                But
ammonia is formed in small quantity in our experiments when
nitrogen and aqueous vapour are passed at low temperatures over
magnesium.      In this case, it is certain that nitride of magnesium
is not produced   ;  for it would not     be produced   if aqueous vapour
were not present, and it surely will not be pretended that the pre
sence of aqueous vapour might induce the formation of nitride of
magnesium under conditions in which it would not be formed in
its absence.
   It is equally certain     that at low temperatures magnesium de
composes aqueous vapour with formation of hydrogen ; and in the
union of nascent hydrogen and nitrogen,          we have a sufficient,  and,
as  I maintain,  the only explanation of the formation       of ammonia.
   (3.) To suppose that nitride of magnesium could be formed is
equivalent to maintaining that magnesium has, in the conditions
of our experiments, a greater affinity for nitrogen than for oxygen,
which the instability of the nitride and the great stability of the
oxide of magnesium        shows is not the case.      This reason alone is
sufficient to negative the supposition of the formation of nitride of
magnesium.

538                 Proceedings of the Royal Society
    (4.) Nitrogen and aqueous vapour passed over sodium yielded no
ammonia.       The reason for this was said to be that a nitride of
sodium does not exist.         The real reason for the non-formation of
ammonia appeared to be due to the violent action            of the aqueous
vapour on the sodium.          If sodium amalgam were used in order to
modify the action of the sodium, we believe that ammonia would
be produced.       It  is our intention to try this experiment.

1.   Influence of the Vagus upon the Vascular System.                    By
    William Eutherford, M.D., F.E.S.E., Demonstrator of
    Practical Physiology in the University of Edinburgh.
                                   Abstract.
    The author gave the chief results of 120 experiments upon frogs,
rabbits, and dogs, as follows : —
    1.  He showed, by novel methods of experimentation, that the
inferior cardiac branches of the vagi are — as the brothers Weber
pointed out — inhibitory nerves of the heart, and that they cannot
in any sense be regarded as motor nerves       of the heart, as maintained
by Schiff, Moleschott, Lister, and others.         The experiments bear
ing on this question were performed in 1866-67.
    2.  Because the heart usually beats more rapidly after division
of the vagi, Von Bezold           and  others  have   concluded   that   the
vagus     is  continually    restraining the heart's movements.         The
author showed that increase of the blood pressure is generally the
cause of the quickened cardiac action after division of the vagi,
a  fact which had been overlooked        by all previous  observers.   Von
Bezold's theory, that the vagi continually inhibit the heart,           was
therefore shown to be devoid of the necessary proof.

                         of Edinburgh, Session 1868-69.                      539
    3.   It  had been noticed       by many observers that after division of
both vagi the blood-pressure            usually rises.    This has always   been
ascribed       to the quickened rate of cardiac        action  ; but the author
proved that        it is usually due to the contraction of abdominal blood
vessels,      chiefly those of the stomach.          Division    of the vagi is
followed by rise in the blood pressure — in general — only when the
animal is digesting its food; that is, when the gastric blood-vessels
are dilated previous to the division of the nerves.
    4. The vessels of the stomach appear to be dilated during diges
tion, chiefly by the vaso-inhibitory action of incident filaments of
the vagi upon the splanchnic nerves (the vaso-motor nerves for the
gastric vessels).
    5.   By the discovery of the above fact additional support is given
to the theory that the contractile elements              of the entire vascular
system       are presided over by two kinds of nerves— one motor, the
other     inhibitory.        The former brings about contraction of the
vascular       system,     the latter causes its dilatation by throwing the
vaso-motor nerves into a state of rest.
    The experiments bearing on the questions embraced in                 2, 3, 4,
and 5, were chiefly performed in 1868.

    In the first part of the paper         I adduce probable, or prima facie,
evidence        in favour of the theory that the power which produces
voluntary motion is not derived solely, nor even chiefly, from the
decomposition          of the muscular tissues,     as has   been generally,    if
not universally,          held by recent investigators,     but is derived pri
marily and principally            from the decomposition of the cerebral
tissues    ;  and second, that this decomposition of the brain is effected
by a   direct voluntary mental effort.

       An immense amount of free force is being constantly liberated
     2d,
by the process of decomposition going on in the body of the living
animal, and it is thus that heat, one of the prime agents in the
animal economy, is supplied to all parts of the body.
  3d, Free force is also in this way, viz., by the decomposition                                    of
the substance          of the brain, supplied to the muscles of voluntary
motion,          and it is the agent which causes their contractions, for
the purposes            of animal movement.
     4th,    This decomposition                    is effected by a direct mental effort,
which       we are conscious           of exerting during voluntary muscular action.
     5//i, Though there is a notable difference between the tension of
brain       force and what is called       galvanic force, as is marked by its
ascertained                             —
                       inferior velocity about 95 feet in the second— and by
its having        a feebler         and more easily interrupted current, yt t brain
or nervous force seems substantially the same in its nature, source,
and action, as galvanic force.
     The grounds            for holding that the free force which produces
muscular action is derived, at least chiefly, from the brain, and not
from the muscles, whose main function is to be the mechanicol
instruments of motion, are the following : —
     1st ground.The brain is the centre of the nervous system.  It is
now, also, by the experiments of Helmholtz, Harles, Fick, Schelske,
and others, ascertained to be the sole seat of sensation.      Being
thus the direct and only organ                        of the mind, it is natural, if not
necessary,            to conclude          it to    be the    immediate       source of animal
power during voluntary muscular movement.
     2d ground.         We have        a direct experience   that the amount ofphysical
power obtained            is,   caeteris   paribus, in constant proportion to the amount
of   the mental effort             which we are conscious             of   exerting   in producing
this physical power.
     3d ground.           The brain gets, according to reliable computation,
probably         five times the average supply of blood which                          is   furnished
to the other parts of the body, weight for weight.                                    This circum
stance requires            to be accounted              for, and physiological              principles
mark        it   as   a   proof that the brain               is   an organ    discharging very
heavy and important work, by the decomposition                                  and reconstruc

tion of its substance, and by the consequent                  liberation of free

  4th ground. The circumstance that the complex albuminous and
oleaginous constitution of the cerebral substance yields readily to
decomposition,    and that it is the part whose chemical combinations
are the first to break up after death, serves further to strengthen
the views here set forth.
  The subject      is,
                  doubtless, one very difficult to investigate; for
even   in the face of much contradictory evidence, we accept the
     if,
opinion that the amount of Urea and other nitrogenous products
discharged from the body affords correct measure of the amount
                                            a
of animal work performed in             a   given   time, yet from the circum
stance that both the brain and the muscles are chiefly nitrogenous
in their constitution,     it   must ever remain difficult,   if   not impossible,
by any mere examination            of the nitrogenous     excretions, to ascer
tain whether they are derived from the one organ or from the other,
and therefore, the most ingenious and careful investigations               will   be
required     before we are entitled         to dispossess the brain       of what
appears, on pretty strong grounds, to be one of its most important
functions, viz., that of being the organ to the mind                 for the pro
duction of animal motion and power.
                                   On Perception.
   The second part of this paper has reference to the subject of
sense-perception, or the impressions which the mind obtains by
reason of its connection with the physical world.
   The writer directs attention to the fact that an examination                   of
the laws     of momentum, and of the transmission              of the rapid con
cussions and vibrations which pass through the atmospheric and
ethereal media, makes   apparent that free force or power
                            it                            trans           is
mitted from molecule to molecule of these media, and that, philo
sophically     speaking,     this free force which thus enters the
                            it    is
brain through the appropriate nerves, and which impresses the mind
with the sensations of light and sound.
  The difficulty which has hitherto been felt by philosophers, not
only of the various continental schools, but also of our Scottish
school of philosophy,       has ever been       — how matter or physical sub
stance could     act on mind      ?    This difficulty prompted Malebranche

542                Proceedings of the Royal Society
to promulgate      the theory of our perceiving all things in God.               It
also prompted       Leibnitz to maintain that there was no operative
connection     between    the mind and external physical nature, but
merely a pre-established         harmony   ; and much        the same difficulty
led Berkeley to deny the existence            of an external world, and to
declare    that our perceptions       were    not real, but only apparent,
being mere ideas evoked in the mind by Deity.
   Reid and Stewart also represented perception               in the light of    an
inexplicable miracle, on which the study of the physical laws not
only threw no light, but rather served to mislead and pervert tl e
inquirer.     The Deity they held to         be the      only efficient cause     in
perception.
    Mr Wyld holds that the difficulty thus experienced by philoso
phers disappears       the moment we       carefully examine the physical
phenomena.        Thus in the sensations of light and sound, it is not
matter    or substance which affects us, but           it is the force or power
transmitted by the respective media, which affects the mind.                Force
or power    Mr Wyld defines to      be the action      of an unseen immaterial
 agent,   as  proved    in his former paper          on " Free Transmissible
 Power."      And wherever       movement    is observed to exist,       we   have
evidence of the existence of force as its cause.
    When     we explore,    says  Mr Wyld, the links of cause and effect in
 the physical world,      and also when we         contemplate     the operations
 of the mind,    we are made aware       that the seen and the unseen, the
 physical and the mental, rest alike on the spiritual foundation of
 power.     Power is the immaterial or spiritual element in nature —
 that which produces and governs every physical phenomena                   ;  it is
 the copula     uniting cause and effect.           It  is also the attribute of
 the active principle within us, by which we feel, and think, and
 move, and exercise control over external nature.
    Reduced, then, to     a  philosophical form, we stand in this position :
 It is the power of the Supreme Being which constitutes the energies
 and forces of nature.        These forces act on the mind, and the mind,
 as a real agent, acts on them.         Our intercourse         with nature thus
 strictly implies    a connection    of mind with mind, — the connection
 of the Great Mind with his creatures          ;  not, however, as maintained
  by Malebranche, Berkeley, Leibnitz,            or Reid, by miraculous inter
  position or action, but, on the contrary, expressly             by and throusrh

the operation            of the natural laws we have endeavoured to explain
in the previous             paper — Deity         being the sustainer              of these laws
and of the active energies of nature.
  We know that the mind of man deals with and directs free
power or force, when it sends it to the muscles for the purposes of
voluntary motion             ;   and we are therefore justified by parity of reason
in holding that, when free force comes in upon the mind from the
outer world,             through the vibratory movements                    above referred          to,
the mind            will be susceptible to its influence.               This is not only             a
consistent,       but a necessary conclusion.
     It   is, be it observed, not substance, but power, which the vibrat
ing molecules bring to the mind, and which the mind receives.                                      We
may hold also that the force or power thus received or appropriated
by the mind, and the physical movements which accompany       take                           it,
end in the brain, being there neutralised by the control which we
know the mind to exert over physical power.
  It common, we admit, for physicists to explain the perception
          is
of light and sound               as due to the      vibratory    movements         of the physi
cal molecules which impinge on the retina and auditory nerve. But
in doing so they give us merely the outer manifestation, and
neglect the unseen essence and efficacy.                         For   it   is   the force which
causes the movement,                    and   not the movement              which causes the
force.         It   is   force which causes the cannon                 ball to fly with its
destructive violence.                 Take away the force, and the iron lies harm
less on the ground.
     Without the iron, indeed, or other atomic body, we could neither
obtain nor use physical force for physical purposes, and for these
reasons — first, though we can take force from one body and pass
it   to another, we can never obtain                  it   freed from its physical con
nection.   The second reason that physical substance      necessary                 is
for physical purposes    this — Though the iron
                                   is              passive, and the     is
sport of its Master — Force, and though        force that carries
                                                             it   is                                it
through the air, still the iron evidently performs an important part
in physical dynamics. It        because iron and other atomic bodies
                                          is
are impenetrable            by each other, that when the cannon ball meets
the iron target, one or other                  of them must yield.               The question       is
not, which of them               is   the hardest   — for   a   piece of tallow, we know,
may be fired through               a    deal board— the question             is  — whether         the

544                  Proceedings of the Royal Society
cohesive     power     of the target or the onward        force  of the ball   is
greater.      If  the latter preponderates, then the force necessarily
carries the ball with it through the iron plate, with violent disrup
tion of its parts.
    On the same principle,       it is not the movement of the molecules
which, hitting the retina and auditory nerve, affects the mind
with the sensations of light and sound, it is the force which they
carry which accomplishes this.
     Though force is the operative            principle in all physical      and
mental action, yet mark the result were force not regulated, and
 bound up in connection with physical bodies.                Were force freed
 from this connection, it would attain immediate              equilibrium, and
 the physical universe        would instantly     cease  to exist — action and
 reaction,     momentum       and   inertia, resistance    and  localised force
 being at an end, physical law and the physical world would be at
 end with them — for the physical world consists but of the antagon
 ism of contending forces.
     Mr Wyld       concluded by referring to the distinctive nature       of our
 perception      of the primary or solid resisting properties of physical
  objects, and of our other perceptions.           In our sensations of light
  and sound, taste, smell, and touch, the mind is passive.              But our
  perception      of the primary properties       of external nature depends
  entirely on another principle, namely, on our consciousness that the
  mind    possesses,   and exerts a command        over active physical power,
  or the power of animal motion.          When we are conscious of possess
  ing this power, and perceive that the Will which exerts and directs
  it, is thwarted by our coming into visible contact with outer objects,
  we    discover     at once that these     objects   possess resisting power,
  seeing that they counteract         at once our power, and our       Will,  and
  our motion.
      This distinction between passive sensations and the exercise of
   our active      mental and animal powers has not been sufficiently
   urged in refutation of Berkeley's Idealism.            The vast majority of
   realists in philosophy succumb under the apparent force of the
   absurd argument, that all our perceptions are resolvable into mental
   sensations, and therefore that our belief of an outer world hangs on
   faith alone.      Mr Wyld maintains, on the contrary, that according
   to the principles     of his theory  we   have a ready and complete con-

futation of Berkeleyism.  For the mind not only possesses                                                 a com
mand of physical power, but it is conscious that it possesses                                             it,   and
that      it   exerts      it,   and that its exertions are resisted                               by external
objects    ;    and thus, through a direct consciousness of mental power,
we have an                               proof and perception of the
                     indirect, but indefeasible
resistance of external objects, and of the external world.
 3.       On the         Affinities and Classification of the Nemerteans.
                            By W. C. M'Intosh, M.D., Ac.
     The immediate allies of the Nemerteans are evidently the Plana-
rians, and Ehrenberg's class Turbellaria, as now amended,                                             is   there
fore   a   very natural one.                There        is,   however,        a   considerable divergence
between the two groups                     ;   and since           it   is   only through the Planarians
that the Nemerteans can in any way be linked on to the Trematoda,
it   found that there
     is                little structural resemblance between the
                                       is
two last-mentioned types.                           The various                parts of the organism             in
the Trematodes               and Planarians (through which the connection                                        of
the Nemerteans with the former may be supposed to occur) were
contrasted, and their homologies explained. The structural re
lations of the Planarians and Nemerteans were then considered                                                      ;
and, thirdly, the connections of the latter with the higher Annelids
were alluded to.
     In   regard to classification, the arrangements of Linnaeus, Ehren-
berg, (Ersted, De Quatrefages,                          Max Schultze, Schmarda, Keferstein,
and others were examined, and the reasons why they could not now
be adopted,              at least      without essential                       modifications,       explained.
The following classification                        is   considered less liable to alterations
in principle, since              it   is   founded on an anatomical                       basis.
    Order Nemertinea. — Worms, with more or less elongated, soft,
ciliated bodies; nervous system composed of two conspicuous
ganglia connected by                   a       double      commissure,              and two main lateral
cords; digestive system, in the form of                                      a   ciliated canal, with two
apertures   circulatory system, consisting of
                ;                             series of closed con                 a
tractile vessels. The proboscis forms the typical organ of the
order, and          is   surrounded            by   a   special muscular sheath, within which
it   glides in       a   corpusculated              fluid      ;   in front        it   passes between          the
commissures              of the ganglia, while the digestive                                tract    is    placed

iuferiorly.     Sexes    separate in      the   majority  ; oviparous   or ovo-
viviparous.
     The Order may most naturally            be separated into two great Sub-
 Orders, distinguished      from each other by the presence or absence
of stylets in the proboscis, the former being called after Max
Schultze, (but with amended characters), Enopla, and the latter
Anopla.
     The Sub-Order     Enopla is characterised         further by the rounded
 and somewhat double nature of the nerve-ganglion              on each side, and
 by the fact that the lateral nerve-cords are placed within the proper
 muscular walls of the body.             The mouth, moreover, opens on         the
 ventral    surface of the snout in front of the commissures of                the
 ganglia.     The blood-vessels        are   more differentiated   than in     the
 Anopla.      The young,     so far as known,       do not undergo    any   note
 worthy metamorphosis.
     In the Enopla there exists one great group, and a subordinate
 one,    which,   however,     retains    so  many of the characters      of   the
 former, that it has not been considered advisable to separate it into
 a   distinct Family, but both have been placed under the Family
 Ommatopleidw.        The animals forming this Family have two mus
 cular layers in the body-wall, an external circular and an internal
 longitudinal ; the proboscis is composed of three divisions, anterior,
 middle, and posterior,    — the former having in the typical forms         seven
 coats, viz., external     elastic,   external    longitudinal (muscular),      re
 ticulated    or beaded    layer,    inner    longitudinal, circular, basement
 layer, glandular layer.         The middle region bears the stylets, and
 the posterior forms a       long sac, with two muscular coats — external
 circular and internal longitudinal.             There  are  three great   longi
 tudinal vascular trunks, two lateral and one median.              The cephalic
  pits and glands are     accompanied by long tubes or ducts.          The sub
  division of the Family referred         to may be made by separating       those
  (A) with comparatively short and thick bodies, and proportionally
  large   proboscides  ;  and (B) those having more or less elongated
  bodies, and proportionally short proboscides.
      The Sub-Order Anopla, again, is further distinguished by having
  the nerve-cords placed between the muscular layers of the body-
   wall.   The mouth opens on the ventral surface behind the commis

eutiated than in the Enopla.        The young in the most conspicuous
Families undergo      a remarkable   metamorphosis.
    In this Sub-Order   there are several Families, the most conspicuous
and typical of which is that of the Borlasidae, characterised        by the
more or less elongated shape of the ganglia, the arrangement having
with the commissure        the  form of      a horse-shoe.   The muscular
covering of the body is composed of three layers — external longi
tudinal, circular, and internal longitudinal.            The proboscis is
furnished with five coats, viz., external elastic, external longitudinal
and accessory bands, circular, basement, and glandular layers.           The
circulatory system consists of three great longitudinal trunks, two
lateral and a dorsal, which frequently anastomose by transverse
branches, form a rete mirabile in the oesophageal region, and unite
in   lacunae  behind the ganglia.     Head, with deep lateral fissures in
connection with the cephalic gland, which is rounded, and not
furnished with long tubes or ducts.
     A  curious specimen from Herm forms the type of a group             that
 would require to be raised to the rank of a Sub-Family, but as only
one specimen      has yet been found,       it is thought advisable to post
pone this at present, and distinguish it only generically.          In this
 animal the proboscis is extremely slender in proportion to the bulk
 of the body, and in its minute structure differs from the type of the
 Borlasidae in having no accessory bands cut off from the longitudinal
 layer.    Externally the organ has an elastic investing layer, then a
 longitudinal, within which are      a  thin circular and  a glandular coat.
 The reddish colour of the muscles of this species, and the tinted
 circulation, are likewise quite characteristic.
     A more distinct Sub- Family of the Borlasidae than the foregoing,
  perhaps, is that of the Borlasian without lateral slits.     The anatomy
 of the body-wall agrees with Lineus, but there are no cephalic
 fissures.    The structure of the proboscis is also characteristic, for
  there is externally no distinct investing layer, the outer coat con
  sisting of spiral and interwoven muscular fibres, the middle of
  longitudinal, and the internal of the usual glandular coat.
     The Meckelidce constitute     a   very distinct Family of this Sub-
  Order.     The general structure of their nervous system agrees with
  Borlasia, but the lateral nerve-cords      are placed between the  circular
  (external) and the longitudinal        (internal), these being, moreover,

  the only two muscular           coats of the body.       There are no lateral
  fissures.      The circulatory      system     consists  of two great       lateral
  trunks.     The proboscis has externally         a double elastic  layer, a thick
  longitudinal coat, and internally          a glandular layer.
      The Family of the Cephalothricidce deviates still more from the
  typical group.         The arrangement of the ganglia differs, and the
 commissures are separated by a considerable antero-posterior inter
 val.    The lateral       nerve-cords    lie between the longitudinal          layer
 and an isolated         inner band of fibres having the same direction.
 The proboscis          is supplied with acicular papillae, and seems to
 have an external circular and an internal longitudinal coat.                  Snout

 they possess eyes, whereas the adults are generally eyeless.
 4.   On the Alkaloids contained in the Wood of the Bebeeru
      or Greenheart Tree {Nectandra Rodiazi, Schomb.)                             By
      Douglas Maclagan, M.D., F.K.S.E., Professor of Medical
     Jurisprudence           in the University of Edinburgh, and
      Arthur Gamgee, M.D., F.RS.E.
     When the wood of the bebeeru tree is subjected to                   a process
similar to that recommended             in the British Pharmacopoeia         for the
separation       of bebeerine from the bark,      a mixture of several alkaloids
is obtained.
     In this  memoir       the   authors   specially describe the properties of
one of these alkaloids, to which they have assigned the name
Nectandria and the formula Ct„H„3N04. (Bebeerine, according to
V. Planta, has the formula C1(,Ht1N03).               Nectandria is obtained by
treating the mixed alkaloids obtained from the wood with chloro
form, in which        it is abundantly soluble.
     From the chloroform solution it is obtained in the form of                     a
fawn-coloured substance,            which is quite amorphous.            It differs
from Bebeerine in being almost absolutely insoluble in ether, and
in fusing when placed in boiling water.                 By treating the solution
of the hydrochlorate of this base with animal charcoal, and then
precipitating the solution with ammonia, the authors succeeded in

                    of Edinburgh,     Session 1868-69.                    549
obtaining the base of an almost pure white colour. When dissolved
in acid this powder, however, yielded yellow solutions.
    When Nectandria is treated with sulphuric acid and binoxide of
manganese a magnificent green colour is developed, which slowly
changes to a violet, which cannot         be distinguished from that pro
duced under similar circumstances           with strychnia.     This reaction,
which is of exceeding delicacy,            is not   possessed   by bebeerine.
 Nectandria has no effect in rotating the ray of polarised light.
     After separating nectandria by means of chloroform, the authors
 treated the mixed bases with boiling water, which readily acquired
 a  rich yellow colour, and an intensely alkaline reaction.          On cool
 ing, the water deposited a yellow precipitate, which was found to
 consist of microscopic      nodules.     The substance dissolved      by the
 water    is a very powerful base      ;  its compound      with platinum is
 noular, and differs from the double salt of platinum and nectandria
 in being fusible in hot water.       This new     base  is insoluble in chlo
 roform, decidedly soluble in water (one part is soluble in 56-8 parts
 of cold water) and insoluble in ether.
     When treated with binoxide of manganese and sulphuric acid
  it gives exactly the same reaction        as nectandria.
     The taste of this  base is peculiar,   being both bitter and astringent.
     The platinum compound of the new base was analysed, and
 found to contain (1) 20-l per cent, of platinum and (2) 2057 per
 cent of platinum.
     After separating the two bases above referred to         a brown residue
  remains,    which is insoluble in chloroform, ether, and water, but
  soluble   in alcohol.   The alcoholic solution possesses an alkaline
  reaction.    This substance forms compounds with acids, and yields
  an amorphous     compound    with platinum.
      The authors propose to examine in the sequel the physiological
  and therapeutical properties of the true bases treated of in this
  paper, as well as to investigate       in   a special manner the chemical
   relations which exist between them.

   1.  On the Basin of the Firth of Forth, and some of its
       Geological Phenomena.            By David Milne- Home, Esq.
     I. An    account   was given of the dimensions         of the estuary, in
  respect of length, width, and depth       ;  and also of the general direc
 tion of the axis of the estuary.
     II. It   was next shown      that the formation of the estuary        was
 probably due to the great          geological fractures     and dislocations
 which had taken place in this part of Scotland, inasmuch as the
 direction of these was parallel, or nearly so, to the axis of the
 estuary,   and as the downcasts        in the adjoining counties on the
 north and the south were all towards the estuary, thus producing
 a trough or valley, deep enough to be entered and filled by the
 sea.
    III.   The author, before describing the newer deposits filling the
 basin of the Frith of Forth and covering its adjoining shores,
 stated   that the materials of these deposits          were most probably
 derived from the upcast strata which, along the slips and fractures,
 had formed high exposed cliffs, and which yielded to the influence
of the   sea,  if the sea covered them, or atmospheric       changes, if they
 were above the sea-level.
    1.  There were no data for determining          when   these dislocations
took    place.      There   was  clear   evidence,    however,   that in the
Western Highlands there had been outbursts               of trap at a period
later than the chalk     ;  and Mr Cumming thought, that in the Isle of
Man part of the boulder-clay had been formed after great disloca
tions there.
    2.  An account was then given of the various kinds of deposits,
chiefly by means of reports obtained of borings, which showed the
layers of clay, pand, and gravel passed through, with the thickness
of each.

                   of Edinburgh,       Session 18(58-69.                     551
   3.  It was observed that clay generally occupied the lowest levels,
sand and gravel the higher levels, a reason for which was assigned.
The bed called "     sleech
                             " or "            "
                                                 was described, as also the
                                      sludge
"brown" or "carse clay;" and the question was raised, whether
the peat beds, which also appeared among the deposits, were in situ,
or whether they were formed of drifted materials.              The sub-marine
forest on the   Fife coast was noticed.
   Some account     was given of the sea- shells found in the districts,
it being explained that they occurred sometimes in positions where
they were entire, and also in other places where they were broken.
It  was supposed that in the former case the shells were now where
they lived and died   ;  in the latter case, where they had         been thrown
up on beaches.
   An enumeration of the Whale         skeletons  discovered was next given.
   4. Some details were entered          into regarding beds of sand and
gravel, and the pebbles      found    in both, particularly the fragments
of coal,   as indicating    the    quarter from which the transporting
agent had moved.         The subject of kaims was adverted to, which
the author ascribed to the action of sea-tides and currents.
   Some    ancient deltas along the foot           of the Ochil Hills were
noticed and shown in      a map.
   5. Boulders of a large size were pointed out, with a notice                 of
striae on several, and    of the direction of the     striae.
   These boulders     were    described      as  belonging     to  two   distinct
classes, the one being rounded,        the other angular, and each being
in such different circumstances           as   to suggest     a different mode
of transport for each class. All the boulders in this district, how
ever, appeared, from the nature of the stones composing them,
to have come from the west or north wesl, in this respect agreeing
 with the direction of the     striae on the boulders      and rocks, and with
the direction, in most instances,       of the longer axis of the boulders.
    6. The next topic adverted to was the lines of rocky cliffs and
caves, at a height of from 15 to 30 feet above the present sea-level,
which proved that the sea had stood that much higher formerly.
   The author then proceeded to show that almost all the hills in
the district presented     smoothed      or bared fronts to the west, and
that many of them were worn down and grooved in such a way as
to show that some powerful and heavy agent had passed over them

These markings       were   particularly    visible in the gorge       of   the
estuary at Stirling, and up to a level of above 350 feet.
   7.  Attention was next called to the boulder-clay of the district,
whose    irregularity,  both   of distribution      and    of thickness,    was
pointed out.
   The fact of marine beds found above, below, and in the heart of
the boulder-clay was noticed, as also the force with which        it appeared
to have been pushed by some agent or agents in an easterly direc
tion.
   The colour of the boulder- clay, varying          as  it does in different
districts, seemed to   be owing to the colour of the rocks situated           in
each case to the westward, and it was observed that beds            of strati
fied or laminated clay sometimes       showed     different colours, concur
rently with the boulder-clay.
   The author next adverted to the two theories proposed to explain
the origin of the boulder clay, the one being that it was mud
formed    by a glacier grinding      the   rocks, over    which the glacier
flowed,   and the other    that it was formed        by icebergs   ploughing
through and mixing up a previously existing sea-bottom composed
of mud, sand, clay, gravel, and boulders. He stated that he adopted
the second view, and specified some of the difficulties of the ques
tion, all of which he thought could        be more completely solved by
the iceberg than by the glacier hypothesis.
   8.  The author then adverted         to   the   subject   of ancient    sea-
margins, four or five of which he specified, mentioning the names
of places where they had been observed by himself or others.
   The lowest of these sea-margins he had drawn on a map, which              he
exhibited, and the height of this margin he stated was, at the head
of the old estuary (west of Stirling), about 30 feet above the same
old sea-margin at Dunbar. This rise he attributed to tidal action
 exclusively, pointing out that even now, when the estuary                is  so
 much   shallower,  the sea-level   at  Alloa is    6£ feet   higher than at
 Dunbar, and that there are other estuaries,            in this country and
 others, where now the sea-level is at their head more than 30 feet
 above the level at their mouth.
    9. The author said that the change in the relative levels of sea
 and land, which these ancient sea-margins indicated, might have
 been brought about either by the land rising or by the sea sinking             ;

                    of Edinburgh,       Session 1868-69.                  553
  and he was inclined to think the last process, however        it was to be
  accounted for, seemed more in accordance           with the facts, and, in
  particular, with the     horizontality     of these sea-margins, which,
  being over an extensive area, could scarcely have resulted from
 volcanic elevation of the land.
    10. The   author adverted        to an    opinion by Mr Geikie, and
 countenanced by Sir Charles Lyell, that the last change in the
 relative levels of sea and land took place in the Firth of Forth
 since the time    of the Romans, which opinion he thought was dis
 proved by the number of military works of the Romans in the
 district about Stirling, which could never have been made had the
 sea then stood 20 or 30 feet      higher than at present.
    At  the same time, he thought there was evidence to show that
 human    beings   occupied  this part of Scotland       when the sea had
 stood at that higher level, and that as there were also grounds for
 believing that the climate of Scotland had then an arctic character,
 the subterranean    dwellings, called "weems" and " Picts' houses,"
 found in many parts of Scotland, might very probably           be referred
 to the epoch which preceded the change of sea-level.
                2.  On Comets.          By Professor Tait.
                                  (Abstract.)
    The principal object of the paper is to investigate how far the
 singular phenomena exhibited by the tails of comets, and by the
 envelopes of their nuclei, the        shrinking   of their nuclei  as  they
 approach the sun, and vice versd, as well as the diminution       of period
 presented by some of them, can be explained on the probable sup
position   that a comet is a mere cloud of small masses, such              as
stones and fragments      of meteoric     iron, shining by reflected light
alone, except where these masses impinge on one another, or on
other matter circulating round the sun, and thus produce luminous
gases,  along with considerable modifications of their relative motion.
Thus the gaseous spectrum of the nucleus is assigned to the same
impacts which throw out from the ranks those masses which form
the tail.
   Some of the most       wonderful of the singular phenomena           pre
sented by comets, such as       the almost sudden development of tails

554                Proceedings    of the Royal Society
of many millions of miles in length, the occurrence of comets with
many tails, and the observed fact that there is no definite relation
of direction between     a comet's  tail and its solar radius-vector, are
here looked upon as due to the differences          of motion of these dis
crete fragments relatively to the earth,           in a manner     somewhat
analagous     to the appearances    presented by a distant flock      of sea-
birds flying in nearly one plane, and only becoming visible (as a
long streak) when the plane of the flock passes approximately
through the spectator's eye. The so-called envelopes are compared
 with the curious phenomena         presented     by tobacco-smoke    (which
 seems, however, to be emitted     in  a  form   apparently resembling thin
 continuous films of small particles of carbon), and the so-called
 " gaseous jets," which                                   from the nucleus
                             appear to     be  projected
 and to be repelled from the sun, are not difficult of explanation
 from the general point of view here taken.
     The investigations are mainly conducted            by quaternions, and
 show how a group       of discrete masses,     so  small that their mutual
 perturbations are not of great moment, except in the case of actual
 impact, gradually changes its form as it revolves about the sun ;
 independently of any hypothesis as to the cause (planetary attrac
 tion or otherwise) by which it was first introduced into the solar
  system.
      The author had some hesitation in bringing forward this paper,
  as  he did not know how far Schiaparelli, whose recent discoveries
  have been so very novel and remarkable,          had carried his investiga
  tions.    The ideas here brought forward had occurred to him imme
  diately on his being made aware (more than two years ago) of the
  identity of the orbits of the August meteorites and of Comet II.,
  1862 : but they seemed so obviously to follow from that identity
  that it was only on reading Dr Tyndall's recent speculations, which
  seem to have been well received       ;  and on being informed by      Pro
  fessor Newton (of Yale Coll. U.S.A.) that the questions of tails,
  envelopes, and
                     " gaseous jets " had been treated by Schiaparelli
   as  proving the existence of a repulsive force (such      as seems to have
   been admitted    by Bessel   and others, who observed Halley's comet
   on the occasion of its last return), that he ventured        to produce  to
   the Society an explanation so apparently simple, yet so inconsistent
   with what appears to be held by the majority of astronomers.           The

mathematical part of the necessary investigations could hardly have
been made so simple          and   yet comprehensive     as   it now is had
quaternions    not been employed.
3.  Hegel and the Metaphysics of the Fluxional Calculus. By
     W. E. Smith, Esq. Communicated by Professor Tait.
                                  (Abstract.)
    The object of this paper is to consider the mathematical value
of Hegel's discussion of the fluxional calculus. This discussion,
as contained    in several notes in the " Logik," professes to evolve
the true principle     of the calculus in     a form free from the incon
sistencies   of the usual processes, and to show how this principle
may be rendered useful in the solution of problems.              To clear the
way for this new theory, Hegel engages in a sharp polemic against
the expositions of several       parts of the calculus given by Newton
and others.
    As these strictures on Newton have, at least in part, been re
ceived with great satisfaction by metaphysicians,           the paper seeks
 first to show that the notion on which Newton based his doctrine
of fluxions,     viz., the generation of magnitudes           by   continuous
 motion at definite (but not necessarily constant)            velocity, really
 has a place in nature.       If we  remember that Newton always views
 fluxions  as   a method     belonging to physics (kinematics), we shall
 find the whole developments        of his calculus to  be   thoroughly con
 sistent and simple.       It  is shown, however,    that Hegel, while he
 professes to approve    of Newton's fundamental notions, has         so com
 pletely misunderstood      the whole method as to propose to eliminate
 as  inessential the conceptions of movement and velocity, and then
 to blame Newton for attempting to use the calculus to do work for
 which it is fitted just because it is based on the notion of continuous
 movement.        Not only does it appear that Hegel has failed to
 appreciate   Newton's general principle, he seems also to have quite
 failed to understand     what mathematicians mean by a limit.             His
 strictures on the doctrine of limits are in no sense directed against
 any tenet of mathematicians,         but only against certain     absurdities
  which he supposes mathematicians to hold.         This especially appears
  in his inability to understand      what is meant by the evaluation      of  a

 556                        Proceedings of the Royal Society
 function which takes the form      but the most interesting point in
                                              % ;
the details of this part of Hegel's work is his criticism of Princip. ii.
lem. 2.        Hegel accuses Newton of an error in elementary                     algebra,
but in reality Newton's work is strictly accurate, and Hegel has
merely failed to see the point of the problem.  Hegel's own views
of the calculus were got from Lagrange, whose treatise, with all its
analytical skill, is yet             a   fruit of the very Aufkldrung            which in
other matters           Hegel especially opposes.               Mistaking the abstract
formalism of Lagrange's intrinsically                       erroneous     and now quite
abandoned           method      for superior generality,         Hegel still thinks it
possible      to reject       certain incumbrances that cling to Lagrange,
and which are in fact inevitable concessions                       to the physical view
of the calculus, without which the method could have no value.
     Absolutely identifying              analytical with algebraical method, and
thus freed from all the difficulties about continuity which occur in
the ordinary processes              of algebra, Hegel, of course, cannot appre
ciate these parts of Lagrange's work.                   He gives    a   simplified theory,
and       applies     it,   among    other things, to the problem             of drawing
tangents.    Hegel professes to deduce the correct rule, but he does
so   only by adopting an utterly false definition of tangent, which, a
in fact, gives        an infinite        number     of tangents at every point of          a
curve.       In     short, in this and other cases, Hegel makes errors                of   a
mathematical character               sufficient to show that his knowledge of
the calculus was absolutely worthless.

     In   papers which the authors have already communicated                       to this
Society, thej have shown that there exists                  a   very marked difference

between       the action  of   bases  containing   nitrogen   as a  triad and
those     in which that element is pentad. This result was obtained
from an examination of the physiological action of substances
having an unknown and complex constitution.                It  appeared to be
necessary to institute a series of experiments with bodies having a
simpler and fully known constitution.           For this purpose, the salts
of ammonia,        tri-methylamine,     and tetra-methyl-ammonium         were
selected.       A  comparison     of the structural formulae of the hydro-
chlorates of these bases shows that tri-methylamine             stands in the
same relation to the salts of tetra-methyl-ammonium as strychnia
to the salts of methyl-strychnium.
     The iodide of tetra-methyl-ammonium was prepared by mixing
iodide of methyl with an excess of ammonia dissolved in alcohol,
and      recrystallising   the   crystalline  precipitate from hot      water.
 From the iodide the hydrate was obtained             by the action of oxide
 of silver; and by     distilling the hydrate and conducting the vapours
 into hydrochloric acid, the hydrochlorate of tri-methylamine was
 obtained.
     In their   general physiological effects these substances very closely
 resemble      each other.     The most obvious       symptoms    which they
 produce are paralysis and slight muscular spasm            ; and when these
 symptoms        were carefully analysed,     by restricting the poisonous
 action to certain defined regions in frogs, it was ascertained that
 they are caused mainly by a direct action             on the cerebro-spinal
 nervous      system and on striated      muscles.    When large doses are
 given, the functional activity of these structures is first impaired
 and then destroyed ; but during the stage of impairment, a slight
 degree of spasmodic         action  is produced, which may probably be
 referred, in frogs, to the stage of irritation which precedes the final
 action of the majority of muscular poisons, and, in mammals, to this
 action, aided by changes in the vascular condition of the central
 nerve organs, due to an influence on non-striated muscles.
     The physiological effects of chloride of ammonium and of hydro-
 chlorate of tri-methylamine were found to be extremely similar,
  both    in degree and in kind, and to differ, in several important
 respects, from those of iodide         of tetra-methyl-ammonium.           The
  two former substances are comparatively feeble in their action          ;  the
  latter   is a poison of considerable     energy.   Chloride of ammonium

 558                Proceedings of the Royal Society
 and   hydrochlorate of tri-methylamine             develop    their full effects
sluggishly    ; but the different structures which they influence have
their activity destroyed         nearly simultaneously, so that           it  is a
 matter   of considerable    difficulty to ascertain whether the muscles
 are paralysed     before the     motor    nerves, or the latter before        the
sensory, or whether the nerve-trunks or periphery are first affected.
 Iodide of tetra-methyl-ammonium, however, very rapidly destroys
the conductivity of the motor nerves by an action on their peri
 pheral   terminations, and an interval of several hours may elapse
before its other effects are      fully developed.
     While the change of physiological action, produced by the addi
 tion of iodide of methyl to tri-methylamine, differs in some respects
 from that produced by the performance of the same operation upon
strychnia, the observations        now communicated         tend to confirm the
conclusion drawn from the previous               experiments of the authors,
that paralysis of the peripheral terminations of motor nerves is                  a
characteristic effect of the salts of the ammonium bases.
     The decomposition     of atropia by means of acids and bases has
lately been completely studied by Kraut* and by Lossen.f                         It
appeared of interest to examine the physiological actions of the pro
ducts of this decomposition,           and to compare       them    with that of
atropia.     The reaction may be expressed by the equation             —
                 C17H„NO,    +   H.0 =     C9H10Oa +     C„HI5NO
                  Atropia.      Water.    Tropic acid.    Tropia.
The tropic acid       is further changed          by loss of water      into two
isomeric    acids, atropic and       isatropic   (C9H6O3),    the former being
produced     most    abundantly in the presence of alkalies, and the
latter in the presence of acids. These substances were prepared by
the methods given by Kraut and by Lossen               ; and, on account of the
readiness with which the acids pass bv oxidisation into formic and
a toluic acids, the action of the latter acid, prepared by the method
which one of the authors communicated               to this Society some years
ago,J was also examined.
    Each of these substances has been examined              by the authors, and
it was found that none of them possesses the well-known dilating

action of atropia on the pupil.         The experiments were made with
the hydrochlorate     of tropia and with soda salts of each of the
acids.   Although, however, tropia differs        so   strikingly from atropia
in being quite unable to influence           the pupil, it resembles it in
some of its other physiological effects.         Like atropia, it is       a power
ful paralysing agent, and it produces paralysis in very much the
same way as atropia does.         In virtue of this action, tropia is an
active poison.
   Apart from     the   immediate     object    of these researches, some
interest is attached to this portion of the investigation on account
of its bearing on practical      therapeutics.       It  has been       shown by
Professor Garrod, that when small          quantities of caustic potash or
soda are added to solutions of hyoscyamus, stramonium, belladonna,
or atropia, the activity of these substances appears to be destroyed.*
More recently,   Dr John Harley, of London, has pointed out that
the same effect is produced by caustic             lime    and by ammonia.f
 This conclusion   was   arrived   at, principally, by observing that the
pupil   was  not affected by preparations         to which       they     had pre
viously added one or other of these alkalies.               The decomposition
effected by potash, soda,     lime,   and   ammonia,       is the same as that
which the authors have described; and by an examination of the
separate products of this decomposition they are enabled to confirm
the observation    of Drs Garrod and Harley, and to add to it the
additional fact that the products of this decomposition are not
altogether inert.
   The last portion of this paper, to which the authors think it
advisable to draw attention, is that in which they describe some
experiments    with the salts of methyl- and of ethyl-strychnium,
which were performed       subsequently to their first communication.
These additional experiments        were made with the view to establish
beyond the possibility of doubt, the truth of their statement,                  that
these substances act as simple       paralysers      of motor nerves.          In  a
paper recently communicated to the French Academy of Sciences,
two able observers, Messrs      Jolyet and Cuhours, have confirmed the
result that these substances possess an action analogous                to that   of
wourali (curara);   but they have, besides, observed symptoms which

560                  Proceedings      of the  Royal Society
induce them to believe that this analogy is not a very perfect                 one,
as the  methyl- and ethyl-derivatives of strychnia               seem    to retain
a certain degree      of the characteristic convulsant action of strychnia.*
They found their opinion on the appearance of tetanic spasms in
the limb of a frog, whose vessels had been ligatured before the
poisoning, and on the production            of coexisting paralysis      and con
vulsions in mammals poisoned by these substances.                   Both of these
effects are obviously explainable by the presence of              a  minute trace
of strychnia.        In    the case   of the frog with the vessels of one
limb tied, the methyl- or ethyl-strychnium salt paralysed                  all the
motor nerves to which it had access;                but as strychnia was also
administered,       by accident,   the excitability     of the spinal cord was
exaggerated,       and tetanic     spasms therefore      occurred    in the non-
poisoned     limb — its motor and sensory nerves being protected               from
the paralysing action of the methyl- or ethyl-derivative.                       The
appearance of strychnic effects           in mammals may likewise           be   ex
plained by the presence            of strychnia.       One of the     authors    has
shown,    in a paper communicated          to this Society,    that when     a  suf
ficient dose    of  a substance    that paralyses the terminations of motor
nerves is administered         to a frog along with a certain proportion          of
one that stimulates the spinal cord, the symptoms                    are those    of
paralysis alone; but when this combination is administered,                  in the
same relative proportions,        to a mammal,       the symptoms     are those   of
paralysis   coexisting with convulsions.f            This result is sufficient to
account for the different symptoms observed by Messrs Jolyet and
Cahours     on frogs and on mammals,              on the supposition      that the
methyl- and        ethyl-strychnium         salts   they employed       contained
strychnia.
   The authors have made           a number     of experiments which support
this supposition.         Several   specimens     of these salts, prepared by
them, were found to produce such complicated effects as the French
physiologists describe; but by carefully treating them a second
time with iodide of methyl or of ethyl they succeeded in removing
the convulsant action.         They have also treated       a specimen    of iodide
of ethyl-strychnium that produced strychnic effects, with iodide                  of
methyl, and thus obtained a substance whose action                  was   a purely

paralysing one.       They have, besides, added minute quantities of
strychnia to specimens of salts of methyl and of ethyl-strychnium
of perfect purity, and they found that the effects which were then
produced were exactly the same as those described by Messrs            Jolyet
and Cahours.       The correctness of the statements previously com
municated to this Society by the authors was thus established               in
the most undoubted       manner.
    In their first  experiments   with these strychnia derivatives,       and
especially with that formed by iodide of ethyl, the authors obtained
results similar to those described by Messrs Jolyet and Cahours ;
and they have been induced         to enter   thus fully into the subject
from the knowledge,       gained by their experience,     of the importance
as   well as of the difficulty of obtaining these bodies in a state of
absolute    purity.    This is apparent if it      be  recollected   that the
presence of 0"l per cent- of strychnia is sufficient to vitiate the
results of such      experiments.    It  was only after the authors       had
adopted precautions,      which seemed at first to    be perfectly unneces
sary, that they succeeded in eliminating this source of error, and in
obtaining their substances in      a state of physiological   purity.

 1.  On the Annual Range of Temperature over the Globe.
     By Mr Keith Johnston, jun.                 Communicated by Mr
     Buchan, Secretary of the Scottish Meteorological Society.
     (With a Plate.)
    The subject of range of temperature has been divided by meteor
 ologists into the two main heads of Diurnal and Annual range,
the former being measured by the variation of temperature between
the warmest and coldest       hours of the day, the latter     by the differ-

562                 Proceedings      of the Royal Society
ence of temperature        between     the warmest      and coldest months       of
the year.
    For   a  study of diurnal range we should require a series             of ob
servations for every hour of the day and night from all parts               of the
earth, and the places where such laborious observations                have been
made are as yet very few; but the returns of daily and                   monthly
temperatures      now obtainable     from all countries      are sufficient  for  a
tolerably complete study of the simpler head of annual range.
    It is believed that the subject of annual range has never before
been systematically worked out for any large portion of the               earth's
surface, though its general         conditions may have been recognised
from the comparison        of  a few isolated    points.
    In preparing     the charts of annual range now shown, it was             first
assumed that the months of          January and July       are  respectively the
coldest and warmest months of the northern, and the warmest                   and
coldest months of the southern hemisphere.               This proves to be the
case,  with few exceptions, in all parts of the earth, excepting those
near the equator, which have two maxima and minima;                      but the
annual range of temperature in these regions is so very small, that
the difference between the temperatures of January and July may
be taken as the measure         for every part of the earth where range is
considerable.      January and July temperatures were then collected
from all available sources, and their differences being taken, the
annual range of twelve hundred               places in all countries     was   ob
tained.     These figures were then set down on maps, on the positions
of the places of observation, and lines were drawn through those
which have an equal range, at intervals of ten degrees of increase,*
thus   presenting     the subject     in  a   graphic form.      The places      of
observation     in Europe    are so numerous       as to enable the   lines to be
laid down there with almost absolute precision.             Then the collection
of temperatures       throughout the United States, Mexico, and the
West Indies by Laurin Blodget, the returns               from Canada and the
Forts of the Hudson Bay Company, observations                 for  a long series
of years at the Danish stations             in Western Greenland, and the
   * In  the reduced chart which    accompanies this paper the lines of 10, 30,
50, 70, and 90 degrees   of range have, for the sake of clearness, been omitted,
but the course of these intermediate      lines  may perhaps be traced from the
description which follows.

                       of Edinburgh, Session 1868-69.                      563
 numerous     registers    of temperature     kept in vessels exploring the
 north-west     passage, complete     the   lines for North    America.     In
 Asia the observations         made at Russian government         stations   in
Siberia in the north, at the ports of China and Japan on the east,
at the   Dutch Colonies in the East Indies, and in British India on
the south,     give the direction of these lines with certainty.           For
Africa we have the returns of numerous French stations in Algeria
and Marocco,        from Egypt, from the colonies on the Guinea Coast,
from    Cape Colony and Natal          on the south, and a few checking
points from       the observations     of travellers in Central Africa and
Abyssinia.       In    South  America the ascertained      points  are fewest;
but observations       made at the ports on both sides of the continent,
from   Panama to Patagonia, those of Ross in the Falkland Islands,
a  collection   of temperatures in the Argentine Confederation           given
in the   work on that country by M. Mai tin de Moussy, along with
a  few isolated points in Brazil, enable the range lines to be drawn
here also    with confidence.       Lastly, for the coasts and south-eastern
part of the interior of Australia, and for New Zealand, we have a
large   number of observations made chiefly by the Colonial Govern
ment.      On the charts shown the parts of the earth's surface which
have    a  less annual range than 40° have been tinted in red, the
strength of the colour increasing as the              range diminishes;    and
those   regions which have       a greater range than 40° in blue, the depth
of colour increasing with the range.
    At the point where January and July, the coldest and warmest
months of the northern hemisphere, turn to January, the warmest,
and   July,   the coldest month of the southern hemisphere,          we find a
line passing       round   the globe on which there is no difference        be
tween the temperatures         of these two months.
    Starting from the first meridian           we find this zero line passing
along the Guinea Coast of Africa, through the centre of that con
tinent, bent northwards         by the table land of Abyssinia, and again
by the    Indian Ocean, entering India below Bombay and running
curiously down the line of the Western Ghauts to Cape Comorin ;
then by the south of Sumatra through Java to New Caledonia,
and    across the Pacific between the parallels of 10° and 20° south
latitude to the South American Coast, which it meets between lati
tude 5° and 10° south.          Now it    passes  northwardly along the line

56  1              Proceedings of the Royal Society
of the Andes to Quito, and curves round the whole north coast of
South America to beyond the mouth of the Amazon, then down
into the South Atlantic to include the island of Ascension, which
has a northerly range, and again       northwards to the 20th parallel
of north latitude, where it enters        the African    continent.    It is
observed that this zero line is very far from coincident with the
mathematical equator of the globe, and that the parts of it which
pass through the great land masses are in the northern hemisphere,
in Africa,   India,    and   South America, whilst those which pass
through the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans are carried far into the
southern hemisphere.
   The line of     10°  of range   in the northern hemisphere        passes
through the centre of North       Africa   above Lake Tchad, is carried
to the north by the influence of the Red Sea to beyond Djedda on
its east coast, round the west and south coasts of Arabia, through
Aden, and thence        to  India near the Gulf of Cutch.          Here it
reaches southward, taking the form of the peninsula, to beyond
Madras, then crosses the Gulf of Bengal to Further India,
passes round the coast of Cochin China and through the              Philip
pine Islands in latitude     10° north, then turning to the north-east,
keeps   in this direction through the Pacific        till it enters  North
America above the parallel of 40° north latitude           ; from that    it
turns down the coast of California       to near the south of   Mexico at
Vera Cruz, through the West Indies just to the northward of Cuba,
and across the Atlantic, with a northerly bend towards the          Azores,
to the African coast in latitude 25° north.
   The line of 20° range in the northern hemisphere is one of the
most interesting of all, since it shows in the most marked manner
the difference    of range between the west and east coasts of the
continents.    It  passes   through North Africa and Southern Asia,
carried to the north     at the Red Sea and Persian       Gulf, leaves the
east coast of Asia at Macao, near Hong-Kong,        in 15° north latitude,
runs well into the Pacific, keeping away from the Asiatic coast, and
reaches the American west coast in latitude 55° north, or 40°       further
to the north than where it left the Asiatic coast, then it turns
south to Mexico, across the north of the Gulf of Mexico to Florida,
leaves the east coast between latitude 25° and 30° north, then into
the Atlantic to the Bermudas, after which, bending due north-east,

it reaches as far as Iceland, and perhaps                  Spitzbergen, before turn
ing south to the Norway coast, again                   showing,      as   in the Pacific,   a
difference     of 40° in latitude between the same range on an east
and west coast.        From the coast of Norway, at Stavanger, this line
of    20° range   dips down into the North Sea, then rises northwards
along the coast of Scotland to Braemar                       in Aberdeenshire,          bends
thence to the west and south-west                   to between Glasgow and Green
ock,   then down the west coast of England by Liverpool and Chester,
and    Pembroke in South Wales, to Devonport on the coast of Corn
wall, then along the south                  coast   to the    Isle of Wight and the
Channel Islands, thus enclosing the main part of Great Britain
with a greater range than             Ireland, though the central and eastern
parts    of that island have         a range    of nearly     20°.    The difference        of
range between the south-east                 coast of England and the west coast
of Ireland is nearly          10°.
     The line of 20° range then passes along the west coast of France
and     Spain, bending completely round                  the south-west         and south
coastsof the peninsula, through Lisbon, Cadiz, and Gibraltar into
the Mediterranean, where it seems to form a great loop extending
to the east nearly as far as Alexandria (21° range), touching in its
return at Tunis, Algiers, and Oran in North Africa, and keeping
along this coast       as   far   as the    Atlantic shores of Marocco, where it
turns into the interior of Africa.
      The line of   30° range         runs through North Africa, Arabia, and
Southern Asia to the north of the line of                    20° range, and      parallel to
it,   excepting in Northern               India, where       it   forms   a   curious    bend
round the high mass of the Himalaya mountains, which appear to
have   less range than
         a                observed in the plain to the south of
                                     is
them.        Leaving    the       Asiatic    east coast,     a    little to the north of
Canton, the line of           30° range passes between the            Loo-Choo Islands
and     Japan, and thence north-easterly to the American coast, which
it    reaches just to the south of the peninsula of Aliaska.   It runs
southward  along the west American coast, close to the line of 20°
range, to near the 25th parallel of north latitude in Mexico; then
bending round, first north and then east, follows along the coast of
the Mexican       Gulf and through the Southern States to Charleston
on the       east coast   ;        turns north-east and north, away
                              from this      it

runs to the north-west of Iceland, and probably round Spitzbergen,
turns south again to the coast of Norway at Hammerfest, follows
down the whole west coast of Greenland, keeping near the head of
the numerous fiords with which its coast is intersected,                               whilst the
line of    20° range      falls just at their mouths            ;    through the Cattegat
and Eastern Denmark, leaving Copenhagen                             just to the east of it ;

France.       Here the range of the Pyrenees seems to cause a break —
the greater        elevation    having      a   smaller range — and to isolate the
portion of this line which              passes        round    the Spanish peninsula.
This separate portion of the line                passes    inland round the east                and
south     coasts of Spain, but          close      to the      north       and west coasts.
Taking up the main line again at Toulouse,          skirting the    we   find   it
Mediterranean coasts of South Fiance and Western Italy, through
Genoa, Rome, and Naples, but leaving the east coast of Italy to
cross the Adriatic          to Dalmatia.          A    second small isolated               part of
this line    is   found in the eastern part of the inland of Sicily, where
Catania, on the east coast (on an average of sixty years' observa
tions), has    a   range of 39°, whilst Palermo, on the north-west coast,
has but 25°.        From the Dalmatian coast the main line of                          30° range
turns to the south-east           nearly through the centre of Greece                           and
bends slightly north again in the Mge&n to near Smyrna.                                   A    third
isolated portion of this line          is   found in the south-east               of the Black
Sea,    passing     round      Trebizond        and along the coast of Caucasia.
From the iEgean             we find    this line running through Cyprus                           to
Syria, near Beyrout and Jerusalem, then turning west through the
isthmus of Suez, just south              of Cairo, and all along the north of
Africa, not far inland from the coast, numerous                                observations       in
Algeria, showing that its average distance from the                                  sea, in    that
country,     is   not more      than    20 miles.          On approaching the west
coast   it   bends first south     and then           east into the centre of North
Africa.
  At 40° of range the lines begin to keep to the land masses — no
part of the open ocean in any part of the globe having                                a   range of
more than 40°.            In North Africa        we find   a   large area of the Sahara
with this range, where the north part of the line 40° reaches                                     to

extends      probably south       to the 20th      parallel of north latitude.
Taking up the           line   in   Asia,   we   find it passing     completely
round    the   interior of Asia Minor, at no great distance from its
coasts, then through Damascus into Arabia, round the head of the
Persian Gulf, and through the Punjab, south of Peshawar,                  to the
table-land of Tibet          and    the   coast  of China,     near  Shanghae   ;
thence    it turns north-east through the Yellow Sea to Hakodadi,
in the north island of Japan, along the line of islands to the east
coast of Kamtchatka, near Petropaulovsk, across the Behring                  Sea
to Aliaska; thence down the west coast of America, close to the
lines of less range, to the 35th parallel of north latitude, where it
turns east across the continent to the west coast at Chesapeake
Bay   ; thence     it skirts the coasts of Nova Scotia, touches on New
foundland at St John's, and, taking a northern direction, reaches
the   Greenland coast near Disco Island.                 Carried south by the
influence of Greenland, it leaves the east coast, perhaps in the
latitude of Iceland, and stretches              thence    probably beyond the
North Pole, returning           to the islands of Novaia Zemlia, where
observation      at two points gives       a range    of only  39°.   From this
the line of 40° range keeps near the north coast of Russia, and
passes down        through the centre of the Scandinavian Peninsula,
by   Christiana       and   Gottenburg to Stockholm, is carried           north
wards into the         Gulf of Bothnia, then half way into the Gulf of
Finland to Helsingfors, along the coasts of the Baltic provinces,
and southwards         through central Europe to Vienna.            As we found
the chain of the Pyrenees breaking the line of 30° range, so here
we observe      that the range of the Alps isolates the part of this line
of  40°,   which marks out the plain of Northern Italy. Another
separate area, of above 40° range,           is observed in the valley of the
Ebro, in North-East Spain, and the heights of the Carpathians and
Transylvanian Alps form a third exceptional portion of this line,
since, though within the main line of 40°, they have a slightly less
range.      From Vienna the main line of            40° passes round the   Hun
garian    plain, through Turkey to the north of the Balkan range,
across the Black Sea south of the Crimea, into Trans Caucasia,
nearly   as  far as  Tiflis, and thence bends back again round the coasts
of Asia Minor.

    It  is doubtful whether an area of any great extent, of above 60°
 of range, is to    be found in Northern Africa, though one observation
 would    seem to show     that such does exist.        The observed range at
 Biskra, in the interior of Algeria, is 54° ; but since the observa
 tions at that station have not been made for any considerable
 period, no weight has been given to their indication.            We find the
 line of 50° range entering Europe at the north of Norway, passing
 south to the centre of the Peninsula, then turning east to the coast
 at Hernosand, bent north by the             Gulf of Bothnia to Carlo or the
 Finland coast, then turning south inland to near the Gulf of
 Finland, and again carried northward by the influence of the
great Russian lakes        ;  thence    it passes southward midway between
 Moscow and St Petersburg to near the north-west side of the Black
 Sea, where     it turns sharply to the eastward above the Black Sea
and the Sea of Azov, and along the northern side of the ridge of
the Caucasus to the Caspian.             Round this sea the line of 50° range
forms a loop which passes through the north-western part of the
sea,   but close to the remaining coasts, back to the south slope of
the Caucasus;        thence    it passes westward       through Erzerum    into
the interior of Asia Minor, curves round, and reversing its course,
turns back into Asia through Persia,                Tibet, and China to the
eastern     coast in the      Yellow Sea, through the Corea, Saghalien
Island, and Kamtchatka to the American coast at the mouth of
the Kwichpak River in Alaska ; thence southward into the interior
of the continent to beyond the Great Salt Lake, where it turns to
the east with two curious          bends, and is carried to the north round
the coasts of the great American lakes, only cutting off the north
west coast     of Lake Superior with a greater range.          It is curious to
observe that the three greatest inland sea and lake regions              in the
northern hemisphere, the lakes of European Russia, the Caspian Sea,
and the American lakes, have the same range of temperature ; and
that Fort-William, on the north-west coast of Lake Superior,                has
exactly the same range of          58°,   observed at Astrakhan   in the same
relative    position to the Caspian.         From the Canadian side of the
lakes    near Ottawa,       the  line of 50° range bends south into the
United States to      as far  as Albany in New York, then north-eastward
through New Brunswick              to the coast of Labrador, where three
stations     have this    range.     Keeping      still northwards,   it passes

through Davis Strait to nearly            as   far north on the West Greenland
coast at Upernivik,       then through Greenland and round the                     Arctic
Ocean, between North    America and Asia (Point Barrow on the
Arctic coast of North America having a range of 55°) to the Asiatic
coast, probably near the mouth of the Obi river, and thence                         along
the coast to the north of Norway, where we first took                     it up.
  The line of       60°   range, and those above            it,   are confined to the
Asiatic and American Continents, and may be called land lines.
Taking up the line of 60° of range in the north of European Russia,
we observe    it   making   a   bend to the north-west round               the town of
Krasnoiarsk (which has range of 65°) back again eastward to the
                                a
Ural Mountains beyond Ufa, then forming second western pro a
jection to   as far as    Kharkov, on the north of the Sea of Azov, then
passing back round the east side of the Caspian Sea, and sending
out a narrow tongue-like extension                  through Northern Persia and
the town of Urumiah towards Asia Minor, then returning eastwards
through   Central Asia to the south of the town of Hi in Eastern
Turkestan (62° range), through China, with   probable bend to the
                                                           a
southward, rising again to near Pekin and Tientsin, through Man
churia, near its coasts, to Port Ayan (60°), on the Sea of Okhotsk                      ;
thence this line seems to pass round                 the north-eastern      projection
of Asia, and to turn westward   through the Arctic Ocean, but not
far from the land, to the north of the Ural Chain, where   enters            it
Russia.
  In America, taking        up the line of 60° range at Port-Clarence on
the coast of Behring Strait, we find           it   passing down into the interior
to the east of British Columbia as far as Oregon, then following
the same curves as the line of 50° range through the centre                        of the
continent, to the north of the lakes, and bending round with the
coast in Eastern Canada and Labrador, northwards through                      Melville
Peninsula and Baffin Bay to Greenland in latitude                  75°   north. After
passing through Greenland           it   most probably bends backwards along
its north coasts and those of the islands of the Arctic Archipelago
to where we find proofs           of its existence in the westmost of these
islands, thence to the north coast of America, along which                   it    passes
south from    Point Barrow to Behring Strait.
 A   third area, which       we     find surrounded by      a   line of   60° range,   is
that in the north-east of Norway, in Lapland, and in the Kola

570                Proceedings of the Royal Society
Peninsula.      This line reaches as far south as Umea on the east
coast of the Gulf of Bothnia, and passes just to the west of Tornea,
at the head of the Gulf ; thence across to the White Sea, and
embracing the Kola Peninsula and the coast to westward of the
Waranger Fiord, to where it enters Norway.
   Beginning at Tobolsk in Siberia, we observe the line of 70° of
range    turning south-west        to Orenburg and      forming   a western
extension    into European Russia, north of the Caspian Sea, as far
as the Volga; thence round the north and east of the sea of Aral
(where Raimsk has a range of 69°), and probably south from this
into the deserts of Western Turkestan to the latitude of the south
of the Caspian Sea; thence north-east through Barnaul on the Obi
to the north of Krasnoiarsk on the Yenisei River (which has a range
of 63°); south again through Irkutsk on the west side of Lake
Baikal, probably to the northern frontier of China-proper, enclosing
the desert of Mongolia        ;  then north-eastward,   taking the general
direction of the coast to near Okhotsk (66° range).              Afterwards
bending round parallel with the line of 60° range this line must
keep along near the north coast           of Asia, re-entering the land at
the Obi river and following along the east side of the Ural chain
to where we found it first, at Tobolsk.
   The American line of         70° range   passes nearly parallel with that
of  60° from near the coast at      Behring Strait into the continent past
the south    end of Lake Winnipeg,          and thence   has most probably
an extention into the mass of land             to the west of Labrador, but
avoiding the     sea  till it returns   to the west coast of Hudson Bay,
which it crosses near Fort- York          ; from this  it passes north-east
through Southampton Island and Boothia to where Kane wintered
in Smith Sound, probably extends thence into Greenland, and
turns back from there to Melville Island and Banks Land, through
which it   passes  south-west     into the mainland of America.     A  small
and remarkable      area in the north-east of Norway has also a range
of above   70°.    It extends from Enontekis (73° range) in the centre
of Lapland on the south, to beyond Wardo, on the east coast of
Norway, which latter place has a range of 78°.
   From Tara, in the government of Tobolsk in Siberia, the Asiatic
line of 80° range passes eastward to the north of Lake Baikal, and
then south between that lake and the town of Chita, which has a

range 85°, probably far into the desert of Mongolia, then north
eastwardly    parallel with the lines of     70° and 60° range,   but further
inland to the north of Nijnie Kolymsk (85° range), and along the
north coast westwardly to beyond the mouth of the Lena, where it
probably re-enters      the continent, and passes south-west           through
the government of Tobolsk to Tara.              The observing stations        on
the chain of lakes     in America which stretch north-west from Lake
Winnipeg, have all       a less range   than 80°  till we arrive at the most
northerly, the Great Slave lake, whose north coast at Fort Confi
dence has this range      ; but two belts of country, one on each side        of
this lake-region, appear to have       a range   of upwards of   80°.    These
two belts unite at the north of the Great Slave lake, and stretch
out thence westwards         into Alaska territory, and eastward      as  far  as
Victoria Land and Boothia.          A solitary observation of    93°  of range,
on the Yukon river in the centre of Alaska territory, might             justify
the enclosing of a small area in that region as having a range of
above 90°, and this is certainly the part of the American continent
which has the greatest range.
    In Asia, the area which has          a greater  range than 90°, proba
bly extends     in Siberia from the Yenisei river        on  the west to the
Stauovoi range of mountains in the east, and from near the north
coast (where at Ust Yansk we find a range of 92°) to the Yablonoi
range    in the south.        The  town    of Chita to the south of these
mountains has      a range     of 85°.   A smaller   area in the interior of
this one must be surrounded by         a  line of 100° of range.     Near the
centre    of this terrible region is Yakutsk, the point of the earth's
surface which has the greatest range of temperature, whose climate
undergoes a change         between   the months of      January and July of
the fearful amount      of 106 degrees.
    In the Southern Hemisphere of range, the line of 10° seems to
enter North Africa on the west coast not far north of Cape Colony, and
to extend northwards into the centre of the continent to the north
 of the equator at Gondokoro on the Nile (whose January tempera
 ture is 11° above that of July), with a further extension towards
 the plateau   of Abyssinia, since observations made by the traveller
 Bruce at Gondar give the January temperature at that place 8°
above that of     July.     From this the line of      10° of range seems to

with   a   slight bend to the northward south of the islands of St
Denis and Bourbon, both of which have              a range   of  8°, to the south
coast of Australia at Adelaide          ; from this, turning westward again,
it runs along the south and west coasts, till, entering the latter coast
about latitude 20° south, it crosses the north of the continent below
the   Gulf of Carpentaria into the Pacific, passes thence between
New Caledonia and New Zealand, across the Pacific to the coast of
South America southward of Valparaiso (9° range) ; thence it runs
northwardly along the west coast of the continent to near Lima in
latitude    12° south, bends up       into the interior of the country, and
crosses it in a general south- east direction to the east coast on the
north of Rio de Janeiro (13° range), and finally                 passes   over the
Atlantic south-eastwardly to Africa.
   The line of     20° range    in the southern hemisphere is divided into
three parts.      The coasts of South Africa have nowhere an observed
range of more than 16°; but in the interior an area showing                slightly
more than 20° of range extends from near the coasts of Cape
Colony inland to perhaps 10° or 15° south latitude. Within
Australia a line of 20° range passes from near Perth in Western
Australia      along    the  south    coast,  then close     to the     east coast
(Brisbane and Newcastle showing 20° and 19° of range), and across
the continent again westwardly near the parallel of 20° south
latitude.      The third line of        20° range    enters the     west coast    of
South America        in about latitude 40° south, passes north near the
coast to 25° south latitude, turns inland round the northern bound
aries    of the Argentine Confederation and Paraguay, and then
curves round       south    and south-west     to Monte Video on the east
coast  ;    thence    it runs due south, round the Falkland                Islands,
which have        a range     of   16° to 18°,   crosses   the    ocean    towards
the Cape of Good Hope, and thence east to New Zealand,                      passing
through the south-eastern          parts of both its islands, and from that
over the Pacific to South America.
   A line of      30°    range   follows close upon that of 20° in south
Australia, and is probably confined to the southern half of the con
tinent.      In South America the range line of 30° passes along the
west coast, perhaps from Cape Horn, northwards                  into the Argen

north, returning thence perhaps outside the east coast.
     The central and eastern parts of Patagonia have the highest
range      in the southern          hemisphere,           and this does not exceed 40°;

     The lines of equal yearly temperature                             over the          globe, or the
annual isotherms,            are    sometimes termed               "climate lines," and one
is very apt to imagine that every place which lies under the same
isotherm has the same climate, which is by no means the case.
With a view to showing the variation of range in those parts of the
earth which have the                 same mean annual temperature,                              six of the
annual isotherms have been opened out,                            as   it were, on each side of
the meridian of Greenwich, and the amount of range for each point
of these lines has been projected vertically above  giving remark                 it,
able curves, of which the one shown beneath the chart of the annual
isotherms* which accompanies this paper                            is   a   sample.
     On the isotherm of  in the northern hemisphere,
                                   10°                    observed                       it   is
that the range may vary from 30° in the Arctic Ocean to above 100°
in Eastern Siberia, near Yakutsk.    The mean range on this iso
therm       is   65°.
     The isotherm of 20° has also mean range of     a                         65°,       but may have
as   little as 25° in the Arctic Ocean, and as much                            as       100° in Asia.
     On the isotherm of 30°, or nearly                    a     mean annual temperature of
the freezing point, the range                       may vary from            below        20°      between
Greenland and Norway, to above                            90°    in Eastern Asia, the mean
range on this line being                 60°.
     The isotherm of 40° shows                  a   variation of range of from less than
20° in the Atlantic Ocean south                     of Iceland and in the North Pacific,
to above 80° in Mongolia;                  whilst the mean range                   is   47°.
  The line of 50° of mean annual temperature has mean range of                     a
41°; but this varies between 20° in the west of Ireland, to above
80°      in Asia.
     On the isotherm of            60° we find        a   mean range         of   40°, but         only   10°
in the Pacific, and above 70° in Central Asia.
     From these curves then,               it   is   evident that hardly any two regions

cently revised by Mr Buchan.

 574                 Proceedings of the Boyal Society
 having an equal mean temperature, even though of small extent,
 and at a very        short distance          from one another,          have    an equal
 amount      of range, and that the places on the earth's surface in
 which these two conditions of equal mean annual temperature and
 equal annual range are the same, are very few and far between.
    Again, to show the variations of range in the same latitude,
 some of the parallels of the northern hemisphere have been opened
 out, as the isotherms          were in the former instance,               on both sides
 of the first meridian, and the range on each point projected up
 from these as before, giving curves analagous to that shown below
 the southern hemisphere of the accompanying range chart.
    One of the peculiarities shown by the curves thus produced, is that
 of the smallness of the range on            seas and lakes, and the great amount
 on the land surface of the globe, as also the very immediate                              in
 crease of range from some coasts towards the interior of the land. But
 by far the most interesting and curious feature                      presented       by this
 diagram, or indeed by the whole subject, is that of the difference in
 the amount of range on the opposite coasts of continents and                            seas.
    In    the temperate      regions,      and even to some distance                 beyond
 these into the torrid zone and the arctic regions, the range on coasts
facing     west is invariably      less   than that     of  coasts  facing    east,    in   the
 same latitude, and      this holds good not only in the              case   of great     seas
 and land masses, but also on the shores of inland seas and lakes.
     The comparison of the range at a few places in the same latitudes,
 but on the opposite coasts of the continents, given in the following
 tables, may serve to show the great amount of this difference.

     The difference        of range on these coasts, determined                   as    before
 from the range lines, is again 25°, the same amount as we obtained
 for North America, thus establishing a close agreement                          in the re
 lations of the coasts of these two continents.
     The mean difference           between    the east and west coasts of that
 portion of North        Africa which falls in the temperate regions is                    10°,
 the Red Sea coast having that amount                      of range more than               the
 Atlantic coast.
     In   South America we find Valparaiso in latitude 33° S. on the
 west coast, with a range of only 9°, and in latitude 35° S. on the
east coast we have Monte Video and Buenos                          Ayres, with ranges
of 21° and          25°,  thus showing        a   difference      between      the coasts
at this point of 14°.             The range lines give             a   mean difference
of   12°.
    Observations       on the west coast of South Africa, in the temperate
region, are entirely wanting; but since the line of no                     January and
July      range     falls 10° of latitude farther to the south                        in the
Atlantic on the west, than it does on the east coast, where it just
reaches the equator, we may perhaps assume that the west coast of
South      Africa has also     a less range than the east, probably                amount
ing to     5°.
    In   the temperate regions of South Australia the range lines give
a mean difference          between the coasts of 10°, the range on the east
coast again predominating to this amount.

  576               Proceedings of the Royal Society
     Taking   a mean    of all these differences, we find that, in     the tem
  perate regions   of  the globe, the west coasts   of the continents have 15°
  less range than the east coasts, and we have seen        that this difference
  may rise to above 40°.
     An examination of the ranges on the coasts of inland             seas, and
  even lakes, leads to the same general conclusion.
     In   the  Mediterranean       the   following   places — Alicante    (30°),
  Valencia (40°), Barcelona (30°), Perpignan (36°), Montpellier           (36=.,
  Catania (39°), and Athens (38°), on east facing coasts, give a mean
  range    of 36°;   whilst Oran      (21°), Algiers    (21°), Palermo    (25°),
  Naples (29°), Rome (30°), Corfu (28°), and Beyrout (28°), give a
  mean of 26° for the west facing coasts, or a difference of 10° be
 tween the two.
     The mean of Odessa (47°) and Constantinople (33°) gives 40° of
 range for the east facing coast of the Black Sea ; and Trebizond
 (29°) and Redut Kale in Caucasia (31°) give 30° as the range of
 the west facing coast     ; again showing a difference of 10° less on the
 latter coast.   On the east facing coast of the Caspian Sea, taking
 the observations    at Astrakhan and Lenkoran (58° and 42°), we have
 a mean of 50°, whilst Novo Petrovsk, the only observing station on
 the west facing coast, has 47°     of range   ; Fort William (58°) and Bay
 City (55°) give 56°     as the   mean range of the east facing coast of
 Lake Superior; and Michipicoten, in the centre of its             west  facing
coast, has only 46° of range, again showing a difference of 103.
    The causes of this uniform predominance           of range on east coasts
over west, might form an interesting subject for investigation.             On
no two continental coasts do we find             exactly the same prevailing
conditions of winds and currents, much less of elevation and
form, so that the explanation of this phenomenon must rather
be looked for in a special combination of these influences for each
individual    coast, than     in any one cause acting over the           whole
earth's surface.
    The lines of equal range are formed between different January
and July temperatures in different parts of the globe.           To show the
manner in which these equal range lines move up and down the
thermometer     scale in their passage round the earth, a few           of the
range lines in the northern hemisphere have been opened out, as
the isotherms were before, on each side of the meridian of Green

                      of Edinburgh, Session 1868-69.                               577
wich.     The curved lines thus obtained, and of which                a specimen      is
given under the northern hemisphere of the range chart, show the
fluctuations of the temperatures forming the range lines of these
amounts     ;    the upper     line shows        the  July,    and the under line
parallel to it the January temperatures,                   according to the scale
shown at the side of the lines.
     From this      we observe      that the line of       60° range    lies between
the temperatures         of  30°  Fahr. in January, and 90° Fahr. in              July
at its maximum,        in Persia, and between —20° Fabr. and + 40° Fahr.
in Baffin Bay at its minimum.
     The line of 50° of range, again, has its maximum in Central Asia
between 40° Fahr. in January and 90° Fahr. in July, and its
 minimum in the Arctic Sea between                   — 15°  Fahr. in January and
  + 35°  Fahr. in     July.
     Forty degrees of range stands           highest on the temperature        scale in
 Arabia and        Persia    between      95° Fahr. in       July,  and     55° Fahr.
 in   January; and is at its       lowest   point between —5° Fahr. and +35°
 Fahr. in the Arctic Sea.
     The line of     30°  of range has its maximum in Central Africa                 be
 tween 95° Fahr. and 65° Fahr.              in  July  and January,     and its mini
 mum between         + 5°  and 35° in the North Atlantic.
     Lastly, the line of 20° of range is at its highest temperature                   in
 Central Africa between            95° Fahr.        and  75° Fahr.     in   July    and
 January, and at its lowest in North Norway between 47° and 27°
 Fahr.     The next lowest temperatures on the line of 20° fall in the
 British Isles, between        38°  in January and 58° in JulyatBraemarin
 North Scotland, and 42° in January and                 62°  in July   at Ventnor in
 South England.
     The points on these lines which pass through the same iso
 therms, or whose January and July temperatures are at the same
 heights on the scale, have,           so  far   as regards   temperature,     exactly
 the same yearly climate.             Thus, on the line of         60°   of range we
 may compare Minnesota in the United States with South Russia                           ;
 on the line of 50° range, the Great Salt Lake region,                    in America,
 with the Caucasus in Europe; and the east coast of China in Asia,
 or the American Lake district, with that               of North Russia.        Again,
 on the     line of 40° range,          Newfoundland         has exactly the same
  climate     as   the   Baltic provinces         of Russia,    and    the coasts of

578               Proceedings of the Royal Society
Kamtschatka may be compared with those of North Norway, or
Hakodadi in Japan with Vienna in Austria.
    On the 30° range  line we find the north coasts of British Columbia
comparable with those of North Norway,           Paris with Fort Vancouver
 in Oregon, and the south of Spain with the north of Mexico; and
lastly, on the 20° range line, Macao Island near Hong Kong in
China with the same climate        as  Florida in America.
    A point worthy of   notice, but for the establishment of which few
data are as yet to be had, is that of the apparent              diminution of
range on elevated     parts of mountains        or mountain chains.          The
 best authenticated   example     of this is that presented by the Alps
of Switzerland.     Observations for ten and twenty years at the St
Gothard and St Bernhard hospices, at elevations                of above 6000
feet, give a range    of only   27°   for each, whilst the plain of Italy
to the south has a range       of upwards of     40°.     This diminution for
elevation is also observed in stations        in the Pyrenees,      the Tran-
sylvanian Alps, and the Himalayas.
    By the aid of these charts of annual range we can at once predicate
of any point of the earth's surface whether it has a uniform and even
climate, or an extreme one, or what precise place it holds between
these limits.    These charts may thus        be of considerable      utility in
themselves, but it is when      taken as companions        to the annual iso
thermal charts, that they have their highest value.                  From the
isothermal   chart we may find that any required place has a certain
mean yearly temperature      ;  but we have no means of ascertaining
from  it how far the temperatures of its coldest month may descend,
or how high its warmest month may ascend the thermometer                   scale.
Again, from the      range chart      taken   by   itself, we can only tell
that the climate of the place in question is limited to a certain
number of degrees, without being able to say what position these
degrees occupy in respect to heat and cold.             But let the charts be
used in company,       and then     we   may    have    all that is required.
First, from the one chart find the mean annual temperature of the
place, and from the other its annual range            ;  then, since  the mean
annual temperature of places in        the temperate    and arctic regions of
the globe corresponds very closely with the midway point between their
January and July temperatures — if the one-half of the amount of
the range be placed above and the other half below the mean annual

                        of Edinburgh,       Session 1868-69.                           579
temperature          on the thermometer       scale, we have at once the tem
peratures         of the warmest         and coldest    months,   and       the yearly
temperature          of the place,   a   knowledge sufficient for almost every
purpose.          This is best illustrated by an example.          If we      take from
the isothermal chart the mean annual temperature                       of Paris, we
find     it            other chart its annual range is 30°; then
              52°, and from the
the mean annual temperature plus the half of this range gives 67°,
the      July,    and the mean annual minus            half of the range,       37°,   the
January temperature of Paris.
     In conclusion, it is submitted          that the chart of annual range is
a   useful companion to the isothermal chart, and that used together
these two form a very complete                guide    to the temperature        of the
globe.*
    2.   Note on Electrolytic Polarisation.                 By Professor Tait.
     The following note refers to some experiments instituted at the
request of        Mr Dewar, who asked me to determine the polarisation
of the Palladium electrodes whose singular behaviour he recently
described to the Society.
     I                    of Sir W. Thomson's most recent forms
         had just obtained one
of quadrant electrometer, and it occurred to me that this must be
the proper instrument for determining                  polarisation,   as    its indica-
cations are not affected by electric resistance,              and give directly —
that      is,   without assuming the truth of Ohm's law for reverse elec
tromotive         forces, and the consequent          necessary determinations          of
resistance — the quantities required.                 The method       employed         by
Wheatstone, Poggendorff, Buff, and others, assumes that the whole
electromotive force in the circuit    the algebraic sum of those
                                                is
of the decomposing          battery and of the electrodes,        — an      assumption
whose truth some may consider                 to require proof, and which          it   is
certainly useful to verify by an independent process.                       Again, after
   * The author has much pleasure in returning his best thanks to Mr Buchan,
the Secretary of the Scottish Meteorological Society, for much assistance in
the preparation of the materials for the chart, and for placing at his disposal
a large private and unpublished collection of temperatures in all parts of the
globe.

580                       Proceedings of the Royal Society
the decomposing            action has ceased, the resistance     of the films (of
gas or oxide) which are deposited on the electrodes may change in
value.  That neither of these circumstances produces any marked
effect    is,     amply proved by the numbers which follow,
                however,
which, though given only as first approximations, are within the
limits of difference of the results given (from galvanometric deter
minations) by former experimenters.
  The experiments were all made in my laboratory, mainly under
my own direction, but sometimes under the eye of my assistant,
Mr W. R. Smith.               Able assistance was rendered by several of my
practical students,         — two months     ago by Messrs Russell Smith and
J.   C. Young, more recently by Messrs Browning and                    Nichol.
     As the polarisation in most cases diminishes with very great
rapidity from the instant of breaking contact with the decomposing
battery, and as (for this and other reasons) the mode of measure
ment by the first swing of the index-needle of the electrometer                     is
not deserving             of much   confidence,   it   was necessary    to devise   a
process        by   which the electrometer        could   be charged at     leisure up
to any desired potential, and then, for an instant only, placed                     in
connection with the electrodes.              The apparatus    I   employed       bears
a certain analogy to the wippe of Poggendorff, but differs from                     it
in some essential            particulars, both of construction and mode of
working.
     In   a   plate of vulcanite, or other good insulator, ten holes are cut
as below, and         filled with mercury.        Those marked   E   are connected
with pairs of opposite quadrants of the electrometer,     with the      P
electrodes,          B,
                with the decomposing battery, and        with the      Bs
auxiliary (or charging) battery. Also metallic connection, as indi

                        of Edinburgh,               Session 1868-69.                             581
cated in the sketch,                is permanently established                between the two
central holes and the holes connected with the electrometer.
   The rocker consists of four wires, supported on an insulating bar
of vulcanite, the two outermost having three points, the middle
one longer than          the others, and the two inner being similar, but
wanting one of the extremities.                       When the four middle stems dip
vertically into the four central mercury cups, the other stems do
not reach the mercury in any of the other six cups.                                If the   instru
ment be inclined to the right                       the four prongs enter the holes to
the      right — thus simultaneously connecting the electrodes with the
decomposing         battery,            and   the    electrometer        with     the     charging
battery.       When the instrument inclines to the left, the electrodes
are shunted  from the decomposing battery on to the electrometer, —
the latter having just before, by the same action, been cut off from
the charging battery, and thus left charged.
   The modus operandi is simply this : — Leave the rocker leaning to
the right by its own gravity, decomposition and polarisation going
on   ;   adjust the wires   different points in a wet string (or a
                                    B4 to
narrow canal of water) closing the circuit of the charging battery ;
work the rocker quickly to the left, and allow it instantly to fall
back again, — a process which need not occupy more than a small
fraction of    a second        ;    yet which must not be performed too quickly,
on account of the inertia (small as it      of the needle and mirror
                                                          is)
of the electrometer.               If
                       the deflection of the electrometer be suddenly
increased      or diminished by this action, slide one of the wires                                B4
along the wet string,               a    little farther from or nearer to the other,
and      rock again, —continuing              this process   till   a   charge    is   found which
leaves the electrometer                 at rest when the rocking to and fro                 is   per
formed.       Reverse      a   commutator           attached to the wires          E,   and repeat
the operation.          The difference of the scale readings in these two
cases gives    a   number proportional to the electromotive                            force of the
polarised     plates   — (I        say difference, because          the    scales commonly
used with Sir       W. Thomson's instruments are, to avoid confusion,
graduated      from one end to the other,                 as they       ought to        be, instead
of being graduated                 opposite    ways from the middle).                   To enable
this measure to be reduced to absolute units,                             a   normal Daniell's
cell was applied at intervals, during each day's work, directly to
the electrodes         of the electrometer,             then reversed         ;   and the    differ

582                  Proceedings of the Royal Society
ence of the readings was tabulated as representing                    its electromotive
force.
     In   the   earlier experiments      I   used a plate        of gutta-percha in
which the ten holes were bored, but for a time discontinued its use
on suspecting       that it sometimes         led to irregular working              of the
apparatus by imperfect insulation.  The cups were then separately
mounted on insulators three inches high, but this was not found to
be an improvement of any consequence;                     and the holes are now
made in a small, but thick, plate            of vulcanite.
     In this    note the numbers presented must be looked upon only as
first approximations;         but the apparatus          has now        been carefully
constructed       by an instrument maker,           and    Mr Dewar has begun
an elaborate series        of experiments         with   it,   from which valuable
results    may soon be expected.             In   the trials which have as yet
been made we employed          a    temporary     apparatus,         rudely built up of
wires, sealing-wax, and gutta-percha.               We have rather been endea
vouring to determine whether the process, complicated                         as   it   is   by
the inertia of the movable          part of the electrometer, the quickness
with which the rocking can             be conducted,       and the rate at which
the polarisation begins to diminish as soon as the polarised                            plates
are detached        from   the decomposing         battery,     is   capable of being
made to give good results, than in actually attempting to get such.
So far as  I     can yet see, the first of these complications                     is   alone
likely to cause any serious embarrassment; and should such be the
case, which    do not anticipate,
                I                  form of experiment
                                         a             little more        a
laborious than that above described, and which                 I     have already once
or twice tried, seems to       be   well adapted to meet it.
     The following are, for the most part, means of                   a   great number
of determinations.          The electrolyte was usually dilute commercial
sulphuric acid,      1   part acid to 10 of water; and to the lead and
other impurities      it   was found    to contain, we may ascribe the fact
t   hat the results were not very accordant from day to day, so that                         it
was not easy to decide how to take the means.                    Mr Dewar           is    now
working with substances chemically pure, and obtains much                                more
constant results.
  The unit employed        the electromotive
                               is             force of an ordinary
Daniell's cell. The Grove's cells used in the electrolysis had (very
constantly) an electromotive force about 1-74 times as great.

 3.    On the Causes               of Volcanic Action. By Joseph John
   Murphy, Esq.                   Communicated by Dr Wyville Thomson.
  In offering         these remarks                    on the causes of volcanic action,                                   I
take     it    as   proved        that volcanoes                     are in communication with                               a
reservoir of heat, occupying the centre                                    of the earth                   :   which heat,
however, the earth            is   gradually, though very slowly, losing; partly
by volcanic eruptions,                 partly by hot springs,                                and partly by the
slow conduction of heat towards the surface through the strata.
I      also take     it   as proved,                  that the earth                is   not fluid but solid

584                Proceedings of the Royal Society
throughout     ; or, at least, that its solid crust is of such thickness
that the earth is to     be regarded       for all purposes as      a   solid body.
Consequently the production of lava— that is to say, the liquefac
tion from heat of a small portion of the solid mass of the earth — is
a  strictly local occurrence     ;   this is sufficiently proved by the well-
known fact, that the lava stands at different levels in different
volcanic craters, even when they are in eruption at the same time,
and very near        each  other   :   as  in the     case  of Mauna-Loa          and
Kilanea, in Hawaii (Scrope on Volcanoes, p. 262), which would be
impossible if there were any free hydraulic communication between
the different reservoirs      of lava.       The strata at great depth, not
withstanding their intense         heat, are kept solid, as we have every
reason to believe, by the pressure of the superincumbent                 strata, and
their liquefaction     in particular      places,  producing lava, is      due, as  I
shall endeavour to prove, to local relief from pressure.
   Darwin has brought forward what appears to be nearly con
clusive evidence for believing that active volcanoes are to be found
only in areas that are undergoing elevation.                  To quote his own
words   : —
   "It    may,   I  think, be considered          as  almost    established,     that
volcanoes are often (not necessarily always) present in those areas
where the subterranean motive power has lately forced, or is now
forcing outwards the crust of the earth, but that they are invariably
absent    in those where the surface has lately subsided or is still
subsiding." — Darwin on Coral Islands,             p. 142.
   It  appears to be generally taken for granted             that the expansive
force of the earth's internal heat is the motive power that produces
elevation,   and also volcanic action.          In this   theory, however, there
is a difficulty which is not,        I  think, generally perceived.          At the
beginning of geological time, the earth must have been sufficiently
cooled down to permit the formation over its surface               of  a cold   solid
stratum.      The lower strata are not hotter now than they were
then, and may perhaps be sensibly colder, as they are constantly,
though very slowly, parting with heat.              If, then, the temperature of
the lower strata, millions of ages ago, was low enough                 to permit a
cold solid crust to form above them,              how can it now, when it has
not risen, be high enough to raise up that crust in upheavals, and
break through it in eruptions?             It seems almost a contradiction to

                     of Edinburgh,         Session 1868-69.                   585
 think this possible.        To use a familiar illustration: —When an
 iron casting is cooling in the sand, and, of course, like the earth,
 cooling from the surface       ;  when once the cold hard crust begins to
form, the greater heat of the interior has no tendency whatever                 to
break through the crust.             Were there no other force to upheave,
 or break   through the earth's crust,           I do   not believe the internal
heat could    ever do    it.    I   have now to state how         I  believe such
actions are brought about.
    The earth is cooling, and         as it cools it must contract.       But this
is true only of the deeper strata : the surface is cooling and con
tracting no longer. But the surface, by reason of its weight, is
clinging round the centre.
    The earth is     a sphere,    whereof the centre is contracting, while
the surface    clings to the centre and yet cannot contract.                What,
then,   will necessarily     follow?       The same that happens when an
apple contracts, while its skin clings to           it and yet cannot contract —
the surface will form wrinkles, rising in some places and sinking in
others.            I
           This, believe, is the explanation of those gradual move
ments of elevation and subsidence, which, as we know, have taken
place everywhere,       and are now going on at least over extensive
areas.     But the formation of mountain chains having axes of
igneous rocks, and of volcanoes, needs further explanation.
    Over areas of elevation          the superficial strata     are,  in a slight
degree, being lifted      up; over areas of subsidence they are, in an
equal degree, being forced down.              When they are lifted up, there
will be  a  diminution of pressure on the lower strata.                (This may
be made evident by considering that              if  the upper strata were lifted
up into an arch, which, however, is probably impossible, they would
not press on the lower strata at all.) A diminution of pressure on
the lower heated strata will cause them to melt into lava, expand
ing at the same time (igneous rocks, in the act of melting, expand
by from a ninth to a third of their volume when unmelted —
Bischoff, quoted in Scrope             on Volcanoes, p. 44), and the same
cause   will make their imprisoned vapours expand.                (For the exist
ence of these vapours, see Scrope on Volcanoes, p. 56.)                       This
action   probably begins suddenly,             as   soon   as the  diminution of
pressure is sufficient to permit the rocks to begin to melt.               In this
 way, as  I  believe, the igneous        axes of mountain      chains   have been

586                 Proceedings of the Boyal Society
thrust up.       Two causes there are which             so operate — the    general
subsidence       of the crust of the earth, thrusting it in particular
places over regions of elevation, into huge anticlinal wrinkles, and
the expansive force of the heat from below, when once liberated by
local relief from pressure.       The former,      as   I have    explained above,
is what determines          igneous     in any particular place; the
                                        action
latter accounts for all violent action, such as highly inclined and
overturned       strata;   without it there would be no mountains, but
only gentle elevations.
  A    volcano is formed      whenever       the igneous        matter from below
either forces its way to the surface, or (what is perhaps a possible
case) has way made for it through a crack in the superficial strata,
formed    as they bend       into wrinkles.      But the fact that volcanoes
are found only in regions of elevation,           proves to my mind that the
first determining cause of volcanic action is the elevation, causing
local relief from pressure, and enabling the solids and vapours to
expand from the heat they contain.
  Proof has been found of the existence of active and recent
volcanoes    in the heart of the Asiatic and North American con
tinents   (see    Scrope on Volcanoes,       pp. 405, 453), but they are very
much more numerous on islands and coasts.                     There must    be some
reason for this, and,      I believe,    the reason     is,   that the ocean   is   the
great agent of denudation          and deposition; consequently             changes
in the weight pressing on the various positions of the bed of the
ocean are constantly taking place, and such changes cannot fail to
cause changes in the limits of the areas               of elevation and subsid
ence, and to produce irregularity in the           wrinkling action     ;   and the
more  of such changes and irregularities there are, the more multi
plied will be the chances of local diminution of pressure sufficient
to cause volcanic action.             Over   great continental areas, on the
oontrary, the wrinkling actionwill be undisturbed, and will go on
for the most part more evenly, though     will still produce igneous
                                                  it
action in some cases.

4. Preliminary Note on the Antagonism between the Actions
   of Physostigma (Calabar Bean) and Belladonna. By Dr
   Thomas K. Fraser.
                                    (Abstract.)
   In  this paper the author described          a number      of observations
which appear to demonstrate that the fatal action of certain doses
of physostigma may be prevented by the administration of atropia.
   The following       plan was adopted for the investigation :— After
the minimum fatal dose of each poison had been approximately
determined    for rabbits and dogs of different weights, a fatal dose of
one of the poisons was administered along with a certain dose of
the other, and,    if  death   did not result, the same animal was sub
sequently   killed by     a  dose  of one of the poisons equal to or less
than that given      in the combination.
   To illustrate the general character of the results, the following
experiments,     among others, were described      : —
   Experiment     1. — A   solution of four grains of sulphate of atropia,
in twenty minims of distilled water, was injected under the skin at
the left   flank of    a   young rabbit, and, immediately afterwards, a
solution of   0"5 gr.   of physostigma, in fifteen minims of distilled
water, was injected under the skin at the opposite flank. In two
minutes the pupils were dilated. Fibrillary twitches then occurred,
and   in about ten minutes paralysis was present to such a decided
extent that the rabbit had great difficulty in moving about, and
usually lay extended        on the     abdomen   and chest, with the     head
resting on the lower law.           It  continued in this state for about
twenty minutes, and then the symptoms gradually disappeared ; so
that, in rather more than an hour and thirty minutes after the in
jections, it appeared to have recovered perfectly, with the exception
that the pupil-dilatation remained.
   Experiment     2. — Several    days subsequently,    0-5 grain of extract
of physostigma, in fifteen minims of distilled water, was injected
 under the skin of this animal. Death occurred in fifteen minutes.
   Experiment     3. — In the     next experiment,    a rabbit of nearly the
 same weight as that used in the last received six grains of sulphate
 of atropia, and then        05 grain of extract of physostigma.          The
 symptoms    were less serious       and of shorter    duration   than in the

588              Proceedings of Ike Royal Society
experiment where      the same dose      of extract of physostigma wag
given along with only four grains of sulphate of atropia, and they
appeared to be caused by the latter substance chiefly.
   Experiment   4. — Four days afterwards,     it was found that 0-5 grain
of extract of physostigma was a fatal dose for this rabbit also.
   Evidence of a still more satisfactory character in support of the
result that the toxic action of physostigma may be prevented                by
atropia was obtained with dogs.
   Experiment 5. — Eight grains of sulphate            of atropia and three
grains of extract of physostigma,       in distilled water, were injected
under the skin of a vigorous English terrier dog, weighing ten
pounds.    The chief symptoms were dilatation of the pupils, partial
paralysis, and hypnotism. Of these, the first continued for several
days,   and the last for less than     twenty-four hours.         The partial
paralysis  continued for only forty minutes, after which the dog was
in  a perfectly normal condition, except that the pupils were in full
dilatation, and that a tendency to indulge in sleep was manifested.
   Experiment    6. — Three weeks   afterwards,      the same dog received
eight grains of sulphate     of atropia     and six grains      of extract of
physostigma   —the latter  being twice as large a dose as that given in
the previous experiment.     Dilatation of the pupils and considerable
loss of motor power were again produced          ;  but, in addition, certain
symptoms were prominently exhibited that were undoubtedly due
to the physostigma,     such  as  tremors     and exaggerated       bronchial
secretion.    The partial paralysis and tremors continued for more
than three hours, and the dilatation of the pupils for several days,
after which the dog perfectly regained its former condition.
   Experiment   7. — In order to show     distinctly that the atropia had
prevented the fatal action     of the physostigma given in these two
experiments,   this dog received, some weeks afterwards, three grains
of extract of physostigma — a dose equal to that from which it
recovered in the first experiment,   and only      half as large as that from
which it recovered in the second.          The results were that partial
paralysis and tremors were quickly produced, that the lachrymal
and salivary secretions     were profusely increased,          and  that the
respirations became more and more laboured and jerking, until
they ceased in death, at seventeen minutes after the administration.
   These experiments appear to prove that in rabbits and dogs the

                       of Edinburgh,           Session 1868-69.                              589
fatal action of certain doses of physostigma                      may be prevented by
atropia.
     Many examples can             be referred to        in which several of the actions
of various substances may be impeded, prevented, or counteracted
by those of others.   Of these we may instance the antagonism
between the actions of physostigma and atropia and of opium and
atropia on the iris, and also of these pairs of substances and of
quinia and morphia on the minute blood-vessels.                             It    is,   however,
doubtful     if   any absolutely           demonstrated        example    of antagonism
can be referred to in which the toxic action of one substance may
be prevented        by the physiological action                 of another.         The only
instance deserving of notice in which antagonism                       of the latter class
is   asserted to exist,       is   that between opium on the one hand, and
belladonna,       hyosciamus,         and other active         substances     derived from
the Solanacece                 The truth of this reputed antagonism
                     on the other.
has not, however, been established.   The observations on man that
appear to support      it     are found,      on careful examination, to be liable
to many objections        ;   while the experiments              that have been made
on the lower         animals have produced                  evidence     that     is     directly
opposed to its existence.
     In bringing     these experiments              before the Society           the author's
purpose      has only been to show that there exists                      an antagonism
between the toxic action                 of certain doses of physostigma and of
belladonna or atropia.              In    the further investigation of this subject
it   will   be necessary to determine    exactly on what special actions
this antagonism        depends, and also within what limits of dosage                          it
is   maintained.      Being concerned with two substances each of which
possesses     a   number of actions,         it     is   not unreasonable        to anticipate
that several of them          are not      mutually antagonistic.           Above certain
doses   a   region may, therefore, be entered where the non-antagonised
actions are present           in sufficient degrees to be themselves able to
produce fatal effects.
  These, and many other important questions, remain for exam
ination. Their elucidation may be expected to have       direct                         a
bearing on the principles of therapeutics, for they require the
demonstration of the manner in which certain accurately defined
abnormal       conditions       are      restored    to normality by actions                of an
equally defined and accurately determined character.

590               Proceedings of the Royal Society
   In  the meantime,     the few facts that have been obtained           indi
cate a valuable     practical application.      Although     the existence of
an antagonism      between the fatal effects of physostigma and bella
donna    has been ascertained      by experiments       on rabbits  and dogs
only, there is no reason to doubt that it will be found to exist
in man also.       We may thus have at our disposal            a physiological
antidote    for physostigma-poisoning, occasion for applying which
may occur in this country, and already daily occurs in West Africa,
where physostigma is extensively used as an ordeal poison.
5. On the      Thermal Energy of Molecular Vortices.                  By W.
     J.  Macquorn Kankine, C.E., LL.D., F.E.SS. Lond. and
     Edin., Ac.
                                 (Abstract.)
   In  a previous   paper, presented     to the Royal       Society of Edin
burgh in December        1849, and read on the 5th of February 1850
(Trans, vol. xx.), the author deduced the principles of thermo
dynamics, and various properties         of elastic fluids, from the hypo
thesis of molecular    vortices, under certain special suppositions       as to
the figure and arrangement       of the vortices, and     as to the properties
of the matter which moves in them.              In   subsequent    papers,  he
showed     how   the  hypothesis might be simplified, by dispensing
with some of the special suppositions.           In    the present   paper he
makes further progress       in the same direction, and shows how the
general    equation  of thermodynamics,        and other propositions, are
deduced     from the hypothesis       of molecular vortices when         freed
from all special suppositions      as to the figure      and arrangement of
the vortices, and the properties      of the matter that moves in them,
and reduced simply to the following          form  :  that thermometric heat
consists  in a motion of   the particles  of bodies in circulating streams,
with a velocity either constant or fluctuating periodically. This, of
course, implies that the forces acting amongst those particles are
capable of transmitting that motion.
   The principal conclusions      arrived at are the following:     —
   1.  In  a substance  in which the action of the vortices is isotropic,
the intensity of the centrifugal pressure per unit of area is two-
third* of the energy due to the steady circulation in an unit of

volume.     The centrifugal pressure is the pressure exerted by the
substance in the perfectly gaseous state.
   2.*  If there   be substances   in which the action of the vortices      is
not isotropic, then in such substances the proportion already stated
applies to the mean of the intensities of the centrifugal pressures
in any three orthogonal     directions.
   3.* The proportion which the whole             energy of the vortices, in
cluding that of the periodic disturbances,           bears to the energy    of
the steady circulation alone, may be constant or variable.
   4. Absolute temperature       is proportional to the        energy  of the
steady circulation in unity of mass, and to the specific volume in
the perfectly gaseous state.
   5.  In substances which are nearly        in the perfectly gaseous state,
experiment shows the proportion in which the whole energy ex
ceeds that of the steady circulation to be sensibly constant ; and its
value may be found by computing in what proportion the dynamical
value of the specific heat at constant volume            exceeds once and a
half the quotient found by dividing the product of the pressure and
volume    by the absolute temperature.             *The following are ex
