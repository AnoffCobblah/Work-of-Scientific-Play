                     Monday, 7th December 1857.
    At   the request     of the Council, Dr Christison, V.P., deli
            vered the following Address from the Chair : —
    On this annual occasion of resuming          the Ordinary Meetings        of
the Royal Society, it becomes us, as almost a duty which we owe to
science,   and to our country, whose science we in some measure repre
sent, that we should review what has been done by the Society dur
ing the past year, to merit         the position which     it holds in public
opinion, and the title which it pre-eminently         enjoys.
    I  believe it may be allowed me to congratulate you on the result
of such    a retrospect  of your proceedings.      We cannot, indeed,     boast
of any great or prominent discovery in the physical or natural sciences
having been first announced during last Session in this           Hall, or first
given to the world in our Transactions for that period.                 But in
truth, the    past year has been nowhere, to my knowledge, marked by
any such event in any country.          Nay, for   several   years it has been
scarcely possible to place the finger on any great discovery made by
the cultivators of natural and physical science in any quarter of the
world.    We   seem to be   living in one of those not uncommon pauses in
the progress of science, during which discovery, in its grand significa
 tion, is at rest, but in which prior discovery undergoes        consolidation,
 extension, and application;     and in which a breathing-time is obtained,
 and a firm vantage-ground whence, without           doubt, another advance
 will  be made ere long to other conquests;       and the development, pos
 sibly, of new elements and      new  powers, — but   certainly of new gene
 ralizations and new laws, —will reward the researches of some higher
 mind, which, without the preparative works of detail of the present
 day, might remain barren in discovery and invention.
     In  such unobtrusive,     and yet, as we may be permitted        to hope,
 not unproductive labours, this Society may claim to have taken a fair
 share.     Without referring,    as might be  justly  done, to many papers
 of  a more fugitive or less elaborate character which         have  been  pro
 duced to our     Ordinary Meetings, it will be sufficient for me to call
  attention to   the recent Fasciculus of our Transactions for the year

                                            3
  1856—57, in which the mathematician cannot fail to recognise the
 acute scrutiny, by    Mr Boole, of the Application of the Theory of Pro
 babilities to the question of the Combination of Testimonies             or Judg
 ments   ;  or the mechanical philosopher to welcome           the contributions
 of Mr    Clerk Maxwell to the Theory of Rotation ; or the chemist to
 admire the continuation of         Dr Anderson's Analysis of the Products
 of the Destructive     Distillation of Animal Matters       ;   or the naturalist
 to wonder at the strange and overwhelming variety           of forms of micro
 scopic life, to the unfolding       of which   so much has     been contributed
 by  Dr Gregory's elaborate paper           on the Diatomaceae      ;  or the phy
 siologist to applaud and encourage the ingenuity with which a new
 and promising inquirer, Mr Lister, has successfully investigated the
 Minute Structure of Involuntary Muscular Fibre.
    Nor    has the Society neglected       other branches   of its vocation.      I
 may, in particular, call your attention to what has been done by your
 Council    toward^   completing       the publication   of the " Makerstoun
Magnetical     and Meteorological        Observations."    These Observations
have been already published down to the year 1846, in                  three extra
 volumes of the Society's Transactions          ; but as the observations have
 been continued since that time almost to the present day, — not, in
deed,   in such number     as previously, but with care and regularity, by
the direction of our President, Sir          T. M. Brisbane, — it     was thought
that benefit would accrue to science by continuing the reduction and
publication of them.        This it     has been resolved  to carry through on
a somewhat abridged plan          ;  towards which object the President has
munificently     contributed    L.200, and the Council, on behalf of the
 Society, has added an      equal sum.        Mr Welsh of the Kew Observa
tory, who was himself observer at Makerstoun              for a few years, has
favoured the Council by superintending the reductions, which are now
in progress.
    During the past year the Librarian and Council have continued
their exertions to bring the Library into a satisfactory and easily
accessible   condition.    Of the     sum   of L.300  voted by the Society for
the purpose, only a small proportion has been expended in the pur
chase of a few new works, — works, however, of much interest and
value.     The greater part of the        vote has been applied to completing
and binding many previously incomplete works, and in adding to the
truly valuable Collection of Maps, which was prominently noticed in
the introductory Address of Bishop Terrot last year, as having been

                                            4
begun and advanced far forward, under the kind superintendence                               of
Mr Keith Johnston.
   The importance of what has thus been done for the Library, and
the value of the collection of books now in the Society's possession,
cannot be well appreciated until the publication of the Catalogue,
which has been in hand for a longer period than many Members may
have thought necessary.   It is only those who have been themselves
engaged in making a Catalogue that can estimate                      the time        required
to carry through     such an undertaking well             ;   and to them the time
which has been found requisite will not appear too great.                              When
the present Assistant Curator was appointed to his office last year,
the Catalogue was actually in type              ;   but in so unsatisfactory            a con
dition, that   what had been done may be said to have since been all
done over again.  During last year it has been almost entirely re
constructed, and much extended ; it will be found now, as the Coun
cil believe, correct, complete, and worthy of the Society ; and it is
ready, or nearly so, for publication.   The Council, in noticing the
completion of this important         labour, cannot express too highly the
sense they entertain      of the services of Dr Lawson, who                    has applied
himself to the task put before him with a zeal, diligence, method,
and ability, which lead the Council to congratulate themselves and the
Society on the choice which was made in appointing him.
   While we may survey,        as   it appears       to me    with   some satisfaction,
these labours of our Society during last session,                I    will nevertheless
take the liberty of observing that, on casting my eye down the                             List
of Fellows which   was    put before   us   all, according to custom, at the late
annual election of Office-Bearers, it did occur to me to wonder, that
so long a catalogue of names,         well known in literature             and science,
should not have produced even               more materials           for upholding         the
character and title of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.                               This list
comprises 289      individuals,     of whom eighty-nine              may be truly con
sidered to be engaged in the pursuit of science, and twenty -four in that
of literature; and of the former         class there are at least         forty-nine, of
the latter thirteen, resident in Edinburgh, or not far from                    it,   who have
already shown,     by   their writings   and inquiries,        that they are well able
to maintain and forward the prosperity                of literature and science.
I    will not pretend       to inquire      into the causes           which,     for   a   few
years past, have somehow or another                   lessened   the    interest       of the

                                          5
meetings of our Society, in face of such apparently ample resources.
But, as one means of counteracting them,                I may be permitted to
point out   to   all, but especially to the cultivators        of science  in our
northern    land, that they are not perhaps fully aware of the advan
tages to be derived from promulgating            their inquiries and discoveries
through the medium of the Society's meetings and published Proceed
ings and Transactions.           It cannot be too well known to them, that
our Prizes, founded through the affection and munificence of the late
Sir Alexander Keith and Dr Neill, and of our present President,
Sir T. M. Brisbane, are sufficiently numerous              to hold out a reason
able prospect of substantial public honours for every successful              and
 important investigation      ; —that    our printed Proceedings      and Trans
 actions, promptly       published,     and at once widely disseminated by
 exchange with every distinguished            scientific Society in Europe and
 America, hold out the temptation of easy and extensive advertisement
 of discoveries and researches ; and that our Meetings supply, in our
 audiences, an assemblage        of   men   of talent and weight in every rank
 and profession, who are competent judges of ability, and whose good
 opinion will ever tend to foster, advance, and reward true merit,
  especially among the young and aspiring in science.               I could  men
  tion not a few instances in my own time of men of celebrity, whose
  first successful   step in life    rested   on the fame acquired for them
  among the Fellows of this Society by            a paper read at its Ordinary
  Meetings.
      But there is    also a whole galaxy of names in our list,         of men  in
  need of no such encouragement, who pursue science for its own sake
  alone, and yet who choose other channels than this Society for pro
  mulgating their successes.          These   I beg simply to remind that the
  Royal Society is no longer the tedious channel, whose former tardi
  ness has probably led to a        falling off in the number of important
  communications to our Meetings            ; and farther, that the production
  of  a paper here does not prevent its author from selecting any other
  medium of communication which he may prefer to our Transactions.
      In making the survey which has led to these,           I trust, neither un
  seasonable    nor unreasonable considerations, my attention has been
  naturally   turned to the changes        which the lapse of a short year has
  created in our List of Fellows.         Of the Ordinary Fellows, as the list
  stood last year, nine have          died, and one has resigned.        The ordi

                                           0
nary list includes       269   Fellows.       The newly-elected Fellows are
Horatio Ross, Esq.,         Dr    James Black, Dr John Ivor Murray,
The Right       Hon. John Melville,        Lord Provost, John Blackwood,
Esq., Brinsley     de  Courcy Nixon, Esq., Andrew Murray, Esq., W.S.,
Rev.     Dr Macfarlane,        Duddingston, Dr W. M. Buchanan, and
Thomas Login, Esq., C.E.               Our loss has therefore been exactly
replaced, so far as mere number is concerned.
     Whether our     loss has been replaced in other respects than in mere
numbers, is a question which the future             only can answer.      But  if
our new members are to take upon themselves the duty of repairing
in all respects the casualties of the last twelve months, they have an
arduous task before them        ;  for, among our losses, we have to deplore
the deaths of     William Henry Play fair, William Scoresby, Marshall
Hall, and John Fleming, — names, than which               we can scarcely point
to any in the   British Islands more estimable in their respective sciences
of Architecture, Navigation, Physiology, and Natural History.
     In  one respect these gentlemen have had a common fate.                They
have    all attained   to an advanced     age, — dying,  except partially in one
instance, in the pride of mental vigour, but yet not until each had left
behind him works that are likely to be imperishable, so far as the
work of man may be so.            This consideration    casts a ray of sunshine
over our gloom of regret at their disappearance from amongst us.
But it cannot render our calamity less material, and must only in
crease our anxiety that their places here may be worthily and
speedily filled from the succeeding generations of members.
     The other   deceased fellows whom       I  have to mention are    Mr John
 Dewar,     advocate,    Mr Bald,      civil engineer in London,       Mr John
 Haldane of Haddington, Mr George Forbes, banker in this city,
and Mr John Adie, optician in Edinburgh.                 Of these Mr Haldane
was known to us as an unobtrusive amateur in natural history, to which
he was naturally enough attracted during             his long service in earlier
 life, as an able officer of the Hudson's Bay Company in North America.
Mr     Forbes, one of a family long remarkable in our city for worth and
talent, and still represented now more ably than ever in this Society,
was     for  some    years   our    faithful and    zealous    Treasurer  ;  and
was     endeared   to many    of  us as a gentleman       of cultivated taste in
literature    and art,   and to    the whole community as a man of most
amiable disposition, constantly abounding in works of active practical
 benevolence.      Mr A die's enrolment among us is sufficient proof

                                            7
 that he successfully followed his calling as one of the scientific arts               ;
and by those by whom           he must' be better appreciated            than by my
 self, he was greatly esteemed as a man conversant with the highest
branches of his profession, and who has left behind him in that re
spect scarcely an equal, certainly no superior, in Edinburgh, or per
haps even in London         itself.
    The four pre-eminent         men whose        names   I  mentioned in the first
instance, demand       from us much more than a simple                passing notice.
 I wish that   I  were competent, and your present leisure sufficient, for
the full biography which is necessary              to do them complete justice.
 I am sure, however, that you           will  welcome   some present short tribute
 of respect to their memory           ;  and   that you     will  excuse    my short
 comings on a field of great extent, which             I   have had unfortunately
 but very brief opportunities of leisure to survey, and on which,                   in
 deed,  I  should on that account have been compelled to decline entering,
 had it not been for the kindness of sundry Members of Council who
have furnished me with the necessary               means.
     William Henry Play/air,            a Scotchman by descent,         and  a citizen
 of Edinburgh from his youth, was born in London, where his father,
 the brother of our former Professor, Philosopher, and Secretary,
John Playfair, practised          as an architect of repute.          Educated here
 under the eye      of   his uncle, and living much in the society of a
host of his uncle's pupils, comprising a multitude of young men of
talent, who have since risen to great eminence in many departments of
human knowledge,         Mr Playfair acquired an extensive acquaintance
with Learning, Science, and Art, and above all, in his own profes
sion,   a correct and fastidious taste,         of which    we now reap the fruits
in this city.
    At    the early age of twenty-six Mr Playfair was chosen by His
Majesty George the Third's Commissioners to carry out the erection
of the buildings for the University, — his first great work, in which                he
was at one and the same             time aided by the general grandeur, and
cramped by the faulty details, of his precursor Adam, — and in which
he ultimately triumphed over every difficulty.                 There is nothing in
our northern      metropolis to compare with the simple stateliness and
chaste details of the interior quadrangle of the University,
                                                                          — which is
mainly Playfair's own, — for his predecessor contemplated the mon
                                                                 differently elevated
strous and fatal blot of a double quadrangle, with
courts ; — and we have nowhere else any single apartment
                                                                            that com

                                                s
bines so chastely and harmoniously                 the vastness of space, architec
tural splendour, and bibliothecal fitness of the upper Library Hall.
    It  would be out of place for                me   to   notice here all Playfair's
public    works     ;    which   have been principally erected             in Edinburgh
constitute a large proportion of the most conspicuous architectural
decorations of the city, and bid fair to immortalize                     him, so long as
the capital      of Scotland shall continue              to attract,     as  it  does now,
visitors of taste from all quarters of Europe and America.                          Among
critics in architecture it may be wished that some of them were better.
But    was   it the architect's fault that they are not             so ?     In  every one
of his works, except Donaldson's Hospital, he had to encounter great
difficulties of site, or neighbourhood, or both together, — difficulties,
indeed, sometimes unconquerable                  by any skill.        And yet even in
these, when he is said to have             failed, the critics who think so appear
to me to proceed          for the most part upon the assumption, that he had
within his choice plans of far greater magnitude than his limits, and
a command of means far beyond his actual treasury.                           Who, for in
stance, can say what might not have been the                   felicity of an architect,
so pure    in his style, and       so  fruitful in his    resources,    had he been told
when he designed the columned temple in a portion of which our
Society is now accommodated,                 that he was afterwards           to cover the
Mound,      from the         bottom to      the crown       of its   slope,    with   public
edifices ? — and        that he was at liberty to do       so at a cost of twice, thrice,
or four times the          L. 100,000     which have been actually expended on
them ? — for      that seems conditional            to the criticisms       to which one
often hears Playfair subjected, on account of                      his designs for the
Royal Institution's Building, the National Gallery, and                           the  Free
Church College.
    Of all his works none            has called    forth such unqualified          applause
as Donaldson's           Hospital   ;  and his success there was all the more
remarkable,       because the style was altogether new to him.                     This has
been described by one of his most successful                   ephemeral biographers,
—plainly       a zealous,      yet impartial, and able admirer,           — as    a type of
 Gothic style     ;    for which the author is obliged to admit, with evident
compunction,          the unhappy        cognomen of
                                                           "  Debased Gothic."          But
 let us call this work of Playfair's hands more fitly the                    " Inhabitable
 Gothic ; " and no          one has been more perfectly successful in making
 the Gothic habitable than our deceased fellow-member.                         No pleasure
 however is without alloy.              There     are few who      will not regret that

                                           9
so magnificent      a pile had not been destined        for a  more conformable
object.    Scotchmen were usually charged in former days                  by their
neighbours with presenting, by a species             of elective attraction, the
frequent union of poverty and pride.                It may    be allowable     in a
native of the Scotch metropolis to lament, that the old sneer should
be verified in these present times, by the pride of lodging poverty in
such a palace.
    I  am  assured      that Playfair was so conscientiously fastidious in
discharging the trust reposed in him as a professional man, that he
executed    all his drawings with his own hands.               When    engaged in
this task, he for many years constantly worked in the standing pos
ture, often for twelve hours a-day.           To this habit  he himself ascribed,
not without justice,       a paralytic affection    of the spine, which gradu
ally stole upon him       when he was a man        of middle life only.      Slowly
increasing year after year, it at last prevented in a great measure
locomotion.       But his aptitude for exercise of the mind continued
unimpaired long afterwards.            And even when his sad malady, spread
ing upwards, enfeebled          his arms, and at length         invaded also his
mental faculties, it only required a new point in his plans to need
consideration, when he was aroused to his old perspicuity and deci
sion, and the point was settled.
    Playfair  was, in every good sense         of the words,     a scholar and     a
gentleman.       As    such,   his society   was courted on      all hands.     But
for many years his infirmities had withdrawn him very much from
the social    circle  ;  so  that few except one or two old intimates can
 now tell how much society has lost in this respect by his death.                He
died in his sixty-eighth         year.    No  one can doubt that his memory
 will long survive in his works.
    The biography of William Scoresby belongs not so much to us
as to the parent Society of the sister kingdom.              But as this remark
able man     frequently      visited us, joined us as an Ordinary           Fellow,
sometimes contributed          to the business    of our meetings, and       was  in
early life a student of our University during             the winter intervals of
repose from      his voyages of Arctic       adventure, it becomes      me to ad
vert shortly to the departure of one so eminent in Science, so amiable
 in disposition, so distinguished for Christian virtue.
    Scoresby was the son of an experienced whaler and able navigator
of Whitby, in Yorkshire.           The father's zeal in     his profession was so
                                                                             to his
intense and catholic, that          he actually carried off his child
                                                                         B
    VOL. IV.

                                      10
favourite Arctic regions at the age of ten, without the previous know
ledge    of Mrs Scoresby, — an attached wife, and       no less fond a mother.
The idea, it must      be added, did not occur to the father         till he  one
 day detected, with much trouble,         the urchin hidden below in the
 Resolution, while the     "Blue Peter "    was   flying from the mast-head,
 and when the boy had a clear intention of running away from home
 in this remarkable manner.        Entering thus early     on a life  of fearless
 adventure,    it is no wonder that the    second   Scoresby outstripped the
 first  in eminence asa navigator.     At  the age   of sixteen,  he discovered
 with his father an open sea near Spitz bergen, apparently stretching to
 wards the North Pole       ; and he actually    sailed in it to the latitude
  of 78° 46', — the highest known to have           been ever    attained up to
 that time.      At the age of twenty-one he         succeeded    his father   as
  commander of the Resolution         whaler   of Whitby     ; and    for twelve
 years afterwards he annually fished the Greenland Seas, carrying on
  at the same time constant researches in geography, magnetism, geology,
  and zoology ; for which he had prepared himself by several winters
  of study under Jameson       and other Professors of the University of
  Edinburgh.      The results were published in his " Account of the
  Arctic Regions,'' and in his " Voyage to the Northern Whale
  Fishery."
      A  deep pure vein   of piety, fostered by careful early training         on
 the part of his parents, everywhere        pervaded his pursuits, whether
 professional or scientific.     No whale    was hunted, and no other work
  that could be dispensed with was done, by the crew of the Resolution
  on the Sabbath.      Their captain   was constantly as assiduous       in main
  taining the religious    condition  of his men,      as in preserving their
 health, and availing himself of their seamanship.               But it is also
  recorded of him, that he generally contrived to reward the forbear
 ance of his men while their game was         sporting    securely on all sides
  around    them on Sunday, by ensuring        that they should make prize
  of a whale or two at the first entrance of the hours upon Monday
  morning.
      The depth and sincerity of his feelings, as a responsible creature,
  he has recorded in his '' Sabbaths in the Arctic Regions."                  The
  ultimate consequence    of his following this bent of his mind was, that,
  while still in the prime of life and vigour, he deserted his favourite
  the sea, studied at Cambridge       for the English       Church, took     soon

                                         11
afterwards the degree of Doctor of Divinity, and became a zealous
and efficient member of the ministry, first among his co-mates as
Chaplain to the Mariner's Church            at Liverpool, and eventually at
Bradford, as pastor of an extensive manufacturing population.
    The ardent and conscientious discharge of his religious duties,
however, did not prevent him from applying               also  to the favourite
scientific pursuits of his youth.        Only a year before his death, indeed,
he undertook       a voyage   to Australia, for the purpose of testing his
theory respecting the aberration of the compass in iron ships              ; and
one of his last scientific observations was the measurement of the ocean
wave in a storm off the Cape            of Good Hope, when       he ascertained
that the elevation of the           highest, when the sea
                                                               " ran mountains
high,"    was forty feet from trough to crest.
    I cannot,    consistently with the indispensable brevity of this sketch,
even    so much as enumerate           Dr Scoresby's many contributions to
science   ;   but must hasten         at once   to  the close of this     theme.
 Scoresby died, after a tedious illness, at a fair old age, in his 68th
 year.    Few men can at that age console           themselves with the retro
 spect of   so long an existence so usefully spent.        The intrepid  seaman,
 the skilful navigator, the philosopher of no mean order, and the pious
 divine, was throughout his entire life full of good works in each and
 all of his multifarious vocations.
     The connection of Marshall          Hall with  our Society has been some
 what similar to that of the Arctic Navigator.             Born in Nottingham
 shire, and trained there       till  his 19th year, he then came         to this
 city in 1809      to pursue the study of medicine.            He graduated at
 our University in 1812         ;  remained two     years longer as one of the
 resident physicians of the Royal Infirmary            ; was elected during that
 period President of the Royal Medical             Society, an office which has
 generally     been   the forerunner      and presage    of future distinction    ;
 delivered, it seems, a short course of lectures on the Diagnosis               of
  Diseases, ever afterwards a favourite          subject of inquiry with him      ;
  and on leaving this, to settle as a physician in Nottingham, continued
  to maintain his predilection for Edinburgh, as is shown by his having
 joined its Royal Society as a Fellow in            1819.     But this  has  been
  the full amount of his connection with us.
     He     had been     scarcely twelve years       in  Nottingham,    when the
  promptings of genius induced him to seek a fitter field for its de

                                           12
velopment in London, where he slowly attained                   a respectable     place
as a physician.         His contributions      to the practice    of his profession,
both before and after he settled in London, were numerous, always
ingenious, often original, generally           valuable, but sometimes contro
vertible.      Of all    these    contributions     none perhaps       will   convey  a
higher idea of his acute and inventive discrimination                as a physician,
than his inquiry, begun in 1824, and perfected some                       years after
wards, into the constitutional         effects  of the  loss  of blood, of which     he
successfully investigated        the phenomena, supplied the explanation,
and detailed the conclusions, in the shape of valuable instruction, for
distinguishing     between    inflammation       and nervous irritation, thereby
laying down the means of            escape   from    fearful   errors    at  that time
often committed by the incautious and uncompromising admirers of
blood-letting     as a remedy.
    But the credit, which may           be  justly claimed for Marshall Hall
for his contributions      to medical      experience    and practice, sinks into
insignificance     when compared with his higher fame as a physiologist.
It    belongs properly to the sister Royal Society to sketch biogra-
phically the details of his discoveries in physiology.                From     me they
can receive but a brief and passing notice, without too great a de
mand on your time and attention.                I  must confine myself,         indeed,
to only one      of them, but that the greatest of all, the precursor and
foundation      of all the rest, and sufficient of itself to stamp Mar
shall Hall     as    an  inventive    genius,     whose name       will   go down to
 posterity as one of the pillars of physiological            science in the present
 century.
     It is evident from his works         that Marshall Hall's attention had
 been    eagerly    turned   to   the immortal       discoveries    of our greatest
 Scottish physiologist      in these recent times, the lata        Sir Charles Bell,
 in regard to the functions of the brain, spinal marrow, and nerves.
 From that moment the nervous system was his great centre of attrac
 tion.     Sir Charles first sighted, and laid down in an undeniable
 shape, the grand fact in the physiology of the nervous system, that
sensation is conveyed and motion governed by different nerves, or
 different filaments of nerves, having different origins in the cerebro
 spinal system.         Hall, however,       was the   first to   see   that   this se
 paration of what were          once   conceived to be common functions               of
 all, or almost all,     nerves,   was not enough to account for the whole

                                        13
phenomena of nervous action.              He showed that, sensation being
conveyed from the circumference to the centre, the brain, by one               set
of nerves, or filaments     of nerves, — as Sir     Charles first   indicated, —
and motion being     excited by volition sending an influence from the
centre to the circumference          by means    of other nerves or nervous
filaments, — also a branch       of Bell's discoveries, — there is another
class of actions  caused,    independently of volition or of consciousness,
by external impressions        made directly on the spinal marrow itself           ;
and, above all, that there is another          set  of numberless mysterious
movements and actions, mysterious            formerly,  — but   intelligible and
clear as noon-day since        his inquiries    have been     accepted,  — which
are excited    by an agency, conveyed first from the circumference
along afferent filaments of nerves to the spinal marrow as their
centre, and thence along other or efferent nervous filaments to
the   circumference    where action        is eventually    manifested, and all
this   independently     of   volition,   often   too   of sensation,    and   not
unfrequently     of consciousness.          These    actions,  which     are con
stantly illustrated   in the exercise of our functions,          such   as in the
acts  of breathing, swallowing, discharging           the excretions, sneezing,
coughing, winking, and the like, constitute what are called by               Hall
Hejiex Actions.      They are also exemplified by a thousand pheno
mena occurring during disease.          Let me instance one example, which
will at once render his discovery of Reflex Actions intelligible to any
common understanding.            When in poisoning with prussic acid, the
sufferer is perfectly insensible and motionless, and no muscular ac
tion is discoverable except a spasmodic upturning of the eyeballs,
and a slow, short, imperfect respiration,        — if   we pour upon the head
 suddenly a full stream of cold water, instantly a deep inspiration              is
 drawn, which fills the whole chest.           By repeating this process,      we
 remove several of the immediate and sure causes of death, and may
 restore consciousness,      sensibility, and at last perfect health.         But
 this by the bye   ; the main purpose in quoting            the fact now is to
 exemplify   an action caused       by an impression on a part of the ner
 vous   circumference, conveyed by certain          nervous filaments      to the
 spinal marrow, and transmitted          instantly   by certain   other nervous
 filaments to the muscles which maintain respiration,           — and    quite in
 dependently    of volition,    of sensation, of consciousness, of all the
 cerebral functions   in short, which, in the case supposed,           are totally

                                       14
dormant and suspended.         This   is a reflex action, one    of a countless
multitude of phenomena which were entirely, or almost altogether,
misunderstood until Marshall       Hall caught the first glimpse of them,
investigated, elucidated, and classified them, and deduced innumerable
conclusions from them for explaining previously incomprehensible
phenomena occurring in health, and still more in disease.                This is
the grand fact, the discovery of which           we owe   to Marshall      Hall,
and from which he afterwards proceeded           to further discoveries in the
physiology of tho nervous system.
    Like other discoverers,    he  at first encountered much opposition
to his new views.       But all physiologists       and physicians     are  now
agreed in adopting the most important of them, and in acknowledg
ing the obligations which physiology and medical practice owe to him.
For many of the latter years of his life, he was esteemed as one of
the most successful physiological inquirers in Europe.          He persevered
in his researches till near the end of his life, which terminated in a
slow and painful illness before the close of his 67th year.
    It still remains for   me to take notice of one other loss which the
Society and science have sustained, and a loss which, to us in parti
cular, is the most serious which the last twelve months have brought
forth.     By the death of    Dr John      Fleming, the Royal Society has
lost not only a man well known to           science, but likewise one of its
 most useful and active members.           He may be said to have been the
last survivor of a group of naturalists who gave lustre to Scotland
 soon after the commencement of the present century.
    John Fleming      was born at Bathgate in 1785.             Having chosen
 the Church for     his  profession, and having been settled at an early
 age as a minister    of the Church     of Scotland, in the charge of the
 parish of Bressay, in Shetland, his first writings as a naturalist con
 sisted of observations which he made on the zoology and geology of
 that interesting group of islands.        Papers were read by him to the
 Wernerian Society of this city, so early as 1808, when he was only
 twenty-three years of age, on the Narwhal, and on the Rocks of
 Papa Stour.       Being translated      soon   afterwards   to  the parish    of
 Flisk,   on the south shore of the    Frith of Tay,    he had fresh materials
 around him for pursuing his favourite           researches, and    made   ample
 use  of them for cultivating various branches of Natural History.         Seve
 ral of the   most  interesting districts of his neighbourhood, such as St

                                       15
Andrews and the Red         Head,     were    first   geologically described by
Fleming.
   Gradually, however, his attention during the hours                he could spare
from his professional duties became            concentrated in the study of
animals;    and the results appeared in 1822              in his  " Philosophy of
Zoology,"    a laborious and   still most serviceable work, which instantly
obtained for him a high reputation            as    a philosophical       naturalist.
This  was   followed by another work of equal labour. " On British
Animals," in which      he exhibited     their descriptive characters.           Fle
ming also contributed to the Encyclopaedia          Sritannica    some important
papers on sections of the Animal Kingdom, particularly one on the
Mollusca.
   Throughout     these and    all his other labours        as a man      of science,
our departed associate never ceased to sustain his earnest and con
scientious character    as a  minister of the Gospel.          It is stated of him
that, on being translated in 1832, from comparatively light duty at
Flisk   to the parish   of Clackmannan, where           he had pastoral        charge
of  a populous    flock, he deliberately        locked up his        cabinets,  until
familiarity with    his duties should enable        him to open them at a more
convenient season.
   In   1834 he was relieved altogether from his labours as a minis
ter of the Word,      by accepting the chair         of Natural       Philosophy    in
King's College, Aberdeen.          It is to be regretted that          a more con
genial position in a University did not at this time                  open to him ;
for, in a chair of Natural History, he could not have failed to confer
lustre both upon himself        and upon       his University      ;  whereas, in a
chair of Physics,    entered   on    not   till the 45th year of his         age, he
never could have risen beyond the level of a diligent teacher.                     At
length a more suitable       position was attained by him in 1845, when
he undertook the Professorship of Natural Science in the Free Church
College of Edinburgh.        Here his object more especially was to give
the future pastors of the Free Church a general acquaintance with
Natural Science,     so as to prepare them in some measure               for the dis
cussion of the various questions on which it is now so frequently
brought in contact with religion.              It is generally acknowledged,
that in this field of exertion,       Dr Fleming proved of the greatest
utility  to the communion of which he was              the ornament.         He   had
that object always much at heart, and when                assured that his chair

                                         16
would probably        be maintained     in perpetuity,     he declared    that he
felt as   if  a kind  of  dew had fallen    upon him, invigorating       his aged
frame to increased activity.
    Notwithstanding the comprehensive nature of his
                                                                " Philosophy of
Zoology," it will probably be generally admitted, that Dr Fleming's
great merit as a man of science lay in his careful and vigilant power
of observation.        His knowledge of rocks, of fossils, and of living
species,    was no less extensive than exact.         It was   perhaps    in some
measure his profound and ever active sense of what was necessary
for the faithful observation of a fact, which            made    him distrustful
beyond rule of what was reported by others.             Caution, carried to such
a degree as to amount to a scientific scepticism in receiving the tes
timony of others, exercises eventually a baneful influence on the
fruits of    the mind that thus indulges in      it ; for the benefit is thereby
lost of much        that has been     tolerably    well  ascertained    by   other
inquirers, and conclusions are apt to         be  pertinaciously    opposed   long
after the world of science       has generally considered them as settled.
It   may be doubted whether          Dr Fleming did not        sometimes     incur
this misfortune.        Yet, while   he was   engaged     in disputing evidence
and battling off inductions,        even  those who      might   think him un
reasonable were forced to acknowledge, and even to admire, his                  ex
traordinary      shrewdness, and the philosophic caution by which he was
prompted in every movement of his own mind.
     It is understood that     Dr Fleming had prepared           a new work      on
the Geology of the Environs of Edinburgh, a subject always of deep
interest, and on which few men were so well entitled to speak.                   Of
this work it is gratifying to learn         that a large portion has already
been put through         the press.
     For this short sketch of his scientific life,          I am   principally in
 debted to our fellow-member,            Mr   Chambers.       For   some   months
 at least before his death,         Dr Fleming had       been   observed by his
 friends    to  fail in looks and strength, owing to some obscure dis
 turbance      of the digestive organs.        At last, and when no appre
 hensions were entertained of so sudden a termination               to his life   of
 usefulness, he was seized abruptly with violent illness, which proved
 to be owing to perforation        of the stomach, and which ended fatally
 next morning, only fifteen days ago.
     With this imperfect tribute       to his memory,       I bring   to a conclu

                                         17
sion what may be fairly stated from this chair regarding one whose
communications to our meetings were numerous, singularly lucid,
and always received with marked attention          ; whose criticisms invari
ably restored animation when our interest threatened            to flag ; and
 whose strictures,     if they sometimes cut rather     deep, never failed to
strike   out new ideas        from any adversary who was      worthy of his
lance.    It  is in these capacities that we who are now here assembled
will long fondly recall him, and lament his removal from our circle,
and feel that it will be hard to supply his place.

 Professor Kelland, V.P., read from the Chair the following
    short Biographical Notices of MM. Thenard and Cauchy,
    two recently deceased Foreign Members of the Society.
    In Dr   Christison's   excellent address at the last meeting, he pre
 sented you with biographical      sketches of the recently deceased Home
 Members     of this Society.     I have been requested to complete his
 work, by adding a brief sketch of the lives of the two Foreign Mem
 bers whom we have lost during the past session.
    1. M. Thinard. — For the information which          I have acquired       rela
tive to this excellent chemist,     I am    indebted to   Dr Christison, who
has furnished me with his personal recollections, and with a biogra
phical souvenir of the      deceased   by one of his former assistants,         M.
Le Canu.
    The association of the name of Thenard with the progress of Che
mistry dates back to the period of history. His first contribution
to the science was      made so early      as the year    1799    ; the subject
        " The
being            Oxygenated Compounds of Antimony, and their Com
binations with Sulphuretted Hydrogen."               His last was presented
in 1856,    fifty-seven   years later, and is entitled
                                                             " Memoir      on   the
Bodies whose Decomposition         is effected under the influence of the
Catalytic Force."       To detail all the discoveries of an author          whose
writings are scattered over so vast a period would be a work of some
labour,   and might justly be regarded by many of my hearers as a
dry and unnecessary detail.         A  few of the more important        only can
be noticed.
   We   owe    to him    the production    of muriatic    ether.     It  is true,
however, that Boullay in France, and Gehlen               in   Germany,      made
the discovery about the same         time with himself.        We   owe to him
also the discovery of oxygenated water, or the binoxide of hydrogen,
and consequently that of the peroxide of calcium,               of copper, &c.,
which it produces by reacting on         the inferior oxides of these metals.
M. LeCanu admits, in reference to this discovery, that a happy acci
dent exhibited to M. Thenard the dissolution of binoxide of barium
in water acidulated with      nitric acid, without     the disengagement of

                                            31
oxygen     ;   but he argues very justly that the merit consisted in the
far-seeing power which could divine the existence of a definite com
bination of oxygen and hydrogen,               essentially distinct from ordinary
water.
    M. Thenard        had the good fortune to labour         in conjunction with a
host of great men — with Fourcroy, with Dulong,                     with Biot, with
Dupuytren, but,         above   all, with Gay-Lussac.         It is in this last con
nection,      I imagine, that his name comes most frequently                under the
eye   of non-chemical       readers amongst us.         Gay-Lussac      and   Thenard
published,      in conjunction,     a  series  of most   valuable    memoirs,     which
were afterwards united in two volumes.                Of these volumes Berthol-
let thus speaks       :
                         " They    seem to constitute a new science,          raised on
the    old    sciences of physics and chemistry            as  their groundwork."
 Amongst the vast          mass   of discoveries which      these researches make
 known,      I  have space to mention only two           :  1. A   highly important
 series   of facts tending       to  throw light on the relation between the
chemical and the electrical energy of the voltaic pile.                 For example,
 that acidulated water, as compared with               pure water, increases the
 chemical action of the pile, but diminishes the electrical                 ;  and that
 those   fluids which were found most efficient in exciting the chemi
 cal  powers of the battery are the most rapidly decomposed when
 subjected themselves to its action.              2. The indication of the means
 of obtaining       considerable     quantities   of potassium and sodium, by
 subjecting caustic potash and soda            to the contact of iron at a high
 temperature ; and the train of consequences                which flowed from the
 facility    of producing      those   metals.     The Memoir which contains
 the process referred        to appeared      in the Moniteur        of  the 15 th and
  16th November 1808.               In it    was  announced the existence of a
 particular radical, boron, which Davy described a month later in a
 valuable paper read to the Royal Society of London.
     Not the least important, however, of M. Thenard's publications
  was his     Traite  de Chimie, which has gone through            six editions.     He
  had a happy talent for popularizing, without the sacrifice of strict
  scientific accuracy.        His genius lay in arranging the parts, in deve
  loping truths in succession, in bringing out the characteristic facts,
  and causing the whole science to rest symmetrically on them. And
  tho same power of        popularizing and arranging was observable in his
  lectures.      The courses which he delivered at the Athenaeum, at the

                                       32
 Faculty of Medicine, at the Ecole Polytechniqve,             at the College of
France, were admirable of their kind.         Notwithstanding his intimate
acquaintance with the subject, and his long experience as a lecturer,
he never presented himself before        an audience,     without having care
fully planned the lecture, and determined the exact order and position
which every part should occupy.         He   used to say that each fact had
its own proper place, where alone it could be exhibited in relief, and
that it was the duty of the Professor to determine this place before
hand, just as much as it is the duty of an author to clear his sentences
of feeble tautology, and to attach the right word to every idea.               In
consequence of this care, his lecture was always complete, always a
continuous lesson on the subject in hand         ;   free alike from deficiency
and from exuberance.
    It  is indeed in his character as      a lecturer, that     M. Thenard      is
best studied.     On the public platform, the peculiar idiosyncracies of
the whole man came out spontaneously.          Let     me endeavour to present
him to you, as he stands before his class.     Imagine a vast amphitheatre
capable of holding       a thousand    persons — every     seat   occupied —the
 very lobbies and passages crowded to overflowing.              At   the back of
the contracted space       allotted  to the Professor      and his apparatus,
 stands   a huge black board, well covered with chemical formulae.
 The assistant     whose   duty it has been to prepare the experiments,
 stands anxiously regarding       his work.    The lecturer enters.         Your
ideas, derived from Hogarth, have perhaps pictured               to you a thin
spare man with       a hatchet face, and you start when your            eyes rest
on a figure placed in strong relief against the black board, whose firm
build and massive       countenance more than come            up to the typical
John Bull of your own land.           His broad full     eye, set  off by  a dark
mass   of hair, first glances at the apparatus, then rises and haughtily
scans the audience, as     if to measure their capacity, and        finally drops
on the assistant, who quails beneath its weight.           The lecture begins.
 So clear, so forcible, so continuous, is the stream which            flows from
the speaker's lips — so appropriate, so neat and so well performed
are the experiments,      that the hour passes over quickly and insensi
bly.      But should any accident happen           ;   should the unfortunate
assistant   have    mistaken    his directions ;     woe   betide    him.    The
presence of a thousand persons places no restraint on the lecturer's
indignation.     On one occasion, when he had given way to an un

                                        33
 usually violent    outburst,   an illustrious hearer,   said to    be Baron
Humboldt, thought it his duty to interfere, and request the master
to have a little more patience with his assistant.         The request was
granted, and all went smoothly during the remainder of the lecture.
For two days sunshine continued.         On the third day M. Thenard, on
entering   the room, perceived a      portion of the apparatus in a condi
tion which foretold the failure of the experiment.          Placing himself
right in front of the benevolent stranger, and looking him full in the
face, with his finger pointing to the unhappy apparatus, he cried
out in the theatrical     voice which    he inherited from the tragedian
Talma, " Friend,      I promised    to restrain my anger, and  I have    faith
fully kept my word     ;  give me back my promise, or you will         see me
expire before your eyes."         The stranger had no alternative but to
bow assent.                                           I
                 You may imagine what followed — will not attempt to
describe the scene.
    Report   says that the    assistant  was   sometimes a match for the
professor.    On   one   occasion    M. Thenard ironically commiserated
him   in  these   words,   " Poor fellow, you will never do any good."
To which the other replied, " Sir, you compliment        me ;  it is the very
same   thing Fourcroy predicted of yourself when you were his               as
sistant."
    Beneath that rough exterior, and that fiery temper, there lay an
honest conscience     and a warm        heart.   Again and again did his
assistants tender their resignation, but it was never accepted          ;  and
public exhibitions   of anger were followed by private acts of kindness.
When in 1832, M. Thenard lay ill of a fever, his two assistants,
M. Le Canu and M. Clement Desormes, undertook           the duty    of sitting
up alternately by his bedside.         One night the latter was   so ill of a
cough that the patient forgot his fever, in his anxiety to watch over
his nurse.
   M. Thenard died full of years, and rich in honours and titles.
   2.  Baron Cauchy. — At the suggestion of Professor Forbes, I had
drawn up a brief notice of the life of our mutual friend M. Cauchy,
when the biographical letter of M. Biot fell into my hands.               This
letter has enabled me to add certain details which        I  had previously
been unable to supply, and to which the present sketch owes its
chief interest.    As however M. Biot's statements, in one or two
   vol. iv.                                                          e

                                       34
instances, differ from my own, which are based, for the most part, on
M. Cauchy's writings,      I have allowed the latter to remain as         I  origi
nally penned them.
    In   Baron   Cauchy, the world      has lost the last of those eminent
cultivators   of mathematical    science   who sprung up in the early part
of the present century, formed in the school of Laplace and Lagrange.
The     names   of Poisson,   Gauss, Fourier, Abel, Jacobi, and Cauchy,
form a constellation     of abstract mathematicians,         such  as the world
never before saw existing together, and will              probably     never    see
again.     Agustin-Louis     Cauchy    was  born on the 21st          of August
 1789, the period of universal        confusion throughout        France.      His
father, who was keeper of the archives of the senate, appears to have
been     exempt from     the turmoils which      embroiled       every grade of
society   at that time.     Perceiving the mathematical bent of his son's
mind, he took pains to bring         him frequently       under the notice of
Lagrange.        This illustrious philosopher      interested himself in the
education of the lad, and gave the father a piece of advice which no
doubt greatly surprised      him, and which, coming from such a source,
it is worth our while carefully       to note.     These were      his words    : —
 " Do not allow your son to
                                 open a mathematical        book, nor to touch
a single diagram, until he has finished his classical studies."             Sound
 and excellent    advice under the circumstances.          Preliminary      educa
tion has for its object the cultivation     of all  the faculties, not the de-
 velopement of any one to the exclusion of the others.              It  fulfils its
 functions as well when it tends to check and keep down an over
 whelming bias in one direction, as when it aims at drawing out the
 dormant powers in another.        The wisdom of the advice of Lagrange
 may be    inferred from the whole life of Cauchy.              In his classical
 studies he was eminently successful, and       received the highest award
 of his class.     The  taste which he now acquired for languages never
 forsook him.     In his later years he read deeply in patristic theology,
 and delighted in pouring forth his divinity for the instruction of the
 young.    Nor did his exclusive devotion to classical study stand in the
 way of his professional advancement.             After a single course of
 mathematics      under a public professor, Duret, he presented himself,
 at the age of sixteen, for the entrance examination               of the Ecole
 Poly technique, and    was ranked second on the       list.
     It is not necessary to trace, step by step, his advance in his pro

                                               35
 fession.     Suffice it to say, that he became ingdnieur en chef in 1823,
and was employed on many public works.
     Prior    to  this date, however, he had            been   brought    prominently
 before the world.         The French Institute had proposed              as the sub
ject of the Prize Essay for               1816, the determination        of the  wave
 motion   of a disturbed fluid.           M. Poisson, who,      as he himself states,
had been for a long            time engaged on this problem, sent in a first
 memoir on the subject in October                   1815, followed by a second      in
December,          There    is   reason    to suppose,  that one object which the
 Institute had in view in proposing this problem was to draw out
M. Poisson.          That any living man should have succeeded in wrest
ing the prize from him, who was justly regarded as a giant in in
vestigations of the kind, is matter of astonishment to this day.                 That
that man should have been Cauchy, who justly looked up to Poisson
as   his model for imitation, and who, years after, acknowledges with
gratitude      his obligations       to  that great mathematician,       as the guide
of his early career, must            have greatly    surprised   even Poisson    him
 self; yet such was the fact.              The prize was awarded       to  Cauchy on
 the ground      of the greater generality and freedom from limitations
 which    his solution of the problem presented.               I   am not sure that
M. Poisson       was    satisfied with the decision.         At any rate, his own
 memoir was immediately published, whilst that of M. Cauchy, who
was not then a member              of the Institute, lay twelve years in manu
script.      In    this  case     the Institute, by following their ordinary
vicious practice,      conferred a real benefit on science, by allowing M.
Cauchy to add copious notes to his essay.                The two works of Poisson
and Cauchy now stand together as masterpieces                  of analytical investi
gation,   and form the starting-points from which all future writers on
 the subject must commence              their progress.    Prior  to this period,  M.
 Cauchy had published several admirable papers on subjects connected
 with pure geometry;           and the proof now afforded of the fertility of his
genius would at once have secured                him  an admission into the     Insti
 tute, had there been a vacancy.              The termination of the brief struggle
 of the hundred days unhappily               too soon created the desired vacancy,
 in a manner      little to the benefit of M. Cauchy,          who was named to
 fill it.   The Institute had          been remodelled     by Napoleon      in 1803,
 and the    legitimate monarchy,            on  their second   restoration,   at once
 resolved to re-establish          it in its original    form.     In effecting this

                                           36
  re-establishment    it is not much     to be wondered at that the Govern
  ment should    see  fit to strike out the names of two members, Carnot
  and Monge    — names     not more distinguished          by the brilliant talent
  of their possessors, than by their         connection with that of the first
  consul Napoleon.        Great as was       Cauchy's    genius, aimable as was
  his disposition, it could not prevent his sharing in the general feel
  ing of disgust and dissatisfaction at the expulsion           of Monge.        Con
  nected as the   latter had    been  with the revolution,      he had raised his
 hand when in power only as a shield to protect his colleagues from
 the proscription    of the Reign of Terror.           To sit in his place    was    to
 participate   in the obloquy attached to his removal.             Looking at the
  matter from this distance of time,          however, we cannot impute the
 slightest blame to Cauchy.          He   was a    legitimist by conviction.        In
 the depth of his ardent piety he believed that the interests of religion
 were bound up with those of the monarchy ; and as he never for a
 moment doubted the propriety of the act which placed                 his name on
 the roll,  so he accepted     the appointment        without   hesitation,   firmly
 and conscientiously believing that it was his duty so to act.
     About the    same time he was appointed a professor adjunct in the
 Ecole Poli/technique.         He occupied     besides   two other chairs.        The
 lectures which he delivered are well known to the world under the
 titles of  " Cours d' Analyse Algebrique"             "          sur  les  Calculs,
                                                         Lemons
 fyc," " Resume       des Lemons     sur   le  Calcul Infinitesimal"        "  L'ap-
plication    de V Analyse a      la Theoric     des   Courbes.''     He published
 also at this period various important          memoirs, especially one on in
 tegrals taken between       imaginary     limits.
     In  1826,    he  undertook the Herculean            task of conducting       and
 carrying   on a scientific    periodical,    under the title of Exercises          de
Mathematiques,       confined exclusively to his own writings.            After    the
lapse of little more than four years the work had advanced into the
fifth quarto volume, without any abatement of originality or of interest,
when it received a sudden interruption.                 M. Cauchy, as we have
said, was a warm adherent of the legitimate monarchy, and its over
throw was his own.          Following the example of its         predecessors,    the
new government demanded an oath of allegiance from all men hold
ing public situations.        This oath appears       to have made no stringent
demands, none which         a scientific     man might      not safely have      con
ceded, whatever his political principles.           But M. Cauchy's conscience

                                           37
was tender even to excess          ;  and although he had now a wife and two
children depending        on   him,    he resigned all his employments                  and
retired into voluntary exile in Switzerland,                sacrificing     his prospects
"   to devotion    to the unfortunate,          and the sincere love            of truth.''
The     King   of Sardinia,      informed of the circumstance, created for
him a Chair of Mathematics              in Turin.        This appointment            he ac
cepted, and lectured         in   the Italian      language       with great success.
There he recommenced the publication of his Exercises, under the
appellation of Resumes Analytiques. Having remained in Turin about
two years, thevoice of his sovereign (Charles X.) called him to Prague,
to take part in the education of the Count De Chambord. At Prague
he was rejoined by his wife and family                ;  and for the succeeding          six
years     he  attached     himself to      the    persons      of    the    royal    exiles.
Again he resumed his Exercises ; and having,                      I   believe, plenty of
spare time on his hands, he appears to have amused himself with
lithography.      In this    new form he        issued his publications           ;  and it
is to be feared that a complete set does not exist.                    I   have    the im
pression that    M. Cauchy informed            me,     with   his own lips, that he
did not    himself  possess copies      of all his lithographed           memoirs.       At
any rate, they are     almost unknown even in France.
     Charles  X. died    on the 6th     of November        1837    ;  and   M. Cauchy's
 functions as tutor      to the Count         of Chambord          having      ceased,    he
 returned to Paris      in 1838, and resumed              his place at the Institute.
He now took the title of Baron Cauchy, but whether by                           succession
 or by creation     I  do   not know.         Having no public occupation, he
divided his time between the pursuits of science and the performance
 of deeds of benevolence.           In both his voluntary labours              he   was in
defatigable.     The time      he bestowed      on each seemed          to preclude      the
 possibility of his having a moment for attention to the other.                     During
 the last peaceful nineteen years of his           life he published in the differ
 ent   volumes of the Institute, and in the Comptes                   Rendus,      upwards
 of  five hundred         memoirs,       besides    a multitude         of reports      and
 criticisms.    This immense          mass   of work abounds in new thoughts,
 new methods,      and sweeping generalizations,               and may be regarded
 as  a vast storehouse       from which        the next       generation       of mathe
 maticians will draw their resources.                It  is to be regretted that         M.
 Cauchy did not concentrate his attention more.                   Many of his papers
 are in a very rude state,        containing only the germ of an idea, which

                                          38
 he failed  fully   to develope.      In fact, during his later years          he   re
  minds one a little of Hooke, who was wont to rise at the conclusion
  of every memoir which       ho heard, and declare that he had something
  in store on the same subject.             The notation, too, of some of his
 papers is a notation peculiar to         himself ; and the methods employed
 are often those of a new calculus,          the Calcxd des Residus, invented
 by him, but not generally         adopted     by mathematicians.          All  these
 circumstances will conspire to lock up          M. Cauchy's papers for a con
 siderable period.       But no   one   hesitates about their value.         In those
 subjects where the results of his analysis can be easily tested,                such
 as in the determination       of the motion of elastic media, with its            ap
 plication   to the undulatory       theory of light     ; or in the doctrine of
 planetary    disturbances    as applied      to the movements of the small
 planet Pallas,     M. Cauchy was, and will continue           to be, the received
 authority.
     No sooner had he settled at Sceaux, in the neighbourhood of Paris,
 than,   for the fourth time,       he     commenced     the publication       of his
 Exercises,   which he continued to the day of his death.                The extra
 ordinary amount of work          thus performed        by one    man strikes     the
 mind with       astonishment.      It   is true that    many of his papers are
 but the exhibition in type of the pages of his scribbling               book.    He
 had the habit      during life of preserving       all his  loose   thoughts     and
 unsuccessful attempts, by working constantly on paper bound in vol
 umes.     Thus whatever      he penned was         sure to be preserved.         We
 may perhaps be permitted         to regret    this circumstance,     as its evident
tendency was to present a bar to the operation                  of that polishing
process   which     most writers    find so    essential to the success of their
 works.    But M. Cauchy        was not allowed to remain          nineteen years
 in the silence of his study.        On     the 13th of November          1839, the
Bureau     des   Longitudes called him to the place previously occupied
by M. Prony.          This was an unfortunate event.           It was evident to
all those who knew M. Cauchy that he would never consent to take
the requisite oaths.       Negotiations       were  accordingly     at once set on
foot by those who desired his presence           amongst them, with the object
of inducing the Government           to   dispense with the formality.          Men
of science of every shade of political opinion interested themselves in
the matter     ;  but  without   success.      The Government          did, indeed,
consent to reduce the oath to the merest matter                  of form,     but an

                                              39
absolute dispensation it would not concede ; and Cauchy was less
likely to move towards the opposite party than they towards him.
With an obstinacy               quite    puerile,     to use        M.    Biot's    phrase,    he
doubled on their path at every turn                        they took to encompass him.
His resolve rendered all their efforts hopeless; and finally his                              ap
pointment        was    cancelled.       Those       only who know what Cauchy was
capable of, will be able to estimate the loss astronomy has sustained
from this untoward event.
     In    1848    France       saw another      revolution,        and a new republican
government.            Oaths were now dispensed with, and                      M. Cauchy re
sumed his Chair of Mathematics in the Faculty of Sciences.                              But the
events of the 2d December 1851 once more unseated                              him.      Again,
the scientific men            of France (to their infinite credit              be   it recorded)
used every effort to induce the newly constituted authorities to make
his an exceptional case, and dispense with every formality.                             At    first
without success ; but after a while, when the Emperor had                               become
securely established            in his government,             he   had the good       sense to
cause      M. Cauchy to         be restored      to his chair,       fettered by no condi
tions.         Whether from conscientious scruples or otherwise, it                       is cer
tain M. Cauchy never appropriated to his own use one farthing of
his salary. The whole was devoted to deeds of charity. As the
dispenser       of blessings       to the poor, he knew neither monarchists nor
republicans.           In    the neighbourhood of Sceaux, where he resided, he
was the prime mover in every labour of love.                             On   one occasion     the
mayor remonstrated              with him on the prodigality               of his    beneficence.
His reply was,              " Be   not concerned       ;   I   am only the channel ;          it   is
the Emperor that pays the money," alluding to his salary as pro
fessor.
     The scientific character of M. Cauchy requires                        no exposition.          I
 am content to adopt the judgment                      of a competent authority, the
 Dean of       Ely, pronounced nearly            a   quarter of a century ago, which
 will     be fully confirmed by future eulogists. " M. Cauchy," he says,
 "   is   justly celebrated for his almost unequalled command over the
 language of analysis."
     With the private life of a scientific man the biographer has pro
 perly little to do.           But in the present instance, the brilliant virtues
 of the Christian shine            so   brightly upon his genius, that the latter,
 dazzling as it        is,   fails to eclipse the former.                M. Cauchy's labours

                                          40
among the infirm, the destitute, and the young, are the labours of a
true   apostle.      His march       was    always    forward  ;  his   watchword
always     duty.    As     seen by the eye      of the man of science,       he   w as
absorbed     in study   ;  as seen by the eye     of the   man   of God,      he was
absorbed     in labours of love.       In  every scheme     for the instruction,
for the sustentation, for the elevation of his commune,               he was     ever
active, ever devoted.         No amount of labour,        no sacrifice of time or
of money,      was too    great for him.        He   was  accustomed     to wait on
the mayor almost daily, and often several times in the day                 ;  and he
brought with him all his resources            of heart, of  head,   and of purse.
Now    to recommend         a poor   infirm    man   to the charity    which      pri
marily came from        himself ; now    to suggest    the adoption of an orphan
whom he had hunted out             ; now to restore a wounded soldier to his
family   ;  now to organize a school        ;  now to forward     the working       of
                   " He
an   hospital.              had   (says the eloquent mayor of Sceaux) two
distinct lives — the Christian and the scientific life — each so full, so
complete, that it would have served to confer lustre on any name.''
A  characteristic    feature in his good works was that truly Christian
one, that he conducted them without ostentation, and without assum
ing even the shadow of merit.
   A little    before his death, and when it was but too evident that
his end was approaching, he was busily engaged with the cur6 of the
parish in arrangements for the benefit of the people.                   Perceiving
that he was overtaxing         his strength,    the cure besought him to take
rest, adding, that in so doing, he would second              the efforts of those
who were praying for his restoration to health.                His reply      was in
these words,      and they are the last of his recorded words           :—
                                                                             "  Dear
Sir,  men pass away ; but        their works remain.        Pray for the work."
   I  have a pleasing remembrance of the retired chateau at Sceaux,
with its vine-trellised      gardens;    and of tho beaming countenances of
M. Cauchy and his agreeable family.                 In that retreat all      was    as
bright as the summer sky.            To the great     and good man, whose         loss
we now lament,       it   was the dawning       brightness of the morn
                                                                              "  that
shineth more and more unto the perfect day."

    The following Communications were then read : —
1 .  Excursions in the Troad, with Observations on its Topo
     graphy and Antiquities.             By Dr William Robertson,
     F.R.C.P.E.       Communicated by      Dr   J. Y.  Simpson.
    The author had resided for fifteen months, in 1855-56, within
a few miles of the    Plain of Troy, and had made excursions over it
at all seasons.
    His paper commenced with         a  description of the western ex
tremity of the Asiatic coast of the Hellespont, between Abydos
and Koum Kaleh, including the River Rhodius and the sites of
Dardanus, Ophrynium, Pteleos, Rhaetium, and Novum Ilium, all
of which he considered positively identified.         A minute topogra
phical account followed : first, of the valley of the Dumbrek
(Simois)    ; next, of the valley of the Mendere (Scamander)      ;  next,
of the valley of the Kimair (Thymbrius of Strabo) ; and lastly,
of the hilly country between these streams, and of the relics of
antiquity which it included.
    The author believed that Homer's Troy must have stood, like the
Novum Ilium of Strabo, on the hill now called Hissarlik — that the
mouth of the Scamander was formerly two miles to the east of its
present main channel, and that the In-Tepeh-Osmak and Kali-
fatli-Osmak might be regarded as its terminations in the times of
Homer and Strabo.        He showed that these, and the other Osmaks
in the valley of the Mendere, were at present merely                winter
channels of the river, and that in summer they would              be   dry
nullahs, but for the drainings from the extensive marshes left by
the winter inundations of the plain.         He believed that the bay
between Koum Kaleh and In-Tepeh was deeper in the days of
Homer, and that its eastern extremity, in particular, had during
the last 2000 years been materially encroached upon by deposits
of mud and sand from the rivers and        sea.
    He remarked that Homer made no mention of             a river Thym
brius,   and that the Thymbra        which is alluded to in the Iliad
very probably stood in the valley of the Simois, to which           it has
ultimately transferred     its name.    The Thymbra and Thymbrius of
Strabo were certainly situated near the modern farm of Ak-tchai-
kioi on the Kimair.

    An account was given of various excavations, made in 1856, in
some very ancient places of sepulture at Ak-tcbai-kioi,             and among
the ruins     of Dardanus.          In  the former of these cemeteries the
bodies had been buried, entire and unburnt, in very large earthen
urns, along       with    paterae   and lachrymatories of materials        and
forms indicating the earliest stage          of Grecian art.   The cemetery at
Dardanus was more modern              ; and the bodies, which had usually
been burnt, were          here found      in rectangular cysts, built of flat
stones or tiles,       and carefully cemented.          The pottery found at
Dardanus was often of very elegant workmanship, and the painted
or glazed figures upon it less rude than those observed at Ak-
tchai-kioi    ;  but it was singular that no medals, nor coins, nor even
traces of inscription, had been found among these tombs.
2. On the Composition             of the Building Sandstones of Craig-
       leith, Binnie, Gifnock, and Partick Bridge.                 By Thomas
       Bloxam, Assistant Chemist, Laboratory of Industrial Mu
       seum.       With    a  Preliminary Note by Professor             George
       Wilson, Director of the Industrial Museum.
                               Preliminary Note.
    In  prosecution of the analyses of Scottish           building stones com
menced last winter in the laboratory              of the Industrial Museum,
by the examination          of the bed-rock from Craigleith quarry,        four
more     sandstones      have been      analyzed    since  May 1856 by Mr
Bloxam.         The stones in question are the Craigleith liver-rock, and
the Binnie sandstone, from the neighbourhood of Edinburgh, and the
 Gifnock     and Partick      Bridge     stones,  from   the neighbourhood   of
Glasgow.
     As in the    case  of the coarser Craigleith rock, the chief points in
quired into, in the case of each stone, have been the following: —
  1. The specific gravity.
  2. The amount of water naturally present.
  3. The amount of water absorbed by entire aqueous immersion             under
        air.
  4.  The amount of water absorbed by partial aqueous immersion, dis
        tinguished in the sequel as absorption by " capillary attraction."
  5.  The amount of water absorbed by entire aqueous immersion under
        the air-pump vacuum.
  6.  The amount of substance soluble in pure water.
  7.  The amount of substance soluble in water saturated with carbonic
        acid.

                                                43
 8. The     amount       of   substance soluble      in dilute hydrochloric   acid.
 9. The amount of clay present.
10. The quantitative composition.
   From the entire investigation it will                  be seen that, as in the case
of the Craigleith bed-rock, water alone dissolves something                           from
each stone;         water charged with carbonic                acid dissolves an addi
tional   amount of substance              ;   and water containing       mineral      acids,
effects still farther solution.               The conviction    I had
                                                  long entertained,
that the iron stains in sandstones are occasioned not only by the
oxidation of iron pyrites, but by the solution of iron in water con
taining carbonic acid, and which led to the trial, in the case of the
Craigleith bed-rock, of the action of carbonic acid water upon its
powder, is now extended and confirmed.
   The results in full are stated in the succeeding statements by Mr
Bloxam, who has had the entire charge of the analytical inquiry.
His interesting observation, that cobalt occurs in Craigleith stone,
previously announced in relation to its coarser variety, is now ex
tended to the denser liver-rock and to the Gifnock sandstone.
   Copper also has been shown to be present in the Binnie sand
stone, a metal not hitherto suspected to exist in rocks of its class.
Mr Bloxam          has also pointed out the occurrence of nodules of proto-
carbonate of iron in the Partick stone,                  a peculiarity   which probably
will not    be found confined to that rock ; since,              in truth, it   is but the
most exaggerated form of that occurrence of carbonate of iron in
sandstones, to which the extraction                  of iron from them by carbonic
acid water pointed.              Nevertheless,       Iwas quite unprepared for the
carbonate of iron occurring in separate masses of considerable                        mag
nitude, nor was          it in   consequence      of any hypothesis,      but solely by
careful analysis, that           Mr Bloxam        made    this curious discovery.      The
explicit table which             he has constructed, and the commentary               which
precedes     it,   render any further remarks on my part unnecessary.
                                                                                G. W.
                               1.   Craigleith Liver Sandstone.
   The experiments upon the Craigleith liver sandstone were made
with carefully-selected specimens of the stone.   The results are
stated in full      in   the table.
                                     2. Binnie Sandstone.
   The second        stone subjected to analysis was             procured from Binnie

                                                    -14
quarry      ;    it   was chosen      not only as a building material in great re
pute, but also with the view of investigating the bituminous matter
which       is both         disseminated through              it,   and found in sufficiently
large quantities to admit of                  a   special inquiry.
     In    the specimen alluded to, the bitumen appeared in small spots,
becoming moro visible when the stone was heated to 212° Fahr.
When held               melted, burned, and left the stone quite
                      in
              flame,  a               it
white.
  To the consideration of this curious substance the last part of this
paper   entirely devoted
           is             and the experiments upon the stone itself
                                       ;
are given         in the table.
 I        now proceed to          a   few remarks         upon the bituminous                 substance
already briefly noticed as occurring in the Binnie stone.
     It  brittle substance, resembling wax
          isa                                                          to      the touch, fusing at
240° Fahr., and boiling above 680° Fahr.
     It   is slightly soluble in alcohol, imparting to an acid reaction        it                       ;
it   is   somewhat more soluble in ether, in which case the solution also
has an acid reaction.                 It   is   also soluble to      a   slight extent in bisul
phide of carbon            ;    turpentine,      however,     is    its best solvent, giving            a
solution of           a   brown colour.
     The specific gravity of the bitumen                      is    '955   ;   when heated      it   com
pletely melts, then boils, and finally burns away, leaving                                  a   trace of
ash.
     A     large quantity of          it    was burned and the ash examined, when
the following substances were found                       :— silica,        iron,   soda,    and     mag
nesia.
   When subjected to destructive distillation,                             it   furnishes       two dif
ferent products  the first solidifies as soon as
                            :                                                  it   distils over   ;   the
second         remains liquid even at 32° Fahr.                ;     and exhibits           the proper
                                 .....
ties of paraffine oil.
     The first product, when treated with ether, yielded paraffine in
large quantity.
     A     quantitative          estimation of the at,h and volatile matter gave the
following results           :   —
               Volatile,                                                                99S6
               Ash,                                                                          -06
                                                                                        9992

                                        4.5
    A portion of     the bitumen    was subjected to organic           analysis with
chromate    of lead, and gave a mean result as follows              :—
         Carbon,                                                       8437

                              3. Gifnock Sandstone.
    The third variety      submitted to investigation           was   from Gifnock
quarry, situated between        two or three miles          north   of Glasgow    ; it
was procured from        Mr Napier,    chemist, Partick, Glasgow.
    The stone appeared much disintegrated and easily broken.
    The results of the experiments upon this stone, and also upon the
Partick sandstone, may be seen by referring to the table.
                         4. Partick Bridge Sandstone.
    The fourth stone made         the  subject of experiment            was  Partick
Bridge quarry, about a mile and a half due west from Glasgow.
    In the preliminary process of pulverization, preparatory                 to ana
lysis, some pieces     of a black-coloured substance, associated with iron
pyrites,   were   found disseminated           through     the stone, which were
carefully separated, and made the subject of special inquiry.
    When heated, this substance blackened, due to the presence                   of a
small  quantity of organic matter         ;    its solubility    in different   men
strua was ascertained,      dilute hydrochloric         acid being first added    ; it
had, however,     little or  no action.
    The probability of this substance being clay               was suggested   to me
by others ;    but from its extreme         hardness and general weight the
supposition did not seem likely.             I  was led, therefore, to try it by
fusion   with alkaline carbonates.           The fused       mass was    treated, as
usual,   with dilute hydrochloric acid, when             a black residue was left,
which entirely dissolved in more concentrated acid.
    A  small portion of this powder was collected and examined;                     it
was   attracted by the magnet, and its solution               in hydrochloric    acid
 yielded nothing but iron in the state of protoxide.                  This circum
stance suggested the       probability of the supposed clay being, firstly,
clay  very rich in protoxide of iron, or, secondly, entirely an iron
compound,     devoid, or nearly so, of clay         ;  for, on examining the acid
solution   of the fused mass, nothing           but a trace of alumina was dis
covered, at once proving the absence             of all clay.

                                             46
   The black powder attracted by the magnet yielded by analysis
5-78 peroxide of iron, from 6-01 of substance ; while, had the sub
stance been magnetic oxide of iron, the amount of peroxide yielded
would have been             6-   63;   so that we may safely conclude       that     the
substance was nothing more than magnetic oxide of iron,                     produced
during the fusion with the alkaline carbonate.
     The next experiment that suggested itself                was to   try the action
of more concentrated acid upon the supposed                   clay.     The whole of
the substance immediately                dissolved   in moderately     strong    hydro
chloric acid, with the evolution of much carbonic acid gas                  ;   the so
lution on analysis yielded a large quantity of protoxide of iron,
together with carbonate of lime, and traces of sulphate of lime, also
alumina, magnesia, and soda.
     As   a conclusive experiment,          the action of carbonic acid gas upon
the substance suspended                in water was tried.    Upon filtering the
liquid at the       close   of the experiment, and subsequently analyzing             it,
much protoxide of iron was dissolved.
     It   is   obvious, from the foregoing remarks, that the pieces of sub
stance found disseminated through the stone consist entirely                 of proto-
carbonate of iron.
     The ill     effects  of these nodules of proto-carbonate of iron are at
once evident      ;   for  a block of stone freshly cut from the quarry exhi
bits no external mark of their presence within                it   to guide us, and   it
is   not until the rain and air have had their full effect upon           it    for some
time that the stain renders itself visible               as   a   dark reddish-brown
ring of peroxide of iron.

     The following Communications                   were read    : —
 1. On the     Structure of the Reproductive Organs in certain
                    Hydroid Polypes.              By Dr Allman.
     Most of    the   observations contained in the present communica
 tion were made        some    years ago, and during the last autumn the
 author had an opportunity of repeating many of them and of adding
 some others.        His object in now bringing them together was, that
 by being thus placed in possession             of sufficient material,    we  might
 be enabled to make a useful             correlation of the ascertained facts, so
 as to obtain,    if possible, some more general expressions for the phe
  nomena presented.
     To arrive at    such results,      it was found absolutely necessary to in
  troduce some new terms         ;   for in many cases, parts requiring precise
  notions had no distinctive appellation whatever, while in other cases
  they had been known by names which convey an entirely false idea
  of their nature and significance.
                                 Definition of Terms.
      The parts of the hydroid zoophytes,            on which devolve the office of
  perpetuating the species by the exercise of a true generative function,

                                        51
as    distinct from simple gemmation, show themselves, as is well
known, under the condition of external buds, which are produced in
various forms and in various positions on the animal.                To these buds,
which are truly sexual, being in some cases male and in some female,
the author proposes to give the name of gonophore (yon(,                       <pt£tcn).
     As   an essential portion    of the gonophore,        we invariably      find one
or the other of two different kinds of bodies.              One of these presents
the form of a closed sac, in which a more or less disguised medusoid
structure     may in almost every instance             be   detected.       For   these
bodies he proposes      the name of sporosacs (aerojet, tfaxxoj).
     The other differs in     no respect from a gymnophthalmous               medusa,
and may conveniently be designated by this name.
     Both    sporosacs  and medusae contain the immediate                 products of
the generative system, certain individuals               of  each    producing      ova,
and certain others spermatozoa.
     In   some   cases the gonophore       has only a single sporosac, or a
single     medusa, and these spring         directly from the ccenosarc of the
zoophyte.      In  other cases these bodies are numerous, or,             if single,   do
 not spring directly from the ccenosarc of the zoophyte,                   but from a
 special organ (blastostyle) to be presently described.               In   the former
case,    the gonophore      may be called simple           (Gonophora simplex)            ;
 in the latter, compound (Gonophora composita).
     The simple gonophore consists essentially of               a sac,     which is a
 mere extension of the ectoderm of the zoophyte invested or not in
 vested by a polypary, and containing           within it in   some cases a sporo
 sac, in others a medusa.         To this   sac the author gives the name                of
  es.totheque (sxroj, djjxjj).
     A   correct notion of a compound gonophore may be best obtained
  by referring    to some illustrative    example such as that afforded by a
  Laomedea.
     In   this genus the gonophores are produced near the axils of the
  ramuli in the form of oval hollow bodies or capsules, invested like
  the stems and ramuli       by a distinct    polypary.      The axis of       the cap
  sule is traversed by an extension        of the     ccenosarc   of the branch in
  the form of a tubular column,        from whose        sides there bud forth           in
  some cases     numerous sporosacs,       in other     cases   medusae, each with
  an ectothecal investment        from   the column.         For this column          the
  author proposes the name of blastostyle           (/3XadT»|.  ffriXoj).
      In  some cases (e.g.     tubularia)   the  compound gonophore is desti

                                                   52
 tute of its investing capsule, and then presents merely the condition
 of a naked blastostyle with its sporosacs (or medusae                             ?).
     The          like the gymnophthalmaB generally, consist of an
            medusae,
 umbrella or mantle with radiating and circular canals, and with a
 central    projecting        organ,   in    which      the stomach          is   excavated,        and
 which carries the mouth at its extremity.                           To this central organ
 the term peduncle has commonly been given,                          a     name which conveys
a   wrong idea as suggestive of an organ of attachment and support.
 It  isalso frequently called the stomach,  term also obviously in
                                                               a
 correct, as the true stomach may really occupy                             but a small portion
 of the entire organ.               Huxley,* seizing,          as the author thinks, upon
 its true significance,            names   it   polype,     but as    it   will   be more conve
 nient in the present investigations                    to distinguish        it   from the ordi
 nary nutritive polype of the colony,                     it   is   proposed       to speak of       it
 under the name of manubrium,                      a    term suggested             by its position
 with regard to the mantle being such as to admit of                                a     comparison
 with that of the handle of an umbrella.
    The    sporosacs    consist of parts which have their strict homologues
 in the medusae.         These parts will therefore be spoken of under the
 same names as those of their equivalents in the medusae.
    These preliminary remarks will render easily intelligible                                the new
 terms which, after much consideration, the author deemed                                   it   neces
 sary to introduce, as the only way                    by   which cumbrous circumlocu
 tion can be avoided and precision given to our descriptions                                ;   and he
proceeded     in the next place to describe the structure of the repro
ductive system in certain species                  which have in this respect either
never received, so far as he            is   aware, the attention of the compara
tive anatomist,        or which, though             studied to       a   certain         extent, still
present certain points worthy of attention,                         but which have hitherto
escaped notice.
                                   Ht/dractinia echinata.
    In Hydractinia          echinata the gonophores are borne upon certain
polypes, which, as       is   well known, are destitute of tentacles and mouth,
and differ also in some other respects from the other digestive poly
pes of the colony      The gonophores surround the naked stems of

 *    Lectures on General Natural History in Medical Timet.
 t I   have observed in these generative polypes an oval mass nearly filling the
cavity of the body. It    developed from the endoderm, and projects from the
                              is
floor of the cavity.     It   reminds one of tho manubrium of                 a   sporocyst, but is
apparently solid.

                                       53
 the polypes at a short distance behind the distal extremity.               They
 may be seen to consist externally       of an investing sac (ectotheque),
 which is a   simple extension of the ectoderm of the polype, like it
 containing   thread-cells, and totally destitute of polypary.
     Immediately within this is another sac (sporosac), in which the
 indications of decided structure are very obscure.          The second sac
 immediately    invests the mass of ova or spermatozoa           which occupy
 the space between its wall and a well-developed manubrium, which
 lies in the axis of the sac.    The manubrium is a simple diverticulum
 of the endoderm of the polype, its cavity freely communicating with
 that of the latter.    I could find no evidence of an ectodermal layer
 upon it.    There are no gastrovascular canals.
     I have not succeeded in making out any further structure in the
gonophore of Hydractinia, which may be assumed as a type of the
simple gonophore.
    Hydractinia     echinata is strictly dioecious, the male and          female
gonophores being always separated,        so as to occupy distinct colonies.
                               Coryne ramosa.
    The gonophores here belong to the simple type.            They are borne
upon the clavate body of the polypes, where they are scattered irre
gularly among the tentacula.
    They are of a nearly spherical figure,         and   are attached to the
 polype by a short peduncle.
    The manubrium      of the   sac is large and simple, — there are no
radiating canals.
    In the female gonophores the      ova are numerous, and may be seen
in their young state to be each contained in a very delicate mem
braneous caecal tube of a pyriform      shape, which closely embraces        the
ovum, and is attached by its narrow extremity,           which    constitutes  a
sort of neck to the base of the manubrium.              The germinal vesicle
and germinal     spot are distinct.   As the    ova advance     towards matu
rity, they appear to rupture the confining membraneous tube, and
then lie free in the cavity of the gonophore.
    In  the male gonophores, while they cannot be externally distin
guished from the female, the sporosac is filled          with the spermato-
genous cells.     These may be seen,     under    slight compression, to be
arranged in radiating lines, which, with a       little careful examination,
may be traced to the base of the manubrium.             That   these lines re

                                                 54
present exceedingly delicate tubules, filled with the spermatogenous
cells seems evident, and then they will be the exact equivalent of the
pyriform ovigerous            tubes    of the female.           It       is quite possible, that in
both the male and female sacs, the tubes containing the spermatozoa
in the one, and the ova the other, open into the cavity of the manu
brium    and thus facility would be at once afforded for the sperma
         ;
tozoa to gain access to the ova.                    I
                                     have never, however, succeeded
in demonstrating such a communication.
     Indications      of the ova and spermatogenous cells being confined at
an early period within delicate membraneous tubes may be witnessed
in other species,           but in no case have          I    succeeded        in demonstrating
such a condition so plainly as in the present species.
     The spermatozoa           have the usual form            of caudate corpuscles.          The
zoophyte dioecious.
                                      Clava multicornis.
     In this   species,      the gonophores are borne upon the clavate body
of the polype, just where it              passes        into the stem, and immediately
behind the posterior tentacula.                  They are compound,               each consisting
of   a cluster   of   sporosacs       attached to a short blastostyle, but are                 des
titute of investing capsule.              I    have observed             in the same colony two
kinds of polypes, — the ordinary tentaculiferous                             polypes, and others
destitute      of tentacula, and consisting                  merely         of a columnar stem,
scarcely clavate at            its    extremity,        and    destitute        of mouth.     The
gonophores were borne on both kinds                           of polypes.          The male    and
female gonophores are separate on distinct colonies.
     The manubrium of            the sporosac is simple              ;    and there are no radi
ating canals.         In     each          (female) there is usually a single
                                      sporosac
ovum, though           I    have occasionally witnessed two.   The germinal
vesicle is visible         in the ovum, and the              process       of segmentation    may
be   distinctly traced.
     As development           proceeds    the ovum becomes elongated, and it may
be seen to be invested by a proper membrane,                               apparently structure
less.   Within this membrane              a    distinct dermal layer             now begins to be
differentiated from the ovum               ;   while at the same time a cavity is
formed within         it,   and the embryo may now frequently be seen doubled
upon itself.          At     this stage   it   is   ready to escape from the sporosac,
which gives way for its exit, and the embryo may then be seen swim
ming through the surrounding water by the aid of the minute vibratile

                                         55
cilia which clothe it entire surface.          It  is of an elongated conical
figure,    but very contractile.      When fully extended, its surface is
smooth     ;  but when contracted, it is thrown into transverse rugae,
which give it     a close resemblance to an annuloid animal.           The   rugae
never show themselves on the thick extremity,                which always con
tinues smooth, even in extreme contraction.
                           Tubularia coronata.
     In  the Tubularia     coronata (Van Ben.) the gonophores are borne
 upon the body of the polype immediately within the posterior circle
of tentacula.       They consist of    a long blastostyle carrying      numerous
sporosacs, and are destitute of investing           capsule.    The zoophyte is
 dioecious.     In referring   to my notes   of this  species  made some years
 ago, but which      I have not since had an opportunity of verifying,           I
 find that      the phenomena       presented     by the development of the
 ovum point to a type quite different           from what prevails in that of
 the sertularian zoophytes, and in Clava, Coryne, &c.             In the present
 species,    the embryo is not the result of a transformation          of the  en
 tire ovum, as in the instances just mentioned, but is produced from a
 definite portion of the vitellus, the remainder of the vitellus             being
 absorbed by the developing embryo.
     The embryo itself     is developed on an entirely      different plan from
 that of the sertularidans,      &c.    Instead of presenting the form of an
 elongated ciliated cone, destitute of all appendages,           as in the latter,
  it assumes here somewhat that of two short, thick cones placed base
 to base, surrounded at the place of contact by a circle of long filiform
  tentacula slightly thickened at the ends.
      In this condition it   leaves the sporosac, and by the aid       of its long
  tentacula, moves about freely in the water.
      As development      proceeds,   and apparently before it had left the
  gonophore, a mouth is found upon one apex of the double cone, and
  round this mouth, a circle of short tentacula afterwards sprout out.
  In   a further stage, we find that the opposite apex has become elon
  gated    into a hollow peduncle, by which the young Tubularia per
  manently fixes itself to some solid body, while the clavate condition of
  the extremities    of the tentacula entirely disappear,       and these organs
  acquire a uniform thickness throughout.
      Little more is    now needed    to  bring it into the form of the adult
  Tubularia.

                                        56
                    Laomedea flexuosa.         Hincks.
    In this zoophyte the gonophores are of an oral form, generally
truncated at the summit.         They consist of a blastostyle, with sporo-
sacs and investing capsule.
    The blastostyle is in the form of a cylindrical column expanded
into a sort of head at its distal end, and having a distinct ectoderm
and endoderm inclosing a central cavity, which freely communicates
with that of the   cocnosarc    of the polype.
   From the    sides  of the column numerous        sporosacs   bud forth, car
rying with them      an ectothecal investment     from the ectoderm of the
blastostyle, and, being more mature the nearer they approach to the
distal extremity     of the blastostyle.      They possess a large simple
manubrium, and are destitute of gastrovascular canals.
   The whole    is surrounded     by the oval capsule.      The formation      of
this capsule may be observed         by watching   the growth of the gono-
phore.    In  the young state of the gonophore           one or more lacunae
may be seen in the ectoderm of the blastostyle.           These become con
fluent and soon extend round the whole blastostyle, thus separating
the ectoderm into two distinct layers by a true process of choriza-
tion.   The inner layer still remains adherent to the endoderm             ; but
the outer layer      recedes   farther and farther from the central co-           ,
lumn, to which it remains directly attached            only at the proximal
and distal ends, thus forming the walls of an external capsule whose
axis is occupied by the blastostyle, and whose cavity is nothing more
than a large lacuna.         Into this    lacuna  the sporocysts bud forth
from the sides of the blastostyle.       While the gonophore      is yet young
numerous irregular fleshy bands may be seen stretching               across the
cavity from the blastostyle to tho external wall.           These    bands are
the remains of the original union between the two layers into which
the ectoderm of the blastostyle has split.         They are generally torn,
and disappear as the capsule, increasing in size, becomes more and
more widely separated from the blastostyle           ; but they are also oc
casionally more or less visible in the full-grown gonophore.             In  the
meantime, the ectodermal layer, thus separated from the blastostyle,
becomes    invested by a distinct chitinous        polypary   ;  and after   the
capsule has acquired its full size, this ectodermal layer generally dis
appears along with the connecting bands just described, and the

                                         57
capsule is now solely represented by the chitinous              secretion of its
original wall.
    Each sporosac (female) produces a single ovum in which the ger
minal vesicle and spot are distinctly visible. The segmentation of the
vitollus can be easily followed ; and as the segments become smaller
and more numerous, a nucleus may be distinguished                in each.      The
ovum at the same time increases in size, and the manubrium                  of the
sporosac becomes more or less displaced.             After the disappearance
of the mulberry-like condition,          an   external   dermal  layer becomes
distinctly differentiated.      It   is composed     of elongated cells placed
perpendicularly     to the surface, and may be seen to enclose a minutely
granular mass.        The ovum, at the       same time, becomes considerably
elongated, and may be soon seen doubled on itself.              It  now acquires
cilia  on its surface, and is ready to escape as a free embryo from the
 sporosac, which accordingly becomes ruptured to allow of the exit of
 the embryo, which ultimately gains its final             freedom through       the
summit of the capsule.        The embryo now moves freely, by the aid of
 its ciliated surface, through     the surrounding      water.   It  is of a coni
 cal or pyriform figure,     but    very contracted and       mutable.     Its in
 terior may    be seen to be hollowed       out into a cavity, but as yet no
 mouth can be demonstrated.
     I have not yet succeeded       in witnessing      the change of the loco
 motive     to the fixed state of the polype, but it is doubtless similar
 to what has been observed       in the allied forms.
     The male capsules and        sporosacs     resemble the female so closely
 as only to be distinguishable        from them by an examination            of the
 contents of the sacs.      These contents consist of a mass of spcrma-
 togenous tissue, which replaces the single ovum of the female.
    The spermatozoon consist of caudate corpuscles, about J5Vff of                an
 inch in diameter.
    Laomedea flexuosa is strictly         dioecious,  the male and female go-
nophores always occurring on separate colonies.
                           Antennvdaria antennina.
    The gonophores in Antennularia antennina are borne upon the
                                                                               from
 upper side of the short processes which, springing in verticels
 the main stem, give support to the polypiferous            ramuli.

    Each   process carries a single gonophore, which is            of an oval form,
and    presents, as      it approaches     maturity,     a  subterminal      aperture
directed towards the main stem of the zoophyte.
     The gonophore      is constructed on the compound type, and presents
a blastostyle,     sporosacs,   and investing capsule.           The    sporosacs    are
given off near the base of the blastostyle               : there is usually but a
single one    ; occasionally, however, two may be observed in one gono
phore.      The manubrium        is well developed, but there are no gast.ro-
vascular canals.
     In the  female sporosac a single ovum makes its appearance.                    This
at first   occupies    but a small portion        of the cavity of the sporosac,
and permits       the long manubrium        to be easily seen,      but as    it grows
it entirely fills the sporosac,       and   ultimately,    by its pressure, causes
the absorption, first of the walls of the sporosac,              and at last of the
manubrium        and blastostyle, until nothing remains but the external
chitinous     envelope of the capsule, with the              ovum     floating    freely
 within it.
     I have also frequently observed          floating along with        the ovum in
 the gonophore, a small free sporosac           with well developed manubrium,
 but containing       neither   ova nor    spermatozoa.        It   was    probably     a
 bud, formed like the ordinary            sporosacs    from the blastostyle,         but
 never developing within it the generative elements.
      The male gonophores resemble the female in all respects                    except
 in the contents of the sporosacs,        which are hero spermatozoa, instead
 of ova.      In the young gonophores the sporosac              is filled with semi
 fluid contents, which        are found to be composed         of a mass of cells,
 frequently with secondary cells,
                                          "  vesicles  of evolution,"      in their in
  terior.   The secondary cells, whether         free or contained in the mother-
  cells, are filled with a corpuscular        fluid, in the midst of which may
  generally be demonstrated a larger corpuscle, which under the action
  of acetic acid    is rendered     especially apparent as a bright spherical
  nucleus.
      The contents of the      sporosac,  which were at first sufficiently trans
  parent to admit of the manubrium              being clearly seen in the midst
  of them, become         more and more opaque        as the gonophore         advances
  to maturity,      and finally completely        conceal the peduncle.           If  the
  contents be now liberated         by rupture of the sporosac, they will be
  found to consist, partly of free active spermatozoa, and partly of cells
   (vesicles of evolution),     with the spermatozoa still confined            in them.

                                                      50
The spermatozoa consist of a minute oval or rather pyramidal body
with a delicate caudal filament. In each of the vesicles of evolution
there may be distinctly seen a somewhat elongated nucleus which is
the body of the spermatozoa, as yet confined in its vesicle of evolu
tion,     and       is plainly derived from the                   original spherical nucleus of
the vesicle.
   The ovum, from the earliest period at which  have observed                   I                           it,
appears as an opaque yellowish body.   From an early stage    may                                   it
be seen to consist of mass of minute spherical cells filled with
                                   a                                                                        a
yellow fluid, while the whole                        is    enveloped in         a   delicate       vitelline
membrane.              In   the young ovum                the germinal          vesicle may be seen
as   a    single      large spherical         cell included           in the midst of the other
contents, whose opacity, however, makes                               it   necessary to subject the
ovum to compression                    before we can bring into view the germinal
vesicle, which may then be completely isolated as                                   a   separate cell on
the field of the microscope.                      In the more advanced ovum                        the ger
minal vesicle            has  entirely disappeared but     did not succeed in
                                                                  ;        I
satisfactorily         tracing any very distinct segmentation, owing, doubt
less, to the unusual opacity of the ovum.                              The whole         ovum      becomes
gradually converted into the embryo.                              As the time approaches when
it   is   to leave the gonophore, we find                    it   capable of changing its form
by slow contractions,                  and   it    soon     escapes        by   the aperture          of the
gonophore, and enters on the external world as                                  a   free embryo.
     It    is      now of a more or less conical form,                          though       continually
changing its shape                by   slow contractions.             By this time the          ectoderm
and endoderm are both differentiated,                         and   a   central cavity has already
made its appearance; but there                       is   as yet no trace of        a   mouth; thread-
cells, the characteristic                product of the ectoderm, are copiously deve
loped      in   it,   and its surface        is   clothed with very minute cilia, which,
however, in all the examples                      I       examined,        were so enveloped in             a
mucous investment                  as to      impede their            action,       and render          them
powerless as organs of locomotion.                           The embryo creeps about slowly
upon the sides of the glass                   jar    in    which
                                                                      it
                                                                      is     confined, avoiding the
light side of the           vessel.
     After enjoying for period its locomotive stage, the embryo fixes
                                   a
itself to the side of the jar by one extremity (the wider      which                            '()
then       extends       itself    by   means of radiating elongations                      into    a    little
disc      of   a   regular stellate          form.        From tho centre of the                free     sur
face of the disc            a   cylindrical       column       now rises perpendicularly,                 and

                                        GO
the whole becomes invested, at this stage, with a delicate transparent
polypary.      The column continues to grow longer, and now presents
at intervals a shallow constriction.            The ccenosarc which fills its
axis is at first a simple tube with its endoderm and ectoderm                ; but it
soon becomes        resolved into the distinct      tubules which characterise
the coenosarc       in the  stem    of the adult.*        The currents     in these
tubules are very evident, but are quite independent of one another —
sometimes they may be all seen running down, sometimes running
up   ; some down in one or two tubes, up in the others             ; sometimes the
current will     be  very active in some, and at rest in the others.
    From the basal disc small           tubular    filaments     are prolonged to
constitute the commencement of the matted root-like                    base    of the
mature colony.
    From the parts of the stem where the constrictions show them
selves, short, thick processes are shot out alternately at each side,
so   that the stem now presents a slightly zigzag               form.    From the
upper side of each process a pair of the peculiar little cup-like organs,
characteristic      of the adult zoophyte, are produced, and on its ex
tremity the first joint of the polypiferous ramulus makes its appear
ance.      This joint is soon followed by another, and the ramulus
gradually     elongates itself by the necessary          multiplication   of joints.
We     have now a condition       of the zoophyte very remarkable from the
fact of its polypiferous ramuli presenting a strictly alternate arrange
 ment, no tendency to the verticellate disposition of these ramuli in
 the adult being yet apparent.
     Beyond this point     I  have not been yet able to follow the develop
 ment of the young Antennularia.
    * In  the main stem    of the adult,   the disposition  of the ccenosarc   is very
 peculiar.   Instead of forming a single tube, it consists of numerous separate
 tubules, each with its ectoderm and endoderm. The tubules lie close upon the
 polypary, and leave an unoccupied space in the axis of the stem.            They are
 connected to one another by an extension of the ectoderm,        which thus forms a
 continuous lining of the polypary.      In some parts the tubules of the coenosarc
 run straight and parallel to the axis of the stem, in others, they are more or
 less curved, and frequently connected by transverse but irregular branches, so
 as to present a reticulated    arrangement.    The motion of the contents of the
 tubules can be distinctly    witnessed   in them.    This complex structure of the
 ccenosarc  disappears in the ramuli,    the separate   tubules here giving place to
 the ordinary simple tube.

     I obtained this species  on   the 24th September 1857, from rock
pools near low-water       mark   in  Courtmasherry          Harbour, with the
gonophores.      I obtained it afterwards in considerable           quantities to
wards the end of the following        October, from the same locality, ad
hering to Delesseria sanguinea, brought up on the long lines of the
fishermen, but it was then almost entirely destitute of gonophores.
     The gonophores are borne on the creeping stolon, to which they
are attached by a short peduncle.            They are of an irregular oval
shape, with the summit truncated.
     The blastostyle, in every   case  I examined,        carried one largo spo
rosac, which occupied about the upper two-thirds               of the gonophore,
and one smaller, and less developed, springing             from the blastostyle
near its base.
     The sporosacs present some interesting peculiarities.               The ma
nubrium is obsolete, but four gastrovascular canals extend from the
base    of the  sac to the summit,      where they terminate in blind ex
tremities.     These canals send out short, lateral, alternate            branches
between every two of which,         in the female sporosacs, an ovum              is
embraced.      The germinal vesicle and spot are distinctly demonstrable,
 and the ovum is itself invested by a delicate membranous sac, which
 confines it in the sinus between the branches of the gastrovascular
 canals.
     I had no opportunity of observing the development of the ovum.
                            Plumularia pinnata.
     The gonophores, which are compound, are of              an oval form, some
 times smooth,     sometimes with      a   few   irregular spiny longitudinal
 ridges.    They are  borne  on the central stem or rachis, chiefly towards
  its attached end.
      The blastostyle  is but moderately developed,          and carries    usually
 only a single sporosac ; but   I  have occasionally met with two or three.
 The manubrium, after advancing for           a short distance into the sporo
 sac,   becomes   much, but irregularly,        lobed.     Into   these  lobes  the
 cavity of the manubrium      is continued, and they may be            fairly taken
  to represent the gastrovascular      canals, which have no further equi
   valent in this species.    In very young         sporosacs     the manubrium
   appears quite simple, but as the sporosac        advances     tow ards maturity
  the lobed   condition  becomes apparent.

                                        02
   The   ova vary in number.          I  have occasionally found but a single
one   in each    sporosac,    though     most usually     from     three to eight.
They present the germinal           vesicle and germinal        spot, and may be
observed    to undergo segmentation.
   The ciliated embryo         is of the usual conical form.           When about
to change to the        fixed state    it attaches itself by one extremity,
which   becomes    extended in the      form of a four-lobed star, resembling
a Maltese cross, from whose           centre rises perpendicularly          the pri
mordial stem of the future zoophyte, at first in the form of a small
cylindrical   process,  which elongates      itself more and more, becoming
at the same time invested with a delicate polypary.
   We next find that       on one side    of the young     stem a cell is formed
in which the coenosarc becomes developed into a polype.
   Beyond this point       I had no opportunity       of observing the progress
of development.
   I  have found the male         gonophores on the        same     stem with the
female, so that here the usual dioecious            condition is departed from.
The male gonophores are smaller and much less numerous than the
female.      The manubrium is less distinctly lobed, and is surrounded
by a mass of spermatozoa instead of ova.               The spermatozoa consist
of a minute, somewhat pyramidal,              body about zvoo        °f an    lac^ m
diameter, with a caudal filament.           They    are developed      in vesicles of
evolutions, from which they seem to be produced by a transforma
tion of   the nucleus.
   I  obtained the    Plumularia pinnata in abundance with the repro
ductive capsules, during the months of September and October,                       in
rock pools near low-water         mark at Lisnaleen.
                              Plumularia cristata.
    Plumularia cristata       is very remarkable, by a singular arrangement
destined for the protection of its gonophores.
   These are      borne on certain        peculiarly    metamorphosed         ramuli,
 which we must be careful not to confound, as has hitherto been done,
with the proper gonophores of other zoophytes,                and for which, be
lieving it therefore necessary        to give them a special name,             I  pro
pose   the term corbulee,        suggested by their      basket-like      form.     In
these   corbulse  the proper gonophores are contained.                 The peculiar
metamorphosis of the ramulus,             which   results   in   the formation of
a corbula, consists in its developing from its sides            alternate     leaflets,

                                              fi3
which have their edges at first entire, but which                      afterwards   become
deeply serrated.        As the leaflets increase in size they direct them
selves    vertically from the upper surface of                the ramulus, and those of
one side     arch over, so as to approach those of the opposite.                       They
are at first free, but they afterwards                  become        intimately   united at
their    edges, while those of one side ultimately                coalesce     with those of
the other by their summits, and thus form a completely closed                             re
ceptacle.      Each leaflet contains          a cavity which           is only a prolonga
tion of that of the ramulus.
   In     this receptacle the        gonophores are produced.                  They spring
from      the upper side of the metamorphosed ramulus                          at the point
where the leaflet leaves       it,   and take the place of the polype cells on
an ordinary     ramulus.      They begin            to be produced at an early stage
of the corbula,      and    may be easily examined                in the young corbula
while yet open.
    The metamorphosed ramulus generally remains unchanged for                               a
short distance from its origin, and here may be seen bearing one or
 two ordinary polype cells.
    About twelve gonophores are generally contained in each corbula                            ;
 they are of the simple type, of a regular oviform figure, and are
 invested with     a   delicate extension of the polypary.                     The sporosac
 has a well-developed manubrium, which                    is   quite simple, and extends
 nearly from the base of the sac to the summit.                               have not found
 more than     a   single ovum in the female sporosacs
                                                                        I I   examined.    In
 the male sporosacs,         the     cavity    is    filled    with    the spermatogenous
 tissue.
                               General Conclusions.
    A     comparison of the different               forms of gonophore presented by
 the several species just described, and                by    some others not included         in
 the present paper, shows that they are referable to three distinct types.
     1.The simple gonophore, such as we find in Hydractinia, Cor-
 dylophora, &c.
     2.  The naked compound gonophore consisting of blastostyle and
  sporasacs, but destitute of investing capsule. Examples of this
  form are found    Tubularia and Clava.
                       in
     3. The capsular compound                  gonophore,        consisting of blastostyle
  and sporosacs, and having the whole invested by a distinct capsule.
  This type occurs in Campanularin,                  Laomedea, &c.

                                            04
  The gonophores may present a further remarkable condition, in
having a number of them grouped together and included in a
common receptacle formed by modified                     ramuli,    as   in Plumularia
cristata.
     Besides the above types, certain interesting              modifications of form
are presented by the sporosacs.
     In   these the manubrium         may bo
     1. a simple       diverticulum     from the coenosarc           or the blastostyle,
as in     Hydractinia, Laomedea, &c.
     2.   It   may be irregularly lobed, as in           Plumularia pinnata.
     3.   It   may send off from its base true gastrovascular                canals, as in
Cordylophora.
     4.   It   may be completely suppressed, while well-developed gastro
vascular canals spring from the base of the sporosac.                         This condi
tion we find in Campanularia caliculata.
     In   the development of the embryo, we are probably justified in
distinguishing         two distinct    types, though further observations                will
be    needed      before     we can   consider     the    generalization      involved     in
this assertion as absolutely established.
      The embryo may be developed directly from the whole vitellus,
     1.
and will then always(?) present the form of a ciliated conical body.
   2. The embryo may be developed directly from only a part of the
vitellus, and will then always             (?)   present the form of      a   non-ciliated
actiniform body.

with      notices of the focal adjustment in the eyes of oxen, common
fowls, and       in   fishes, as the cod and haddock, the author examined the
different theories which have been advanced to account for this adapt

cular apparatus         was the   principal      and   initiating   agent.

3. Note on the Black Lustrous Varnish of ancient Pottery.
        By John Davy, M.D., F.R.SS. L. & E., &c.
     So far as my reading               extends, the nature of the black varnish of
the ancient Greek and Etruscan                        vases is    still undetermined.
     From  the experiments                  I
                             have made, operating on very small
quantities, abraded from vases which were taken from tombs in
the Ionian Islands,           I    have been           led to the conclusion, that it is a
vitreous matter, coloured by black oxide of iron, probably mixed with
particles       of metallic iron, to which its peculiar lustre may be owing.
     It   is,
           I      find, of the hardness of glass, brittle                         and opaque.              In
powder or small fragments,                  it   is   powerfully attracted by the magnet.
Before the blow-pipe              it   is   fusible, its colour remaining                    unchanged,
however powerfully           it    may be urged             by    the flame.            It   is   insoluble
in the nitric and muriatic acids, and also in the nitro-muriatic, and
without change of colour                ;    but, when fused with boracic acid, and
then      acted on      by   muriatic        acid, its colouring             matter        is   dissolved,
siliceous matter remaining, and the solution                            is   slightly precipitated
by ammonia.
   Considering this glazing as compound of silica and of an alkali,
                                                 a
or of an alkaline earth, coloured iron,  may,         by
                                                   presume, be init          I
ferred, that     it   was applied to the earthenware                    in   the form of          a   paste,
and that the vessels were afterwards                             subjected to          a   temperature
sufficiently      elevated to melt the paste, and convert                         it    into glass, but
not high enough to fuse the substance of the pottery, which                                        I   find
is   fusible at    a    very high temperature.                     It   may also,        I        think,    be
inferred,       that the ferruginous                 colouring     matter         was      mechanically
mixed with the paste, before being applied        inference   am led
                                                                   ;  — an                    I
to, from the circumstance, that where the varnish     very thin,                  is                   it   is
no longer opaque, — the red colour of the clay                               is   seen       through       it
                                                                                                            ;
and, on minute inspection, with a magnifying                            glass, evidently owing
to a partial absence of the black colouring matter.
     Probably the ancient      of superior quality, in which the red
                                       vases,
colour of the clay   so finely contrasted with the shining black of
                             is
the varnish, were subjected to heat, in close vessels, as the Turkish
pipe-bowls, which are of similar material, and of the same pure red
colour, are baked at present                :    they are placed in a dome                        made      of
clay, from        which      the air        is   excluded,       the fire         being       heaped       up
around.

   1. On the         Mechanism of the Knee Joint.                        By Professor
                                           Goodsir.
   After alluding to the comparatively superficial manner in which
physiologists,       with the exception of the brothers Weber, have hither
to investigated the structure and movements of the joints, the author
gave an abstract of the general results which he had formerly obtained
in an examination of the knee-joint, made with reference to Meyer's
valuable        observations.      He had found that,       by Meyer,
                                                                 as stated
the thigh and leg rotate on one another in opposite directions,— at the
close of extension,        and at the commencement of flexion                     ;    and that
the co-ordinated        movements in the patella,              the ligaments, and mus
cles correspond generally              with the account given by that observer                          ;
but in addition he had ascertained what had previously escaped notice,
   1. That the articular surfaces of the femur, tibia, and patella aro
not continuous but faceted surfaces.
   2. That         in consequence        of this faceted configuration,                 and the
peculiar manner in which the opposite articular surfaces move on one
another,        they are in no position of the joint congruent throughout,
but gape more or less in different parts of their extent.
   3.   That in addition          to    their lubricating       function,    the so-called
Haversian  glands, or fatty folds of the synovial membrane, are ar
ranged with reference to the resulting gaps or chinks between the
opposite articular       surfaces, each gap, as it opens             out, being simul
taneously occupied by the fatty                  synovial    pad provided for               it,   and
which           forced or dragged into the chink,              and pulled or forced out
        by is
again           special arrangements.
   The author next         proceeded        to state, as introductory         to the me
chanism of the knee-joint,             the results which he had latterly obtained
in his examination of other diarthrodial                 articulations.
   1.   All diarthrodial         surfaces are faceted,         and consist of areas                of
distinct configuration          and movement.
   2.   These facets and areas             are    marginal     or terminal, and central
or acting — the former            giving    steadiness       to the action   of       the    joint,
and supplying        surface on which        it   rests securely at the opposite ex

                                            OS
tromities of its movements — the latter more especially regulating the
movements themselves, and presenting the greatest extent of sur
face, which again consists of a moiety for each half of the movement,
the one portion breaking contact, while the other is acting, and vice
versa.
   3. Even the acting facets of opposite articular surfaces are only
congruent at one particular stage of their movement.
   4. The movements of opposite diarthrodial surfaces                       upon one
another appear to be in every instance a combination of gliding and
rolling — the amount of the former being directly, and that of the lat
ter inversely, as the congruence of the opposite articular surfaces.
   Referring to the important simultaneous                 discovery recently made
by Langer and Henke,             and verified       by Meissner,   of the screwed
structure    of certain joints, the author            proceeded    to state, that he
would in a future communication on the ancle and tarsal joints give
the grounds on which he had come to the conclusion,
   1.   That in all the joints hitherto examined the screw is               developed
on a conical surface, and not on a cylindrical one, as is held by             Langer
to be generally      the case.
   2. That not only is it impossible accurately to prolong the screwed
surface by uniting longitudinally             a number of casts       made from      it,
but that neither       the original surface nor its cast admits of being
screwed along the mould, with continued congruity of surface.
  3. That this incongruity depends, in the first place, on the screwed
surface being conical, and on the rapid increase in the obliquity of
the thread     ;   and, in the second, on its consisting            of at least two
areas, each being      a   portion of   a   conical screw.
   After exhibiting prolonged screws,           according to Langer's
                                                    made
method, from the upper articular surface of the astragalus   the horse,in
panther, lion, and human subject, the author proceeded to state, that,
induced to re-examine         the knee-joint from this fresh point of view,
he had ascertained,        in the first place, that the path described         by   any
point in the thigh, when the leg            is   fixed, and the knee put through
its movements, does not lie in the presumed plane of flexion and ex
tension, as  would do
               it         the profile curvatures of the femoral con
                              if
dyles   were circular arcs, or logarithmic spirals, according to the
ordinary view, or that of the brothers Weber neither does the  ;
point in the upper part of its course describe the arc of    circle in  a
a plane oblique to that in which        it   must afterwards move,      if   Meyer's

                                       69
observations     be absolutely     correct, but on the contrary       describes  a
 helix, consisting of at least two parts, an upper and a lower.              This
 observation led the author to the detection of two screw combinations
 in the knee-joint   ;  and by a careful study of the anatomical relations
 of the elements of the articulation        he came to the    following conclu
 sions,
    1. The knee-joint       consists essentially of two conical screw com
 binations.
    2. One of these screw combinations forms the anterior,              the other
 the posterior part of the joint.
    3. The axes of these screw combinations, instead of being at right
angles to the so-called plane of flexion and extension, as in the ankle
and elbow joints,      are parallel, or nearly so, to the axis of the limb,
the vertices of the fundamental         cones being directed upwards.
    4. The femoral condyles form the            concave   ; the tibial condyles,
intercondyloid    spine, and crucial     ligaments,    the convex elements of
each screw combination.
    5. Each of these        screw   combinations    is   double-threaded;     the
breadth and obliquity of the threads rapidly            increasing from vertex
to base.
    6.  A  comparatively limited extent of the convex element of each
combination     is retained, so that the larger extent of the concave ele
ment employed moves on the former by a combination of gliding                   in
the direction of the screw, and of rolling.
    7. The gliding in the direction of the screw is due partly to the
screwed    configuration    of the opposite cartilaginous surfaces       ; partly
to the peculiar mode       of attachment of the crucial ligaments.
    8.  In  consequence of the peculiar        attachments of the successive
fasciculi of  the crucial ligaments, these fasciculi, after      having in suc
cession co-operated in producing the gliding movement in the direc
tion of the screw, bend over, and thus permit the rolling move
ment.
    9. The    path   described by any point in the thigh or leg during
flexion or extension of the knee-joint         is a helix,    produced by the
movements of the two screw combinations in succession             : but modified
by the rolling.
    10. The anterior      screw    combination   is left-handed     in the right
knee, and right-handed        in the left.

-   11.. The posterior screw combination        is right-handed   in the left
 knee, and left-handed in the right.
    12. The two screw combinations in each knee are united, so that
the anterior half of the anterior combination,         and the posterior half
of the posterior, are alone retained ; while the external femoral
and tibial condyles respectively consist of the united basal portions
of  one of the threads in each combination ; and the inner condyloid
surfaces respectively of portions      of the other thread in each, but
consequently towards the vertices of the fundamental cones.
    13. When the knee joint is fully extended, its anterior screw com
bination is screwed home, and its posterior is unscrewed        ;  when it is
completely    flexed the anterior combination        is unscrewed,   and the
posterior screwed home.
2.   On the Exhibition of both Roots of a Quadratic Equation
     by one Series of Converging Fractions. By Edward Sang,
     Esq.
    It had been long known that every periodic continued fraction
expresses    the   root of a     quadratic  equation,     and in   1808    M.
Lagrange    demonstrated     the converse proposition, that the roots of
every numerical equation of the second          degree may he expressed
by such   fractions.    The subject has since been examined by M.
                    " Theorie   des Nombres," and also by Barlow, and
Legendre in his
the laws discovered     have   been   applied to the resolution of certain
classes of diophantine problems of the second order.
    The writers    on this subject have considered the two roots of such
 equations   separately, and have regarded the two series of fractions
 which converge to them as distinct.          In the development of     these
fractions the quotients become periodic after one or more terms have
 been  found  ;  resembling   in this way the digits of a recurring deci
mal fraction of which some of the earlier terms are not recurrent.
The object of this notice is to show that these two series form in
reality parts of one general series, the multipliers of which are pe
riodic throughout.      To this particular form of series it is proposed
to give the name duserr, from tho Persian jXiji two heads, or two
leaders.
   The character of the dusurr progression         was exemplified   by con
sidering the roots of the    equation —

                                                    71
    On approximating to these roots                           by the known process, the
quotients

                       and     5 ; 4 ; 1 , 3 ; 4 , 1 , 3 ; &c.,
are found, whence the two progressions                       —

    If, instead of proceeding forwards in either of these progressions,
we compute        backwards, using only the recurring quotients, we pro
                                                  —
                                       4314314
duce the other progression, thus                :

    The    case   of the   roots being on different sides                 of the zero, was ex
 emplified by means of the equation
                                     7*a-8*jr-102y!!=0
 which are contained in the two-headed progression                           —

 and that case      in which the roots lie equally on either side                          of the
 zero by the equation
                                           10*«-5V=0
 the roots    of which are contained in

    It  was remarked that the progressions indicate                            certain peculiari
 ties in those      continued        fractions.         First, that the order of recur

                                       72
 rence in the quotients obtained for one root is inverse of that for the
 other    root of the quadratic      ;  second,   that in continued       fractions
 which express the square root of any rational               fraction, the order of
 recurrence      is symmetric    within    each   period  ;   and third, that the
 last quotient of the period must be double of the first or integer part
 of the root.
    It  was also observed,     that the progressions may be separated into
 as  many      progressions   as there are      members in        the period, each
 progression proceeding as with a single repetend.                  The considera
 tion of this branch of the subject was said to lead to the formation
 of series representing the impossibility of the roots when the square
 of the middle coefficient is less than four times the product of the
 extreme ones, and when these have the same sign.

1.  On the Form and Origin of the Symbols on the Ancient
           Sculptured Stones of Scotland.                By Dr Wise.
   In  continuation of his former essay on the sculptured stones pecu
liar to the north-eastern       portion     of Scotland, the author produced,
for the inspection of the Society, two specimens of the Buddhist dorje,
which he considered to be the prototype of the well-known spectacle-
ornament, found on no fewer than thirty-four of those stones              ;  and, in
twenty-nine instances, in combination with zig-zag lines, the symbol
of power.      The dorje is a portable instrument, which represents the
two original members of the Buddhist Triad, spirit and matter, and
is employed by the Buddhist           priests of Tartary,      &c.,   in the per
formance of religious worship.
   The dorjes which were exhibited              consisted each   of two hollow-
ribbed spheres, or ovals of brass, united by a handle, two inches long,
of the   same metal.     When represented on the black board, with its
axes or poles towards       the spectator, one        of the dorjes     resembled
exactly    the spectacle-ornament        on    the larger Aberlemno       stone    in
Forfarshire.
   The dorje    is considered indispensable to the      Buddhist priest, during
certain religious ceremonies.        It  is held over the head of the kneeling
penitent    in the act of absolution      ;   and a sacred bell   (likewise exhi
bited), having at the extremity         of its handle    a ball  similar    to those
of the dorje, is rung.       In  some     temples direct worship is paid to a
drje kept for that purpose.
      vol.. iv.                                                           K

                                       74
    It is well known that the Buddhist priests were enjoined to spread
themselves over the world for the propagation             of their faith,    and
that they speedily overran, and converted, a large portion of the great
nations of Asia.    As they     are proved to have been known        in Europe,
during the second and fifth centuries,        it appears probable that the
may have reached Scotland by means of Phoenician ships.                  In this
case they would introduce the dorje,     —the indispensable     symbol of their
faith, — and would naturally incise the figure of it upon the upright
stones, possibly erected    at an earlier period, as objects of veneration       :
And in    such representations,     as the priest was not present to com
plete the sacred symbolism        of the Buddhist     faith, by representing
the third member of the Triad, or organized matter, the result of the
interaction of the two former members, this was represented by the
figure of an elephant, or a bird, or the segment of a circle, well-
known as the cockit -hat-ornament,        &c.
    Various instances  were given,    in which the Buddhists borrowed         re
ligious ceremonies from the ritual of the Latin Church.               A similar
combination appears to have taken place in Scotland, on the intro
duction of Christianity   ;   with this difference, that there the faith and
the symbol of the cross eventually prevailed over those of Buddhism.
For a time, however, the old symbol of the deity, the spectacle-orna
ment, or, as it ought        in the author's     opinion    to be   styled,  the
dorje symbol, was retained along with the emblems of Christianity.
From the similarity to each other, of the figures on the sculptured
stones of the north-eastern part of Scotland, they appear to have
been executed by the same        Christian community, and that the very
earliest in that part of the island ; the community,          in fact, to which
Tertullian refers, in  the    third century,   as  inhabiting    those  parts of
Britain never conquered by the Romans, and which, after gradually
superseding the more ancient belief, flourished in the great kingdom
of the Picts.
2.   Notes on the Structure of Amphora, a genus of Diato-
     macese, and the diagnosis of its species.               By Dr Walker
     Arnott.
    When Linnaeus    said that    all objects of natural history must       have
a specific name,  he did not mean a      trivial  name (which was not then
invented), but what is called a short, distinctive character, otherwise

                                                 75
it is not imperative           on   others to adopt the trivial name                            imposed,
or recognise it in any way.   The want of short characters (intended
to place clearly before the mind the few essential points of difference
between supposed new and already known forms or species) cannot
be supplied      by figures or diffuse descriptions                          of the entire object,
as these leave quite            in the dark the precise marks of distinction
observed      by the writer,         if   such    actually            existed.       In composing
either a defining character or              a detailed description,                 it   is also neces
sary to use the technical            language of that science.                      The author, in
referring to Dr Gregory's               paper on the Diatomaceae                     of the Clyde,
published in the last part of the                 Transactions, regretted that this
patient observer had neglected these                        rules, and thus enveloped his
whole memoir in an almost impenetrable cloud                                ;   thus not only pre
cluding himself from claiming any right of priority of names, in the
event of the same form being afterwards correctly characterized by
another under a different             name,      but depriving the paper itself of its
claims      to be considered a scientific one.                          The      same     unfortunate
cloud rendered it difficult to understand                            what    Dr Gregory's actual
views of the structure of Amphora were                          ;   although, from expressions
used by him, he appears to enunciate the theory, that what other
writers call a simple frustule,                  ought to be considered as a double
one.
      The author,   to make         this more intelligible                  to those not generally
interested in such pursuits,              defined what the structure of a diatom
was, as is explained by Smith             in his Synopsis of British                     Diatomaceae       ;
and indicated the mode of proving, by Canada balsam, whether                                             the
 frustule was single or double.               When          tested      in this way, what            was
 commonly called a simple frustule                        was       found to be actually so, and
 of   one   cell, so that      Dr Gregory's           hypothesis            was untenable.           The
 structure     of the genus Amphora appears to have been also slightly
 misunderstood by Kutzing and Smith.                                The real form of the frus
 tule is not a spheroid, as they must have considered                                    it,   but rather
 like that of a coffee-bean, rounded at the back and hollowed out in
 front, the line connecting the two terminal                            and central nodules of
 each valve being        the median line              ;    this line and the central nodule
 are thus not marginal,              as hitherto            described,          but exactly         as    in
 other diatoms in which such are found.                               An Amphora               would thus
 chiefly differ,    by   the    half of the valve on the                    one side of the median
 line being      concave,       while     the other was convex                  ;   whereas, in most

                                                       76
genera of the group                     the two halves of the                   valve     are precisely
alike.
     The form and structure of                the frustule being established, the parts
capable of affording good distinctive marks for species were next ex
amined.    All naturalists agree, that if these are taken from variable
parts, they must be of less importance                            than     if    derived from those
that are subject to little or no variation ; and that no observation
can be relied on, of a permanent kind, when taken from parts known
to change their appearance rapidly.                         Thus, the zone connecting the
two valves of          a   diatom, which, from being a mere line, is understood
to attain the whole breadth                  of the frustule in the course of twenty-
four hours, has been deservedly rejected                     ;    and hence it is to be feared
that few or none of                Dr Gregory's         species    of    " Complex Amphorae,"
which owe their peculiar appearance to                           it,   will stand the test of diag
nostic characters.                As the    striae, costse, or furrows, are the same                       on
both sides of the median line,                         and as the valve          is     folded, those at
the back of the frustule                   must be seen through the medium                              of the
surface nearer the eye, and crossing those belonging to it, so that ob
servations on these relate entirely to the accidental position the frus
tule happens to be in.    This compels one to depend chiefly for es
sential      characters       — 1st,      on the small portion               that       is   seen between
the median line and the apparent outline of the frustule                                     ;   and 2d, on
the form of the frustule                  itself, previous         to the siliceous connecting
zone commencing the process                       of self-division.
     The author            also    stated his conviction that no certain conclusions
could be drawn as to what was a new                           form or species from deposits
or dredgings, on account of the impossibility                            of procuring the species
in an isolated state, and consequently of studying them independently                                           ;
the same species putting on very different aspects, and different spe
cies assuming the same aspect at                        particular      stages of self-division.
     Microscopical          differences are by themselves of little importance.
To    see   is   one thing, to understand and combine what we see, another                                      :
the eye must be subservient to the mind.                                Every     supposed         new spe
cies requires to be separated from its allies, and then subjected                                         to a
series      of careful observations and critical comparisons.                                    To indicate
many        apparently            new   species    is   the work of an hour, to establish
only one on        a   sure foundation            is   sometimes        the labour of months or
years.       In    microscopical natural history as much scrutiny                                 is   requir
ed to    prove     a   new form          to bo distinct from its allies as in chemistry

                                            77
to discover     a new alkaloid, or in astronomy to demonstrate the identity
of two comets.           A  naturalist cannot be too cautious.         It  is better to
allow diatoms       to remain in the depths of the sea,            or in their native
pools, than,     from imperfect materials, to elevate them              to the rank    of
distinct    species,    and encumber our catalogue with a load of new names
so  ill   defined,   if defined   at all,  that others are unable to recognise
them    ;  the same object can be more easily                attained by attaching
tbem, in the        mean time, to some       already recorded species, with the
specific     character      of which they sufficiently        accord.     In all     such
cases the question to be solved for the advantage of naturalists is
not, whether the object noticed            be a new species, but whether           it has
 been proved such, and clearly characterized.

    The following Communications             were read : —
1 . Description of the Sulphur Mine near Conil ; preceded by
     a Notice of the Geological features of the southern por
     tion of Andalucia. By Dr Traill.
    Dr Traill's paper      was divided   into four    sections:    the 1st con

                                          79
tained the geology of Andalucia from the Sierra Nevada of Granada
to the south     ; the 2d described the mountain or rock of Gibraltar                ;
the 3d traced the succession          of rocks from     the Sierra Morena to
the south and south-west        ;   and the 4th described the Sulphur Mine
near Conil.
    1.  In  the part of the Sierra Nevada visited by            Dr Traill, which
was  at about two-thirds of its height, the only visible rocks were
mica- slate,   in its lower portions        approaching    to gneiss, on     which
reposed beds of limestone, evidently belonging              to the same     forma
tion as the slate.      These rocks, too, form the mountain ranges south
of Granada,      towards the shores of the Mediterranean,             near Velez-
Malaga, where they are        covered    by a very shining clay-slate without
organic remains     ;  and   which,     in the Sierras Mijas      and     Bermeja,
often contain beds of white statuary marble.
    The clay-slate continues along the         coast to the south      of Malaga
and Marbella ; but at the Rio Verde it gives place to Old Red Sand
stone, or Devonian strata         ;  while the rugged mountains to the west
appear    to consist of    primary rocks. This Devonian sandstone                  is
the fundamental       rock of the Sierra Carbonera, the nearest range             to
Gibraltar, and around       the bay     of that fortress.     On this appears    to
repose a limestone, which the author referred to the mountain lime
stone.     On going westwards from             Granada     by  Loja, Archidona,
and    Antequera,     the mountains        seem   to consist of limestone like
that of the Sierra Nevada.             But  on  reaching    the valley of   Teba,
he found newer rocks, viz., a limestone containing              shells, on which
reposed   beds  of gypsum and a reddish clay.            In this valley is a salt
lake, evaporated for culinary salt ; and the gypsum often contained
crystals of rhomb-spar.             This valley he therefore considered as
belonging to the Magnesian Limestone             and New Red formations, or
Permian system of Sir Roderick Murchison. Farther to the south,
as about Ronda and Guarroman, a gritty limestone occurs in which
he found ostracites and other marine shells ; and in the valley of
Alhama, in Granada,          similar limestone occurs, with          those  shells,
mytilites    and   corals.     Both formations        he refers    to   the Oolite
system.
   2. The author        described the      geology of Gibraltar,         which   he
referred entirely to the true mountain limestone,             and illustrated   his
remarks     by specimens of the solid rock,           of the fibrous limestone,
and of the calc-sinter deposits containing          bones.

                                          80
    3. The author then traced the different rock formations from the
Sierra Morena       to the south and south-west.
    In this Sierra    he found in the upper regions gray and red                granite,
the latter often containing crystals of andalucite               ;   and syenite also
occurs in some places.          These rocks are generally covered by a very
shining   mica-slate ; but in descending towards the south, this is
succeeded    by clay-slate.        At  S'*-  Elena this       slate    contains    many
crystals of chiastolite,       exactly like that of Cumberland.                 A    little
south of   S1*-  Elena    he found true grauwacke            and grauwacke          slate,
or unmistakeable Silurian formations            ;  on which reposed oolitic lime
stone, containing      ostracites, and other shells.
   The Oolite     occurs in other parts      of Andalucia,       as already noticed ;
and it forms extensive tracks between Tarifa and Conil.
   Still newer formations begin in the valley of the Guadalquivir,
and in the country between Sevilla and Xeres. At Lebrija are hills
of indurated      chalk,    containing     flint.     Tertiary      formations      occur
between    Cadiz and Gibraltar, as well as in other valleys of this pro
vince  ; so that    Andalucia presents formations belonging                 to   all the
great geological epochs.
   4. The Sulphur Mine lies near the sea, about three miles east                          of
Conil.    It  occupies    a small oval valley surrounded              by oolitic   rocks,
and is filled with a bluish marl, the matrix of the sulphur.                          The
sulphur is often finely crystallized         in its cavities, and is accompanied
by crystals   of sulphate of lime and calc-spar. The mine                was   wrought
until about the time of the French invasion of Spain.                      In   1814 it
was not wrought         ;  but this    seemed       less from      exhaustion     of the
sulphur,    than from the troubles of the Peninsula,                  and the want of
fuel to sublime the sulphur.           Magnificent       crystals     of this sulphur
are in the royal cabinet at Madrid.
   The author concluded by some speculations                   on the origin     of the
sulphur in the Mine of Conil.
2.   Remarks on a Slab of Sandstone                        containing numerous
     Cavities,     apparently       produced by         Marine         Animals. By
      Charles Maclaren, Esq.
   This slab    was found      lying on the       sand    about 150 yards within
high-water mark, a          little northward         of  the   projecting      headland
called Whitberry Point,         on the  coast of      East Lothian.         The head

                                                          81
land is of trap, which                   rests on a red sandstone, similar to that of
the slab.           The sandstone              covers     some acres northward                       of the head
land at low water, running out in a succession of ridges in a north
east direction,             and dipping to the south-east.                          The slab is of               a   tri
angular form            ;   its length         is 17 inches, greatest                   breadth         9, and the
thickness varies from                    1J    to 2 inches.              It   rested on the sand, with
the honeycombed face undermost, without any other fragments near
it,and 20 yards, or more, from the nearest sandstone in situ. On
one side    it    is   dimpled with twenty-three round cavities, all cup-shaped.
A     few are so faint as to present merely slight markings                                         ;    the others
are from        1   inch to        1£   inch in diameter, and from                    J        to   £   an inch       in
depth, with rounded edges.                          The cavities shew a tendency                        to   a   linear
arrangement;            those in one line having their sides in contact, or nearly
so   ;   and the whole are               in   two groups, the cavities in each crowded
together, and no one cavity standing                             entirely detached.                     The oppo
site     side     of the slab            has     no     cavities, and          is       thinly covered with
some species of vegetation, apparently                               a   lichen   ;     but there are four
or five small vestiges of cavities, and two large ones on the edge of
the slab.  In explanation of the cavities, was stated that there are     it
many marine animals which bore holes in stones to make lodgments
for themselves,              such       as    those described in Forbes                         and      Hanley's
" British           Mollusca,"           and        in Doctor        Johnston's " Conchology,"
under the titles of Pholas, Saxicava, Petricola                                ;    and in the English
Cyclopaedia, under that                  of " Lithophagida;,"                 including             also the Pa
tella and Echinus. These animals burrow in wood, chalk, limestones,
shale, and some of them in red sandstone.     Reference was also
made       to    Dr Johnston's work                       (Letter         10th)         to    show       that        the
property of burrowing                    in stone         had   been attributed to some terres
trial mollusks (the             " Helix             nemoralis,"      and       " Helix          aspersa"),            by
Dr Buckland, and others, though not                              on very certain grounds.                            Al
lusion     was also          made       to the mode             in   which          the Helixes              named
"    cluster together" on the under surface of stones or ledges of rock,
as presenting an analogy                      with the clustered or grouped                             disposition
of the cavities,              on    what appears to                  be the         "    lower surface"               of
the slab, as indicated                  bythe absence there of the vegetation seen on
the opposite surface.                   The slab had evidently been moved from its
original        site, probably           by   the     action of the waves                    in a storm.             Ho
inclined to the opinion, that the cavities were                                made          by animals like
the Patella, which bore holes to                      a   moderate depth, and being perhaps

gregarious in their habits.       Four opinions had      been proposed as to
the process by which the mollusks        excavate the holes, and are dis
cussed    by Forbes   and Hanley     : — 1. By   rasping the rock      with the
sharp edge of the shell    ;  2. By dissolving    the rock with an acid se
creted by the animal ; 3.     By grinding with silicious particles attached
to some     part of its body ; 4. By vibratory cilia set in motion by
the animal, and producing currents         of water.    But objections have
been made to     all these opinions.
3.   Notice respecting some Artificial Sections illustrating the
      Geology of Chamouni.            By John Ruskin, Esq. Commu
      nicated in a letter to Professor Forbes.
    In  the Proceedings of the Royal Society,        vol. iii., p. 348, an ac
 count has been given by Professor Forbes          of the discussions which
 had then taken place as to the geological        constitution    of the chain
 of Mont Blanc, and as to the reality of the alleged superposition           of
 the primary rock (gneiss) to the secondary (limestone), near Cha
 mouni, and at Courmayeur.
    In  order to clear up any remaining doubt,       Mr Ruskin      caused sec
 tions to be made, laying bare the junction at several points of the
 Valley of Chamouni.         The results, which are perfectly accordant
 with the conclusions   of  the above-cited paper, have been kindly com
 municated by     Mr Ruskin      to Professor   Forbes,    and   are described
 and sketched by him in the following note.           The order of the     sec
 tions is from the head of the Valley of Chamouni towards its lower
 or south-western extremity.
     Specimens of the more important rocks have been placed in the

     Professor     Kelland,       V.P., delivered        the   Keith    Medal,
 awarded by the Council to Professor                    Boole   of Cork    ; on
doing which he said : —
     The Council of the Royal Society, in the exercise of the power
 conferred on them, have awarded the Keith Medal to Professor
 Boole of Cork, for his Memoir
                                        " On    the Application of the Theory
 of Probabilities    to the Question      of the Combination of Judgments
 or  Testimonies,"    printed  in  the  Society's Transactions of last Session.
     In conferring this medal, in the name of the Council, it may
 reasonably be expected that        I  should say a few words on each of two
 different heads   —first, the person on whom the medal is conferred ;
 secondly, the paper, which has appeared to the Council worthy of
 the award.      And I admit that I ought not to decline to fulfil the
  expectation after some sort.         I  shall accordingly offer some remarks
 on these separate topics.
      1. Mr Boole     is a stranger to us    ;   in no way connected with Scot
  land, further than as a similarity of pursuits          connects one intellect
  with another.      To Bishop Terrot alone amongst us, who is labour
  ing successfully in the same department of science with himself, is
  he, so far as I am aware, personally known.               I will therefore en
  deavour to sketch      Mr  Boole's past history, that you may have tho

                 Proceedings of the Royal Society.                           85
materials for inferring the amount of confidence to be placed in the
researches which we have selected for honour.
    Mr  Boole is one of those remarkable men who, under almost every
possible   disadvantage, rises from     obscurity to high eminence.           In
early youth he held the situation of usher in a school in Yorkshire.
After four or five years thus spent, he commenced business as a
schoolmaster, on his own account, in the city of Lincoln, being even
then    under twenty.    He  was   not unsuccessful.       This is   a remark
able fact, when we consider that he delighted in such reading as the
"MScaniqtte Celeste," and      " Liouville's    Crelle's  Journals."       That
                                             8f
such was his reading is abundantly proved by his earlier papers — the
first of which appeared, so far as I know, in the " Cambridge Ma
thematical Journal for 1840." These papers attracted the attention
of the editor of the Journal, Mr Gregory, and a correspondence had
commenced between them, which          the lamented death of the latter
alone prevented being productive       of much valuable fruit.         My first
knowledge of     Mr  Boole, except such as might be derived from             the
papers above     referred to, commenced in 1844, about the beginning
 of which year     he sent to the    Royal Society of London         a  Memoir
 "  On a General Method in Analysis."           Many problems of no very
 great apparent complication     had baffled the ingenuity of mathema
 ticians.   Solutions were, it is true, obtained, but the processes         were
 so indirect and unsatisfactory,   that they were something like excres
 cences on the smooth face    of  science.   Of this    class  of problems is
 an equation which occurs in the theory of the figure of the earth.          Mr
  Airy, in his "Tracts," gives simply the result, without the slightest
 indication   of a process. Mr Gaskin and Mr Leslie Ellis had at
 tacked this individual   problem with partial success.        But   Mr Boole's
  " New Method"      not only set the logical    question     of dealing with
  separation   of symbols in a clear light, but completely effected           the
 solution of all that class of problems, of which       this was a    particular
 example.      The Royal Society did     me the  honour     to refer the paper
  to me, and  I  had the good fortune at once to perceive       its importance,
  and to recommend the Society to bestow on it a mark of approbation.
  Accordingly, the Council of the Society awarded to Mr Boole the
  Royal Medal for 1844, expressing their conviction that
                                                                   " his Method
  would find a permanent place in the science."
     After this he remained many years in comparative obscurity in          Lin
  coln, but at length received the appointment       of Professor of Matho

86                 Proceedings of the Royal Society.
matics in Queen's College Cork,          which  he   still holds.    He com
menced     his career as professor somewhat daringly, by publishing in
succession, — 1st, "A Lecture on the Claims of Science," in which he
advances out of his subject into the domain of mental philosophy.          2d,
"An    Investigation   of the Laws of Thought."     This last volume, which
is equally remarkable for clearness of enunciation,          breadth of gene
ralization,   and originality,    of thought, is the prelude     to the paper
for which     we this day present      Mr  Boole with      the Keith   Medal.
Mr Leslie Ellis      has pointed out in the first volume of the collected
works of Bacon, that some of the germs of          Mr    Boole's ideas are to
be found in the writings         of that great philosopher,     and in those
of Leibnitz.      But this, instead of detracting from the claims of Mr
Boole, is rather a proof of his power, or at any rate of his sagacity
in seizing on and developing ideas which lay unexpanded                in the
records of minds so vast and so original.
    This is all  I  shall say about the person on whom the Keith Medal
is to be conferred.
    2.  Let me now very briefly refer        to the   paper for which this
award     has   been   made.      The problems which the author pro
poses to solve are these     : — 1st, That of combining testimonies whose
different values may be regarded as numerical          measures of a physi
cal magnitude.        2d, The same problem in which the testimonies
are not only expressible, as in the former, but relate to some fact
or hypothesis of which it is sought to determine the probability. Re
lative to the former of these, an important       element, now,     I believe,
first completely discussed,     is the determination    of the   " Conditions
of Possible Experience."         Suppose,  for example, it were asserted
that of all cases of a certain disease, two-fifths of the patients were
affected with shivering and sweating, two-thirds with shivering and
thirst, and four-fifths with sweating and thirst, this very assertion
would be found to contain within itself the elements of its own con
demnation, seeing that it violates the conditions of possibility.
    The other problem has for its object, to combine the force of two
testimonies in support of a fact, the strength of each separate tes
timony being given.         That a complete discussion of this problem
is most valuable in itself cannot be doubted.          What has here been
written may rather be regarded as material          for a future judgment
than as exhausting       the consideration   of the question.      There   are
so many conditions to be taken into account, and such a tendency

                           Proceedings          of   the    Royal Society.                      87
exists    in writers to adopt one general standard of reference, that
a   critical examination like the present, which certainly does much
towards throwing              down the buildings             of others, cannot fail to have
great        value, even should its own foundations                    not stand.        This    is
not like a discovery in pure analysis,                 — the opening up of a royal road
from      one position to another,              — so   much as a survey of the ground,
with a view              to the assertion       that the right road lies on this side,
and      not on that,          of some         given obstacle.        In    the   name   of the
Council,       I    beg our Vice-President, Bishop Terrot, to take charge of
this Medal for Professor Boole, and to express to him our wishes
for his future success in the career to which he has devoted himself.
Bishop Terrot is not, in this instance, a mere passive spectator, nor
a mere hand to convey a reward from one party to another ; he
stands in the light of a participator in the honour, and that to no
small extent. The problem of combining two or more probabilities
of the same event received from Bishop Terrot a solution in our
Transactions             two years since, to which the present paper is proba
bly due.           Here, for the first time,               was given the form of the proba
bility or value of expectation due to entire ignorance, as an inde
terminate fraction.   This result, as indeed the other conclusions of
Bishop Terrot, the present paper satisfactorily confirms.   Bishop
Terrot, therefore, whilst                I
                          doubt not he will cheerfully transfer the
award to       Mr        Boole, will still retain a share in the honour.
    The following Communications were then read : —
        1.    On the Average Value of Human Testimony.                                   By
                                             Bishop Terrot.
    The author              began     by       some        remarks   upon     the    expression
—        —
              ^ — t-           .    or       — — — = U.          Where p represents the
pv + (l — p) . (1 — v)                       pv + wq
a priori probability of             an event attested by a witness whose veracity,
or the ratio of whose               true assertions           to the number       of all his   as
sertions      is,   v.    He observed that U, or the ultimate probability of the
asserted fact, depended upon the accuracy of the numerical                                value
given to v, and that men have never such knowledge of their neigh
bours' antecedents, as to assume this value with anything like an
approximation to the truth.
  It was then suggested that                          a more definite       result   might      be

obtained, by assuming, from experience, the value of                                                 U, and thence
determining             the value of v.                    The instance adopted                      was      that of a
man saying              that out          of a bag containing                          99 white balls and one
black, he has at the first trial drawn the black.                                              In such a           case, so
long as there exists in our minds no suspicion of a motive for false
hood, the assertion is absolutely believed ; that is to say, we give to
U    the value unity.                But p being the proper fraction                                1   £0,   U     cannot
equal     I unless v=           1 ;      that is to say, unless we consider human testi
mony, even to improbable events, as certainly truthful, in every case
where there exists no suspicion of the action of a motive for false
hood.        The suspicion of such motive at once prevents                                           us from            giving
to   U    the value       1 ;    that         is,   from receiving the assertion as absolutely
true.        If,   for example, the man                          who drew the black ball was to
gain      L.1000 by our being persuaded that                                      he had done so, we should
not readily take his word for the fact that he had so succeeded.
     It   was then noticed that the expression for the ultimate probability
given by Laplace was
                                         vr+(l— v).(l—                     r)
                                              —
             w+ (1—                                           j^v.
                                V)   .   (1       r)   +             (1   —   r)   x            v)
where     r   represents the probability that the witness,                                           though intend
ing to tell the truth, deceives himself.                                          If    in   this expression             1   be
substituted for (r) this formula                               coincides with                           —    ^
                                                                                                                        l—v
                                                                                                                             ,
                                                                                             pv +   (l   — p)       .
for all the        cases treated in                  the paper are cases where there can be
no reasonable suspicion that the witness                                      is   deceived.            It    was at the
same time allowed that there are numerous                                              cases where        a       suspicion
of this, or        some other            disturbing force, may reasonably                               be suspected.
But     it   was maintained                   that such cases, however numerous, are ex
ceptional,         and are very few compared with those                                        to which no sus
picion       attaches      :     and          that     were          this not the              case,     human            tes
timony        would        be of no practical value, and human society could
not subsist.             The final inference was, that habitual credulity less                                      is
unreasonable             than habitual                     incredulity        ;    that      in the former                 the
exception          is   sacrificed to the rule,                      in   the latter the rule                is   sacrificed
to the exception.

 2. On the      Tides in the Sound            of Harris.        By Henry C.
      Otter, Esq.,   R.N.,   Captain H.M.S.          "  Porcupine."       Com
     municated by       Dr Stark.
   The author stated that during summer, in neap tides, the stream
flows from the Atlantic into the Minch all day, but from the Minch
into the Atlantic all night.      In winter this was reversed, the stream
flowing through the Sound of Harris from the Minch into the Atlan
tic all day, but from the Atlantic into the Minch all night.
    In   spring  tides,  both during       summer   and winter,     the stream
comes in from the Atlantic during the greater part of the time the
water is rising, and flows back into the Atlantic during the greater
portion of the fall of the tide.
   The rise and fall of the tide     was found to be much more influenced
by the direction and force of the wind than by the moon's parallax.
Thus, a strong southerly or south-west wind raised the water to
equinoctial height, but produced a very poor            ebb.    The velocity of
the current through the Sound of Harris was            stated  to be about five
miles an hour during       spring    tides, but only from two to two and
a-half miles an hour during neap tides.
   Various other interesting particulars were mentioned relative              to
the local peculiarities of the tides in the     " Narrows     of Berneray," at
the  " Hermetray Group,"       and at the     " Groay Group,"       and a dia
gram was exhibited,      by means of which the time of high water and
low water could be easily found in the Sound of Harris, on knowing
the moon's meridian passage.
   Dr Stark, whocommunicated the paper, appended a note, endeavour
ing to account for the peculiarity       in the current through      the Sound
of Harris, attributing it to a difference in the level of the water in
the Atlantic and the Minch, caused by the attraction of the sun.
So long as the sun was north of the equator, and its attractive power
was greatest over the North Atlantic, the level of the Atlantic during

1.   Note on the use of Subacetate of Lead as a means of se
     parating some of the Vegetable Alkaloids.                          By Thomas
      Anderson, M.D., F.R.S.E.
    In  a paper on the crystalline         constituents    of opium, read before
the Royal Society of Edinburgh,             I described a process      for separating
thebaine from papaverine and narcotine, with which it occurs mixed
in the opium liquor       I  examined.       This   process consisted in convert
ing the mixed bases into acetates,           and adding to the solution an ex
cess   of subacetate   of lead, by which the feebler        bases are precipitated,
and the stronger thebaine left in solution.
    As it   is  familiarly known that in        those  plants in which alkaloids
are found, they rarely occur singly, but are generally associated in
groups of two or more, often very closely allied in their properties,
and consequently        require for their        separation,   processes      of consi
derable complexity,         I  have been       induced to make a few experi
ments, with the view of ascertaining                whether    the method        I  had
applied with success to the opium bases could be used for other sub
stances.       These observations     I   offer, not as exhausting the subject,
 but merely as an indication         of a path which may             be   followed   by
those engaged      in the examination of the natural                bases with some
 prospect of success.
     When a dilute solution of acetate of strychnine, containingan excess
 of acid, is mixed with a saturated solution of subacetate of lead, until
 its reaction becomes       alkaline,   and a further quantity of the lead-
salt added, the fluid at first remains perfectly clear            ;   but after some
time minute crystals of strychnine             begin to be deposited, and go on
gradually increasing in quantity for four-and-twenty                  hours.     If the
solution be highly diluted, the strychnine              is deposited      slowly,  and
then appears        in very regular      crystals, occasionally of considerable
size.    Concentrated solutions,       if  violently agitated, are rapidly filled
with precipitated strychnine.
    If  brucine be treated in a similar manner,             the solution remains

                  Proceedings of the Royal Society.                         93
perfectly clear, and, even      where violently agitated,     no   precipitate
makes its appearance.        At  the end of twenty-four hours, the fluid
is still clear, although   I  have once or twice, when the solution was
concentrated, observed    a few    needle-shaped crystals     of the   base at
the bottom of the fluid.
    Acetate of cinchonine, in moderately diluted solution,          begins   to
deposit small crystals of the base almost immediately          after the sub-
acetate is added, and the quantity goes on increasing for some hours.
Agitation produces an immediate precipitate.
    Quinine is not deposited from its acetate,      even on standing    during
the night, provided the solution be dilute       ; but  if concentrated and
briskly shaken, small tufts     are occasionally thrown down after stand
ing for some hours.
    Morphine and thebaine are not thrown down from solutions of
their acetates, even after standing ; and codeine, as might be anti
cipated from its solubility    in water, is entirely unaffected.       On the
other hand, narcotine, papaverine, and narcine are instantaneously
precipitated   as bulky powders.
    These facts indicate the importance       of a more minute       attention
being paid to the deportment of the vegetable alkaloids with sub-
acetate of lead.      We observe that in the case of the two cinchona
and the two nux vomica alkaloids,          the difference is very marked,
and the reaction might be used as a means of separation, and pos
sibly also of purification.    Most of the substances found in vegetable
extracts, such as gum,     &c, are precipitated by       subacetate   of lead  ;
and in the case of the stronger        bases, it might   be possible to effect
purification  by extracting    with acetic acid, and precipitating    with the
subacetate.     The strong base would then remain in solution along
with   excess  of lead, which being precipitated with sulphuretted hy
drogen, would carry down colouring matters, and leave a pure ace
tate in solution.    I have not attempted to put this process into prac
tice, but recommend a trial of it to those chemists who are engaged
with the examination of the natural alkaloids.
 2.  On the Colouring Matter of Persian Berries. By Mr                   John
           Gellatly, assistant to Dr Anderson, Glasgow.
    Two varieties of the    seeds  of the Rhamnus tinctoria are found in
 commerce, known by the names of Persian and Turkish berries.              The

  94                Proceedings of Hie Royal Society.
 former are said to be gathered before being fully ripe, and are care
 fully preserved;   the latter have remained much longer on the branches,
 and are brown and shrivelled.          Kane     has examined         both varieties,
 and finds in the former a substance which he names Chrysorham-
 nine, soluble in alcohol and ether, and crystallizing               from the latter
 in minute silky needles of a brilliant yellow colour.                This substance
 is replaced in the ripe berry by another, which              he    names Xanthor-
 hamnine, of a much less beautiful           yellow, and not crystal lizable           ;
 this change is effected also by boiling the chrysorhamnine                   for a few
 minutes with water.        Xanthorhamnine          is easily soluble       in alcohol
 and water, but quite insoluble in ether.
     The Persian berries which the author examined yielded to ether                  no
chrysorhamnine, but with alcohol they gave a considerable quantity of
 a pale yellow substance    in fine crystals, which     was believed to be       Kane's
 xanthorhamnine,      although that chemist did not obtain             it crystalline.
     It is prepared by digesting the coarsely-ground              berries for a short
time with boiling methylated spirit, filtering and expressing the re
sidue.     The fluid   is left for several days, to deposit a dark-coloured
 resin, and then poured off and set aside.             In about ten days, it is
converted into a yellow semi-solid        mass.        This    is   pressed and re-
crystallized    several times from alcohol      ;  when nearly pure, the crys
tals appear as the solution cools.
    Xanthorhamnine appears in tufts of            dense   silky needles, of a pale
yellow colour, and nearly tasteless.              Readily soluble in cold and
warm water.        It dissolves also in alcohol, and very readily when hot.
It   is quite  insoluble even in boiling      ether.      The analysis of three
separate preparations, dried at 212°, gave results somewhat differ
ent from Kane's ; and, guided by the products of decomposition de
tailed in the paper, the author proposes           for the substance the for
mula C46 H2s O2s, which agrees with his experiments,                     as shown by
the subjoined comparison —

     A   compound, prepared by adding                neutral   acetate       of lead   to an
alcoholic solution of the colouring matter, keeping the latter in ex
cess, approaches the formula C46 H2s O2s, 2PbO, 8HO.
     When xanthorhamine           is boiled with weak sulphuric acid, it is re
solved into grape sugar and a yellow powder, which the author pro
posed to name Rhamnetine               ;    showing the colouring         matter to be a
glucoside.       In   the proportion of its constituents,            its softish, nearly
tasteless crystals, and insolubility in ether, it agrees with these bo
dies generally.
     The composition of rhamnetine                 agreed   closely with the formula
C22H10O10.       It is almost entirely insoluble in water, alcohol, and
ether ; alkalies dissolve    and acids reprecipitate
                                 it,                  from an alkaline

solution.   The ammoniacal solution precipitates metallic salts.
     On adding the formula of rhamnetine to that of grape sugar,                            we
have xanthorhamnine          plus      6    atoms of water.

3.    Account of some Experiments on Radiant Heat. By B.
       Stewart, Esq. Communicated by Professor Forbes.
     The object of      these experiments           was to compare together            the ra
diations from         the polished         surfaces of different  bodies, all having
 the temperature of 212°.                  In   order to heat the bodies,    tin box
                                                                                 a
 was used, double-sided and double-bottomed,                    or   a   box within    a   box.
 Water being kept boiling              in   the interval, the interior chamber was
 found to have a temperature of nearly 212°                    ;   and on the bottom of
 this chamber the bodies to be experimented on were placed.                             When
 being used these were taken out of the chamber and placed before
 the sentient pile of      a     thermo-multiplier, the galvanometer                   needle
connected with which was immediately deviated from its zero posi
 tion. The extent of the first swing of this needle was taken to de
note the quantity of heat that fell upon the pile, and this deviation

  96              Proceedings of the Royal Society.
 taking place in about 12 seconds after the substance had been taken
  out of the boiling water apparatus, it was found that during this
 small portion of time the substance might be supposed           to keep     its
 original temperature of 212°, its cooling being      so small as to be ne
 glected.
     In order that different    substances   might  bo compared     with one
 another, the same amount of heated surface was always presented
 to the'pile.
     In the first group of experiments, the quantities     of heat radiated
 from polished plates of different substances (heated to 212°) were
 compared with the quantity radiated from a similar surface of lamp
 black at the same temperature.         It was found that glass, alum, se-
 lenite, and thick mica, radiated very nearly as freely as lamp-black ;
 while the radiation from rock-salt was only 15 per cent. of that from
 lamp-black.
     In the second group of experiments, the quantities of heat ra
 diated at 212° from polished plates of the same substance, but of
 different thicknesses, were compared with one another.
     It was found that    thickness   made   a scarcely perceptible    differ
 ence on the quantity     of heat radiated by glass,   a somewhat     greater
 difference on the quantity radiated        by mica,  and a very sensible
 difference on the quantity      radiated by rock-salt  —a   thick plate of
 this substance giving more than a       thin plate, in the proportion of
 nearly 5 to 3.
     The third group of experiments showed that heat from a polished
plate of any substance is less transmissible through a screen of the
same substance      than heat from lamp-black ; this difference being
exceedingly marked in the case of rock-salt, — the same rock-salt
screen which transmits      Jths of the rays which fall upon it from
heated    lamp-black,  transmitting   only  Jd of the rays that   issue from
heated rock-salt.
    The fourth group of experiments showed that heat from a thick
plate of any substance is more transmissible through a screen of the
same substance     than heat from a thin plate.
    These four groups of experiments        show that the radiation     from
diathermanous     bodies,  such as rock-salt,   is much less   copious than
that from bodies of an opposite nature, such as glass      ;  and also that
the radiation from diathermanous bodies increases with the thickness
of the plate.

    It was shown that all these results follow from Prevost's theory
of exchanges.       For if  we suppose   a plate    of rock-salt        placed in a
chamber of lamp-black,       all at 212°, then,    since     the temperature         of
the rock-salt remains the same,       it must radiate         as  much as      it ab
sorbs.    But  since  it absorbs but a small proportion of the lamp
black heat, it will radiate but a small proportion, and since a thick
plate of rock-salt would absorb more than a thin plate, it would also
radiate more.
    The radiation of such     a thin plate is therefore equal to its               ab
sorption.
    It was then shown that for every separate           ray of which the he
terogeneous radiation of 212° is composed          this equality must hold            ;
and that for every such ray the absorption of such a thin plate = its
radiation.
    It was shown that the reason why rock-salt is opaque to heat from
rock-salt is this.     There are a few rays out of the total lamp-black
radiation of 212° for which rock-salt        is opaque    ;    these   rays, there
fore, are rapidly absorbed by a thin plate of rock-salt              ;  but the ra
diation   being equal to the absorption        for every kind of heat, this
thin plate will chiefly radiate such rays, which will consequently be
stopped by a screen of rock-salt.
    In  conclusion,  it was  shown that     if  we have a chamber, whose
walls are composed      of different substances, kept at          a uniform      tem
perature, the heat radiated and reflected together                from any given
portion of the surface of its wall will be independent of the nature of
the substance of which that surface is composed             ;  the only difference
being, that in the case of a metal,       it will    be   chiefly reflected and
little radiated heat, while in the    case  of lamp-black it will          be altoge
ther radiated heat.         But for all substances, radiated              + reflected
heat = a constant quantity.

     In this     paper it was        shown that the usually           received theorems
concerning the faces of polyhedrons are true only of one class of solids.
The theorem that " no solid can have every one of its faces more
than pentagonal" was             contradicted      by the    exhibition      of a solid
bounded entirely by hexagons.                Each corner of this solid      is   trihedral,
and the sum of all its angles amounts to four times as many right
angles as there are corners             ;   whereas    the usual theorem           is,   that
" the                  any solid amount to              times as many      right angles
         angles   of                            four
as there      are corners,    less   eight."     The number of uniformal solids,
that     is   of solids of which all the faces have the same number                        of
sides,    and all the corners the same number                   of angles, instead of
being five, was shown to be indefinite                by the exhibition of the solid

 1.   Notice respecting the remains of a Seal, in the Pleistocene
                      of Fifeshire.      By Dr Allman.
     Professor   Allman exhibited     a portion of a pelvis of a seal, which
 had    been   recently   obtained from   the   Pleistocene    deposits in the
neighbourhood      of Kirkaldy,     and sent to him for determination           by
Mr    Martin Rigney of that place.
     From a note received from Mr Rigney, it appears that the bone
 was found in the Tyrie clayfield, about two miles west of Kirkaldy, and
about a quarter of a mile from the shore of the         Firth,  and that    it lay
  18 or 19 feet below the surface of the soil, and about 30 feet above
 the present level of high-water.          It  was  unaccompanied        by any
 other remains.
    Mr   Page had already noticed the occurrence of a very perfect skele
 ton of a seal from another locality in Fifeshire ; and the great rarity
 of such remains in the British Isles appeared         to Professor   Allman      a
 sufficient reason for placing the present instance also on record.
  2. On    Theories of the Constitution of Saturn's Rings.                    By
                         Professor Clerk Maxwell.
    The planet Saturn       is surrounded by several concentric        flattened
rings, which appear to be quite free from any connection with each
other, or with the planet, except that due to gravitation.
    The exterior diameter of the whole system of rings          is estimated at
about 176,000 miles, the breadth from outer to inner edge of the entire
system, 36,000 miles, and the thickness not more than 100 miles.
    It is evident that a system of this kind, so broad and so thin, must
depend    for its stability upon the dynamical equilibrium between the
motions of each part of the system, and the attractions which act on

100                                          Proceedings             of   the
it,    and that the cohesion                  of the parts of         so large       a    body can have no
effect whatever on its motions,                            though      it      were made       of the      most
rigid material known                      on earth.        It   is   therefore       necessary, in order
to satisfy the demands                        of physical astronomy, to explain                        how    a
material system, presenting the appearance of Saturn's Rings, can                                             be
maintained in permanent motion consistently with the laws of gravi
tation.            The principal             hypotheses         which present themselves                     are
these —
             I.     The rings are solid bodies, regular or irregular.
             II.    The rings are fluid bodies, liquid or gaseous.
           III.     The rings are composed of loose materials.
      The results of mathematical investigation                                 applied to the first case
are, —
      1st.    That             uniform ring cannot have               a     permanent motion.
                        it a                      by
      2d. That                 is   possible,          loading one side of the ring, to produce
stability of motion, but that this loading must be very great                                              com
pared with the whole mass of the rest of the ring, being as 82 to 18.
      3d. That this loading must not only be very great, but very nicely
adjusted       ;   because,          if it   were less     than '81, or more than -83 of the
whole, the motion would be unstable.
      The     mode        in which         such   a     system would be destroyed would                       be
by    the collision between the planet and the inside of the ring.
      And     it   is   evident that as no loading so enormous in comparison with
the ring actually exists, we are forced to consider the rings as fluid,
or at least not solid                 ;   and we find that, in the case of                    a   fluid ring,
waves would be generated, which would break                                     it   up into portions, the
number of which would depend on the mass of Saturn directly, and
on that        of the ring universally.
      It     appears, therefore, that the only constitution                               possible for such
a   ring
             is
             a      series of disconnected masses, which may be fluid or solid,
and need not be equal.                          The complicated internal                   motions of such

a   ring have           been

original disturbance with all its consequences.                                       The motion of         one
of these waves was exhibited to the Society                                       by   moans      of   a   small
mechanical model made                        by   Ramage of Aberdeen.

the only one consistent with permanent motion,     further confirmed                 is

3. On a peculiar Ligament connecting the opposite Ribs in
   certain Vertebrata. By Dr Cleland. Communicated by
   Professor Goodsir.
   While examining the bones of a seal which had been for some
time in maceration, the author observed that, in detaching one of
the ribs from the vertebral column, a long ligament, connected                              to
the head of the former, emerged from the intercostal foramen.
   It   was then found that the right and left rib in all the pairs articu
lating with two vertebrae were connected across the mesial plane by
a ligament which was attached at each end to a depression on the
lower part of the continuous convex cartilaginous surface of the head
of the rib, and      was lodged        in a tube on the floor of the spinal canal,
formed by a groove on the upper surface of the corresponding inter
vertebral    disc covered by the superior                    longitudinal     ligament,    and
lined    by a synovial      membrane common to the tube, the ligament
contained in     it,   and the entire heads of both the ribs.
   It appeared       probable that this peculiar transverse intercostal liga
ment would be found developed in the mammalia directly as the flexi
bility of the spine.
   In    the weasel and squirrel           it   is   fully   developed   ;   also in the lion,
fox, and dog     ;   but   in   the three latter the single synovial membrane
common to the entire arrangement only lines the groove on the su
perior    edge   of the intervertebral           disc and the under surface of the
ligament, the latter        being thus in contact above with the superior
longitudinal ligament of the spine.
   In    the sheep and horse the fibres of the anterior half of the liga
ment are attached midway to the posterior superior margin of the
body of the vertebra        in    front.     In      the sheep there are two synovial
membranes for the head of each rib, — the posterior on each side com

horse there are not only two synovial membranes for the head of
each      rib, but an intermediate        for the ligament itself.

     In   the   rabbit, fibres extend across from the head of one rib             to that
of the opposite, but are closely incorporated                 with the intervertebral
disc.
     In   the kangaroo, monkey, and human subject, there                     is no trace
of the transverse intercostal ligament.
     The author is inclined          to consider this transverse intercostal        liga
ment as represented by the transverse ligament of the atlas, and both
structures as morphologically            related to the perforated form of the in
tervertebral disc.
     The communication              concluded with observations on           the relative
movements of the ribs and spine, in connection with this ligament ;
and on its probable functions.
4. On the Movements                  of the Articulation of the Lower Jaw.
     By Dr John Smith.                Communicated by Professor Goodsir.
     After alluding     difficulty of determining the precise anato
                           to the
mical configuration of the condyles of the lower jaw, especially in
the human subject, the temporo-maxillary articulation admitting of
a multiplicity of movements, and these again being liable to modifi
cation by different accidental and other conditions of relative struc
tures, such as the teeth, &c., the author stated that a general                    prin
ciple would nevertheless be found to prevail, and in general to be
distinctly traceable in this joint, whatever might be the modifications
existing either in its function or external form.
     In man, and many of the mammalia,                 one    essential movement of
the lower jaw consists in simply opening and shutting the mouth,                        in
a vertical plane       :   here the temporo-maxillary         articulation    is said   to
act as a simple hinge.              Another essential motion         is that by   which
grinding of       substances        between the molar teeth during mastication
is   performed     :   here the action         of the joint    has   apparently    been
regarded as somewhat irregular and subordinate in its nature.
     In   the first-mentioned         movement, however, the condyles cannot
act as a simple hinge, as they lie — not at right angles to the plane
of motion of the lower jaw — but obliquely to                it,
                                                each condyle looking
inwards and forwards.    Their more perfect action, therefore, cannot

occur in this movement, but seems to belong to the second we have
mentioned, viz., that of mastication.
   The articulating surface, strictly speaking, on each condyle appears
to constitute the thread, or rather part of the thread, of a conical
screw passing       over an axis lying at or about right angles to the
plane of motion in simple opening and closing of the jaws. This
spiral course of the articular surface is perhaps best seen in some of
the larger carnivora, such as the lion, but is also obvious in a well-
developed human condyle.
  The action of this conical screw or tap within the glenoid cavity,
considered      as the conical die, takes place with            accuracy only when
one   joint alone acts with the condyle within the glenoid cavity — the
other condyle being beyond         it,   and gliding upon the surface of the
zygoma,       as during mastication.      The food      is   in this   process crushed
between the molar teeth of that side whose condyle remains within
the glenoid cavity this condyle screwing the jaw back,
                      ;                                                      so to speak,
to its natural position at each closure of the teeth.
   By this construction     a   great amount of friction           is      avoided   ;     what
would otherwise        be a rubbing      being thus converted               into      rolling
motion between the condyloid and glenoid surfaces                 ;    while       by a   one or
other condyle always remaining           in the glenoid cavity during masti
cation greater steadiness and security          is   afforded to the joint.

                              Professor Forbes.
      " During   the last month of March   I    made some experiments on the
properties of ice near its melting point, with particular                     reference to
those of      Mr
             Faraday, published in the Athenaeum and Literary
Gazette for June 1850, to which attention has been more lately

of glaciers.

session of the Royal Society closes,            to place on       record some facts
which     I   have observed, and also some conclusions which                   I          deduce

   "    1. These observations              I   have confirmed.          But   I have also   found
that metals become frozen to ice when they are surrounded by                                 it,   or
when they are otherwise prevented from transmitting heat too abun
dantly.          Thus   a   pile of shillings          being laid on      a   piece of ice in a
warm room, the lowest shilling, after becoming sunk in the ice, was
found firmly attached to it.
   "    2.   Mere contact, without pressure,    sufficient to produce these

effects.     Two slabs of ice, having their corresponding surfaces ground
tolerably flat, were suspended                  in an inhabited room upon           a   horizontal
glass rod passing through                  two holes in the plates of ice, so that the
plane of the plates was vertical.                     Contact of the even surfaces was
obtained by means of two very weak pieces of watch-spring.                                  In     an
hour and         a   half the cohesion           was so complete, that, when             violently
broken in pieces, many portions of the plates (which had each a sur
face of 20 or more square inches) continued united.      In fact,                                  it
appeared as complete as in another                        experiment       where similar sur
faces were pressed            together by weights.              I     conclude that the effect
of pressure in assisting  regelation"

the larger surfaces of contact obtained                         bythe moulding of the sur
faces to one another.
   "    3.   Masses of strong ice, which had already for                      a   long time been
floating in unfrozen water-casks, or kept for days in                          a   thawing state,
being rapidly pounded, showed                    a   temperature 0o,3 Fahrenheit below

decidedly inferior to 32", not less,               I      think, than 0°-35 Fahrenheit.

    I  think that the preceding results are all explicable on the one
admission, that Person's view of the gradual liquefaction of ice                                   is

peratures           cannot continue so without            interaction.         The water must
give off heat to the ice, but             it   spends   it   in an insignificant            thaw at
the surface, which therefore wastes even though the water be what                                       is

isolated between         two ice surfaces       colder than itself.     The former
equilibrium       is now destroyed.         The films AB&a and A'B'&V were
kept in a liquid or semi-liquid             state  by the heat communicated             to
them by the perfect water beyond.                 That   is now   removed, and the
film in question has ice colder than itself                on both sides.       Part of
the sensible heat          it possesses    is given to the neighbouring          strata
which have less heat than itself, and the intercepted film of water in
 the transition state becomes more or less perfect ice.
       " Even if the    second surface be not      of ice, provided it be a bad con
 ductor, the effect is practically the same.              For the film of water is
 robbed of its heat on one hand by the colder ice, and the other badly-
 conducting       surface cannot afford        warmth enough to keep the water
 liquid.
       " This  effect is well seen by the instant freezing       of a piece of    ice to
 a worsted glove even when on a warm hand.                    But metals may act
 so, provided they are prevented from conveying heat by                  surrounding
 them with ice.          Thus,   as has been shown, metals adhere to            melting
  ice."

            1.   Opening Address.                     By Professor Kelland.
   During the vacation,                I
                           had looked forward with confidence to the
pleasure of listening to-night to an address from one of the ablest
experimenters and most vigorous writers that this Society has ever
numbered amongst its members, — Sir David Brewster.                                       And when,
a short time since,          I   learnt that      I   had been indulging an ill-founded
expectation, and that the duty of opening the session was to fall to
my own lot,       I    experienced          something more than disappointment.
For, in addition        to my imperfect               knowledge of the past history and
present position of the Society,                  is the fact that       I   had    made no pre
paration, either in the way of collecting                         materials, or of providing
a reserve     of time, for drawing up an address.    must therefore           I
come     before you with an apology.                     I
                                        must crave your forbearance
should some of the remarks which                      I make appear          trite and unworthy
of the occasion, — should others be traceable to what     have said                   I
elsewhere, — should  all be found crude and  lower in tone than be
seems the position       in which your kindness places me.
   The primary topic in such                 an address           must be one suggested by
the first glance which the eye takes around the room on every open
ing session   — the     record of the changes which death has                             effected in
our body.        The list of members deceased                         within the year              is,
                                                                                                    I
regret to say, unusually               large, comprising           no fewer than two hono
rary, and fifteen ordinary Fellows. Amongst these are names of note,
— such as those of Lord Dunfermline, the Lord Justice-Clerk Hope,
and Lord Handyside,              — men     whose distinguished               professional career
has brought      them prominently             before the public,             and the tribute             to
whose memory       is   recorded on broader pages                      than       issue from this
place.     There are others, whose walks                     in   life, and scientific pursuits
in particular, brought their doings more directly under our notice,
— such as Dr Fleming, Professor Gregory, Mr Jamieson Torrie, Mr
Tod,     Mr Jardine,    and       Mr Morries Stirling.
  In selecting     some          of   these for   a   few    brief remarks,       I   trust   it   may
not be inferred       that
                         I        deem the others             little worthy of notice.                   A

                                                      Ill
sketch   of the labours of Dr Fleming                            has    already been         laid before
the Society.           A brief     notice of Professor                  Gregory has been drawn
up by    Dr Alison, and            he has come here                to-night      to present it to the
Society in person.             Time and opportunity                     have been wanting to me
to collect extensive information                     respecting   Mr Tod and Mr Jardine ;
whilst in the         cases of   Mr     Jamieson            Torrie and Mr Morries Stirling,
I   have had the advantage of the kind assistance                                of Dr Balfour, Dr
Christison, and       Mr Andrew Coventry.
     Suffice     it to say, that Mr Tod was for                          no less than twenty-nine
years Secretary to the Royal Scottish                            Society of       Arts, the duties of
which    office he discharged with such efficient and ready zeal as to
have rendered himself                  ultimately the centre and moving power of
that Society, by every member of which ho was highly and deservedly
esteemed.          On our own meetings                   he was a regular attendant                    ;    but
he reserved his active energies for the Society to which his tastes
and his official position more directly attached him.                                   As    a disinter
ested patron of youthful inventors, as a friend to every unfriended
projector, his loss will be severely felt.
     Of Mr Jardine all             I   can collect       is,     that he possessed           keen intel
ligence and great mathematical                        powers.           In his       early career he          is
said to have given promise of the highest eminence, attracting the
attention of Professor Playfair, to whom he was under deep obliga
tions.   I       possess   a   copy    of   a   book presented to him                  by   the author      —
the Supplement to Legendre's                         " Theorie des Nombres."                   The testi
mony, even         to this extent,              of   so distinguished            a   man as Legendre,
is   no small matter.              Mr Jardine            appears to have been                     too easily
satisfied      with    the     position which            his professional skill                as   a      civil
engineer secured him, to admit of his using the exertion requisite for
figuring in        a   broader sphere.                His attainments, however, were                         by
no means limited to            a   knowledge of his profession.
     Fifty years ago, when geology                          was        not   a   common study,              Mr
Jardine laboured in that field                  ;    but the fruits of his labours were, so
far as I    know, communicated only to his friends.                                    It   was    a   merit
even to study amongst                  the rocks in those days               ;   when the country-
people were not accustomed, as they are now, to meet with gentle
men converted for the time into stonebreakers.   Professor Sedg
wick     tells    a    story     of his arriving                 late, hammer           in hand,           and
groaning       under    a    load of specimens,             at   a     little inn in        some remote
district, and of the worthy Boniface bringing out                                in   turn each of his

                                          112
 children     from its bed to have        a look at the        " daft" man. I am
 reminded of this story by what              I  have    been    told of Mr Jardine.
  When Professor Jameson           was on     his first visit to Arran, collecting
  materials      for the mineralogy       of the island,        he   on one    occasion
 arrived,     after   nightfall,  at a public-house        near Loch Ranza, and
 asked     if he could obtain       some   refreshment and a bed.             The reply
  was,
         "  Aye, aye, ye may hae         some refreshment,         but for a bed       ye
 maun e'en lie down beside that man on the table."                     To Jamieson's
  no   small     delight  and astonishment,         "that man"         was   his friend
 Jardine,      sound   asleep, after a hard        day's geologizing     amongst the
 hills.
     Thomas Jameson          Torrie, Esq., Advocate, evinced in early life a
  fondness for natural science, which, under the able tuition of his
 uncle, Professor Jameson, resulted in his becoming an excellent
 mineralogist and geologist.           He   was    also distinguished       in Botany.
 He     became      a member     of the Plinian Society in 1824, and was
 elected President of that Society in 1827.                  He contributed papers
 to the Society, and proved himself a zealous student of natural
 science.       In 1828     he joined    the Wernerian Society,          and became
 ultimately      associated with     Dr Neill in the secretaryship.              Owing
 to his retiring habits,         Mr Torrie     did not appear much in public,
 either as a speaker or as a writer.             He did much, however, to            en
 courage science, by the ample collections which his independent for
 tune enabled him to accumulate.                  He had travelled extensively,
 and was well acquainted with the geology of Europe.                       To the loss
 of science, he was attacked, whilst in the vigour of life, by rheuma
 tism, brought on by exposure.             The attack     was succeeded      by partial
 paralysis, which affected        both his powers of memory and his speech.
 Hence it happened that           for many years, whilst warmly interesting
himself in all that was doing in natural history, his own partici
pation in the labours of scientific progress was effectually stopped.
He    was much beloved        by an extensive circle       of friends.
     Mr John Davy Morries Stirling,           was son    of Captain Morries, of      the
Royal Navy, and nephew of Major Davy,                       a distinguished     officer,
who perished in captivity in Candy in Ceylon, after the well-known
fatal    expedition      against   that   capital     early   in    the present cen
tury.        Mr Morries       was    educated    in Edinburgh for the medical
profession, and graduated in 1831, after having given great promise
as a   student.      Both before     and  after graduation         he  showed   a  pre

                                       113
ference for chemical inquiry, and manifested an aptitude for original
 research.     To him is   due the discovery     of one   of the neutral crys
 talline proximate     principles   of the   vegetable    world,   elaterine,     the
active    ingredient   of elaterium,     which   was   also made       known       by
 the late    Mr Hennell     of London about the same             time.       Subse
 quently,   the first  appearance of the malignant           cholera,    in 1832,
 attracted his ardent mind, — at the time a subject of universal                 and
 intense interest, — and    thus, for a period, the practice of his pro
 fession became     the object of    Dr Morries' life      ; and he settled in
 London    as a physician.     Circumstances     soon    led him, however, to
 give up that pursuit    ; and marriage     with a lady of property,           sister
 of the present   Mr Stirling     of Kippendavie, occasioned a change of
 name, and the abandonment of all professional objects.                  Not long
 after his marriage     Mr Morries Stirling        took up     his residence in
 Norway, where he remained several years. The account of the dis
covery of the admixture of metals, on which was founded his patent
 iron, and several other patents, which have been successfully worked,
 I  owe to the kindness of     Mr Andrew      Coventry.      When residing in
Norway,      Mr Stirling     devoted   his   time to field-sports,       in which
he engaged with great enthusiasm.            Hunting, shooting,       and fishing
occupied his days whenever it was possible to get abroad.                   But,   as
the weather was not always propitious, he was sometimes               kept within
doors.     On these occasions,     he tried his hand at the construction           of
the implements used in the field.        On  one occasion,    he was astonished
to   find  the fish-hooks,     which   his experiments        had    produced, to
possess wonderful     toughness, quite different      from anything         he   had
previously    turned out.     With a true philosophic spirit, he set about
diligently   to search out the cause.      Had he done anything unusual ?
Was there any element, either of matter or of manner, to which he
might attribute his success ?          He could discover none.             But his
man,    on   being questioned, remembered that they had stirred                  the
molten metal with a tin spoon.          On this hint, he repeated       the expe
riment, and the result        was   the patent iron, which          consists    of a
mixture of iron with tin or some other metal.                  To this he has
added other patents of great value.          And here permit me to offer a
word of caution to our younger Fellows.             The principle of division
of labour    seems almost to be a     law of nature — it is certainly a law
of society.     The genius which evolves      a scientific invention is rarely,
very rarely indeed, combined with that genius which can turn                   it to

                                                116
  of Scotland      is incrusted with multitudes of         little shells, having within
  them little birds perfectly shaped,              supposed to be barnacles.
                                                                                       " The
  bird in every shell that           I  opened," he says,
                                                             " as well the least as the
  biggest,    I  found so curiously and completely formed, that there ap
 peared nothing wanting                as to the external     parts for making           up a
 perfect sea-fowl        ;  every little part appearing so distinctly,              that  the
 whole looked like a large bird                seen through     a concave      or diminish-
 ing-glass, colour and feature being everywhere                      so   clear and neat.
 The little bill like that of           a goose, the eyes marked, the head, breast,
 neck,   wings, tail, and feet formed            ; the feathers everywhere perfectly
 shaped," and so on.
     We may smile,           I   say, at this tendency to      interpret natural phe
 nomena by the aid of a vigorous imagination, but we must admit that
 it  was better than that stolid uninterpretativeness                which preceded it        ;
 and, at any rate,         it  ended     in the clear day of truth which the next
 generation saw in full blaze.                The object of an association at such a
 period was, from the nature of the case, union of minds and hands in
 questioning nature. What could one man hope to do by his own in
 tellect, by his own resources 1 Accordingly, we are not astonished to
 find that the primary objects which men proposed to attain by union
in those days were natural instruction, and assistance in common in
quiry. The Society's minutes of the period abound in the language of
entreaty.         Every man who had a chance of getting at information
was earnestly called upon to               avail himself of it.     And      we are not to
condemn men, through the application of our superior enlightenment,
because,     like the Florentine academicians, they                 made      it  a rule   to
believe everything            possible     until the contrary       could       be   proved.
They     were justified,       I   think, in ordering fresh hazel rods to be pro
duced,      " wherewith the divining experiment                  was    tried    and found
faulty."        And     we    cannot blame them because, when the Duke of
Buckingham           had presented the Society with a piece of a unicorn's
horn, they proceeded            to  try its virtues in retaining within          a charmed
circle   a poor spider, which, however, contrived                 to run away spite        of
their repeated efforts.
    Now, our circumstances are very different from theirs.                         Physical
science is not, as it was then, a dreamy mystery, struggling for life
in the breasts of        a  few speculative philosophers.            It   has made     itself
eyes   in the     telescope,     arms in the steam-engine, wings in electricity.
It is  a  living thing.         Men     may now rest on science       itself for support,

                                           117
 and not on each other.          It    is only extreme cases       of views     pushed
  beyond the ideas of the       age, — of    views anticipatory      of the future of
  science, — that    seem to demand the support            of societies.      We   may
  admit respecting some of the generalizations of Faraday and Owen,
   for example, that had they emanated from some remote, unheard of
  country-side, they would have           made   no immediate impression, and
  would have fairly seen the day only in the next generation as sin
 gular foreshadowings of doctrines then familiar.                 But   these are ex
 ceptions, not the rule.
     Neither is combination now,          as of old, essential to the prosecution
 of experimental       research.      Societies, in their corporate capacities,
  are no longer      searchers after truths.          They    leave    that   work   to
  individuals.    Not only are we not called on to unite in the prose
  cution  of experiments, but it rarely even happens that we are called on
 to lend pecuniary      aid to such objects.      It  is possible that this Society
 may have been too restrictive             in its grants for the prosecution of
 experiments ; but assuredly this is an error in the right direction.
 A Society like this should never, as it appears to me (but I, of course,
 give my individual opinion only), by its funds undertake researches
  which may either prove of doubtful value on the one hand, or form
  an honourable      incentive   to individual      energy on the other.           The
 only reasonable grounds on which            I  can imagine grants of this kind
 may be legitimately         founded, are these three         : — The     reduction of
 experiments      already made      ;   the repetition    or examination        of old
 experiments    ;  and the continuation of researches which have                  been
 presented to the Society and approved by them.                   And that the So
 ciety, through their Council, have practically recognised these prin
 ciples will appear, when          I    mention    that   the grants which have
 been    made   during the last twenty-five years have been limited al
 most exclusively to the purchase of magnetical and meteorological
 apparatus,    and to the reduction          of the observations        made    at the
 Makerstoun Observatory,           at the      Calton   Hill,    and at    Mr Adie's
 residence.
     Having now pointed out what are not             the objects of such a Society
 as this,   I may be fairly expected to state what             I consider    those ob
jects to be.     They appear      to me      to consist mainly      of  these two,  —
 mutual influence and publication.
     The   end of our intercourse is encouragement and guidance, often
even restraint.        The history of the world tells many a sad tale of
     vol. iv.                                                            a

                                            118
the waste of solitary           strength.    Some of the most illustrious         names
even    have suffered           from   the want of cotemporary corresponding
genius.      Witness         Roger Bacon,     Tycho Brahe,       Landen.       But     this
is not all.       The injury which great men sustain from want of                   colli
sion is    not half so blighting as that which they occasionally                     com
municate.        It   is the prerogative     of  a commanding intellect to create
for itself a sort of worship, and this worship is the certain cause of
the retardation of that branch of knowledge on which it has erected
itself.    Take Newton.             When his philosophy       was once mastered by
his countrymen,              they felt themselves      elevated with       him    to the
highest pinnacle of excellence.                Here   was   a system     of   reasoning
which opened all the avenues of human knowledge.                      They naturally
considered that, in order to advance,                they had only to pursue             the
track which he had beaten down.                 Progress was in their eyes simply
extension of what Newton                had done, and as he had done it.                 On
the Continent there was no such reverence                 for Newton's      name.         Of
 his labours,       it is true,     men   gladly availed themselves      ;   but whilst
 bowing to his conclusions, they yielded no obedience                 to his methods.
 In respect       to the Differential       Calculus, Leibnitz and his followers
 had adopted, from the first, an alphabetical notation capable of                     com
 bining with the other characters which enter into analytical reason
 ing, — a mode of representation as superior to that of Newton as the
 plain English of my pen is to the Egyptian hieroglyphics.                             And
 what    followed       ?     Whilst   the  continental     mathematicians         pushed
 triumphantly through the thickets of                  science,   opening     up every
 where districts          rich in fertility, the English timidly followed             them
 at a vast distance,             contented now to clear away a stump,                   now
 to explore       a secluded       nook which the continental          mathematicians
 in their    hasty sweep           over the country      had    passed  by unnoticed.
  Is this to     be accounted         for  by a difference in the genius           of the
  people  ?     I   think not.       For,   since  the   abandonment of their             old
  methods,     since the introduction of improved processes                by Peacock,
  Herschel,     and       Babbage, our island       has   produced mathematicians
  of the very highest stamp, inferior to none of their generation.
  The simple explanation seems to be, that our countrymen were
  bound hand and foot in the chains of the beautiful                     but inexpan-
  sible systems of Newton, and rapid progress was to them an im
  possibility.       Nor is Newton the only great              man    whose     influence
  has been     excessive,       and to that    extent injurious.       The   very     same

                                          119
thing had occurred in France in the preceding generation ; and
Newton and the " Principia," actually broke down the evil influence
in   France which they contributed to erect in England.             The   seventy
 years which lie half in the seventeenth, and half in the eighteenth
  century, constitute       the most barren period of French science.           A
  brilliant constellation,    — Pascal,  Fermat, Mersenne, with Descartes at
 their   head,  —had just     set, and thick and long-continued darkness fol
lowed.        The brightness of Descartes had blinded the eyes of science.
Need      I  refer to an earlier period, when a similar influence effectually
checked all progress, until Galileo broke the chain which had held
the civilized world in bondage for centuries, —a chain which Aristotle,
a mighty genius like Newton and Descartes, had bound about his
 followers.       In a minor degree,     the same influence has been exerted
 by Bacon, by Locke,           and by others.     Now, surely it may be ex
pected that a Society like this, not restricted to men of one science,
nor even to men of science at all, but embracing every department
of human knowledge, should             operate  powerfully as a preventive to
the recurrence of such evils.           The influence of great men is rarely
injurious, except       at a distance, or after their     personal influence has
disappeared.         It  was so in the case of Newton.         Contact destroys
erroneous impressions,        — changes evil into   good.   Correspondence and
cotemporary        publication    produce much of the same effects.        Hence
great names always appear in clusters.                 Hooke and Huyghens,
and Leibnitz and the Bernoullis, lived around Newton.               It was after
his death that his countrymen placed him on a solitary pedestal.
Minds, like trees, spring upwards from their mutual shelter. The
poet's
            " lodge in    some vast wilderness    ;" the dreamland of literary
leisure is not the soil in which great thoughts thrive.            Real science,
real philosophy,         I   had almost said real poetry, comes from the
dwellers among their fellow-men, —comes from the smoke of great
cities. The heart of man drinks in inspiration from the thoughts
 which are floating about it.           Thus, for example, in the science of
optics, — a     science which seemed to be exhausted, — Malus and Biot,
and     Young and Brewster, and Fresnel and Arago, mutually in
 fluenced each other, and their influence extended to Fraunhofer and
 Cauchy, and Wollaston           and Seebeck,    and   Airy and Herschel and
 Plateau, and Wheatstone and Purkinje,and Hamilton and M'Cullagh,
and    Lloyd and Stokes       ; until the list of men raised to enduring fame
 by a single     worn-out science is too long for enumeration.

                                                120
      Unquestionably           a large amount            of the influence which is here
traceable is due to publication rather than to personal contact. And
this fact brings before us one of the most                            valuable elements of our
union.       The writings of            deep and     original thinkers               in any       science
are      not likely to be self-supporting.                       If    successful, their          success
must be slow.             It   is only a reputation        of the highest order that                     can
ensure      the sale of heavy thought.                    Youthful discoverers have                         no
chance of success.              In     some departments           of knowledge,            so crushing
is this expense          of publication,       as even to destroy societies.                    The Me
moirs of the Analytical Society, containing papers by the greatest
mathematicians of Britain, reached but one volume, of which,                                            pro
bably, not half a dozen copies were ever sold.
                                                                           " The Mathematician,"
            "                                   Journal,"
and the          Cambridge and Dublin                                 have ceased to exist.              The
advantage        of a large society like this             is,   that    it   constitutes both             the
publisher and the public.                 Thus papers uninteresting                       to the mass,
perhaps even uninteresting to all at the time of their publication,                                       are
handed down to future thinkers, where, in                         a   newly turned up soil, they
may grow and produce rich fruit.   The work of publication  perhaps                          is
our greatest work, — perhaps our properest work.  The torch of truth
ishereby trimmed and passed on from age to age.   The great English
philosopher describes              man as the interpreter               of nature.          But      this    is
not his characteristic designation              ;     for are not the beasts, are not the
birds, are not the very insects, interpreters of nature                              ?     It   is   as the
interpreter        of    man — the        interpreter       of man's            records   — that        man
stands distinguished.                   Thus   reason           transcends        instinct       that       its
gifts are transmissive               and cumulative.              Mind       does    not stand sup
ported      by   the mind which exists around               it,  — not      simply, not mainly, —
there     is
          a      higher and        a   broader support.               The minds of the            great
                                                                                                             of
by-gone ages live and work in the breasts of their successors.                                          The
old Greeks,                          knew this, and embodied                    it   in the fable           of
                 I      suppose,
Athene, the goddess of knowledge, who sprang                                    into existence,          not
as   a   naked, helpless child, but as              a    grown-up being, clad              in   complete
armour, from the head of Zeus.
      Hence the importance of publication.                            It   is   at once    the    food      of
existing thought and the seed of future knowledge.                                   A     society      such
as ours has some little difficulty,                 it   may be,            in rendering          its    two
functions        of personal            influence    and         of    publication         harmonious.
Personal intercourse may operate injuriously                            on publication.           It    may
reasonably be expected                 to swell our      Transactions             with    unimportant

                                           121
papers, the contributions of members whose                 merits are viewed         by
too friendly an eye.        On   the    other hand, publication        may tend to
sour personal intercourse.           If such     papers only are selected as are
 likely  to prove valuable      to cotemporary and future           thinkers,    there
 is a possibility   that disappointment may ensue,            and   with it    ill  fel
 lowship.     The Council have        a  difficult duty in this   respect, and they
act wisely     in referring   the   papers presented      to them,    in every case
where there is the slightest doubt, to parties at a distance, out of the
sphere of local influence.         The estimation in which our Transactions
are held is an evidence       at once of the care which is bestowed             in the
selection of papers,     and of the high scientific position        of the Society.
To you, the existing members,             is confided the duty      of maintaining
that position, and of upholding             the character    of our Transactions
 before the world.
2.  Account of the Life and Labours of Dr William Gregory.
                                  By Dr Alison.
    Dr   Gregory,    at the time     of his death, which took place           on the
24th of April last,       was Professor        of Chemistry in the University of
Edinburgh, and one        of the Secretaries of this Society.          He was born
on the 25th of December            1803.        His father  was the late    Dr Gre
gory   ;  for   a long time professor         of the practice of medicine in the
University of Edinburgh.            His brothers, James Crawford, who took
the degree of medicine in 1824, and died in 1832, and Duncan,
who, when he died, was a Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge,
were both so highly distinguished             for their talents and acquirements
as to be worthy representatives of a family of no small distinction in
the   science     and literature      of the country      ; but,   in   Dr Alison's
opinion,    Dr William Gregory           was    the member of the family           who,
in our day, had shown the greatest original talent                  and devotion to
science    for its own sake.       His   love of science manifested itself at an
early period.        He  had    been    present at an introductory        lecture by
Dr Hope, which          was illustrated      by striking experiments.         Several
of these experiments         he contrived         to repeat by means       of   a rude
 apparatus which he constructed              for the purpose.       From that time
 he had always       before  him the object          of ambition which      he     ulti
 mately     attained.    It  was    not,     however,    until  he   had   made      his
 name known        throughout     Europe as a chemist, as a favourite pupil

                                                  122
and friend of Baron             Liebig, and the approved translator                   of several
of his works, and had established his reputation                              as a teacher         of
his favourite        science                    Dublin, and King's
                                  in Edinburgh, Glasgow,
College, Aberdeen, where he was appointed Professor of Chemistry
in 1839, that he at length, in 1844, obtained the Chair of Chemis
try in the University of Edinburgh.
   Dr Alison next referred                 to    Dr Gregory's published writings                 and
scientific papers in proof of his command of practical chemistry, of
his remarkable power of condensation and clear exposition of chemi
cal principles, and of his just perception of the many important                                 dis
coveries by which the science of chemistry was advanced                               during his
lifetime. He had formed plans which, had his health permitted,
would have resulted in a course of chemical instruction not surpassed
in extent and importance in any single school in Europe.
   It    was, however, unfortunate                 for   Dr Gregory, that though            a man
of large make, and capable during youth of much exertion                                      both
bodily       and mental,        he    had       neither opportunity          nor disposition       to
take    so   much muscular            exercise as would probably have suited his
physical constitution.               In   consequence,       also,   of   an attack   of   fever in
1826, he became             liable,    during       the remainder of his life, to           severe
pain and swelling in one of his legs on any unusual exertion.                                 It   is,
besides, worth notice, that he had repeatedly decided febrile attacks,
which were         distinctly     traceable        to    the inhalation       of sulphuretted
hydrogen, and other gases, in his laboratory.
   He        was   thus latterly          compelled to restrict            himself    almost ex
clusively to occupations of a completely sedentary character, such                                 as
the acquisition of languages, for which his remarkably tenacious
memory will fitted him, and the practice of music, in which he pos
sessed   a    refined taste.          Of late years his favourite employment                     was
the use of the microscope                 :     but this was not      a     mere amusement         ;
for his systematic          and      laborious       investigations        resulted in various
memoirs on the          "   Diatomacese," which he contributed to the                      " Tran
sactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh,"                         and the     " Microscopi
cal Society of London."
  The zeal which Dr Gregory displayed in the progress of his                            favourite
science, chemistry,          was      never shown in
                                            more interesting manner
                                                               a
than in the composition of the "Notes on the Action of the Soil Ve                          in
getation," which he drew up only                    a    few days before his death,          when
he was with difficulty supported                   in   bed, so as to enable him to write.

                                           123
1. On       the peculiar Appendage                of Appendicularia, named
             " Haus" by Mertens.                By Professor Allman.
     In  this communication         the author called attention to the fact of
 his having      discovered,    in   April last, in the Clyde, near Rothesay,
 numerous       specimens     of an Appendicularia, invested with the re
markable       appendage,      named    " Haus"      by Mertens,     who originally
described     it in specimens captured in the North Pacific, near Behr-
ing's   Straits, but which no one since his time had seen, though Ap
pendieularia bad become a subject of careful and elaborate investi
gation in the hands of several          of the leading zoologists of the present
 day.*
     The   appendage       under consideration        agreed in its more essential
 details   with that originally described by Mertens,               except that no
trace   could    be detected     of the remarkable        vascular network     which
Mertens describes as constituting             so striking a feature in the speci
mens     examined by him.            There    were   also some differences in de
tails of less importance,       — such    as in the size of the    " Haus,"    which
 was    here    much smaller than in the Behring's Straits specimens,
 and   in the number and                     of the   bodies  named    " horns"    by
                                    shape
 Mertens,    —differences,       however,      which    Professor   Allman    thinks
 may be      referred   to a difference of species        in the  specimens.     The
 author also stated, that he had never witnessed the rapid renewal of
 the   " Haus"      after complete destruction, a phenomenon described by
 Mertens as constant.
     Notwithstanding, however,             these   differences, Professor    Allman
 had not the least doubt that the structure now described is the same,
 except specifically,      with that originally described by Mertens.
  2.  Additional Observations on the Morphology of the Repro
     ductive Organs in the Hydroid Polypes.                         By Professor
     Allman.
      This communication         was   intended by the author to be in con
  tinuation of a former         paper on the same subject, read before            the
     * Dr S.  Wright   has since informed the author, that during the past autumn
                                  in the Firth of Forth, invested with its "  Haus."
  he observed    Appendicularia

                                          124                          i
 Society    during    the previous session,      and contained the following
 additional notices     :—
                          Sertularia polyzonias, Linn.
    The gonophore of Sertularia polyzonias              consists of an oval         cap
 sule  slightly corrugated transversely, with        a short tubular,         obscurely
 4-toothed     aperture,    and having     its axis occupied      by a blastostyle,
 bearing in all the specimens         examined a single sporosac.
    The   sporosac    is produced at first as a lateral bud from the blasto
 style, but soon acquires an apparently terminal position, being borne
 on the summit       of an axile peduncle formed by           the     portion of the
blastostyle which intervenes between it and the                base of the gono
phore, while the distal portion          of the blastostyle seems to become
more or less atrophied.             The   sporosac  is  furnished      with      a large
simple manubrium, between whose ectoderm and endoderm the ova or
spermatozoa are developed,          the ectoderm retreating         from the endo
derm more and more as the intervening generative elements increase
in volume, while the endodermal portion of the manubrium,                        with its
cavity, continues to occupy the axis of the sporosac, extending                      into
the middle of the mass          of  ova or spermatozoa.       For this endoder
mal portion of the manubrium,            round which the generative elements
are developed       in the sporosacs       of the hydroid       polypes,        I   have
already proposed the term           spadix ;*   while to the ectodermal layer,
which now constitutes a sac immediately              confining     these      elements,
we    may give the term cndotheque, as distinguishing                    it from      the
ectotheque,     or external investment of the sporosac.
    The   ova and spermatozoa are of the usual form, and                  in the    male
sporosac     the spermatogenous tissue may             be  observed         in various
stages of development.           Towards the centre of the sporosac,              where
this tissue immediately surrounds the spadix, we find                 it in the     con
dition of a thick mass of mother-cells filled with           "   vesicles     of  evolu
tion ;" but     as we recede     from the centre towards the walls of the
sporosac,   the spermatogenous tissue may be seen to have advanced                     in
maturity,     the mother-cells having burst and liberated their contents,
while in immediate contact with the endotheque is                 a zone      of  active
spermatozoa, which, when liberated, are seen to be of the usual form
of minute     caudate   corpuscles.
    The generative elements are not absolutely confined                    to the spo-

                                              125
 rosacs   ;  they also exist between             the ectoderm     and endoderm        of a
 slightly dilated portion of the peduncular                 blastostyle, immediately
 below the sporosac.            I  have, however, never seen them here, except
  in a very immature            condition   ;  and   it is probable that from this
  situation they subsequently pass into the cavity of the sporosac.
      As the gonophore         advances    towards maturity,      the sporosac is ele
  vated towards the summit            of the capsule, both by its own         increase   of
 size and by the elongation of its peduncle               ;  and we now find in the
 female gonophores           that the contents of the sporosac become                 dis
charged       through    the aperture         of the gonophore       into an external
oval sac, which at the same time makes its appearance on the sum
 mit of the capsule        ;  the now empty and contracted sporosac,             with its
 spadix, remaining behind in the interior of the capsule, on the extre
  mity of its elongated peduncle.
     This extra-capsular          sac communicates through the aperture            of the
gonophore, by means of a short tubular neck, with the cavity of the
sporosac.        Its walls are      composed      of two layers ; the external one
shows no trace of structure,             and    looks like a gelatinous investment
of the    sac,    but it is probably a delicate membrane,              separated from
 the internal by a rather wide interval,               which is filled with a liquid      ;
 while the internal one, or that which immediately surrounds the mass
of ova, may        be plainly     seen to be     composed    of nucleated cells con
nected with one another by a structureless                   intercellular    substance.
The internal layer would             seem to be a simple extension of the endo-
theque of the sporosac,           which now becomes protruded, in the form of
a hernia, through the aperture of the gonophore.                     The connections
of the external layer are more obscure ; but it will probably be found
that this membrane is an extension of the endotheque of the sporosac.
     The    ova which      now occupy the cavity of the extra-capsular                 sac
are each found to be enveloped in a special sac, consisting of a very
delicate     structureless membrane, which closely embraces the ovum,
and is then continued by a narrow elongated neck towards the aper
ture of the gonophore, through which it is probably further continued
into the     sporosac,   but    I   was unable to trace it beyond this point.
     The ova in the extra-capsular sac are in a more advanced stage of
development than in the sporosac ; segmentation has begun, and all
traces of germinal vesicle and             spot have disappeared.           After    seg
mentation has been established, the ovum may be easily broken down
into    distinct    cells,    with    granular     contents,   but   with    no   evident
     VOL. IV.                                                              R

nucleus.      It soon acquires a more elongated form,          exhibits a mani
fest contractility of its walls, becomes         clothed with vibratile       cilia,
and, finally, by the rupture of the confining structures,              escapes as
a free locomotive embryo into the surrounding             water.
     I have  not as yet met with any instance of the occurrence of the
extra-capsular     sac in a male gonophore ; and         it would thus    seem to
constitute a kind of marsupial          appendage, into which the ova are
introduced from the interior of the gonophore, in order to undergo                  a
further development previously to their final liberation as free larva?.
It    occurs, with slight     modifications,   in several other species,        and
ought to have a place in the descriptive            terminology   of the group.
 I  therefore, in    allusion   to its position  on the summit of the gono
 phore, propose for it the name of Acrocyst.
     We must     be careful not to confound the acrocyst with          an extra
capsular, medusa-like sporosac,         which in certain species shows itself
in a similar situation, but with which it        is  in no respect homologous,
— the    acrocyst being in an entirely different morphological category
from that of the sporosacs.
                            Sertularia pumila, Linn.
     The gonophores in this      species are compressed, urn-shaped         bodies,
 generally containing a single sporosac.
     From    the    enlarged opercular     summit     of the blastostyle      there
 extends into the interior of the gonophore a variable number of              coecal
 tubes.     Some of these are in the form of short, simple, cylindrical
 processes,    while others extend to a greater distance, become more or
 less branched, and may be traced in contact with the              inner   surface
 of the walls of the     capsule  to within a short distance of the attached
 end of the gonophore.           Brown corpuscles, similar to        those   in  the
 interior of the blastostyle and ccenosarc, may occasionally           be seen in
 active motion within these cceca.
     The  sporosac    originates as a lateral bud from the blastostyle, and
 contains a large, simple spadix, surrounded by the ova or spermatozoa.
      The generative elements, however, are not confined            to the sporo
 sac.    In the blastostyle itself numerous         ova   may be detected     ;  but
 these are always       smaller,  and evidently less mature, than those in
 the sporosac.       They are produced in the walls of the blastostyle,
 apparently between the endoderm and ectoderm, and are very minute
 towards the summit         of the blastostyle, but gradually         increase     in

                                         127
 size towards      the point of attachment of the sporosac, and are pro
 bably thence conveyed into the cavity of the latter, where a further
 development awaits them.
      In  the condition   now described, the gonophore continues during
  the early part of the season         ;  but at a later period there makes
  its appearance in the female gonophores a spherical acrocyst, in
  which the ova undergo further development previously to escaping
 as  ciliated embryos.
     The young gonophore has         the form    of a compressed cone attached
 by its narrow end to the branch, and with its free end wide and
slightly     concave.    In  this   state  it  is   merely an offset   from    the
 c<Bnosarc    of the branch, hollowed out into       a cavity, which is only an
 extension of the common         ccenosarcal    cavity, and having a delicate
 chitinous polypary     moulded over its surface.
                          Plumularia falcata, Linn.
     The gonophores in this      species are of an oval form,     with   a tubu
lar apical orifice, which is     closed by an opercular fleshy plug.
     They commence      as a minute       bud, which soon presents the form
 of  a little inverted  cone,   having its axis traversed by a blastostyle,
 which dilates at the wide or distal extremity             of the cone    into a
hollow opercular enlargement.             From the blastostyle    a single spo
rosac     is produced as a lateral bud, which         ultimately, by the arrest
of that portion of the blastostyle           between    it and the operculum,
acquires a terminal       position, being now supported on the summit of
a very short peduncle which springs from the base of the gonophore,
and which is nothing more than the proximal extremity of the ori
ginal blastostyle.        From this point the sporosac extends towards
the summit of the gonophore, which has acquired an oval form, and
which at last it completely fills.         From the cavity of the opercular
body which closes the summit of the gonophore several more or less
branched ceecal tubes are given off into the interior of the gonophore,
where they may be seen running for some distance along the inner
surface of its walls towards its attached extremity.
     The generative     elements are produced,         as  usual, between     the
ectoderm      and endoderm of the manubrium of the sporosac           ;  and   by
their increase of volume, and consequent pressure, occasion,             at least
in the female sporosacs,      the gradual absorption of the spadix, which

                                                 128
is ultimately represented by a small                   irregular tubercle            in the bottom
of the sac.
  The germinal              vesicle and spot are very distinct in the young ova,
and the spermatozoa present the usual form of caudate                                     corpuscles.
The larva          is a ciliated, leucophrydiform                body.
                                Laomedea flexuosa, Hincks.
   The usual conformation of the gonophores, and their contents, have
been described in the former paper ; but there still remains to be
considered a remarkable modification of the reproductive                                   system       in
this species.
   We not unfrequently find, especially in                          specimens         gathered     late
in the season,            that on the summit of the capsule,                         and altogether
external          to its cavity,        there are borne certain                peculiar    sporosacs,
with        a structure         presenting    some     interesting           points of     difference
from that of the ordinary or intra-capsular                             sporosacs.
      It    was     to    these    extra-capsular       sporosacs as occurring                  in L.
flexuosa* that Loven                   long ago called attention, when he supported
and developed             the doctrine just then announced by Ehrenberg, of
the        sexuality of polypes, a doctrine which, though                            in its mode of
statement not absolutely                  correct,     was        nevertheless full         of signi
ficance.
      The extra-capsular            sporosacs,    with their investing ectotheque, are
attached by         a    short peduncle to the summit of the blastostyle, where
the latter expands into a sort of operculum for the capsule.                                       Two
or three of them, in different stages of development, may generally
be seen        on    a single capsule.           They are nearly spherical bodies,                     and
contain either a variable number of ova, or else a mass of sperma
tozoa, the generative               elements in either case surrounding a central
spadix.           The    ectotheque     contains thread-cells, and there is developed
from this membrane, upon the summit of the sporosac, a little crown
of short cylindrical              processes   like rudimental tentacula.                  The    whole
body bears thus a resemblance, by no means remote, to a medusa                                    with
the opening of its umbrella contracted                       ;    but    I   could never find in it

Campanularia             geniculata.    His figures, however, arc undoubtedly                  those    of
Laomedea jUxuona, whose distinctness from Campanularia (or Laomedea)
culata of fjinnoms has been fully proved by Dr Johnston, and from L.                             get**1'

the four radiating canals         described by Loven,        nor any other repre
sentative of the gastrovascular system of a medusa.                  When the con
tents have attained a sufficient          degree    of maturity they        escape,   as
 has    been   already    shown     by  Loven, through         an   aperture     which
 makes its appearance         in the centre of the tentacular crown.
     If  we follow the development           of  these   extra-capsular      sporosacs,
 we shall find,      as  Loven    has already pointed out, that they are ori
ginally produced within the           capsule.     They are here indistinguish
able     from the      ordinary intra-capsular         sporosacs,    and     originate,
exactly like the latter, as buds from the blastostyle.              The blastostyle,
however, instead of remaining             stationary,   as  in the ordinary gono-
 phores, grows upwards through the aperture of the capsule, carrying
 out with it the most mature sporosacs, or those which                     are formed
  nearest    its summit,       and which     thus    become     extra-capsular,      de
  veloping from       their ectotheque, while in this situation, their little
 tentacular crown, and, after the discharge of their contents, withering
 away, to be replaced by others.
     Notwithstanding the resemblance which the extra-capsular sporo
 sacs, with their investing ectotheque, bear to a medusa, they will far
  more easily     admit of a comparison with the ordinary intra-capsular
  sporosacs.      Of the two membranes composing their walls, the inter
 nal is undoubtedly         the endotheque,        while the external        is just   as
 obviously an ectotheque, differing, however, from that of an ordinary
 sporosac, in      its being     provided, for the liberation         of its contents,
 with    a definite orifice surrounded by rudimental            tentacles.
      We have not here, more than in the intra-capsular sporosacs,

 any representative of an umbrella ; and confess myself quite unable
 to understand the radiating canals figured and                 described    by Loven.
  If  this excellent zoologist has not been deceived as to the existence
 of such canals, they will probably           be identical with the ccecal proces
 ses from the spadix which            I have already described as occurring            in
  the sporosacs of several species of hydroid zoophytes.
                            Sertularia tamarisca,        Linn.
      Sertularia     tamarisca,     like   most    of the hydroid       zoophytes,      is
  strictly dioecious, but it further presents the remarkable                   character
  of having its male and female gonophores totally different from                    one
  another     in form,     an   important    fact as    regards the zoographical
  characterization      of the species.

                                         130
     The male gonophores appear to be those figured by Ellis in his
description of this species.        They are very much compressed, some
what obcordate bodies, with a short tubular aperture.
     The   female gonophores are far less simple            in form.       They   are
oval   for about the proximal half of their length, and then            become tri
hedral, with the sides diverging as they pass upwards, while the whole
is terminated by a three-sided pyramid.               The  sides of the pyramid
are cut into two or three short         teeth along their edges,        and each of
their   basal angles is prolonged into a short spine.
     The trihedral     portion,   with its pyramidal      summit,     is formed of
three leaflets, which merely touch one another by their edges, with
out adhering,      so that they may be easily separated            by the needle.
They consist of the same chitinous material as that which invests
the rest of the gonophore, formed originally, doubtless, upon the
surface of an ectodermal lamina.
     The male gonophore is traversed by              a blastostyle,    which    gives
origin to one or more lateral          sporosacs   containing    the spermatoge-
nous tissue surrounding a large spadix from which no gastro-vascular
coeca   are developed.        The spermatozoa are unusually              large,   and
their body, instead of presenting the more common spherical or pyra
midal form, is in the shape of an elongated cylinder, with the caudal
 filament projecting from one end.
     On laying open      the  female gonophore, we find that the oval or
proximal      portion  of   it is  occupied     by a blastostyle,      which    gives
origin    to one    or more sporosacs       with well developed       spadix,     and
entirely resembling the male sporosac, except in the nature of their
contents, which are here ova instead of spermatozoa.
     The oval portion of the gonophore terminates upwards by closing
round the distal extremity of the blastostyle, which it here encircles
with a ring furnished with          tooth-like processes.       This oval portion
constitutes the proper capsule           of  the   gonophore, and       is the only
portion developed       in the male.        From      the  summit of the blas
tostyle,    and   apparently     communicating        with   its  cavity,    several
irregularly-branched        ccecal   tubes    are  given off.      They lie     alto
gether external to the proper capsule, and embrace a delicate                     sac,
within which are one or more ova in a more advanced                    stage of de
velopment than that presented by the ova which                     are still within
the capsule.        These    extra-capsular      ova   are each enveloped       in   a
special   sac, very delicate    and structureless,      which is continued by        a

                                               131
narrow neck towards the summit of the blastostyle, but                         I   failed     in
my attempts to trace its connections beyond this point.
     The extra-capsular       ova, with   their investing        sacs, and the surround
ing   coecal tubes,     would thus lie entirely exposed, were                  it not that
they are protected          by the    three leaflets already mentioned as con
stituting the trihedral portion of the gonophore.                      These leaflets are
given off from the external surface of the oval portion, or proper cap
sule, near its summit, and, being in contact by their edges, completely
enclose a space which is occupied by the structures just described.
     Though    I have   not succeeded in discovering the exact connection
between the common extra-capsular ovigcrous sac and the structures
in the interior of the capsule, nor                  the precise     mode   by which the
ova    gain   access   to have no hesitation in viewing
                             it,
                              I                           as   true           it        a
acrocyst in which the ova undergo a further development, previously
to   their liberation   as free embryos.
     In   the following three species, the gonophores contained in all the
specimens     I     examined,        medusce,        and     never   sporosacs.         These
medusae have been more or less investigated by                   Van Beneden, Gegen-
baur, Dalyell,      Gosse, Hincks, Wright,                 and other observers,         and  I
here give the results of my own independent examinations, as partly
confirmatory     of the observations of              these   naturalists,   and as partly
supplementary to them.
                    Eudendrium ramosum, Van Beneden.
 I     obtained this species in fine condition,                attached to an old buoy
in the harbour of Derryquin,             on the Kenmare            River, County Kerry,
in September 1858.
   The gonophores are simple, and are borne upon the ultimate ra-
muli, where they may be seen springing from the upper and lateral
surfaces of theramulus along its whole length. They are obovate, or
fig-shaped bodies,          each    supported  on    distinct peduncle, and in
                                                        a
vested by a delicate chitinous            extension of the polypary.
     When the gonophore              reaches    maturity,       the ectotheque and its
chitinous investment         become ruptured           at the summit, to allow of the
escape of the medusa as an independent free-swimming zooid.
   The medusa, on escaping,       provided with a deep umbrella,
                                           is
which measures about           Je    of an inch       across its base, where       it   is   fur
nished with     a   well-developed velum.

                                             13'2
    The manubrium           is  of moderate size.        It is a sub-cylindrical      body,
 somewhat        dilated at its base, and having its oral extremity                     sur
 rounded by four short tentacles.                 These manubrial          tentacles have
 the cells of their endoderm so disposed as to give rise to the appear
ance    of a transverse segmentation               of their cavity,      and   the extre
 mity of each is surrounded by a little capitate group of thread-cells.
 The cavity of the manubrium                  is   lined   with    cells containing      red
granules.
    From the        base   of   the   manubrium       four gastrovascular canals ra
diate towards the margin of the umbrella, to open there into a distinct
circular canal.
    At  each     of the four points where the radiating canals open into
the circular canal, is a large bulbous dilatation of the gastrovascular
system.        Its cavity contains red pigment granules, and while at its
proximal side it is in communication with the radiating and circular
canals,    it  sends off from its distal         side two filiform contractile ten-
 tacula  ;   the margin of the umbrella being thus furnished with eight
tentacles, arranged in four equidistant groups of two each.                         At  the
root of every tentacle is a black            "  eye-speck."        The velum      is mode
 rately developed.
    From     an ordinary-sized        specimen    of this eudendrium, kept alive in
an 8 oz. phial of sea-water, the medusae were thrown                           off in such
 multitudes as to give a milky cloudiness to the water.                         They   con
tinued active with me for more than a week                    ;  but during      that time
no further change of form occurred, and no generative elements were
developed       in them.*
    If we endeavour to trace the development                    of the gonophore from
its earliest appearance to the complete formation of the medusa,
 we shall find that it originates as a minute solid bud from the side
 of the branch.          In this bud      a cavity     may be seen communicating
   * Gegenbaur has already referred the medusal genus, Bougainvillea, to euden
drium as its " nurse" form, and it is evident that the little medusa here de
scribed needs only that the number of tentacles and ocelli composing each
marginal group shall become multiplied, and the oral tentacles become bifur
cated, in order       that it may be converted into a true Bougainvillea.              This
change   I  have not witnessed, for my continued observation            of the medusae was
here interrupted     ;  but Dr Strethill Wright, who obtained the same species of
eudendrium in the Firth of Forth, informs me that he has traced its medusae
into the adult Bougainvillea, with the generative elements developed in the
base of the manubrium,         as is well known to be their situation in this genus.

                                          133
with the cavity of the caenosarc, from which it thus forms a simple
diverticulum.        We next find that the bud has become differentiated
into a peripheral and a central             portion, the latter      containing the
diverticulum     from the cavity of tho ccenosarc.            A    further differen
 tiation is soon seen in the central portion, which             is now manifestly
 composed    of two layers, — an ectoderm and an endoderm, — while the
 peripheral portion becomes enveloped externally by a delicate chiti-
nous investment. This peripheral portion is to become the ectotheque
of the simple gonophore.
    From the summit of the central portion, which will afterwards
become elongated into the manubrium                 of the medusa, four thick
cylindrical    cocca may be now seen to be given          off ;   their cavities are
simple continuations of the diverticulum,            and they extend, with their
 sides  in  close   contact with one        another, towards      the distal extre
 mity of the gonophore.           They are at first mere tubercles, but they
gradually increase in length, becoming developed quite in the                   same
way     as the tentacles on        the   ordinary   alimentary      polype.    After
they have attained          a certain   length,   the gonophore continuing         at
the same time to grow larger, they became separated from one an
 other laterally, and the intervening spaces are now seen to be
 occupied   by a web-like        membrane, which       extends from the base of
 the coeca to    within a short distance of their extremities, and here
 terminates by a defined margin.
     This membrane        is composed    of transversely elongated cells, and       is
 plainly a   lateral extension of the ectoderm of the coeca.                Close  to
its free margin       a narrow      tube may be seen extending transversely
between the four coeca, connecting them together, and becoming more
 and more elongated as the coeca continue to separate from one
 another.
     In the four    coeca   it is now easy to recognise the radiating          canals
 of the gastro vascular system of the developing              medusa,     and in the
 transverse tube, the circular canal of this system, while the connect
 ing membrane is plainly the rudimental umbrella.
     The distal extremities of the coecal tubes project slightly beyond
 the margin of the umbrella, and here become dilated into bulbous
 terminations, which converge towards the axis of the gonophore,
 where they lie in contact with one another, and soon become very
                                                                                From
  conspicuous by the accumulation in them of red pigment.
                                                                              and as
  each bulb two short tentacles may now be seen to sprout,
     vol.  nr.                                                           8

                                           134
   these continue to grow        longer, they may be seen hanging into           the
  concavity of the umbrella, where they then lie somewhat confusedly
  within the confined space there alloted to them.
      In  the meantime, a velum has become developed from the margin
   of the umbrella, while the central portion of the gonophore containing
  the diverticulum       from the ccenosarc     has   become    elongated   between
  the four radiating canals, and may be seen            projecting in the axis     of
  the umbrella, as a wide coecal process, with             distinct  ectoderm    and
  endoderm.         It is easy to recognise in this process the manubrium of
  the medusa      ;  an oral aperture soon becomes formed at its extremity,
  and the little medusa,         now expanding      the margin of its umbrella,
  and everting its tentacula, escapes from the confinement of the               ecto-
  theque, and enters upon the free phase of its existence.
                            Laomedea     dichotoma, Linn.
      Fine   specimens     of this zoophyte were obtained on the south-coast
  of Ireland, in     the  beginning of September, loaded with gonophores,
  containing medusae in various stages of maturity.            The gonophores     are
 compound, and consist of a blastostyle carrying               numerous medusa,
 which     increase in maturity        as they approach       the summit     of  the
  blastostyle, the whole being invested in an external capsule.
     The    medusa,    on its escape from the capsule, has a thin         umbrella,
 which is capable of passing            through   almost every degree of con
 vexity, from that of a nearly flat disc to that of a dome, embracing
 about   Jd of a    sphere, while it is often completely everted, so as to pre
 sent the appearance of a wide hand-bell          without the clapper, the ma
 nubrium then representing the handle of the bell.              This last condition
 is that which       it always assumes      when swimming, the manubrium
 being then invariably turned from the direction of motion.
     The base of the manubrium presents a hemispherical dilatation,
 and on its free extremity         is borne a mouth with four well-developed
 lobes.     Four radiating canals extend from            the  base  of the   manu
 brium     to the margin of the umbrella,          where they enter a distinct
 circular canal.       The margin of the umbrella carries sixteen filiform
 tentacula,*     one    of these tentacula being always situated at each
junction of     a radiating    canal with the circular canal.        The  tentacles
are thickly set with thread-cells, and their cavity presents the septate
      * Eighteen may frequently be counted, but this is probably abnormal.

                                        135
appearance      found generally in the group.           Close to the base the
ectoderm becomes thicker, and the cavity of the tentacle here loses
the appearance of being transversely divided by septa.
    At the inner     side of the base  of every    second tentacle is situated a
 sessile  " lithocyst"  ;   and at the inner    side of the base of every ten
 tacle may be seen a transparent oval space, having the appearance
of a vesicle.       The lithocyst consists of       a spherical  capsule, with a
spherical, highly refractile otolite.         No pigment spots occur.
    A    narrow velum extends round the margin of the umbrella.
    Exactly in the middle,       between   each   pair of radiating canals, may
often be witnessed       an appearance like a bundle of delicate fibres, ex
tending from the base of the manubrium to the marginal canal, where
it loses itself, by appearing to break up into its component fibres.             I
 believe this appearance is due to mere folds in the inner surface
 of  the  umbrella.*
     Towards     the end of October     I  again visited the locality where      I
had previously obtained the Laomedea in great abundance and per
fection, but found nothing but dead specimens,            from which the gono
phores had all fallen.
                        Campanularia Johnstoni, Alder.
     This   species  was dredged in     September, loaded with gonophores,
whose contents were in every instance medusae.
    The gonophores may          be described as cask-shaped, or      of the form
of a regular oval, truncated at both extremities.               They are corru
gated transversely, so as to present a series of regular rings.              They
are situated on the creeping stolon of the zoophyte, to which they
are attached by a short peduncle.         They consist of     a blastostyle,  with
medusal buds and investing capsule, and never carried sporosacs.
    The medusa,       on escaping from      the gonophore, has a diameter of
about r3ij of an inch.           The umbrella is very convex, embracing
about two-thirds        of a sphere.     From the base of the manubrium
four radiating canals extend to the margin of the umbrella, to unite
with the circular canal, and at          each   point of union arises a tenta
 cle.    The tentacle     commences   with a wide base, which passes rather
    *  The medusa of Laomedea dicholoma, as here described, is probably only the
 young state of Gegenbaur's Eueope polyityla (Zeit. f. Wiss. Zool. Band. 8), a
 species which this naturalist informs us he has traced to the gonophores of one
 of the campanularida;.

                                           136
  abruptly into a very extensile filament, which in its completely            con
  tracted state    I  have always found coiled into a regular spiral.         The
  base of the tentacle presents a large             cavity, which communicates
  freely with the marginal canal of the umbrella.
      Between each of the four tentacles are two lithocysts.                 They
  consist each of a spherical transparent          colourless vesicle, containing
  a spherical     highly refractile otolite, which is itself immediately in
  vested   by a very delicate vesicle, of which it looks like the nucleus.
  Between each lithocyst the margin of the umbrella is extended into
  a slight projection, having all the characters of a rudimental tentacle.
      There is a very wide velum, and in both it and the umbrella mus
  cular bundles are largely developed.
      In  no instance were generative          sacs developed in the specimens
  which came       under my      examination.         Gegenbaur,    however,   has
  found them well developed            on  the course of the radiating canals
  in certain      species  of his genus Eueope,           a genus to    which   he
  would     refer   all such forms      as those    here described in Laomedea
  dichotoma, and Campanularia Johnstoni, and which, he tells us,                he
  has   traced to gemmation           from   the Campanularidse.      In  the un
 doubted medusa of Campanularia Johnstoni, they have been seen in
  a  similar situation, but not fully determined, by Mr Gosse, while the
 detection in them of distinctly formed ova by Mr Hincks, and more
 especially     by   Dr S. Wright, who has figured and described            them,
 has so    far completed the observations         needed on this point.
                               General Conclusions.
     To the general conclusions contained in the previous paper,               the
 following generalizations       may now be added.
     Besides the ordinary        development of the ova in intra-capsular
sporosacs,     we find,
     1.  That in certain      species   bearing    capsular  gonophores (Sertu-
 laria polyzonias, &c.) the        ova,   after attaining in the interior of the
capsule a definite stage of development, are transmitted into an extra
capsular sac        (acroeyst),   where     they   undergo   a  further  develop
ment previously to their liberation             as free embryos, and that this
sac is formed (at least in the species where its connections were most
satisfactorily traced) by a hernial protrusion of the endotheque (and
ectotheque     ?)  of  an intra-capsular     sporosac   through   the summit of
the capsule.

                                           137
    2. That in certain other        species  (Campanularia fiexuosa, &c.) the
final development of the ovum, previously to liberation, takes place
in a peculiarly formed medusa-like extra-capsular sporosac, which,
 however, must not be confounded with a true medusal zooid.                     It
 originates as an ordinary intra-capsular            sporosac,  and subsequently
 becomes extra-capsular         by the elongation of the blastostyle.
    The most important         steps  in the development of the true medusal
buds are the following       : —
    (1.) The formation of a hollow process from the ccenosarc or blas
tostyle. (2.) The differentiation in this process, of a peripheral por
tion (ectotheque), and a central portion (manubruim) ; the latter
becoming further differentiated           into two layers, ectoderm and endo-
derm.       (3.) The emission from the hollow central portion of four
 ca;cal  tubes (radiating canals), composed of ectoderm and endoderm,
 which, simultaneously with their elongation,               have their ectodermal
layer expanded into        a web-like membrane (umbrella),         connecting the
tubes     laterally with one another.           (4.) The further connection of
the radiating       tubes with one another          by lateral branches (circular
canal), and the development of a velum from the margin of the um
 brella.
    From the       above processes,     it follows that the development of the
 medusa admits of an easy           comparison with that of the alimentary
polype, the radiating canals being developed from the central manu
brium in the       medusa,   exactly as the tentacula are from the body of
the polype     ;  but that, while in the polype they continue free, in the
medusa they are united            laterally by an extension of the ectoderm
and by lateral branches.*
    A   comparison of the two kinds of reproductive zooids (sporosacs
and medusa) and of the alimentary              zooid (polype) results in the fol
lowing parallelism      :—
   * In  the remarkable species, Laomedea acuminata (Alder), the tentacles of the
polype are actually united, as Mr Alder has shown, for a considerable distance
from their origin, by an intervening membrane.

   * Professor Huxley's important demonstration of the composition of the
proper radiata out of two membranes, most he carefully borne in mind in all
our attempts to establish relations of homology in this group.
   t   It is highly   probable that the medusae whenever produced among the
Tubularidse, will    be found to have   their generative elements formed between
the endoderm     and ectoderm  of the manubrium    ; while, on the other hand, in the
medusa: of the Campanularidso and Sertularids, the generative elements will
originate in the walls of the radiating canals, here also between endoderm and
ectoderm. In the former, therefore, the medusa' would approach the type of
Sarsia, in the latter that of Thaumantiat, or more exactly that of Eucope,
Oegenb.      Perhaps, however, until a greater number of instances are accumu
lated,  it would   be hardly safe to insist on the validity of this generalization.

           The following Communications                 were read    : —
1.  On the     First Properties of Matter — Inertia, Gravitation,
       Elasticity — referred to a common Law. By John G.
       Macvicar, D.D.          Communicated           by Professor Fraser.
    The author commences by a vindication of the Scottish philoso
phy, that he may legitimately build upon substance as a reality as
well as phenomenon.          He then shows that just          as the idea   of  sub
stance presents, a     priori, an alternative, viz.,      those which are wholly
fixed, the subject of law imposed from without only, and those which
possess a power of changing          their  mode of being from       within   them
selves  ;  so,  in point of fact, common observation has recognised in
all  ages   two orders of substances          or beings characterized       by this
difference,     and filling up in the sphere of reality this alternative
given by pure thought; the one being the ground of all natural phe
nomena, and ordinarily designated body ; the other the ground of
all moral and intellectual phenomena, and designated spirit.
    Of Body the most characteristic properties are inertia, gravita
tion, and elasticity    ; and these     are still regarded in science merely
as postulates, and that, unrelated          to each other except as properties
inhering in the same subject       ;  just as heat, electricity,  magnetism,      and
chemical affinity were some years ago.             It is the attempt to show the
homogeneity of this group of properties, and to account for them,
that has given its title to this communication.
    For this purpose       the author    lays hold of The       Law of Assimi
lation, already admitted in physiology           ; he shows    that it operates in
nature far more extensively than is generally supposed               ;  in  fact, he
affirms that it is universal,         and the only law of nature that          needs
to be    considered by us for the explanation              of phenomena.        This
law,    when thus conceived in its utmost generality,                he    thus   ex
          :—
               " Everything     tends to assimilate itself to itself in          suc
presses
cessive    moments of its existence         ;  and extends this action to all
 things   around to unknown          distances, assimilating      them also     more
 or less to itself, meanwhile being of course more or less assimilated             to

                                                    147
them in its turn."                And   hence,       all through nature, at once the per
manence and intransmutability                       of species, whether organized or mo
lecular, and the construction of these                           species    into genera or groups
into which the         same type enters.
   His first application of this law is                          to show the genesis           of inertia.
Thus, let any portion or particle of substance considered merely as such
be subject to this law alone, it follows, that in                      its relations both to           space
and time, that portion or particle                          must assimilate itself to itself in
every successive        moment          ;   that    is,   if it   be at rest    it   must continue at
rest, and      if it   be   in motion        it    must, in every successive                 moment, ac
complish the same             element of motion which                      it   accomplished in the
first   ;    whence    it    is   obvious that its motion must be uniform and
rectilinear, and must continue                 so    till   it   be changed from without.               But
this    is   simply a definition of inertia, whose genesis thus appears.
   Similarly        he shows,       that      if    the portion        or particle of substance
be considered, not in reference to its matter but its                                form,        it   must,
under the law of assimilation, tend to maintain its true volume and
form,        and, to restore       it       when    it      has been disturbed           —   it   must be
resilient and elastic.
   Again, let there                                 or masses (each and
                                  be two or more particles
all of which must thus be inert, and in their last elements elastic also),
and let them be placed               in     different regions of space              ;   it   follows, that
though as to  inertia and elasticity they are identical already, and the
law of assimilation has exhausted itself upon them as substances and
forms, yet they are not assimilated as to the spaces they occupy. This,
therefore, the law of assimilation must tend to effect.                                 Under this law
they must tend towards one place.                           Moreover, in being assimilated as
to place, they must also be assimilated as to time.  In a word, they
must tend to move, and that simultaneously, towards one another, each
assimilating the other as to the place which                         it    occupies, or attracting           it
withaforce proportional              to     itself (its quantity of substance,                mass,    o1   in
ertia). Nor      merely the fact of mutual attraction that follows
                    is
                    it
from the law of assimilation, but also tho law of that attraction.
Thus, considered            as an attractive apparatus,               it   must be conceived as in
vesting in a spherical manner the attracting particle.  Now, the law
of assimilation requires, with respect to such      spherical investi           a
ture, that all the successive  spherical shells or superficies, of which
the entire sphere of attraction may be conceived to consist, must in
attractive value be assimilated to each other that is, they must all be
                                                                      ;

                                                148
equal to each other.                But in quantity or extent they vary               as the
squares    of their       distances from the centre.         Estimated,    therefore,    nut
as to the entire superficies, but along any line or radius, the attractive
force must vary inversely as the square of the distance or radius                              ;
which is the well-known                   law of gravitation.     Thus the     genesis at
once   of inertia, elasticity, and gravitation is given. They are shown
to   be homogeneous in their nature, and not occult properties inhering
in matter, but merely uniform phenomena arising from the operation
in different circumstances of one and the same law.
     The author then           proceeds to show,         that the law of assimilation
also gives a definite conception as to the structure                  of least parts of
matter in the last analysis which nature appears to                  permit or accom
plish.      He     is thus led to infer the existence of an               universal    ether
or medium of light.             And from this, to the molecules of bodies,                he
thinks     that a transition          may be made,         by regarding the latter         as
products of the former          ; the ethereal elements being definitely grouped
into molecules        ;    which, under the law of assimilation, must be sym
metrical, and permanent or intransmutable (except in long epochs),
as also     ever bent on        union with one another, wherever there is                      a
difference between            them    ;   and   their union would not occasion            too
great a degradation of the symmetry                       which   each   possessed     when
existing separately.
2. On the       Structure and Functions of the Branchial Sac of
           the Simple Ascidiae. By Andrew Murray, Esq.
   The chief portion of this paper is occupied with an inquiry into
the truth of Milne Edwards' theory, that the branchial sac of the
Ascidians        is perforated throughout             by apertures, or what he called
branchial stigmata.
     Some experiments and observations made by          Mr Murray last season
had induced him to            regard this view with doubt. In considering the
question, he first examined the evidence that was recorded in support
of it.    Putting    aside those writers who had taken             M. Edwards'        theory
on trust, he could only find four observers who seem to have critically
tested    it,   viz., — Dr Lister, with whom the idea originated:             who, while
stating that the walls of the sac appeared                   to be traversed      by   open
spaces, yet states that at times he thought                  he   saw something like      a
veil stretching across them, and that the particles in suspension                         in

                                                149
the water were              observed     to course    past these spaces without enter
ing   which would appear to be inconsistent with the idea of tho
       ;
water entering, for the course of the water, and of the particles float
ing in     it,   must necessarily be the same.                The next author       was       Milne
Edwards, who announced the open passages as                         a    fact, without going
into any reasoning or proof upon                      it.     He however started with a
bias   ;   for he alludes at the outset to                  Dr Lister having established
the fact, which,           it   will   be observed,    is    stating the results        of   his ob
servations much too strongly.                    M. Coste followed, and took the
directly         opposed     view, holding       that the branchial           spaces     were all
closed         by   a   more or less diaphanous               membrane.        Van Beneden
seems to have halted between the two opinions.                           But Huxley, the
last and most formidable of them all, takes                      Edwards' idea up in toto,
and has informed                Mr Murray,      that he thinks he has seen the cur
rents of water passing through the stigmata                       iu   at least two Ascidice,
viz., Perophora, and Appendicularia.
      Mr Murray's           observations consisted in feeding the Ascidiae with
coloured sea water, in injecting them, and in actual examination of
their structure.             In   those fed with indigo, the coloured material was
never found on the exterior                   of the sac, but always deposited                on its
inner wall.             Injection by the mouth into the                sac failed to push the
injection through its walls except                   by   rupturing them.           Mr Murray
thought that, under               a    high power of the microscope,            a   diaphanous
membrane             was     to be seen stretching             across the branchial            stig
mata       ;   but   if    so, the membrane was so thin as to be scarcely per
ceptible.
      According to           Mr Murray,        the mode        in which the water which
enters at the oral aperture passes to the anal aperture would there
fore appear to be still unknown.
      Mr Murray            narrated, also, his dissections of the ciliated                    sac or
valvular aperture which lies at the top of the dorsal fold, which at
one time he had been disposed to think (with the elder Carus) might
furnish        a    mode  of egress, but satisfied himself that   was rather   it
a     blind      sac,   or at least   sac terminating in
                                          a                 very small blood
                                                                         a
vessel.
      In   the course of his investigations                 Mr Murray        made   the curious
discovery,           that in Phallusia    Virginea the chylaqueous fluid                              is
 strongly acid.             He had not found this quality in any other species
which he had yet examined, but he thought                          it   probable    it   might be
       vol. iv.                                                                     v

                                          150
   found in   P. Mentula, P.       Oblonga, and those other species which
  are  allied to P. Virginea.
      Another observation     made by    Mr Murray in    relation to this matter,
  and    one  which     promises to furnish     interesting   results,  was,  that
  in none of the mollusca        (and indeed in none of the invertebrate
  animals) on which his experiments had been made, was the food
  digested by gastric acid.      He had never found acid in the stomach.
  The   mode   of digestion in the invertebrata would appear therefore to
  be  probably conducted on a different system from that in the verte-
  brata.
     Incidentally      Mr Murray     alluded   to the Notodelphs       and   small
 crustacea found in the stomachs of Ascidiae.           He differed from     those
 authors who thought them parasitic, as he had found many dead,                and
 in all stages of apparent digestion, in the respiratory sac of Phattusia
  Virginea.
     With regard to the homology of the parts in question, he pointed
 out that the facts he had brought forward all tended to show that
 the sac is homological with the pharynx             rather than with the ten
 tacular crown of the Polyzoa.

 1.  Note on certain Vibrations produced by Electricity.                      By
                              Professor Forbes.
    " In the course of last summer
                                           (1858)     I became acquainted with
a  phenomenon described by Mr Gore in the Philosophical Magazine
for  June (Supplement, p. 519), of the following nature:              —A   metal
cylinder, supported on two metallic rods or rails, the latter being in
connection     respectively  with the poles of a battery, revolves in either
direction, at will, under the action of an electric current copious in
quantity.       Also continuous rotation of a light copper ball, supported
on two    circular metallic rails, takes     place in either direction at plea
sure, depending on the first impulse.             It  appeared to me very pro
bable that this interesting      fact might be applied to explain what is
still obscure in the experiment on heated metals, generally known as
the   "Trevelyan Experiment," described by Mr Trevelyau, in the
''Edinburgh Transactions," vol. xii., where there is also a paper
by myself on the same subject.            With   a view to elucidate the expe
riment,    1  had   Mr Gore's circular railway and ball constructed some
 months since      by Mr Kemp.       I had not an opportunity of seeing it
tried until October 19th,       when   I  found    it to answer well,  with lour

                                                   152
Bunsen's          pairs     connected        for   quantity.         The     same     day, in Mr
Kemp's laboratory,             I
                     laid a brass                    " Trevelyan"          bar or rocker          on the
edge of the brass plate, forming                      the outer rail of             Mr     Gore's     ma
chine, and connecting the rail with one pole of the same battery,                                      and
the bar (by means of a globule of                    mercury inserted in a cavity in its
upper surface) with the other, energetic vibrations commenced quite
resembling those occasioned by heat in the ordinary form of the ex
periment on a leaden support.
    "   I   have since found, among other results, — 1. That the vibration
goes on      in whichever direction the electric current                         passes.        [At    first
I   thought that there was a superior effect when the current                                     passed
from a good to an imperfect conductor, but this has not been                                          con
firmed,      as    far at least         as   I   have gone].          2. The vibrations                take
place both between metals of the same kind                             and heterogeneous                me
tals.       3. When heat is applied to a brass                         bar       vibrating      on      cold
lead, and then electricity is applied as before, the effects are super
added to one another whichever way the current                                   passes, the vibra
tions becoming more energetic, and                       if there    be a musical note it be
comes graver           [owing, it is assumed,             to the increased arc               of    vibra
tion].       4. When a bar of brass was placed so as to vibrate on                                      two
parallel upright plates, also of brass, respectively connected with                                      the
poles of a battery, the vibrations continued, when the whole was im
mersed partly or wholly in water, and even when flooded by a power
ful continued stream of cold water from a five-eighth inch pipe under
considerable          pressure.     From this experiment                     I   conclude that           the
effect of the heat developed                 by the electrical current in the thin                      up
right plates may be fairly considered to                        be reduced so low               as to be
incapable of producing a sensible result                       (if   such were ever the              case).
Indeed, allowing for the resistance and friction of the water tending
to diminish the vibration, there                   is    no ground         for thinking that            the
action was less energetic in the one case than in the other.                                          It   is
consequently reasonable to conclude that the effect in question                                    is   due
to the repulsive action of the electricity                      in passing from one                   con
ducting body to another, and not to its effect in producing expansion.
    " Now      this    is   precisely the effect which         I      attributed to heat           in   the
paper of 1833             already referred to.           I   therefore consider            ita    strong
confirmation          of the opinion         I     then expressed,           from which         I     have
never swerved, although    has not in general been received with
                                        it
much favour.   The importance which    attach to this new confir

mation, and the               suggestiveness             of    Mr   Gore's    experiment               on the
rolling-ball, will          be judged of from the fact, that in 1833, or earlier,
I had an apparatus            made, consisting of a bar resembling                             Mr      Treve-
lyan's,      but       longitudinally divided by a non-conducting                                  partition,
while the two conducting sides were furnished with mercury cups for
connecting them with the poles of a battery, the circuit being com
pleted through the metallic base.                             The instrument exists, or existed
a few years ago, though                 I   am at present unable to find it.                         As well
as    I   recollect, it was tried with an old-fashioned Cruickshank's                                     bat
tery of fifty pairs, without success. Indeed, now find that, even         I
with modern appliances, the experiment does not succeed when the
circuit is only          closed       whilst both points of bearing of the rocker
touch the mass or support.

     Since the date of the preceding notice (which was prepared for
being laid on the table of the Royal Society at their meeting on the
20th ult.),        I
               have continued and extended these experiments.     As
they are still in progress,                 I
                             will content myself with mentioning two
 results as worthy of notice.                     I have       obtained very active vibrations
of carbon (such as is used in one of the elements of Bunsen's bat
tery) resting upon brass, and also when it rests upon two pieces of
carbon connected with the terminals of a battery. For this purpose,
a battery having a certain amount of intensity is requisite, in order
to overcome the resistance of carbon as a conductor, but the vibra
tions      are most energetic.                   The extremely            small expansion which
takes place in carbon by heat is another argument against that view
of the Trevelyan experiment.      The other experiment to which                                                 I
refer      is,
         that bismuth (and perhaps other metals) are not merely in
active as vibrators with any electric power which    have used, but                I
the passage of electricity through them appears to have                                        a    quelling
power        which brings             the       rocker    to     instantaneous          rest   ;    yet   bis
muth permits            a   far freer passage of electricity                  than carbon          :   in one
experiment       I       found that sixteen times                    as   much      was        conducted.
Something          analogous was formerly                      observed       by   me    in connection
with heat applied             to bismuth.          I     am now attempting               to    investigate
the subject farther              by   experiment.

2.   On the Temperature of the Sea around the Coasts of
     Scotland during the years 1857 and 1858 ; and the bear
     ing of the facts on the Gulf-stream Theory.                              By James
     Stark, M.D., F.R.S.E., &c.
   By a reference to observations made on the temperature of the
air, of the sea, and the solid land, the author showed that the mean
temperature of each of these          in and      around Scotland       within
                                                                             were
the fraction of a degree of each other.              From observations made on
the temperature of the air and of the sea at stations on the west coast,
he showed that not only did the air and sea attain their respective
minima and maxima at the same time, but that even in their fluctua
tions of temperature they bore a distinct accord with each other.                       He
then pointed out that such fluctuations in the temperature of the sea
were quite fatal to the theory of the mild winters of                    Britain being
dependent on the influence of the Gulf-stream, as such fluctuations
could not occur were the temperature               of the sea dependent on the
heated waters    of the Gulf-stream.             From    a variety of considerations
he therefore     endeavoured to demonstrate                that the mild winters of
Britain   were   due to the south,        south-west,       and west winds, which
are the prevalent aerial currents which pass over Britain during the
winter season.
     He then examined the whole           evidence       brought forward by Maury
and    others for   the Gulf-stream flowing                up through         the    North
Atlantic to Britain and the North                Seas,    and by a reference to a
number of well ascertained facts, demonstrated that the Gulf-stream
has no such course ; but that, on the other hand,                it    is,   on the east of
the great Newfoundland            Bank,    deflected      southwards         by   the great
Arctic current, and        is   lost in that great calm mass of waters, the
Sargasso Sea, which exists in the centre of the Atlantic.
   He then pointed out the course of the currents in the North
Atlantic Ocean. He showed that though          small portion of the
                                                           a
Arctic current flows through the Gulf of St Lawrence, while another
portion   flows towards the American               coasts, washing the southern
shores of Newfoundland           and Nova Scotia, that the chief portion of
that   current   crosses    the Atlantic         towards    the western shores            of
 Europe and Africa.         That the upper part of this current entering
 the Bay of Biscay, washes round           it,   giving rise to the current known
as Bunnell's     current,   which as      it   leaves the Bay         of Biscay      crosses

                                       155
the mouth of the English Channel,          and flows    up   both sides of Ire
land.      That the middle portion of the Arctic current flows through
the Straits of Gibraltar to supply the wastes in the Mediterranean
 Sea.      And that the southern, and probably          the greater portion    of
  this Arctic current,     rushing towards the north-west      coast  of Africa,
 gives rise to that current so much dreaded by mariners, and known by
 the name of the North African current.
     He then showed that neither the Gulf-stream, nor any other
current in the North Atlantic, took their direction in           consequence   of
any influence of the rotation of the earth          on  its axis  ; and pointed
out the fact, that the direction of the equatorial current, of the Gulf-
stream as it issues from the Gulf of Florida, and of the Arctic cur
rent    as  it crosses to Western Europe     and Africa, are all opposed       to
such a supposition.
    He    also showed    that the Gulf-stream is bent back on the curved
coasts of Florida by the greater force of that portion of the Equato
rial current which flows to the north of St Domingo and Cuba, and
 meeting the smaller stream which issues from the Gulf of Mexico,
 forces it back on the Florida coast.       He   also  showed     that the east
 ward course of the Gulf-stream was given by the curved coasts of
  Florida, Georgia, and the two Carol inas.
     The author then referred to Commander             Becher's     bottle-chart
as   fully corroborating his views of the course of the currents in the
North Atlantic, and pointed out many facts, proved by that valuable
chart, which were quite opposed         to and   inexplicable     by the theory
that the Gulf-stream flows onwards towards Britain.
     The different specific gravities of the Arctic current and of the Gulf-
 stream, the density of the sea- water on our western shores during sum
 mer and winter, the existence of the telegraph plateau between New
 foundland      and Ireland, the finding   in the mud brought up from           it
volcanic ashes identical with those from Iceland, and the known limits
 of the whalebone and spermaceti whales, were all referred to as cor
 roborative of the views of the author.
     Dr Stark then summed up by showing the bearing of all the facts
he    had    stated on the question as to what caused the mildness of
 Britain's winters, and      showed  that they all corroborated the conclu
sion that the south-west        winds were the agents by which this was
effected.       He showed that the only countries of Europe which could
be    materially    benefited by these   winds   were    the  south of Spain,

                                        156
 Portugal,   Britain, and Norway ; while France, from lying far back,
 with the whole peninsula of Spain intervening between these winds
 and her, experienced to but a trifling extent their heating proper
ties, and consequently, though           much further       south, had a winter
 more severe than that in Britain.

 L Notice of a Shower of " a Sulphurous Substance" (so-
   called), which fell in Inverness-shire in June 1858. By
  John Davy, M.D., F.R.S., London and Edinburgh, &c.
   This shower took place about the 10th of June.                                   The following
account of it is from the Inverness Courier; and,                               as showing the
interestthe phenomenon excited, it was republished in most of the
English papers.  The copy                   I
                             give is from the Spectator of the 3d
July.
   " After the late thunder-storm, a
                                     deposit resembling sulphur was
observed in several places in this neighbourhood (Inverness).    At
Freeburn        it    lay on the road and grass in some places to a depth of
nearly       half an inch. At Craigton Cottage, near Kissock, the deposit
 was   observed on the top of water caught in a cask from the roof of the
house,       like a thick cream.    The sulphurous substance was skimmed
off, and      dried in a piece of flannel. When dry it was a fine powder,
and     whenthrown into the fire ignited exactly like gunpowder,
making a slight fizzing noise. Unfortunately none was preserved
beyond what was experimented on in this way. A boat at Craigton
was powdered           all over with the        same substance ; and a countryman
living on the heights near Kilmuir, says, that near his house, in the
space of what an ordinary washing-tub     would cover, he could lift
the powder           with   a spoon.      The heavy rains      have since washed                it all
away."
  This account,             so   far   as mere appearances are concerned,                 I   believe
to be    trustworthy         ;   I   can in part confirm    it,   as   it   happened that on
the    very day, the 10th of June,              I   was    en route         for Inverness by
the mail, proceeding by the upper Highland road. Just after cross
ing the Spey at Kingussie, the substance in question was seen, both
on the road and by the road-side.   It was in such abundance that
the guard had no             difficulty in collecting     a   quantity of           it   during the
few seconds that the coach was stopped for the purpose.                                   Of what

was then gathered         I   obtained a portion, which, on my return             home,
I  examined.
    The results,     as might be expected, proved that the substance                 was
not sulphur,     nor of a sulphureous nature,            but a vegetable        matter,
the pollen of the fir — Pinus sylvestris,             a tree of which        there   are
extensive forests on the banks of the Spey.                 Before     the blow-pipe,
it burnt with flame, without the slightest sulphureous odour                       ; and
left a little charcoal, which, when consumed,              yielded a minute        quan
tity of ash,   possessed       of  an alkaline reaction.       When first      inflamed
it made no such noise as that mentioned                in the newspaper;          nor   in
burning did it in the least resemble gunpowder.                     If thrown     on the
fire before it was quite dry, the noise describod in that notice                   might
have been      owing       to   the sudden conversion        of the moisture         into
steam, producing a slight crepitation.              Under the microscope it           was
found to consist of grains,            some    of a spherical     form,    others,    and
those of largest size,         of the   same form, with,      as   it were, a     lateral
addition, as    if a  smaller grain were attached, or as           if the  pollen grain
had been ruptured           at opposite points,      and a protrusion       of   some of
its contents had taken place.*              The diameter of a single grain was
about TsVffth of an inch.             The central part of those supposed to be
ruptured was commonly transparent, and exhibited a delicate granu
lar structure, which          was   rendered slightly     brown by the action            of
iodine.     The lateral protuberances were more or               less opaque.
    Comparing      the substance       under consideration       with    the pollen      of
the Scotch fir, taken fresh from the tree,               I find there is a perfect
resemblance in form and colour and other properties.                      Further,       in
corroboration,     it may      be mentioned,      that at the time of the occur
rence of the shower, this fir was in flower in the Highlands very
generally    ; and    it is well known that when ripe,              as  it was at     the
time specified, it is apt to be shaken off by gusts of wind                    and rain
in extraordinary        quantities,    so as to   produce what have        been called
"  sulphur-showers."            By Sir John Richardson             I   have been       in
formed     that   it   is not uncommon          to see the surface of the great
lakes in Canada covered with a thick scum of the same kind in                         the
vicinity of pine forests.
    What renders the event,            as  it took place in the Highlands,            re-
   * In the pollen   of   the   Scotch fir we find, that by the increase of the in-
tine the extine is separated into two hemispherical portions,            marked by    the
dark spaces at each end of the grains. —Edit. it. S. Proe.

markable,          and no doubt rare there,               is the extent of ground over
which the pollen fell, and the quantity of it that                        was   deposited.*
It   is worthy of notice, that this year the flowering of all our plants
has been astonishingly              abundant.         This circumstance        may account
for    the quantity ; and the rareness               of the phenomenon may         be owing
to the circumstances essential to its taking place seldom coming to
gether, such as the incident of a thunder-storm                      with rain just at the
time that the pollen is ripe for dispersion.
     In    the annals of the dark ages showers are recorded of a singular
kind     :  in those of Ireland, for instance, as detailed in the last valu
able census of that country,                mention      is made    of those   " of blood,"
of " a butter-like substance," &c.                ;   and, analagous to that in Inver
ness-shire,         " of  a shower    of a yellowish substance which resembled
brimstone."             This last mentioned is recorded             as having    "  fallen in
and about the town of Doneraile,"                   in 1748.
     In    conclusion,      I would beg to observe, that           I have been    particular
in the account of this pollen shower, with the                      hope  of showing that
an occurrence vaguely reported, assuming, from the manner in which
 it has been described by eye witnesses, a perplexing and mysterious
 character, when examined with the smallest aids afforded by science,
  loses those qualities,         and appears perfectly natural.             And,     I   would
 add, can       it   be doubted, that had other showers, such as the reported
 ones     of blood, &c.,       been in the same manner investigated, the result
 would have been             similar  ;   and in the place of a marvel,           we should
 have had           recorded an interesting,            and    it may have     been    an in
structive          fact.     Such    phenomena          might     perhaps,   in    particular
cases, servo a part to the              naturalist akin       to that  of coins and other
 remains        of art to the antiquarian, and lead to inferences in the
 science      of the former hardly less certain and valuable than those
 derivable from the latter in civil history.                     I venture to give an in
 stance      in illustration.        After finding the substance in question the
 pollen of the fir, it occurred to me as probable that the fir might be
 common in that part of Ireland where, according to the annals, the
 shower       of    a  yellow substance resembling sulphur fell              ;  and    I  learn
    * The      names     of the places given in the newspapers where the pollen was
 observed       denote,    it will probably be admitted, the great extent of surface
 over which the shower spread. Craigton Cottage and Kilmuir are, I am in
 formed, two miles from Inverness, about eighteen miles from Freeburn, and
 Kilmuir      is about forty-four miles from Kingussie ; that is by the mail-road,
 but np more than thirty-three           in a straight line due south.

that   it is  so.    In  a letter   with which    I  have been favoured by       Mr
Wilde, the compiler of the annals, to whom I applied for informa
tion, he says, —
                       "  I  have just seen a person from Doneraile, who
informs me, that it is the most            thickly wooded     part of the county
of Cork, and that the timber there is chiefly pine."
    2. Some       Remarks on the Roman Edition of the Vatican
               Manuscript.         By the Rev. Dr Robert Lee.
     Dr Lee commenced with a general account of the existing MSS.
of the Greek          Scriptures,    and particularly      of the Uncial      MSS.
These, though few in number in comparison                  of  the Cursive   MSS.,
are   of peculiar value, on account of their greater antiquity and the
superior purity of their text.             Fac-similes of several of the most
 important      of these interesting       documents were       exhibited.    After
 making      some    remarks    upon the Alexandrian,         the Ephraem,       the
Beza, and Clermont           MSS., Dr Lee remarked that all of          these  were
now, and most of them had long been, available to Biblical scholars
 by means of the excellent copies which had been issued, the posses
sors of the documents having afforded every facility and encourage
ment.       The only exception       was the    Vatican MS., of which he had
now to speak, and which had hitherto               been   withheld from inspec
tion, for reasons which might be guessed               but could not be justified.
He then proceeded          to describe this Codex, chiefly from the accounts
of Hug and Tischendorff,            concluding, with them, that its age could
not be later than the fifth, perhaps not later than the fourth century.
The lately     issued Roman       edition was then considered.         The prefaces
threw no light upon the delay and obstruction which had occurred —
 they spoke much, indeed, on the subject, but really said nothing.
 Dr Lee censured this work              on  several grounds.        1.  Because    it
 wanted Prolegomena,           which, in this case, were necessary, and, in
 deed,   indispensable     — the   more so as the jealousy of the authorities
 at the Vatican had prevented free access to those who were desirous
 to examine the Codex.            2. Because the work was gone about in a
 way which        could not but produce manifold mistakes and macula,
 which had accordingly been produced.               3.   Because the title gave a
  false description      of the Book,     which   was not " The Old and New
  Testament       according to the Vatican Manuscript,"           as the title held
  forth,  but the Greek        Scriptures    from the Vatican      MS., and    from
  various other MSS. of different and often uncertain date, of inferior

                                            161
 authority, but all far more modern.                 Not only are the defects of
 the   MS., such         as   the first forty-seven     chapters of Genesis,         the
 Apocalypse,        and other smaller        defects  supplied — excusably, if       not
 commendably        — but     large masses of matter, which never formed any
  part of the original         document, are arbitrarily inserted — such as the
  rejected  version of Daniel, and the whole four books of the Maccabees;
  so that the work is rendered           enormously voluminous          and expensive
 by the accumulation            of matter which has      no  title   to be there,    and
 which is no of value whatever in a critical point of view.                   But what
 Dr Lee considered the gravest of the sins with which this expensive
edition     was chargeable,         was  the insertion,   for dogmatic        and eccle
siastical reasons, of those spurious or doubtful passages in the New
Testament which are wanting in the Vatican and the other most
ancient authorities.            Such are Mark xvi.      9-20, Luke xxii. 43, 44,
John viii.     1—11, and        particularly   1 John v. 7.      The editor treated
these omissions          as  if  they were defects in his     MS.    ; whereas these
passages      were      insertions — i.  e.,  corruptions   introduced       into  later
documents.           What     made   the matter worse was, that in other cases
 in which the Vatican Codex wanted matter found in the common
  Greek text, it was omitted by Cardinal             A. Mai    ;  such as the     Doxo-
  logy to the     Lord's Prayer, Matthew vi. 13, also Matthew xxiii. 14,
 Acts xxiv. 7, 8, without any reason being assigned, or even any
 notice taken.         This different proceeding in different cases might be
 considered mere carelessness or accident by those who did not know
 that the   passages      arbitrarily introduced     had the support      of the Latin
 Vulgate,     while      those left out wanted that support.               For all the
 three omitted passages before noticed were wanting in that version —
 the first in all the editions and            MSS., the other two in its oldest
 and best      MSS.         This   was  denounced as flagrant partiality.             In
 short    (Dr Lee concluded),        men who are committed to certain versions
 and texts, and to certain           ecclesiastical systems and interests,         have
 nothing to do to be editing such works as this.                    They    can   hardly
 afford to be quite candid or perfectly honest; and though they were,
 they can hardly expect to get credit for these                  virtues.      The  book
  which costs nine pounds is, for critical           purposes — the     only purposes
  for which     it  was   wanted — not     worth nine shillings.         Williams and
  Norgate's    reprint of the New Testament            part — the     only part which
  is of any   importance — is        to cost  about this    moderate sum, and it
  will  possess    all the utility   and value of the five huge quartos.

         3. On the      Constitution of Flame.              By Mr Swan.
    In this   communication the author discusses the theory of the con
stitution of flame advanced          by Professor     Draper of New York, in
his paper    "  On the Production of Light by Chemical Action," which
appeared in the Philosophical Magazine for 1848.
    Professor     Draper refers to experiments             which    prove that     the
higher the temperature of an incandescent body, the more refrangible
are the rays of light emitted by it.            lie  assumes    that the tempera
ture of the outer portions of a flame is greater than that of the in
terior regions     ; for outside there    is a better      supply of oxygen, and
hence    a more intense combustion is maintained.               He thence      argues
that a flame must consist of a series of layers of different                  colours
following the order of tints in the prismatic spectrum, the red being
innermost      and the violet outermost.           Professor     Draper     conceives
that    he  has    demonstrated     by experiment         that   such    a structure
actually exists in flame.
    Mr   Swan, on a careful       examination      of various flames       conducted
essentially according to Professor         Draper's methods of observation,
with the exception of one particular          in which that observer's        process
seemed     objectionable, completely       failed to verify       his results   ;  and
on the following grounds believes his views regarding the constitution
of flame to     be erroneous   : —
     1st, Professor     Draper's    method of observation,          so far as it   can
be gathered      from his somewhat imperfect account of it, involves                an
error in principle calculated to lead to fallacious results.
    2d,   His theory is founded       on the quite gratuitous         assumption of
a great diversity of temperature         between     portions of flame so closely
contiguous, as to render the existence of such diversity of tempera
ture highly improbable.
     3d,   Even    although   great diversity of temperature            did exist in
different    portions of a flame, there is no reason to believe               that it
would give rise to a series of layers of different                colours.    As   the
 temperature      of  an incandescent body is raised,         rays of continually
 higher refrangibility are, doubtless, emitted          ;   but these are in every
 case accompanied by rays        of low refrangibility.        From this it   follows
 that the outer regions of a flame, however high their temperature,
 will not yield exclusively the extreme violet rays of             the spectrum, as
 Professor    Draper     supposes,    but will equally emit the extreme red

                                        163
ravs.    The inference, therefore, regarding the colours of         the different
regions   of  a flame which Professor          Draper has drawn from their
assumed diversity     of temperature,      is obviously inadmissible.

 1.  Biographical Memoir of the late Dr D. Skene of Aberdeen.
                By Alex. Thomson, Esq. of Banchory.
    This memoir commences by stating that it           seemed     desirable to
arrange     and preserve what memorials         could still be found of one
who had done very much to promote the study of natural science in
Scotland, but whose memory had well-nigh perished.
    Dr   Skene's father and grandfather       were both eminent physicians
in Aberdeen, where he       was born, on 13th     August 1731.
    His   early education was conducted in Aberdeen.           He spent    the
winter of 1751-2 in Edinburgh, attending various medical classes;
and in the autumn of 1752 proceeded to London, where he studied
under Hunter and Smellie, besides attending several of the hospitals.

                                            165
     In January 1753            he   went for a few months to Paris, in order
 still further    to    advance his professional         studies.       Extracts from
 letters to his family were read, giving vivid and interesting descrip
  tions of men and manners, and especially of his various teachers                     ;
  of the insolence of the Parisian Perruquiers, and how they obstructed
  the  other students     ;  and of the cost and worthlessness of the Ptheims
 degrees   of M.D., the        possession   of which was concealed        by the owner
 like the commission         of   a crime.
     Dr Skene returned           to Aberdeen    in the summer of 1753,'and on
8th September of that year received the degree of                M.D. from King's
College and University             ; and settled permanently      as assistant to his
father in Aberdeen.
     From    1753     to 1765,       he  carried on   his researches in Natural
History without aid, except from such books as then existed.*                       No
trace of scientific correspondence has been discovered, until his first
letter to    Mr Ellis,        the well-known      writer  on   corallines,    in 1765.
From that time to his death he kept up a close                  correspondence and
interchange of specimens with              Mr Ellis — discussing     particularly, at
 great length, the whole question of the nature of zoophytes, sponges,
 and   corallines  ;   the correspondence throwing much light on the state
  of natural science     at the time.
     In the same year Skene commenced a correspondence with Lin-
 neus ; and the original letters of Linnaeus were laid on the table,
 with the scroll-letters of Skene.                Skene wrote good Latin, and
 frankly controverted           the opinions     of the illustrious      Swede on the
 nature    of zoophytes, — maintaining            them to be animals, — the con
 structors   of their dwellings, and in opposition           to the theory that the
 dwellings constructed the animals.
     During their correspondence, the twelfth edition of the Systema
 Naturte was in the press, and Skene is repeatedly given as authority
 by Linnaeus.        It  is evident that he was much pleased with his only
 Scottish correspondent           — " Ubi   praeter te nullum    curiosum novi."
     In 1769, Skene         began    to correspond with Pennant       ;  and a regular
 correspondence       was maintained          during the rest of his life.       He  is
  frequently quoted in the Fauna, prefixed to Lightfoot's               Flora Scotica.
      Several proposals were made to make Skene a professor in Aber
  deen, and    Glasgow,        and Edinburgh, but he showed no great desire
     * The only instructions       he had on any branch    were during a few weeks'
  attendance on Dr Alston's Lectures, in the Botanic Garden, Edinburgh.

 to quit his established       position in his native town, in many respects
 well suited to his tastes.
     One correspondence, which was read, laid open a singular                   nego
 tiation for the sale of an Edinburgh Professorship,            the most remark
 able feature of which       was, that none    of the parties concerned          seem
 to have had the slightest idea that they were engaged in a most im
 proper transaction.
     Among his school correspondents whose letters have been preserv
 ed, are to be found Dr Hope, Dr Reid, whose letters to Skene were
 printed by Sir William Hamilton in his           Life of Reid, Mr Walker             of
 Moffat, Lord Kaimes, &c. &c.
     Skene was an active member of the Aberdeen Philosophical So
 ciety, where he read many papers on a great variety                   of subjects;
 and   he was also a member of a          Musical Society.        In 1769      he was
 admitted a member of the Edinburgh Philosophical                  Society, but     did
 not contribute any papers.
    He died in December            1770,   at the early age of 38.            He    left
behind him       a very considerable       quantity   of MSS., embracing,             in
 one   form or other,     most branches      of human knowledge            ;  and   the
 catalogue of his library proves him        to have been a very accomplished
general scholar.
    Several volumes of these papers were laid on the table; the most               im
 portant of which were three volumes of botanical, zoological, and ento
 mological descriptions    ;  and one containing a "Discourse on the Study
of Natural History,"      on which he had bestowed much pains, as several
copies have been found among his papers, in various stages               of progress.
    Few of his papers are dated, so that it is not easy from them                    to
 trace his progress    ; but much of his knowledge must have been                  ac
quired    before   the commencement of his            scientific correspondence,
which extends only over the last three or four years of his life.                 His
letters show that he possessed one characteristic of a true naturalist,
viz., his   willingness    to communicate to others            whatever facts       he
had ascertained, and whatever specimens he could collect.                    Though
his early death     prevented his publishing,      it  is very clear that he con
templated the preparation        of a complete Fauna and Flora of his            own
neighbourhood,      if not of the whole of Scotland        ;  and  it is  impossible
to say how much natural science         in Scotland may have been indebted
to him, from      the impulse       he communicated        to  all with    whom he
came in contact.

                                                            167
          The memoir concluded by stating, that though the subject could
 not be very interesting to those devoted                           to the active study         of natural
 science      at the present day, it had its value to those who took pleasure
 in studying the progress of human knowledge.
     2.    On a new        Arrow- Poison from China.                            By Dr Christison.
  In a newspaper printed at Shanghae, in the spring of 1857, a
wonderful account was given of a poison, which was said to be em
ployed in the         interior of China for destroying the largest animals.
Instant death was said to be produced, when an animal was struck
in the      trunk of the body with an arrow poisoned with it.                                    Such was
its potency,         according to the opinion of the Chinese,                              that a scheme
was said to have              been       set on foot for destroying                  the British       army
during the late war,                   by bringing           down to Canton              the natives who
were in       the practice of using it.                      But the     scheme      was frustrated       by
peace       being unfortunately proclaimed                        too soon.
      The poison,          and     apparently               the plant also,         are known by the
Chinese name of              Wu-Tsau,              or Tiger-poison.             The author received
'ery lately        from     Dr Macgowan,                    an American        physician       residing   at
Shanghae,          a specimen of the poison,                      and    of the      root of the plant
from       which it   is prepared.      The root presents all the characters of
an        Aconitum    on    a very small scale. This corresponds with the con
clusion to be drawn                from the characters                  of a few leaves which were
also sent,    and which scarcely differ from those of Aconitum ferox.
A     farther proof         is,
                       that the root produces    an intense degree the    in
very singular combination of numbness'and tingling, which    occa                                 is
sioned    chewing the root of any of the active aconites known in
             by
Europe, such as             A. Napellus, ferox,                   sinense,     or uncinatum.           The
poison itself, contained                in    a   little porcelain bottle,          is   obviously a very
well prepared extract              ;     and,      if   not entirely composed              of the extract
of the wu-tsau root, at                 all   events        must contain       it   largely,    for a very
minute       quantity produces the most intense tingling and numbness
of the tongue and lips after                      it   is   chewed.
      There can be no doubt, therefore,                           that the wu-tsau poison must
be    extremely energetic.                    But the author            objected     to   the admission
that either this or any other arrow-poison can produce instant death,
as    is   often   stated         by   travellers.           Every poison, however energetic,
must be absorbed              into the            blood before          it   can act.      Even    from a

                                           168
wound, absorption         cannot take place suddenly.            Some   time   is re
quired before enough can enter the blood.                 When   death takes place
instantly, the cause must be the mechanical violence inflicted by                  the
arrow.     The author exhibited various poison-arrows             used in different
parts of the world,        which were adequate to occasion most               deadly
wounds      if  they struck      the trunk of the body         over an important
organ   ;  and he also showed           that   even   the little slender     wooden
poison-darts,      used   in some parts of the world for destroying              birds
and small animals, by being shot from a blowing-tube,                may be    easily
projected with      a force amply sufficient to       kill a small  bird or  animal
by the violence        inflicted,    apart   from   the more tardy deleterious
influence exerted by the poison.
3. On      the Connection           between Temperature           and Electrical
  Resistance in the simple Metals.                 By Balfour Stewart,         Esq.
    About    a fortnight     since  I  mentioned to Professor Forbes that            the
resistances of the simple metals to the passage of electricity               seemed
to be very nearly in proportion            to their absolute temperature,          this
relation being especially manifest for those values of the resistances
determined by       M. Arndtsen.
    Professor Forbes        informed     me   that this coincidence had already
been observed       by Professor Clausius,        and that     an abstract     of    his
paper was given in the Philosophical Magazine for November                        last.
On referring to Professor Clausius's             original paper, it would seem
that the coincidence had suggested              itself to him as a remarkable
similarity occurring between the rate of increase (due                      to tem
perature) of the electrical resistance of those metals, and                  that of
the volume of a gas under constant pressure.                  It would seem that
the   fact was     unconnected       in his mind with any theoretical             con
siderations.
    As, however,       I was    led to look for and remark         the coincidence
by theoretical      considerations,      perhaps this Society will permit            me
to lay before them a short statement of my views.
    The   passage    of electricity along a wire is generally viewed in             the
following    light : — The     free electricity of one particle decomposes          the
electricity of the particle next        it; the two electricities then     combine
by sparking across the interval ; and the same thing is renewed oier

                                        169
 and over again with extreme rapidity.            Now, whether electricity     be
 viewed    as a substance     or a motion,     we may suppose that a polar
 ized   state of particles    is alternately produced and destroyed with
 great    rapidity while    an electrical current passes along a conducting
  wire.
     And by a polarized state of particles we would mean a peculiar
 disposition with respect to the direction in which the electricity is
travelling,    of the matter,    or it may be motion,      of the particles of
the substance.
    Again, an     idea very generally    entertained with regard to heat is,
that    it consists in a vortical or rotatory motion of the particles of
a substance.
    Now, with only very general ideas regarding the mode of elec
trical conduction and the nature of electricity, we may suppose that
the    polarization which conduction demands will          be   resisted in pro
portion to the rotatory energy of the particle             ;  just   as a rapidly
rotating     top or cylinder      would   resist any attempt      to  change its
plane    of motion.
    The resistance of     a particle  to electrical polarization would, there
 fore,  be  in proportion   to its rotatory vis viva — viz., its absolute tem
  perature.     This only holds with regard        to simple bodies ;    in com
 pound     bodies the passage of electricity         may be supposed to be       a
 more complicated       phenomenon.

    He next enters   on the details   of the natural history of the herring,
describing its characteristics    and its distinctive difference from other
fishes of its class.   The important question of its      food, is elaborately
examined;     and it is shown, as stated to the author by Agassiz, that
the herring does not confine itself to one species of food, namely
that the food    usually  consists   of minute crustacea     ;  but during the
spawning season it feeds on sand-eels, the fry of various fishes, and
even its own spawn.
   The author    has ascertained a new and important fact from personal
observation, regarding the cohesion of the spawn, and the power of
adhering   strongly   to substances on which it may be placed, which
only takes place on the fecundation of the roe by the milt.
   Many writers reiterate      the   opinion, that the herring is a native
of the distant northern   seas.     This the author shows to       be an error,
proving that the fish is a permanent inhabitant of our coasts.
   He, for the first time, gives     a complete description     of the visits of
the herring, or its geographical      and chronological    distribution    over
the surface of the globe, so far as is known      ; and his work is the first
and only one which exhausts the difficult questions which have hitherto
arisen regarding the most valuable and important             fish,   which   the
bounty of Providence sends       to supply food for the human race.

     Professor KELLAND, Vice-President, in                      the Chair.
   The following Communications              were read    : —
1. Some      Inquiries concerning Terrestrial Temperature.                  By
                         Professor J. D. Forbes.
   In this paper the writer starts by assuming Dove's Tempera
tures for the mean of every 10th parallel of latitude, from 75° N.
to 40°   S., to  be correct.   His object is to inquire      how far the influ
ence  of the proportion of land and water in modifying the annual
temperature of a given parallel is susceptible of being reduced to a
formula.
   The amount of land and water in different latitudes is fi rst tabulated.
   It  is then shown, from an examination          of the ordinary isothermal
curves,   and   also from    Dove's   charts of the    " Thermic Anomaly,"
that the influence     of land  is to exalt the temperature       of lower lati
tudes,   and to depress that of higher latitudes.           About the latitude
of 42 °or 43° this influence         is nil;  and the temperature of that
parallel is independent of the proportions of land and water.               For
convenience     of calculation, however, the latitude of 45° is assumed
as the one    free from this anomaly.
   The writer shows that the decrement of temperature along an
oceanic meridian (that of Greenwich, for example) proceeds nearly
as the   simple cosine of the latitude (which is Sir D. Brewster's for
mula) ; while along a continental meridian (one passing through
Siberia) it is more nearly as the square of the cosine (the law of
Mayer.)
   Hence it is argued that the temperature of any parallel may pro
bably be represented by a formula containing (1) a constant ; (2)
a term    varying with    a power   of the   cosine   not differing much from
unity ; (3) a term for the effect of land, containing as a factor the
 proportion of land on the parallel, and also the factor cos. 2 lat.,
 which renders it additive below 45°, and subtractive afterwards.
    vol. iv.                                                           z

                                         174
    Considering,   first, the northern       hemisphere alone, the constants
are introduced into such a formula by a comparison of the observed
temperatures     of latitudes 0°, 30°, 50°, and 70°, with the following
result   :—
              TV= 12°5 + 59°-2        cos. f \ + 38°-l L'  cos. 2x
where Tx is the temperature of latitude X on Fahrenheit's scale,
and L' the effective proportion of land in the circumference of that
parallel.
    The extension of       the   formula    to the southern     hemisphere     is
shown to give satisfactory results, although all merely empirical for
mulae   for the northern hemisphere altogether fail in this case.
    Some other and independent            confirmations of the formula       are
then adduced.
    Supposing the globe to be entirely composed           of land, or entirely
of water, the temperature of any parallel may be deduced              from the
formula.      In the case of a globe all land, the Equatorial tempera
ture would be about 110°, and the Polar temperature about — 26°;
whereas, on an aqueous sphere,          the former would be about 72°,      and
the latter + 12°.
  2. On the Spermogones and               Pycnides of Lichens.         By W.
       Lauder Lindsay, M.D., F.L.S.               Communicated        by Prof.
       J. H. Balfour.
    The researches contained in the author's memoir, of which                the
following   is a brief abstract, extended over a period of several       years,
and are based on careful microscopic examination of several               thou
sand specimens of lichens          from every part of the known world.
The author examined the lichens of the Hookerian Herbarium                     at
Kew, which contains an unrivalled series of specimens collected               by
the various surveying      and exploring expeditions of the        British  Go
vernment, as well as by all the more distinguished              modern British
travellers.   This collection  is further valuable, from containing authen
tic specimens collected and named by Borrer, Turner, Hooker, Bro-
die, Carmichael, Babington, and other distinguished British lichenolo-
gists, as well as by Acharius, Schaerer, Swartz, and other continen
tal authors.     Access was also had to the Menziesian           Herbarium    in
the University of Edinburgh, the Herbaria of the said University,
of the Botanical Society of Edinburgh, of the Museum of Irish

                                          175
Industry, Dublin, and of Dr Mackay of Dublin, which last contains
authentic specimens of the lichens described by Dr Taylor in the
"  Flora Hibernica."          The fasciculi of dried specimens published by
Schaerer, Hepp, Leighton, and others, as well as large numbers of
specimens       gathered in, and      sent from, various       parts of England,
Wales, Scotland,          and Ireland,     were also examined.         Besides the
examination         of dried specimens in herbaria, the author studied
lichens      extensively in their native habitats on the mountains of
Scotland and Norway, and elsewhere.
    With the exception of two short memoirs,* already published by
the author, the researches in question are the first that have been
made on the subject under review in this country.                   The memoir is
essentially organography, and gives full details of the characters of
the spermogones and pycnides of the higher lichens, — that section,

    The crustaceous section of the lichen family has been examined
by the author in a similar manner; but. the description of the
pycnides     and spermogones          of the lower lichens is reserved for        a
separate memoir.           Neither   does  he profess to enter upon the ques-
tio vexata of the physiology           of reproduction    in lichens    generally.
To this subject       also he proposes devoting a special        memoir.       The
memoir      contains,     inter alia, descriptions of the spermogones, or
pycnides, of many species, in which they either have not hitherto
been found, or in which they are very rare and difficult of discovery.
Such are the spermogones of Usnea barbata,                 Thamnolia vermicu-
laris, Neuropogon melaxanthus, Alectoria jubata and A. Taylori,
Evernia furfuracea, Lecanora tartarea, &c. The letter-press of
the memoir is accompanied by 16 quarto plates of coloured drawings
— amounting         to   several hundreds — and by specimens of lichens,
 bearing spermogones or pycnides, amounting to about 140.
     Among the more interesting or important general                 facts brought
 out by the memoir, may bo enumerated the following                : —
     1.   In addition     to  the sporiferous    organs, —so long familiar         to
 botanists,  — called     Apothecia, lichens possess more or less microscopi
 cally minute organs,          called Spermogones.      The latter organs        the
 author has found alike in species from arctic and antarctic, temperate
 and equatorial, regions.
     2. The spermogones of lichens may concisely be described as fol
 lows   : — In form    they are usually more or less spherical or oval, ap
 pearing     on  the surface of the thallus         as   punctiform     or papillav
 form, wart-like or barrel-shaped, bodies.            In colour they are usually
  blackish, brownish,        or of divers colours.     In site they are usually
  scattered over particular portions of the          thallus — seldom generally
  over its whole surface;          they are usually more or less immersed in
  the tissues of the thallus, sometimes they are sessile on its surface,
  or on the apices of its ramifications,        when it is erect and fruticulose.
  In  size they are seldom sufficiently large to be visible to the naked
  eye, and are frequently so minute that they can, with difficulty, be
  recognised even       with the aid of      a good lens.     In  the latter    case,
  especially, it   is advisable or necessary to moisten the thallus         in order
  to render them prominent from the contrast of colour or surface.
  They consist of          a capsule,   enclosing a cavity,    that opens     to the
  surface by a minute pore or ostiole, which is generally of a darker
   colour than the said capsule.          From the inner wall or surface of the

                                           177
capsule project, convergently            into the cavity, a series of filaments,
closely    aggregated, called Sterigmata.               These    are either    simple,
formed     of  a single     elongated      cell, — or  compound,      made    up of a
series of cells, varying in size and           fjrm, superimposed the        one upon
the other.       They produce from            their apices, when simple,       — from
apices and sides, when compound or articulated,                   —a    succession of
very minute, solid, homogeneous corpuscles, called Spermatid.                     Just
as the importance of the apothecia resides in the spores, so the im
portance of the spermogones resides in the spermatia.                      These cor
puscles are destitute of any essentially vital               motions, though they
frequently,     from their great tenuity, exhibit Brown ian or molecular
movements.          Nor are they provided with any such               appendages       as
cilia.
     3. Spermogones         usually occur on the same plant              or specimen
 which     bears   apothecia    :  sometimes, however, only on barren plants
 or specimens.        Hence,      in regard      to  apothecia and spermogones,
 lichens    have been described           by continental     authors as monoecious
 and dioecious.        Again, spermogones occur in some                species   which
 never bear apothecia, as in Thamnolia vermicularis.
      4. Spermogoniferous          states   of many    species   are  what were       re
 garded     by the older lichenologists          as separate varieties,     species,   or
 even genera,      e. g., vars. encausta and vittata of Parmelia physodes,
 and var. denticulata of Platysma nivalis.                 The discovery, therefore,
 of spermogones         and   pyenides      simplifies   lichenology     by abolishing
 certain genera,        species,    and varieties, and materially        reducing    the
  number of names,        e. g. the old genera Cliostomum, Thrombium,                and
  Pyrenothea, being found to consist wholly of spermogoniferous states
  of more familiar lichens, have been abolished.
      5. To a certain extent, or with trifling exceptions, just as certain
  families or genera of lichens are characterised by apothecia and
  spores of a particular kind, so they are also characterised frequently
  by spermogones, sterigmata,              and spermatia of a particular kind.
  Thus Usnea and Ramalina have wart-like spermogones of the same
  colour with the t hall us, and inconspicuous in consequence thereof.
  The spermogones of Cladonia are barrel-shaped,                    deep   brown, and
  easily visible.        Those of Parmelia are mostly                punctiform,     im
  mersed, black or brown, very minute and crowded ; those of Physcia
  are mostly papillaeform ; and those of Collema and Leptogium
   discoid, and of a pale brown or yellow colour.               In Sticta, Bicasolia,

                                        178
 Umbilicaria,      Collema,   Leptogium,       Thamnolia,       Coccocarpia,      and
Placodium, the sterigmata         are articulated,      consisting    of numerous,
short,     broadish,   frequently    thick-walled,      cells.    They     are   also
articulated     or compound, — but the          component       cellules   are   few,
longish, and delicate, — in Usnea, Neuropogon,                Parmelia, Evernia,
and   Platysma.       They   are simple     and filiform in Ramalina,           Cla
donia, Ephebe, and Lichina.           The spermatia of Cladonia and Roe-
cella are curved or sickle-shaped.             Those     of Squamaria are       very
long, slender, and twisted or curved.           Those of Collema, Leptogium,
and Umbilicaria are short, straight rods            ;  while those of Ramalina,
Ephebe, and Lichina, are oblong or oval-oblong.
    6. The spermogones sometimes              of themselves yield important
characters for classification.      For instance, the spermogones, sterig
mata, and spermatia         of Thamnolia vermicularis are sufficient                of
themselves to separate this puzzling lichen from the genus Cladonia,
in which it has hitherto been almost uniformly placed.
    7. Spermogones        frequently outwardly        resemble, and are there
fore apt to be confounded with —
       a. Nascent apothecia, as in some Ricasolias ;
       b. Pycnides,     described below   ;
       c.   Minute Verrucarias ; or
       d. Minute parasitic fungi, chiefly of the genus            Sphtria.
For instance, the author frequently              receives    from   correspondents
as   new     Verrucarias     what   prove    to   be   merely    sperm ogoniferous
states    of other lichens.     From all the bodies above named, sper
mogones      may at once be distinguished         by microscopic examination,
and by     this alone.
    8. The spermogones of lichens            are now generally          regarded    as
male organs of reproduction         — the    spermatia      being supposed     to be
analogous in function to the antherozoids or spermatozoids of other
cryptogams,       and   to be  endowed with a fecundating             or fertilizing
influence on the spores.        But it is necessary        to state  distinctly that
this is a    mere hypothesis, for direct or distinct proof is still wanting.
The following       circumstances,    however, give great support            to this
hypothesis, and ought, at all events, to be borne constantly in mind in
all speculations on the functions of the spermogones and spermatia : —
       a. Intimate relation between the spermogones and apothecia in
            regard to site — the former       being generally seated        in close
            proximity   to the latter.     As illustrations of this intimate

                                           179
           relationship,    it may    be   stated   that spermogones sometimes
           occur —
           1.   In the hypothecial tissue of the apothecium              itself, as in
               Celidium fusco-purpureum,            Tul. [Mem., PI. 14., f. 12.]
           2. On the apothecium itself,             as   in Lichina   pygmcea and
               confinis, and sometimes in Cladonia rangiferina.
           3. On the exciple of the apothecium, as in Urceolaria scru-
              posa and Parmelia conspersa.
       b.   Relative    period     of development, — the        spermogones      nor
           mally preceding the apothecia.             Spermogones should there
           fore be    looked for      in specimens bearing         no apothecia     or
           young apothecia       ;  when the apothecia are mature, we should
           expect to find the spermogones old, and perhaps degenerate.
       c. Relative abundance of spermatia and spores, — the former
          being infinitely more numerous than the latter.
      d. Relative size of spermatia and spores, — the former being
           infinitely the smaller.
       e.  Essential    difference     in structure       between   spermatia     and
          spores,    the former        being   solid, simple,     or homogeneous,
          without septa ; the latter vesicular, frequently compound or
           septate, with heterogeneous contents.
     /.    Essential difference in form, the spermatia being usually
          elongated and of extreme tenuity, tho spores being generally
          oval or spherical.
      g. Greater constancy of size in spermatia than in spores, which
          are frequently       very variable      in this    respect.   Some sper
          matia are much larger when attached to their sterigmata than
          when free — as in some Parmelias ; but this is only an ap
          parent anomaly, for it would appear that they normally split
          into two on being shed from their sterigmata.
      h. Absence of all germinative faculty, — so far as yet known.
      j. Similarity in structure between the capsule or envelope of
          the spermogone and the exciple of the apothecium,                     — the
          cellular tissue of which they are             composed   being generally
          the same.
      k. Constancy of occurrence of spermogones in all lichens, and
          from every part of the world yet visited by man.
   9. Many lichens possess,            in addition     to apothecia and spermo
gones,    minute    organs,     outwardly     resembling      spermogones, called

                                          180
Pycnides.         They may    be described in general terms as papillseform or
wart-like bodies, generally black, — sometimes brown, — usually very
minute,     — generally partially     immersed in the thallus, on the surface
of which they are scattered, — occupying a site similar to that of the
spermogones.          Indeed they differ essentially from spermogones only
in containing        corpuscles,    called   Stylospores,     which are spore-like
bodies,   — sometimes      septate,  — usually    oval or pyriform in shape, —
but varying        greatly both in form and size, with oily, distinct con
tents, always        borne on    the apices     only of simple        or unicellular,
strongish sterigmata.
     10.    As the essential difference      between    spermogones and pycnides
lies in the characters of the contained corpuscles, and as their char
acters are      of great importance,     as bearing on the physiological         func
tions of the said corpuscles, the comparison or contrast                   undernoted
is  made: —
                  Spermatid.                                Stylospores.

                                                   neous—in part, at least, oily.
2. Always colourless.                           2. Sometimes pale yellow.

 4. Of uniform      size and shape.             4. Varying more or less in size
                                                   and shape.

    bedded in a mucilage.                          mixed.

    they are simple, on the apices and             simple   and  stoutish.
    sides when articulated.
     11. There is much more dubiety and difficulty regarding the na
 ture of the pycnides and the functions                of the stylospores than      re
 garding the nature and functions of the spermogones and spermatia.
 Two hypotheses have            been    advanced      regarding    the pycnides and
 stylospores, viz. —
         a.   That they are substitutes for the spermogones and sperma
             tia, — or in other words,        a different    form or type thereof.
             What lends probability        to  this view, is the perfect resem
             blance to spermogones in outward              appearance, site, &c. of

                                             181
            such pycnides as those of Peltigera,               in which the contained
            corpuscles are the only reason for regarding                    the concep-
            tacles as pycnides rather than spermogones.                   But in certian
            lichens pycnides co-exist            with spermogones of the ordinary
            character.
        b.   That they are sporoid in function            as well as form and gene
            ral aspect.      The strong argument            in favour of this view is
            their germinative faculty.            According      to this view, pycnides
            may be regarded as secondary apothecia, or female organs,
            — and      stylospores       as  secondary or supplementary           spores
            It   has been noticed that, in certain cases, there is a general
            resemblance in form between               the stylospores and the spores
            of  the same species       ;   but this, if not exceptional,      is still far
            from being the general rule.
     12. Pycnides are much more common among the lower, or crus-
taceous, lichens, than among the higher or fruticulose, filamentous,
and foliaceous ones        ;  while, on the other hand, the spermogones are
most abundant and distinct in the latter.                 Pycnides     would appear to
be a connecting         link between the lichens and the fungi,                  and   we
 find   them      most   frequent,      perhaps,     in species     most nearly allied
 to the fungi.
     1 3. Pycnides may occur in plants or specimens                  bearing apothecia,
 but not spermogones         ; or they may occur alone, both apothecia and
spermogones         being absent     ;    or pycnides and spermogones,            one   or
both, may occur in species seldom or never bearing apothecia, as in
some species of Strigula.
    14. Pycnides, from          their outward          resemblances, are apt to be
confounded with, or mistaken for, —
        a. Spermogones.
        6. Minute Verrucarias.
        e.   Minute parasitic fungi, for which,           indeed, they have hitherto
            been    almost universally         mistaken.      Pycnides resemble the
            fructifications    of   fungi,     called    by the     older  mycologists,
            Diplodia, Phoma, Septoria, Cytispora, Sclerotium,                     Mesal-
            mia, Phyllosticta, and Polystigma.
    15.    A   few lichens,   — especially      crustaceous ones, — possess several
forms of spermogones, or of pycnides, or of both, — though such a
phenomenon is comparatively rare. This is just what occurs in such
fungi    as   Erysiphe,      which     has   five several forms         of reproductive
    vol. iv.                                                             2 A

                                         182
 organs.     The simultaneous occurrence of spermogones and             pycnides
 also characterises certain       fungi,  e.g.,  Sphceria   epicymatia,   Wallr.
 Indeed, the presence of multiform           reproductive    organs in lichens,
 renders more indefinite and unsatisfactory the line of definition            be
 tween them and the fungi       ;  or in other words, renders more clear      and
 intimate the alliance between these two great cryptogamic families.
     16. By the discovery in Germany in 1850,              and the subsequent
 description by various French and German authors, of the spermo
 gones and pycnides      of lichens, this family of plants has been placed
 on, at least, as good   a footing, in respect of their anatomy and phy
 siology, as other cryptogamic families, which have hitherto been more
 carefully and successfully studied.

    The following Communications were read : —
    1. On some       First Principles of        a  Mental Science, deduced
          from Correlations of the Primary Laws of Matter and
          Mind.        By Dr Laycock.
    The author      commences       his communication by showing the need
that  has   arisen for  a  scientific exposition of the laws of thought in
relation to the laws of life and organization.              In all the practical
business    of  society, as  well   as of the physician, the phenomena of
life and mind are inseparably associated ; and consequently without
such scientific      exposition    anything    like a scientific application of
mental     philosophy     to medicine and the sciences of human nature,

                                           184
    included under sociology, is impossible.           But physiology is itself           a
   derivative   science,   inasmuch as vital processes are primarily depen
   dent upon certain molecular forces of matter, known as light, heat,
   chemical affinity, &c.     Consequently,     if philosophy cannot        be separated
   from physiology or the science of vital function, neither can physio
   logy be separated from physics.             Philosophy, therefore, ought             to
    include in one harmonious         and comprehensive body of doctrine all
   the fundamental       principles   of the natural       sciences.       It   would   to
   this end take cognisance of three great departments of human know
   ledge — the   physical, the vital or biological, and the metaphysical.
       The author next     shows that as science        has     already developed       in
   each   of these   departments       a number      of general laws which only
   await higher generalizations to bring them all under laws still more
   general, and thus secure that unity of the sciences to which they all
   tend, it is the proper business of philosophy to supply those higher
  generalizations.       These,   the author      argues, must be derived from
  the common sense and experience of mankind                  ;  for that    experience
  consists in a knowledge of the laws of           nature, — not      formularized,     it
  is allowed, in express propositions,       — but    acted     upon by man in all
  his relations.    The experience of mankind            is expressed,      however, in
  at least three different, yet closely related       mode6 — namely,         in his lan
 guage, in the laws which regulate his conduct as a social being, and
  in his conduct as an individual.          If   man's experience of the great
  uniformities    of nature,     as   expressed in these three modes, can              be
 compared with the results of scientific              research and formularized
 into general propositions, these propositions will express fundamental
 empirical laws fit to be received        amongst the highest generalizations
 of philosophy, considered as a practical knowledge of the general laws
 of nature.       After having shown by illustrations the application of
 this method of deducing general empirical laws, the author pro
 ceeds to examine the generalizations            or fundamental          ideas implied
in the words law, force, mind.
      The term law,    as commonly used,         denotes    the written       or spoken
words in or by which is expressed the will of any person or persons,
having the power to compel others to adapt their conduct to the will
so expressed.       Conduct so compelled would be a uniform succession
of events     occurring    according to law.        In  science,    whenever a uni
form succession      of  events or    of phenomena in nature            is observed to
take place, the expression          in words or signs of that uniformity               is

                                                    185
termed a law.             Thus it    is a law of nature           that air has weight, that
all men die, and the like.                    But, as the order         of   succession       is logi
cally    a fixed and necessary            order, so the law which represents or
expresses the order is logically a necessary law.                            In this attribute
of fixedness the mind             recognises         a resemblance between              the order
and the law which expresses                   it,   so that as to the quality         of    necessity
and fixedness, the law and the order                        are    convertible        things,     and
the law stands for the order.
     Force     is   a   word arising out of man's experience of this necessary
order of       events.      He finds the fixed order              to be an inevitable order,
and this idea of inevitableness implies logically an irresistible                               force
or power which compels to or maintains the order.                                     Hence, cor
relative with order and law there    conception of                                the      power or
                                                       is
                                                       a
force upon which the inevitableness of the order depends.                                    In this
way law and force become    in language convertible terms    and we                     ;
speak equally of the law of gravity and the force of gravity, — the
laws of attraction and the force of attraction  and we say generally
                                                                   ;
of   a   thing,      that   it   has the force         of law.      Nevertheless, the term
force has its own meaning,                    and specially includes or expresses the
idea of causation independently of inevitableness.                               In its strictest
sense    it   is   that which compels to the course of events expressed                             in
the law without             reference to the formula               or the order.            Yet the
term     is   used correlatively        with the order expressed             ;   so   that order,
law, and force equally express the same ideas                          of uniform sequence,
fixedness, inevitableness, and an inevitably compelling force.                                  Thus
motion in       a   straight line implies            both a force that impels, and an
unchanging          continuousness       in   the line of motion until an equal force
interrupts or deflects.                Starting from        these      generalizations of the
words force and law, the author proceeds to show, that as the primary
laws and forces are thus inevitable and fixed, the order which they
compel        and    express     can    only be modified            by equal forces acting
according to like laws           ;   since, logically, the inevitable alone can con
trol itself.        Hence, he concludes, that all these phenomena of nature
which appear to be deviations from the primary forces and laws of
nature   (as the resistance to the force of gravity which the upright
position of man implies, and the like) are in fact due to laws and
forces derivative from the primary, and which are therefore se
condary and contingent               laws and forces.         And      since the phenomena
of nature are all, in fact, deviations from                       one or two primary            laws

                                                18G
or forces, science may be defined to be a knowledge of these devia
tions from the primary laws and forces, formularized                               in contingent       or
derivative      laws.         Hence,     too,   the tendency of all the sciences                       to
centre upon a few generalizations.                     It    is,   in fact, upon these              ideas
that the recent doctrines as to the correlations or the physical forces
are substantially         founded.
     The author having called attention                    to these     doctrines, shows that
the generalizations            he points out extend to                sociology.         Social     laws
must, as to society, be logically                   necessary laws, for without them
society cannot exist.             If   the laws be not executed, society, as held
together       by   law, ceases to exist,            and    is     resolved into its elements.
Hence all the laws of society whatever, whether written or implied,
are necessarily correlative with                a   power or force sufficient                 to com
pel men to adopt their actions to the prescribed order.                               In      this way
we  speak of the force of opinion in reference to the unwritten
natural laws, and of the requirements of the law, just as we speak
of the necessary laws of nature and the inevitable laws of God.
   In determining the generalizations included in the word mind,                                     the
author observes that, when we speak of the law, or laws, in reference
to the conduct of man in society, we not only have in view                                     the fact
that there     is   an order     of    events or actions to be followed, expressed
in law, and         a   power to compel to that order, or obedience                              to the
law  ;   but we know as         a   fact of experience that the order                    is   designed
with regard to certain ends to be obtained,                         as results       of the order.
And      we can go      a     step  farther,and find that the designer (or de
signers) either         is    the force necessary to compel obedience  to the
designed order, or delegates    to others.
                                         it In the great uniformities
of nature we recognise    similar cause.
                                 a         When we speak of the ne
cessary    laws of those uniformities,               we not only include             a   conception
of the force which compels the uniformities,                          but we go beyond            it   in
causation,      and      think of the something which both designed                                  the
order implied           in the uniformities,           and       originated       the compelling
force.    Now this       is   what men designate mind.                 It   is   the first cause       in
creation, as
                it
                is       in man's actions.            It   follows, therefore, that             a   true
mental science should set forth the correlations between mind as mani
fested in man, and mind                as manifested         in creation.           In   addressing
himself to this ta^k, the author                    points out, by way of preliminary
remark,     that the design must be carefully distinguished                                   from the
designer   ;   and the law of design or the expression                           of the results        of

                                                  187
the order, from the thought or                     the    thinker.        If   we examine       the
order of phenomena in creation,            at least conceive (what is
                                                   we can
analogous to our own experience of our own mental processes and acts),
that the whole order of creation                        was    pre-existent      in the Divine
mind as a thought        before the order itself began.                         But farther,    we
can also see the logical necessity, that when once the design was
made it must be inevitable,                 for   we find       that the great laws of na
ture in which design is expressed are inevitable. Hence a mental
law and a mental force both dominate, and are correlative with the
physical laws and forces,              or the forces           of matter.       So that there is
no such thing in nature as chance                   ;   the word only implying the un
known to man as to order, law, and cause, and more especially appli
cable to derivative laws and forces.                      It   follows, therefore, that what
we term physical laws and forces are only lower generalizations                                of a
primary mental law and force, and consequently correlative there
with.  Motion and order are thought in act.   So that the entire
phenomena of creation are under the derivative                                laws and forces of
mind.
     Such a generalization             implies, however, a change in the method
of research.        Experience             is content to know            what is the uniform
succession   or order of phenomena, and what are the laws and forces
correlative therewith         ;   but so soon as a law of design is the object of
inquiry, it becomes necessary to examine the order of phenomena
with regard to the ends arrived at in the order ; that  to deter                     is,
mine the results of the uniform succession.                         Hence teleology, or the
doctrine of final causes,             is   as applicable to both physical and biologi
cal researches as to the metaphysical,                         and must be considered the
true guide to the highest researches in natural                           science,   just    as the
law of design and mind subsume all other forces                           and laws.
     Proceeding to apply the teleological                      method, the author next          in
quires what    is   the most general physical result                     in   creation, or    " Fi
nal cause" of the primary law of design and its correlative force.
This result,   he argues, must logically                  be at least the combination            of
things into wholes,      or       a   whole, of mutually related parts               ;     and such
ispractically the result in the physical as distinguished from the
moral world, of both the general and the derivative laws and forces.
The primary forces of matter operate to the end that the great masses
of matter shall form wholes of mutually related parts, as in our
planetary and other solar systems, and in                          the   universe made up of

                                         188
 systems   ; while the derivative       laws and forces operating in life            and
 organization,     result in an organism,         which, according to the defini
 tion of Kant, "     is that in which     all  the parts are mutually ends and
 means."
     Applying     these   doctrines to the primary law             of  consciousness,
 the author maintains that such a result of the law of design, aimed
 at and attained, may be designated in relation to the consciousness,
 the idea of unity ; in relation to the external world, the law of unity.
 The law implies two things — construction of parts in mutual rela
 tion —or organization ; and action of the parts in mutual relation
 as a whole, or     individual life.     The fundamental          idea of conscious
 ness — the intuition in      man  of the "      I am,"    or Ego, is the ultimate
 result presented to the consciousness of these two things.                  It  is the
 final  cause    of all those derivative         or correlative     laws and     forces
 of the primary law of mind           and    primary     forces  of matter,     which,
              in his body as "                       " laws    and   forces, or vital
operating                           teleorganic
laws and forces of adaptation to ends, build up his body into an or
ganism.
    In this way (the author       proceeds     to show) we arrive at the origin
of all other    necessary   or intuitional    truths, of which the' conception
of design itself is     one  of the most fundamental.            The mind of      man
having thus the results of the great law of design                  presented to it
as intuitive    ideas, in virtue   of the teleological operation in his orga
nization of the physical and vital forces, must be potentially, and
when fully evolved in correlation with organization, actually a mi
crocosm.       And it follows, from the correlation of the physical,
vital, and mental forces of creation, that all the intuitive ideas of               the
human mind are to be discovered in the external world, as derivative
results of the primary law of design           ;   or, in other words, as     ideas oi
the Great Thought manifested in creation.                    The author     therefore
maintains      that such a true science           of ideology or metaphysics          as
could be built upon these        principles, would be fit to take its            place
at the head of all the natural sciences           ;  for we can thereby attain to
a  criterion of absolute truth, and correct the dimly felt intuitions of
our own consciousness,        by comparing them with the fixed, immuta
ble, and eternal conceptions of the Divine mind, as manifested in
creation.
    The author next       proceeds   to illustrate these views by special ex
amples.      Thus, in psychology,       he shows that         the will is an intui

                                         189
tive exercise of power according          to the law of design.        That plea
sure is felt, and the condition is good, when the                operations of the
forces by which the organism is          built up     as a whole   are in accord
ance    with the    ends   arrived   at, and with      the order fixed for those
ends ;    that, on the contrary,      pain is felt, and the condition         is evil
when disorder arises, and the results            are in disaccordance with the
ends aimed at.         It  is necessary   to bear in mind that the ideas in
cluded     in general terms correlate       each other     in psychology as well
as  in physics.      Thus Order, regard being had to its results, is logi
cally correlative with Good; for good in creation is the result of order,
and of order alone.          Order, again, is as general a law as design ;
consequently the deviations from the primary law of design, known
as  evils, are correlative with, and derivative from the primary law of
order,   just   as the physical    and vital forces are derivative from the
primary forces.         Again, perfection correlates the law of order and
the   law of unity ; for, admitting that there are degrees of perfec
tion, the highest perfection is attained when, with the greatest mul
tiplicity or differentiation     of parts, there     is the most complete unity,
or adaptation      of those parts to each other as ends and         means.      This
is the   perfection of society as well as of organisms.
    In biology, the author shows that the laws of unity of type and
permanence       of species are compatible with an empirical law           of life —
the law     of incessant change. The adaptation of an organism to the
external world is instinct ; but since the operations of the forces of
the external      world which    maintain     life, as heat, light, and the like,
are constantly      varying,   so, according     to the teleological     law, must
the phenomena        of life and instinct      be constantly    varying.     Ilencp,
correlative with       the fixed and immutable law of design, as mani
fested in    unity of type, and derivative          therefrom, is the law of in
cessant change;        and this is a primary law of creation as well as of
life.    For, just   as the motion of a planetary         body round a centre or
centres    is due to incessant variations (as marked by every point in
the described curve), caused in the line of direction by a deflecting
force, so    all the variations     in organisms, whether animal or vege
table, from      the first, or correlative law of design, as manifested in
unity of type, are results of deflecting forces, i.e., of external condi
tions, influencing organisms to change from the type in time and space.
In this way, unity of type and permanence of               species are correlative
 with incessant variations in the transmissions of the characters and

instincts of the species,   whether they be simply morbid, and known
as hereditariness,  or appear to give rise to new species.
   The author finally    shows,   that as unity of structure implies unity
of function,  we have in these principles       the foundation for an inves
tigation  of what has hitherto        been  considered wholly inscrutable,
namely, the relations of the organization to the consciousness           ; or, in
other words, the connection of body and mind.            Mind is not merely
inseparably associated with the primary forces of matter ; it acts in
and by them.       Their phenomena are its signs. Hence, since the
order of these    phenomena and the action of the forces can be ex
pressed   numerically,   it follows that the results or ends arrived           at
can be expressed numerically        ;  or, in other words, the teleological
laws   can be   reduced to numerical formula.           This  can be done al
ready as to nutrition and development, and the forms of vegetables
and animals ; but since all the successional states of our conscious
ness correspond    to  successional vital    states, occurring     according    to
the teleological law of the physical and vital        forces,  it is clear that
the signs which express the law of succession of the one series, might
be made to correspond to the laws of succession of the other.                  In
this way, the brain may be looked upon as the instrument               whereby
the mind is brought into immediate        relation, — not  with matter alone,
— but   with  the forces of matter     ; and our intuitive cognitions       may
be considered as direct and immediate          cognitions of the teleological
operations of those forces in our organization.

                      Portobello.      By Dr Allman.
   Professor Allman called       attention   to some bones discovered         by
Dr Andrew Balfour in        a clay field   near Portobello,    and forwarded
by him for presentation to the Museum of Natural History.                  They
prove to be bones of a seal, and consist        of some vertebrae,    a portion
of a scapula, a radius,    a femur, and a fibula.       They thus afford an
additional instance to the few already recorded, of the occurrence of
phocine remains in the British Islands.           The deposit in which they
occurred appears to belong to the period of the boulder clay.              They
were found about 20 feet above the present level of highwater, and
about 15 feet below the surface of the soil.

  3.   On the Composition of Old Scotch Glass.                  By Mr Thomas
      Bloxam, Assistant Chemist to the Industrial Museum.
      Communicated,          with   a   Preliminary       Note, by      Professor
      George Wilson.
      We have recently been engaged in the laboratory of the Indus
 trial Museum in executing some analyses of glass, which, as of gene
 ral interest,    I  lay before the Society.       The analyses in question    have
 been made by         Mr  Bloxam,    the official   laboratory-assistant,    and it
 is desirable first to mention with what object they were undertaken.
 I   have limited the investigation in the first place to common bottle
 glass and window glass in use in Scotland, and so far as could be
 ascertained, also manufactured           in Scotland.     As yet we have only
 overtaken six varieties, and the full import of their analyses will
 not appear till additional examples have been examined.                   The fol
 lowing statement aims at nothing more than the establishment of
 certain data in the glass-manufacture           : —
     In  the case of window-glass,       I was   anxious    to obtain a specimen
 manufactured        before the introduction of the process         now so largely
 followed for the conversion       of common salt into soda-ash, the form
 of alkali now used by the maker of window-glass.                     Through the
 assistance of my friend,        Mr James Young,         I  obtained such a spe
 cimen.      It  constituted part of a window-pane,          known to have been
 procured from the Dumbartonshire             Glass-Works, and originally em
 ployed    in glazing     a house   in Russell Street, Glasgow, built some
 forty years     ago.
     Mr John Young,         who died last December, aged          eighty-five,   re
 membered       the building of the house, and knew the source of the
 glass.    He superintended        the   cutting out of the glass, which        was
 taken from an upper pane, as less likely than a lower one to have
 been introduced to replace a broken sheet of earlier date.              He could
 also testify that the putty was that originally employed in fixing the
 pane.
     From the analysis it will be seen, that unlike our later window-
glass, it contains potash as well as soda.               In all probability the
alkali   used in its manufacture        was   kelp, which contains both alka
lies, and was the chief source of soda to the Scotch glass-maker and
soap-maker,       till the salt process   was   established.     The glass   is in

                                                           192
ferior in the important quality of colourlessness to the window-glass
now manufactured,                   a defect       not explicable          by a reference to the
presence         of potash, which has a less colouring influence on glass than
soda.       The green tint             so   manifest is sufficiently explained,                   however
by the large amount of oxide of iron discovered on analysis.                                              Of
dark       bottle-glass,         specimens abundantly                    authentic         were obtained
from the relics of                Dr Joseph Black's apparatus.                         They were       pro
bably made at Leith,                   where ordinary bottles have                         been   manufac
tured for a long period from clay, sand,                               salt, and other cheap ma
terialsof the neighbourhood.    Newcastle, however, has long di
rected much of the bottle-making to herself, and still more recently
Belgium         injuring the trade at Newcastle.
                 is                                                           In contrast with           this
I   have    obtained examples of Chance's glass,                          made by simply           melting
ragstone or basalt, the revival of an old French                                 mode       of glass-mak
ing, extended by the English manufacturer to the production of
glass tiles, vases, and large slabs. Could our native trap-rocks be
at once melted into available glass, it would be an important                                        addi
tion to     the industrial manufactures                          of the country        ;    but the relin
quishment at Birmingham of the basalt process, as unremunerative
and impracticable,               is not encouraging.
  The window-glass from Dunfermline Abbey was given by Dr John
A. Smith, a zealous member of the Society of Antiquaries. Dr
Smith writes in reference to it— " It was picked up by Bailie Mit
chell of Dunfermline,                   in November               1818,    when various diggings
were made above the ruins of the old Abbey,                                 preparatory to the re
building of the church, and it was said to have been found closely
adjoining the site of the great east window of the Abbey.

    The exact              age of the glass is thus unknown, and the place of its
manufacture quite uncertain.                        It     is,   however, certainly old and his
torically interesting.
    Regarding the Abbey,                    Mr John Stuart,              Secretary of the Society
of Antiquaries, furnishes the following information                                :   —

        Queen Margaret founded                    a
after her marriage                in 1070.            It   was        probably     of temporary          de
scription    ;        and   a   church      completed            by   David   I.   was       dedicated    in
1150."

                                          193
 church is spoken of, which seems to have consisted in an enlarge
 ment   of the choir of the previous church, so that the              date of foun

    The glass from Dunfermline Cathedral                 was given me by the sex
 ton, as having     fallen from the windows, and had been                long in his
 possession. — G. W.
    The specimens of glass submitted to                 investigation   were  six in
 number,     namely,     four    window-glasses,       one bottle-glass,    and one
 basalt-glass.
       1.   Window-glass       from Dumbartonshire.
       2. Fragments        from a window in Dunfermline Abbey.
       3 and 4. Fragments           of window-glass from Dunblane Cathedral.
       5.  A   bottle from the laboratory          of Dr Joseph Black.
       6.  Basalt-glass,     manufactured       by the Messrs Chance and Co.
    Where the quantity of material was sufficient, the following points
were determined       with each specimen.
                         1° Specific gravity.
                        2°   Solubility in water.
                         3°   Solubility in alkalies.
                        4° Solubility in acids.
                         5° Quantitative      composition.
   The method of examination             was that employed        by most chemists
for the analysis     of silicates, namely, fusing the substance with car
bonate    of potash and       soda, dissolving      the fused mass     in acid, and
estimating the substances          in solution.     The solvent action of water,
acids, and alkalies was ascertained            by subjecting     the specimen, in
fine powder, to each        of  these menstrua,      for  some days, and    in most
cases analysing the liquid containing              the soluble part of the glass.
The specific gravity was determined              in the usual manner practised
in the laboratory,      a mean number being deduced             from the results of
three experiments.
   Dumbartonshire         window glass had a specific gravity of 2'55.
   Water dissolved substances from it                to  the amount of '14 of a
grain per cent., consisting mainly of silica, together with lime, iron,
alumina, magnesia, and soda in smaller quantities.
   Potash dissolved the glass to the extent of -76 of a grain per cent.
   The quantitative composition of Dumbartonshire glass is the fol-

   The specimen of Dumfermline Abbey glass                was too small to allow
of any characters beyond the specific gravity             and chemical composi

  The third and fourth               specimens examined were from Dunblane
cathedral windows.
  They were of a blue colour, the first being the darker in tint,                     and
were too small to admit of complete examination.

    The last sample     made    the subject of analysis was the so called
basalt glass of Messrs Chance and Co.
    It is produced by the mere fusion of basalt, is very hard, and of a
 black colour.
    The specific gravity was ascertained to be 2'709.
    Water dissolved -34 of a grain per cent., consisting of silica, pro
 toxide iron, lime, and magnesia.
    Hydrochloric acid dissolved       3-4 per cent., and potash 1-44 per

                     the Eye.          Part       II.    By Professor Swan.
     The author, in               a paper communicated                  to the      Royal       Society of
Edinburgh          in 1849,* described a method of observation by which                                      he
had succeeded             in measuring            the brightness of visual impressions                       of
short duration.                This consisted            in causing a disc, with               a sector of
a known angle cut in                  it,   to revolve with         a   known uniform               velocity
between      the eye and           a   luminous object.              At   each revolution of the
disc   a   flash     is   seen.    The time during which the light                        has acted          on
the eye     is   easily        computed from the angle of the sector                          and velocity
of the disc      ;   and the brightness of the flash                    is    ascertained        by   photo
metric arrangements.                    By this method the brightness                          of   impres
sions formed on the eye                     by   light acting for short intervals                   of   time
varying from    to -001 of-1   second was ascertained with
                                                  a                                                   results
which have been described in the paper already referred to.

     It    seemed     desirable       to    extend      the observations        to impressions
formed on the eye in intervals of time still shorter than '001 of a
second ; and        it may     seem that         this could    be accomplished, either by
diminishing      the angle of the sector, or by increasing                          the    diameter
or velocity                            There are obviously, however,
                of rotation of the disc.
limits to the narrowness of the sector, and to the diameter of such
discs as can be used conveniently ; and the                         velocity with         which the
disc may be driven is also                 limited, for when the number of revolu
tions exceeds       about ten in a second, the successive impressions, which
it is proposed to observe separately,                      become      blended into a single
nearly uniform impression, owing to their persistence on the retina.
The instrument          now described to the Society is devised for the pur
pose      of separating       a single impression out               of the multitude         of im
pressions      made by a rapidly revolving                   disc, so as to render it pos
sible to observe        the brightness of isolated visual impressions formed
by   light acting       on the eye for extremely short intervals                     of time.
     The instrument          consists of a train of wheels and pinions by which
a disc       having     a    sector cut in it is             driven     with    great      velocity.
The numbers            of teeth in the            wheels     and    pinions are so arranged
that each wheel, as well as the disc,                      makes      ten revolutions        for one
revolution of the wheel by which it is driven.                          Each of the two last
wheels      of the train, which            are   of solid metal,      has a hole pierced in         it,
through which light transmitted                      by   the sector can pass to the eye            ;
and the wheels are so placed that at each hundredth revolution                                of   the
sector, and only then, the sector in                    the disc       and the holes in the
wheels       come into the same straight line, so that the eye of the ob
server receives        a    single flash transmitted           through      the holes in the
wheels.  The result of this arrangement                       is,
                                            that although the disc be
driven at the rate of   hundred revolutions per second, so that the
                                a
impressions         produced        by the successive              flashes transmitted         by   it
when seen by the             unassisted eye would be blended into an uniform
impression, yet the observer, looking through the holes in the wheels,
receivesonly   single flash of light once
                    a                      second.            a                The brightness
of the observed isolated flashes may be ascertained                            by   photometrical
means,       similar    to    those    employed         by   the author for the same pur
pose in      1849,               fully described.

2. On      the     Destructive      Effects     of the Waves of the Sea               on
    the   North-East Shores of Shetland.                       By Thomas       Steven
    son, C.E., F.R.S.E.
    The author       stated,   that the present communication             might be    re
garded as supplementary             to the one      describing      the results of his
marine dynamometer, which would be found in the 14th volume of
the "Transactions."              On   the Bound Skerry of Whalsey, which is
only exposed to the waves of the North Sea or German Ocean, he
had   found, on first landing           in 1852, masses of rock, weighing 9^
tons and under, heaped together by the action of the waves at the
level of no less than 62 feet above                the sea    ;  and others,    ranging
from 6 to 13£ tons, were found to have been quarried out of their po
sitions in situ, at levels of from 70 to 74 feet above the sea.                Another
block of 7T7oth tons, at the level of 20 feet above the sea, had been
quarried out and transported to a distance of 73 feet from S.S.E. to
N.N.VV. over opposing abrupt               faces as much as 7 feet in height.
Somewhat similar evidences             of the force of the sea were observed on
the neighbouring         islands, and more recently by            Mr David      Steven
son at    Balta and Lambaness              (in the    most   northern     of the Shet
land Islands), who, in a report                made    at  the time, attributed      the
great force of the waves            in the northern         regions of the German
Ocean    to  their exposure and the proximity of             deep water to the land.
In addition       to these     causes, the author       referred    to the strength    of
the tides, the configuration          of the German Ocean, and to the great
general     depth     of the water, as the probable              causes   why heavier
waves are produced in the latitude of Shetland than are found, for ex
ample, on the coasts          of England or Holland.            The author, after     al
luding to the writings of         Mr Airy      and  Mr    Webster, referred, in par
ticular,   to   this gradually decreasing general depth in passing from
Shetland      to  Holland,     as a main cause      of   the   diminished    magnitude
of the undulations.           That the       waves   are materially      smaller in the
southern than         in the northern latitudes, may be inferred from the
low, yet safe,      level at which many of our southern                 sea-port towns
have been        built in reference       to that    of high water.        The author
considered that another proof that this reduction                   of the   waves   de
pended on the reduction in the depth of water, might be deduced                    from
the structure of the bottom.              He considered that the           presence    of

                                     201
 mud at any depth might be taken as a certain proof that the agita
 tion, originating at the surface, had ceased to be appreciable.              If
 the geological formation did not produce a clayey deposit, or        if strong
 submarine currents existed, the absence of mud might afford no proof
 of the magnitude of the waves    ;  but its presence     in shoal water may
 be relied on as indicating  with certainty that in whatever locality it
 is found there must be small disturbance at the surface, or, in other
 words,   that there cannot   be a heavy       sea.    Applying such     a test
 to the present    case — muddy  deposits are      found in from 80       to 90
 fathoms    off Whalsey, from which point southwards they are found
 in gradually lessening depths,     till they rise to within 8 fathoms of
 the surface at     the mouth of the Elbe.         Similarly, at the Firth of
 Forth, the mud rises     on the north     side from 18 fathoms off Elie
 Ness to 7 at Burntisland; and on the south side, from 17 fathoms,
 near North Berwick, to 2 fathoms off Leith ; while above Queens-
ferry, even although the current is stronger in the higher            portions
of the estuary, the mud, owing to the comparative absence of waves,
actually   emerges above low water.       It  is well known,      that on the
banks   of Newfoundland, and all round the British islands, where the
bottom suddenly rises near the 100 fathoms           line, the waves actually
break.     It  seems reasonable, therefore, to infer, that the gradually
decreasing    depth of the German Ocean must as effectually, though
not so  suddenly, diminish the size of the undulations.
3.   Notice of an Unusual Fall of Rain in the Lake District,
    in January 1859. By John Davy, M.D., F.R.SS. Lond. and
    Edin.
   Whilst the average fall of rain during the preceding six years in
January has been at Ambleside 4-22 inches ; in this month, in the
current year, the rain measured has amounted to 14-82 inches.
    The quantity of rain that has fallen in other localities of the district
during the same month is stated in a table, in which also is included
the  rain-fall in  some other parts   of the United Kingdom.           In the
former,    it  has ranged from 14 375 to 6-514 inches, diminishing
with distance from the central mountains         ;  in the latter, the range
has been from 6-48 inches to 0-36 inch, diminishing, it would seem,
with distance from the western coasts.

                                          202
    In another table       some other instances        of extraordinary rain-falls
are   given which       occurred in the Lake District at Coniston and
Ambleside,     varying from 12 to 24-39 inches in a month.
    A third   table is appended, showing the quantity of rain monthly
that has fallen at Seathwaite          in Borrowdale        during fourteen years     ;
from which       it appears that the maximum                fall monthly    has  been
32-83 inches. and yearly 160-55 inches.
    In connection with the rain-fall, other meteorological observations
are offered,    illustrative of    the peculiarities      of the   last year and of
the present season; of which, as regards the last, the most remark
able are, a prevalency of westerly winds, exceeding mildness, and a
precocious     spring   ;  vegetation     in   the first week in     March being at
least a month in advance.

     1.   Researches on Radiant Heat.               Part   II.    By Balfour
           Stewart, Esq.        Communicated by the Secretary.
   The first part of this paper describes the following groups of               ex
periments      :—
   I. On      the effect which      roughening     the surface of a body pro
duces upon its radiation.
   II.    On the nature of that heat which           is radiated by rock-salt    at
at 212°     F.
   III.     On the radiation of     glass and mica at high temperatures.
   The second or theoretical          portion of the paper has reference to
the law     which connects the radiation of        a particle with its tempera
ture, and to      Dulong and Petit's experiments          on this  subject.     The
instruments used, and method of using them, were almost the same
as described in the first series of these researches.
   With regard       to the  first group of experiments, it was ascertained
that roughening         surfaces of glass or rock-salt with emery paper
until    they    are dim    for light, neither alters the quantity         nor the
quality of the heat which they radiate         ;  the surface, although dim for
light, being yet specular for heat.
   With regard        to the   second   group of experiments,        it was shown
that heat from rock-salt         at 212°   F. penetrates a     screen   of glass or
mica less     easily than lamp-black heat at 212^ F.
    It   also penetrates a screen of mica split by heat less easily than

                                          204.
the latter description of heat        ;  but the difference of behaviour of the
two kinds of heat with regard to this substance is not so marked as
in the case of ordinary mica.
    So far as tested        by mica, and mica split by heat, it was shown
that,—
             Lamp-black heat of 700° F. bears            to
             Lamp-black         „       212°  F., the same relation     as
             Lamp-black         ,,      212° F. bears to
             Rock-salt           „      212°   F.
that is to say, rock-salt heat possesses            greater   average wave-length
than lamp-black       heat.
   With regard       to the   third group of experiments, it was shown that
glass or mica, by being heated, does not change in any measure its
capacity for transmitting a given description of heat ; for instance,
cold glass transmits heat of 700°            F. just   as well as glass heated to
700°     F.   does.     Proceeding,     then, to    the  theoretical   part of the
paper, it was then shown that, owing to the following facts                : —
    1st,  That the absorptive power of            a  thin plate of any substance
equals its radiative power.
    2d, That (by the third group of experiments) the absorptive
power of cold glass for heat of 700° F., is the same as that of glass
heated to 700°       F.
    3d,   That cold     glass has a greater transmissive, or less absorptive
power for heat of 700°         F., than for heat of 212° F.
we    must conclude that " the radiation of a thin plate of                  glass, or
other substance, at 700°, bears a less proportion to the total radia
tion of 700° F., than its radiation at 212°              does   to the total radia
tion of 212°      F.      It was   also shown that       this difference     is more
marked      for a thin plate than for a thick one           ; and it was argued,
that Dulong and Petit's          law does not express the law of radiation
of  a material      particle, but that this       law, whatever it be, increases
(for all bodies) less rapidly with the temperature                than Dulong and
Petit's law.

2.   Some Observations on the Coagulation               of the Blood.       By
              John Davy, M.D., F.R.S. Lond. and Edin.
   Dr Richardson, in       a recent and elaborate work on the blood, an
extension of a Prize Essay on          the cause of the coagulation of this
fluid, has endeavoured to prove that this phenomenon is of a chemi
cal kind, depending on the escape of the volatile         alkali.
    The author of the paper of tho abovo title describes three sets of
experiments which he has instituted          for the purpose of testing       Dr
Richardson's      hypothesis.     In all  his trials on blood, he has used
that of the common fowl, its properties          being best adapted to the
objects in view.      The results obtained    were  briefly the following   : —
   1.    Ammonia     added to the blood in small quantities did       not pre
vent    its coagulation;    in larger quantities    it retarded coagulation,
and rendered the blood viscid.
   2.    On exposing mixtures of blood and ammonia, and of water and
ammonia, to the open air, the loss of weight sustained in two or three
minutes    — the  time required for the coagulation of the blood — was
hardily appreciable,     using a very delicate balance.
   3.    The moist fibrin of the blood subjected        to the action   of am
monia was found to be rendered          transparent    and viscid ;  but to be
very  slightly soluble.
   These results, and others, such as the coagulation of the blood in
close vessels, and the volatile alkali not having hitherto been de
tected in    healthy blood, have led the author        to the conclusion that
the phenomenon under          consideration still remains an unsolved pro
blem   ;  and that on the ground of mere probabilities        it is not easy to
say which     of the two chief hypotheses advanced concerning it — the
chemical and the vital — is deserving of preference.
3.  On the Recent Vindication of the            Priority of Cavendish         as
     the Discoverer      of the Composition of Water.          By Professor
     George Wilson.
   The object of this communication           was to direct attention to the
recent recovery of two documents establishing          the priority of Caven
dish as the discoverer of the composition of water.         Their importance
   vol. iv.                                                        2 D

 was   indicated by the late         Mr Robert      Brown,     the botanist, and his
literary executor,         Mr   J. J.  Bennett    of the British Museum, has
 brought them before tho Royal Society of London.                     They are both,
 contrary to general expectation, published statements contained in
 well-known works.            The first is a section of De Luc's " Idees sur
la Méteorologie,"         entitled,  " Anecdotes relatives a la decouverte de
l'Eau    sous la forme      d'Air," in which the following            decisive decla
 ration occurs     : —
    " Vers      la fin de Y annee         1782,    J'allai a Birmingham           ou   le
Dr Priestley         s'etoit etabli depuis      quelques annees.         II  me com-
muniqua        alors, que     M. Cavendish,       d'apres une remarque          de   M.
Warltire     ;  qui avoit     toujours    trouve   de I'eau     dans   les vases   oil il
avoit brule       un melange       d'air inflammable      et  d'air atmospherique         ;
s'etoit applique        a decouvrir     la source de cette       eau,   et qu'il avoit
trouve,    '
             qu'un     melange    d'air inflammable       et   d'air dephlogistiqui
en proportion         convenable, etant allume par l'etincelle electrique,             se
convertissoit tout entier en eau.'            Je fus frappe, en plus haut degre,
de cette découverte."           (Idies, &c., tome ii., 1787,        pp-   206-7.)
   The important           testimony thus borne        to Cavendish's      experiment
having had as its object the discovery of the source of the water
which appeared         when hydrogen        and oxygen       are  burned     together    ;
as its phenomenal result that in certain              proportions     a given weight
of the gases in question could be burned into the same weight
of water ; and as its logical induction that the gazes had been con
verted into the water, constituted Cavendish a discoverer of the com
position of water.           And    as   this conclusion      was  drawn     in 1782,
whilst Watt, the earliest counter-claimant              of the discovery,      did not
draw his similar conclusion            till 1783, the priority unquestionably
belonged to Cavendish, who was thus the discoverer of the composite-
ness of water.
    Reference was then made to the effort of               Mr Muirhead       to under
value De Luc's testimony, on the plea that in another part of the
" Idees" its author declared himself to               have been ignorant of Ca
vendish's conclusions till 1783, and not               to have learned       them   till
after he was familiar with those of Watt.                It  was contended, on the
other hand, that De Luc's two statements                  were    not contradictory,
but perfectly reconcileable with each other, — the one referring                to Ca
vendish's interpretation          of his experiments on firing          hydrogen   and
oxygen, which De Luc learned from Priestley in 1782                     ; the other to

                                                 207
Cavendish's full theory of the formation of water, which was not made
public till January 1784, and which it could be shown by the Watt
Correspondence De Luc did not become acquainted with till March
of that year.
      Special attention was drawn to the fact, that the section of De
Luc's       " Idees"        from    which the quotation was taken went over the
same ground as the Watt Correspondence.                                This section contained
the matured and authoritative                   publication       of those views       on the rela
tive merits of Watt and Cavendish which are referred to by De Luc
in    the hasty private              letters   printed       in the     "
                                                                             Correspondence"              Lin
question, written when he was imperfectly informed on the points he
was discussing, and not intended for publication. The author dwelt
upon the omission of                Mr Muirhead,         when editing the Watt Corres
pondence,        to point          out this important fact to his readers, and the
misleading effect of this omission in representing De Luc                                   as     much
more the advocate of Watt's claims than in reality he                                       was.      In
many            the " Idees" supplemented tho Watt
            respects                                                               Correspondence
so far as       the views of De Luc were concerned, and the latter work
could not be understood unless read in the light of the former.
      The    second     of the recovered documents                     was an extract from             a
Report to the French Academy,                     on   M. Seguin's experiments                   on the
Combustion    of Hydrogen and Oxygen, dated 28th>August 1790,
written by La Place, in name of Commission consisting, besides the

reporter, of Lavoisier, Brisson, and Meusnier, all of whom sign it.
The passage of most importance, as showing that Lavoisier aban
doned in favour of Cavendish the claim he at one time preferred to
be the discoverer of the composition of water, as follows —             is                 :
      " M. Macquer          a   observe dans son Dictionnaire de Chimie que la
combustion des gaz hydrogene et oxygene produit une quantite d'eau
sensible    ;   mais   il    n'a pas connu toute l'importance                       de cette obser
vation, qu'il          se    contenta de presenter,              sans    en      tirer aucune       con

     In  conclusion, the author dwelt upon the brightened moral aspect
 of  the water controversy.       From De Luc's        " Idees" all trace of charge
 against     the fair-dealing of Cavendish           has vanished.        Lavoisier is
 found making full,       if somewhat tardy, amends for any wrong he did
 the English philosopher,        and as De Luc and Lavoisier testify that
 Cavendish had reached his famous discovery in 1782, the most un
charitable must cease suspecting that he borrowed                   or stole it from
Watt, who had it not to offer any          one    till  17 83.
4. On the Preservation             of Foot-prints on the Sea Shore.                By
                             Alexander Bryson, Esq.
    The author remarked, that the impressions of the feet of birds and
molluscs on wet sand, were liable to be effaced by the return of the
tide  ;  and that their preservation was owing to dry sand blown into
the depressions from the shore, and                again covered by a layer of
 moist sand or mud by the return of the tide.                   In  regard to tracks
left by gasteropodous         molluscs,   he    stated    that great caution       was
necessary to distinguish        them from those left by Nereids             ; and in
stanced the case of a foot-track of a common whelk resembling the
marks made by the Crossopodia on               the Silurian slates.        When the
track of the whelk is filled          up by the dry sand blown into the de
pression in the line of progress, no difficulty is felt in recognising it
as the track      of  a gasteropod ; but      should      the wind    blow at right
angles to the track of the mollusc, a series of setae-like                  markings
will  be observed to leeward, caused          by the dry sand adhering to the
moist.      In   this  instance, a geologist       would      naturally assign the
markings       to the impression       of Graptolites priodon,         or sagittatus  :
and   if the wind suddenly shifted to the opposite direction,                 another
series   of   setae would    be found on     the other       side of the mollusc's
track, and the observer would at once pronounce the marks due to a
gigantic Crossopodia, or fringe-footed Annelide.
    The author also stated, that the so-called                 rain-marks found     on
sandstone and         Silurian    slates  were     formed       by   Crustacea,   and
that the cusps which geologists had supposed were the evidence of
the force and direction         of the wind during the shower, were pro
duced     by the wind blowing        dry sand from the shore, and causing a
raised barrier to leeward of the depression, where there was more
moisture, and consequently more adhesion                of the  sand.

    1.   At the request    of the Council, Lord Neaves, V.P., deli
                vered the following Opening Address : —
      It  has been customary for those who have opened              the   business
  of the Session in the Royal Society, from the seat which              I now    oc
  cupy, to give some notice of those members who may have been
 taken from us by death during the preceding year.                  The rolls of
  the Society   still exhibit many    names   illustrious both in science       and
 in literature, but seldom has a year occurred in which we have                been
 deprived of so great a number of eminent members.               The first   whom
 I  shall mention is Principal Lee      : —
     John Lee, late Principal of the University of Edinburgh,             was   one
 of the   most remarkable     and estimable men of his time.           His   intel
 lectual qualities were of a high order        ;  his attainments     and acqui
 sitions of knowledge were        of the most varied and         extensive    kind.
 On almost all subjects he was admirably          well informed, and in       some
 departments he was unquestionably the most learned man of his                  age
 and country.        He  was   more than all this      :  he was  a most     pious
 Christian minister, and he        was one  of the    most   friendly  and affec
 tionate of men.
     Dr Lee     was    born    at  Torwood-lee-Mains, in the           parish     of
 Stowe, on the 22d of November          1779.      He received his early      edu
cation from the care of his mother, whom he was accustomed                        to
 speak of as a woman of remarkable intellectual powers and                 mental
cultivation,   as well as  of distinguished moral excellence.           The   debt
of gratitude which he owed to his parents must indeed have been
great, if it bore any proportion to the filial reverence and devotion
which he showed them in every form in after life.
     He   was sent, when a boy of ten years old, to Cadon Lee              School,
at Clovenford, then taught by       Mr James Paris,        and in which, during
Dr Lee's attendance, Doctor Leyden            was an assistant.       From     that
school he went to the University of Edinburgh in 1794, being then
in his fifteenth year.       In his opening address to the University, as
Principal, in 1842,      he refers to its state when he became a student,
and recurs with pride and pleasure to the eminent men who then gaTe
and received instruction within its walls.               He continued at the

                                       213
 University for    ten years, having studied both medicine and theology.
 He took the degree of M.D. in 1801, when his Graduation Thesis
 was much admired for its Ciceronian Latinity.             He   was licensed as a
 probationer of the Church in 1804.
    During his attendance at college,      he assisted Professor      Robison in
editing    Dr Black's  " Lectures   on  Chemistry."        In   1802, before his
college career closed, he was offered and he accepted               the chair of
 Moral Philosophy in the University of Wilna, in West Russia, in which
also,  I  believe, two other distinguished      men were invited to become
 Professors   — Thomas    Campbell,     the   author of     " The   Pleasures of
 Hope," and Sir David Brewster, who            has now succeeded       Dr Lee in
the office of Principal in our own University.              It is but  fair to say
 that these invitations were made through the medium of the late
David Earl of Buchan, who, with some peculiarities of character,
was a man of talent and taste, and inspired by a sincere zeal for the
advancement of literature       and science.       Dr Lee prepared himself
 for fulfilling the duties of this appointment by writing out in Latin
a portion of the lectures which he proposed to deliver at Wilna, but
the arrangement was broken off by political events which interfered
with its completion.
    For   some time previous to the end      of 1805, Dr Lee had          been on
intimate terms with     Dr Carlyle, well known          as an eminent clergy
man of the Church of Scotland, and then minister of Inveresk, near
 Edinburgh.      He lived a   good   deal with    Dr Carlyle, both at Inver
esk Manse and in the Doctor's town residence ; and as Dr Carlyle
was then about eighty years       of  age, and    still intimate with     those   of
his own contemporaries,       who were      alive,   such as   John Homo and
Adam Fergusson, who        belonged,   like himself, to a by-gone age, and
who had witnessed many remarkable             events    and social changes,       it
cannot be doubted that        Dr Lee must       have    derived from this ac
quaintance a great deal of traditional knowledge as to the civil and
ecclesiastical history of Scotland in the eighteenth century, and his
natural bias may      have  been   confirmed     towards that historical        re
search, and that interest       in personal character and          anecdote,     by
which he was afterwards distinguished.           Dr Carlyle, at his death in
1805, appointed Dr Lee       one of his trustees, and committed specially
to his care an autobiographical       memoir, which cannot fail to be full
of interest,   and as to which,    I may be permitted to express a hope,
that it   will ere long be communicated to the public.

                                        214
    Among other eminent clergymen who befriended Dr Lee in the
outset of his career, special mention ought also to be made of Dr
Finlayson, of whom he always spoke in terms of the warmest regard,
and to whose      memory he has dedicated       one of the painted windows
now put up in the Old Greyfriars' Church.
    About the    same early period,     Dr Lee came to be for some time
connected with the late       Sir John Lowther Johnstone of Westerhall,
in the capacity of tutor or guardian, and was thus brought into con
tact with several eminent public men, with whom Sir John was on
familiar terms.       I have heard that     Sir John  made    to Dr Lee        two
offers, either  of which,  if  accepted,  would have materially    altered his
future course in life.     One was, to bring him into Parliament                 for
one of    Sir John's burghs     ; the other, to procure him a commission
in the Guards.       These offers,   if made,  were certainly   declined   ;    but
he retained his ward's friendship and respect, and, from his gratitude,
derived, during life, a pension of L.100 a year, which Sir John
settled on him.
    After taking his medical degree, he seems           to  have entertained
some idea of following medicine as a profession         ;  and he has        been
heard to say, that at one time, when          a young  man, he had         three
medical     appointments     in his    possession  or power;      one,   as     as
sistant surgeon to a regiment ; another, as surgeon's mate on board
a ship; and a third, as a surgeon in the East India Company's
Service.     Finally he rejected all thoughts of the medical profession,
and fixed upon the Church as the field to which he should              dedicate
his life.
   In 1807 Dr Lee became minister of a Scotch Chapel in London,
and, in the same year, he was presented to the parish of Peebles.
He continued there till 1812, when          he became   Professor of Church
History in St Mary's College, St Andrews, where he remained till
1821.      A  portion of the lectures he then delivered, embracing             the
History of the Church of Scotland from the Reformation, is                   now
announced for publication,         and cannot fail to excite a lively         and
general interest.
   In 1820, before quitting his chair at St Andrews, he               was ap
pointed Professor of Moral Philosophy in King's College, Aberdeen,
where he lectured for one session, chiefly          by a deputy, to      whom
he transmitted     his lectures daily     by post.   He speedily      resigned
his chair at Aberdeen,      and in 1821 was removed to the charge of

                                       215
the parish    of Canongate, Edinburgh ; and thereafter, he succes
sively held the other charges of Lady Yester's Church, and the
Old Church Parish, in this city.
    In 1824   he was named one of the         Royal Commissioners for visit
ing the Scotch Universities.         In 1827 he became Principal Clerk of
the General     Assembly.       In   1837 he was appointed Principal of
the United College        of  St  Andrews, but did not long retain the
appointment.       In 1838 he was       offered,  but declined,     the  appoint
ment   of Secretary to the Bible Board, then newly constituted.
    In 1840   he was elected Principal, and in 1843 he was appointed
Professor of Divinity, in the University of Edinburgh.                Previously,
during    the session     of 1827-28,      he   had taught    gratuitously      the
Divinity class, and afterwards, during the           session  of 1851—52,        he
taught gratuitously,       again, the     Moral    Philosophy     class,   and    in
1853-54, the Church History           class,  in the College of Edinburgh,
during vacancies in     those chairs occasioned by the death or the illness
of their Professors.
    He held the appointments of Chaplain to the Queen, of Dean of
the Chapel Royal, of Chaplain to the Royal Academy,                   and to the
Convention     of Royal Boroughs, and he         was at his death one       of the
Vice-Presidents of this Society.
    I have ventured to say that he was one of the most learned men
of his time, and in      some   departments of National and Church            His
 tory, particularly in all that concerns the civil and ecclesiastical
 affairs, as well as the manners and habits of the people of Scot
 land, during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, his knowledge
 was most minute and accurate.              He was also at home in the cog
 nate subject of the History of the Puritans during the same period.
 We have lately witnessed in this city the exposure to sale of a por
 tion of his library, consisting of upwards of 20,000 volumes, some
 of them of the most rare         and    curious description    ;  and   I  believe
 that there was not one of his books with which he was not familiar,
 and of which     he did not know, as well as          it could   be known,      the
 authorship,   the occasion, the object,       and the import.        The subject
 of Bibliography had been from his early years a favourite study ;
 and his habits of assiduity and perseverance, as well as his capacious
 and retentive    memory,      enabled him to prosecute it with singular
 success.    Nor    was   his intellectual    power overlaid or paralysed by
 the immense     mass    of his acquired knowledge.          His opinions on all

                                         210
  subjects, and particularly on those         to which     he had directed      his
  special attention, were clear and comprehensive;           while, at the    same
  time, they were marked        by that candour and moderation, which              I
  believe to be universally       produced by the thorough         and    accurate
  study of any branch of knowledge or portion of history.
     As in the case of many men of learning and talent, his             published
  works are but an imperfect indication of his actual powers.           Principal
  Lee, however, has left some things behind him, such as the "Memorial
 for the Bible Societies," and the "Pastoral Addresses"             composed     by
 him for the General Assembly, which show at once the force of his              un
 derstanding,     the variety and accuracy of his information,          the recti
  tude of his feelings, and the purity of his taste.        His stores of   learn
  ing also were always at the service of those who wished to make               use
 of them, and his ready aid has            been   repeatedly acknowledged as
  having given additional value to some of the most important works
  of   our  time    on ecclesiastical    or antiquarian     subjects.    I  would
  fain   hope that, among his numerous            papers,    much may yet        be
 found that deserves     and demands publication.
     Dr Lee's health had never       been robust, and was probably injured
 in early life by habits of abstinence and excessive study.                 But it
 was wonderful      with what energy and vigour        he discharged his duties
 and followed out his favourite pursuits.          He died    on 2d   May   1859,
 in the 80th year of his         age,   and in circumstances which had            a
 melancholy connection with the death of a dear son just returning
 from India.
     No man could       be  more universally regretted ; he had not an
 enemy     or an ill-wisher in the world.        The numerous appointments
 which he successively and simultaneously held are a proof of the
esteem and respect with which be was regarded by all ; but those
only    who knew him well        can speak to his amiable disposition,           to
his cheerful and genial        habits,   and to the charity      and Christian
kindness which       he extended     to  all  men     of worth   and merit, of
whatever      opinions  or   whatever persuasion.          An account of Dr
Lee,    indeed,    would be very inadequate         if it did not   prominently
bring forward what       I have thus alluded      to — his highly  amiable and
affectionate character.       In early life     he    earned on   all  sides the
love as well as the respect      of those   who knew him.        In   his minis
terial charge at Peebles, he was long remembered for his quiet and
unostentatious, but most faithful discharge of his pastoral duties,

                                                 217
for his ready and hearty sympathy                      with all who       needed     it,   for his
consolatory        tenderness to the sick, and his great
                                                     liberality to the
poor.  Nor were these qualities   of the  heart extinguished or im
paired       by
         the long life of labour and study which he afterwards led;
on the contrary,           they continued to the end.             He      was ever ready to
relax into a playful               cheerfulness and pleasantry in society                 ;   while
his attention to such of his friends                   as from sorrow or suffering had
more serious claims upon him was unremitting                        and invaluable.
     In consequence, perhaps, of                some defect of manner,          Dr Lee             was
not sought after as an attractive             But his sermons were
                                                   preacher.
excellent, both in matter and in style, and some of his earlier ones,
when read in manuscript, had reached and obtained the approbation
of   Royalty itself.            In   other respects he was all that            a   minister         of
the gospel        ought to be.          Orthodox in doctrine, evangelical in senti
ment, and         blameless in conduct, he had a frankness                     and freedom
from professional             pedantry or clerical          rigour which      are rarely met
with    in   men of his learning and condition.                  We shall not         soon         see
his like again,          if   we ever do so in our day.           Piety, zeal, eloquence,
and assiduity        will not        be wanting to the       Church   ;   but the combina
tion    of these with the learning, the wide range of information                                  and
sympathy, and the knowledge of the world which he possessed, will
not    readily     be found again.
     The next name         I       have to record among           those who have been
taken    from      us,   is   that of William Pulteney Alison, who was also, at
his death,        a Vice-President of the Society.                    Dr Alison           was      the
eldest son of       a    most amiable and excellent man, the Rev.                    Archibald
Alison,      long    an Episcopal           minister in this city, well known for his
elegant      published         sermons, and for his Essay on Taste, in which he
explained with much success his views of the influence of association
in    producing      or heightening             the sense    of beauty,    a   theory which,
within       moderate limits,          is   founded on truth, but which               has been
brought       into discredit          by the extravagant          length to which             it   was
unfortunately            carried     in Lord Jeffrey's        dissertations    on    the same
subject.
     Dr Alison in early life had the advantage of the                              best    society
which Edinburgh could                   boast    of, and of which         his father          was    a
cherished and distinguished                  ornament.        His education        and connec
tions led him to bestow much attention upon the subject of mental

                                                218
philosophy,         which      he cultivated     with great success.                  Bnt     he ulti
mately adopted medicine as his profession, to which he was probably
drawn by the example and influence of his distinguished relative the
late      Dr James Gregory,           and in which he was destined to find                              an
appropriate career for his talents, acquirements, and virtues.
     It    would be idle in me to detail or dilate upon the particulars                                     of
his professional           life, which was in all respects              eminently successful,
and in the course of which he came to hold a high place both                                          as a
teacher of medical science and as a practising physician.                                  The    notice
of him which         has lately appeared in the          "    Medical     Journal" is            so full
and complete as to leave              nothing to be desired in this respect                       ;    and
if   I    were    to attempt to abridge         it,
                                                 I      should only weaken its                   effect,
and probably fall into errors from which no unprofessional                                  man can
easily keep        free.     Neither can       it     be necessary to inform                  any      one
here present of the valuable contributions                     which     Dr Alison            made       to
the       theory    of medicine, or of the great skill, the                           indefatigable
patience, and the unfailing benevolence                      by   which, as      a    physician,        he
was       uniformly     distinguished.         His published works are                     generally
regarded as entitling him to             a    high place as an expounder                         of    the
philosophy of medicine,             and his powers                as an oral          teacher         were
peculiarly efficient, and exercised              a    marked influence on the progress
of medical science. The time, the strength, and the resources
which he bestowed upon the sick poor were almost incredible, and
such as no one could have given who to vigour of bodily frame                                         had
not added the impulse of the warmest benevolence and the highest
principle.         As   a   practical philanthropist,             his name deserves to                  be
placed not far behind that of Howard himself.
     It    would      be   a   serious   omission        in       any   notice        of    this       ex
cellent man        if   his views and exertions, with reference to the Poor
Laws of          the country, were not in some degree commemorated.                                   Two
theories         upon that      subject, diametrically             opposed       to    each      other,
were at one time advocated               by   two distinguished           men in Scotland —
Dr Chalmers and Dr Alison.                     Chalmers,          misled, I       think,         by    the
enthusiasm of his own genius, and overlooking the peculiar powers
which he himself possessed, conceived the romantic idea, that                                 a    com
pulsory or legal provision for the poor might be altogether dispensed
with.       He maintained, that          even the great towns,              if   they were duly
subdivided and furnished with             a     certain amount of religious machi
nery and superintendence, might be so purified and elevated                                      in    the

                                            219
scale    of moral and physical wellbeing, that any pauperism which
they might still produce could easily be relieved by the voluntary
bounty of Christian benevolence.                  For this purpose he made the
rather startling demand, that at least twenty new parishes and
churches should be established in Glasgow.                 He was gratified to the
extent of having one new church erected and assigned to him for
the   trial of his great experiment          ;  and it is possible that by his own
unwearied        diligence   and    unrivalled influence, together          with     the
auxiliary exertions of another most remarkable man, Edward Irving,
who was given him as his assistant, the pauperism of his district may
have been kept within manageable bounds, and sufficiently relieved by
the spontaneous offerings of the wealthier parishioners.                  But it    was
obviously impossible that any such system could be established over
the whole country         ; and even     if such machinery      had been provided,
nothing short of        a miracle could have supplied           men   like Chalmers
and     Irving     in every district to carry out the plan.            At   the com
mencement of the attempt, doubts were                 raised by judicious thinkers
as to its probable success        ;  and subsequent reflection and experience
soon converted those doubts into certainties, and produced a general
conviction      that the scheme was Utopian.
    The views of Dr Alison              on   this important    subject were essen
tially    different.     Indulging in        no   chimerical   anticipations,    better
suited     to a prophetical      millennium        than to the everyday        state    of
actual     things,    he looked earnestly to the evils that           were    immedi
ately operating or impending,               and sought anxiously to remedy or
avert them.          He maintained that a compulsory contribution for the
poor     was    indispensable.       It   was    the only   way of interesting        the
selfish     portion of the rich in the welfare of their poorer brethren,
by inducing        them to take measures for diminishing pauperism,                     so
as to save themselves from taxation.                  He contended that the relief
of destitution could not         be safely left to the precarious         care of vo
luntary charity, but should at all hazards                 be provided    for  so as to
 keep up the general tone of society, and                 save  it from moral and
 physical     evils of the first magnitude.             Destitution,   he conceived,
 when without regular          relief, tended to lower the standard of sub
 sistence among the poor to an alarming degree, and to make them
 forget that there was any better state of things which it was worth
 their while      as  Christians, or as human beings, to aspire to.              Desti
 tution, he further asserted, and his assertion seemed to be proved by
     vol. iv.                                                              2 o

                                        220
 his medical experience, was one of the most fertile sources of disease,
  and particularly     of disease   of an epidemic character.         It  was at
  once,  particularly in great towns, a predisposing cause to every form
 of pestilence ; and by depressing vitality, it interposed the greatest
 obstacles   to a cure.    He thus endeavoured to demonstrate that the
 administration of adequate      relief to paupers was indispensable      for the
 public good, and a necessary measure         of sanitary precaution.
     These principles     were, over a series of years, reiterated by          Dr
  Alison, and pressed upon the public attention with all the fervour
 of deep conviction and ardent benevolence; and they 'were seconded
  within our own locality by the occurrence of alarming epidemics,
 which    could not fail to rivet the public attention on the subject.
  If  it is not presumptuous to say so, we            seem    to have reason to
  infer that the infectious nature of certain          diseases  is designed by
  Providence    to quicken    our interest in our fellow-creatures,       and to
 remind     us that  our own welfare depends, in a great degree, on the
 health    and happiness      of our neighbours.       As    a conflagration    in
 an adjoining     house makes us tremble         for our own safety, so the
 prevalence of fever or pestilence in the poorer classes             of our own
 city excites in us the fearful anticipation      that the mischief may soon
 extend to us or to our children.         It was the object of     Dr Alison to
 prove (and     I  think he succeeded in proving), that if we wish to
 avert epidemic and infectious diseases from our own doors, we must
 attend to the      physical   as well   as  moral condition     of our fellow-
 citizens, and must establish a certain and sufficient provision for the
 poor.
     The theoretical opinions of Dr Alison would probably have           led him
 to exact a legal provision even for the able-bodied poor, but            subject
 always to the condition that no one should receive            support who was
 not ready to work.        The practical question, however, scarcely          ex
 tended to this point ; and the result of the discussion finally was,
 that the views of Dr Alison obtained a triumph over those of an
opposite tendency.        The Poor Law Act of 1845             was passed;   and
a system     of Poor Law relief      was  thereby established, which,     I ven
ture to say, deserves     the highest commendation, and is fraught with
signal    benefits to the social      condition   of Scotland.      The   Scotch
Poor Laws had always recognised a legal right to relief in the
impotent poor; but, in practice, the frugality or parsimony of the
national character had led to great abuses, by restricting           the allow-

                                          221
ances made to paupers to such            miserable      pittances as were scarcely
sufficient to sustain life   ; while the courts of law had but an imperfect
jurisdiction to redress the evil.           By the      new law, a remedy is pro
vided in the    Board of Supervision,           which practically         has the power
of seeing that      adequate    allowances         are given       to paupers by the
 local boards.
    The Scotch Poor Laws had denied relief to the able-bodied poor                         ;
and it cannot be doubted that this question is                  one   of a most delicate
kind, as the right of the able-bodied poor to demand support might,
if pushed to     an   extreme, lead to little less than a community                       of
goods.     The new Act still disallows              any legal right in the able-
bodied,   but permits parochial boards to give them occasional relief,
as a   precautionary     measure     ;   and    it   is thought       that this     middle
course effects   a prudent compromise            of the dispute.
    The blessings, direct and indirect, which are likely to flow from
this improved system       of the Poor Laws, and from the increased at
tention    thus given    to the condition           of the poor, may, in a great
degree, be ascribed to       Dr Alison's exertions           ;   and his country owes
to  him,  in this way,   a debt   of gratitude which           even now     it  is difficult
to  estimate.     The misery of        the poor was alleviated,           the tendencies
to disease   were diminished, the bonds of society were strengthened,
and   all were taught the important            lesson    that their own safety and
happiness    were indissolubly     linked with those of other men.
    It is curious  to compare the early dawn and promise                       of  Dr Ali
son's life   with the character of its ultimate progress and develop
ment.     The tastes   and pursuits of his accomplished father were chiefly
those that belonged to a man        of elegant and        pious contemplation.          His
own    youthful aspirations are said to have tended towards a military
life. The employments of his maturer years were certainly of a very
different kind, though bearing still a strange moral analogy to these
influences.     He   became    engaged in a warfare, but it was with social
misery and maladministration,            and he carried         it  on  in the pure and
self-denying spirit of that great Exemplar who came into the world
to  heal our diseases    and bear our         infirmities,       and who went about
continually doing good.         In   the words of a distinguished friend, who
knew him and loved him well,
                                         " it is not too much to say, that Scot
land will mourn in him for one of the best of the Christian sons who
have adorned her soil      ;
                             — one who       devoted     himself, body and soul, to
what he believed to be the good of his fellow-creatures,                   with a wisdom

                                          222
  that looked beyond the present, with an energy that cast away                      all
  thought of self, with a Christian love that never failed."
     The latter days of Dr Alison's life were clouded by the              visitation
 of  severe   and distressing disease.         With conscientious    firmness,        be
 resigned his professorial position,        and retired into private life.          To
 the last, however, he enjoyed intervals of serene and useful exemp
 tion from his     sufiorings   ;  and it was only last year that he contri
 buted to the Transactions of this Society an interesting           notice of      his
 cousin, the late     Dr William Gregory.           But the fatal ailment         was
 making     sure progress      in   his system,    and terminated       fatally     on
 23d September 1859, when he had attained his 70th year.
     Another eminent and excellent member of this Society who has
 been taken from us is the late Lord Cathcart, for many years well
 known as Lord Greenock,            his father having survived      till  the year
 1843.      A  great part of       Lord Cathcart's     career belongs to         pro
 fessional or public life, and is fitter for the military or historical           an
nals    of the country      than for the journals of a scientific           society.
His military     services   and    distinctions,  however, are proper here           to
be generally     noticed, as illustrating, and making more conspicuous,
the devotion to science which he eminently showed.
    Lord Cathcart      was  born in the year 1785, and entered the             army
at the age    of fifteen.     His choice of a profession       was the result of
no aversion to classical studies, to which he was           uniformly    attached,
nor of any vulgar ambition for the outward show of the military                  pro
fession, but of a strong sense of public duty, which was indeed                   the
guiding principle of       a long     and useful life.    He    was   for   several
years afterwards       actively    employed in military service,      until, for      a
short time, he was disabled            by the injurious effects   of that     pesti
lence which, in the Walcheren           expedition, cut off so many thousands
of our countrymen.          In    1810, when now a major in the army,              he
embarked for the Peninsula,            anxious to follow   the fortunes of        his
relative,   Sir Thomas       Graham, afterwards        Lord Lynedoch,           then
second    in command in that field.              He distinguished      himself      in
several of the most important           battles and sieges in Spain, until         he
was sent to assist      Lord Lynedoch in Holland,          as the head of the
Quarter-Master-General's            Staff, on which    occasion   the Duke         of
Wellington took leave of him in these words              :—
                                                             " I am     convinced
that Sir Thomas will be as glad to receive your assistance              as we are

                                                   223
sorry to lose        it."        He    was afterwards present at Waterloo,               where he
greatly      distinguished            himself, and where he had three horses                    shot
under him.  For his services during the war he received the Russian
Order of St Waldemir, and the Dutch Order of Willems, and at
home he was made a Companion of the Bath.
     During subsequent years                he was appointed to employments                    of   the
highest importance at home and abroad, and it may be interesting to
mention        that his mind was first turned                        to    the study of Geology
while in the command of the Royal Staff Corps stationed at Hythe,
in Kent.   The corps was a scientific one, and had formed a museum
of the various objects collected by its several detachments ; and in
this way Lord Cathcart was led to take an interest in a subject to
which he ever afterwards devoted much of his attention.                                   In   1830
he came to live in Edinburgh, and for some                                    years was occupied
by scientific pursuits.                 He attended lectures in the University                  ;    he
took an active concern in the proceedings of the Highland Society                                         ;
and of the Royal Society he was an assiduous and useful member,
having read several papers which are published in its Transactions.
In    1841         he discovered a new mineral                 —a     sulphuret of cadmium —
which was found in the course of excavating the Bishopton                                  Tunnel,
near Port Glasgow, and which received after him the name of Green-
ockite.       If his      quick eye had not there detected
                                                                             it,
                                                                             it    would probably
have remained unknown, as                   it     has   not   (I    believe) been discovered
elsewhere.           It    is   a   beautiful     substance,        that was entirely new to
mineralogists.
     In 1837 Lord Cathcart had                      been appointed            to   the command of
the       forces    in Scotland.             In     1842       he    was    made    a Lieu tenant-
General, and in 1845 he                   was sent out as Commander                  of the Forces
in British North America.                       He held this appointment                for several
years in very difficult times, and for some                           period combined with           it
the civil government of Canada.                          In    1849 he returned          home, but
still continued             to   give    the public        the      benefit of his services in
various       capacities.             Latterly,     he   resided          at his seat   in Sussex,
where he passed                 the last years of his life in
                                                     happy retirement,      a
surrounded by     his family, and finding an interesting occupation in
the scientific pursuits which he had always loved so much.
     In    1858 his constitution gave way, and on the 16th                              July    1859
he died peacefully,              in the full      possession        of his faculties to the last.
He was a man of powerful                          mind, which         was improved        by    great

                                         224
 industry and perseverance       ;  and he had a kindly and generous            heart,
 which threw a sunshine around the circle of his domestic life.
    To those who had not the pleasure of his acquaintance, it is                    not
 easy to give a correct impression of what Lord Cathcart was to                     the
 Royal Society, and     the scientific    men of    Edinburgh, from fifteen           to
 twenty-five   years ago.
    Under    an exterior    and with an address which did not adequately
represent the qualities concealed         behind them, he had a warmth                of
heart,   a sterling   modesty, a steadiness of purpose, and a love                    of
science   for its own sake, which are seldom combined in the                     same
person.      He   was   very retiring        in his     habits   and    conversation.
Few could     have imagined that he had gone through                 the amount       of
service detailed in the preceding narrative           ;  and   if it   be considered
how total a revolution of habits and employments was involved in                    the
transition from    his military to his civil        life, it is remarkable        what
success and energy attended his scientific career             during the     years   he
spent among us.        He    was   distinguished     by persevering        and   acute
observation in what regarded geological and               mineralogical     research,
which he carried on in a minute, laborious, and systematic manner.
 He  detected   many interesting        phenomena in the very neighbour
hood of Edinburgh, which           had escaped     those    who had lived        there
always.     His conversation on        these   subjects was pre-eminently           in
structive  ;  and it is believed that he never took an ordinary                   walk
without bringing home some specimen, or at least some remembered
fact, which served him for subsequent meditation.                   He   was fond of
the society of men of science, and his continued interest in the Royal
Society formed an essential element in its prosperity.
    Lord Murray, at     one time a      Vice-President of the Society,          is an
other member whose         loss we have to lament,           in common with all
 who knew him, and in common,              I  may add, with very many           whom
he never knew.       Though not specially         devoted    to science,   he took a
 warm interest    in its progress, and was himself an ardent and                   dis
criminating lover of literature, and an accomplished scholar. His
high social as well as official position — his connection by relation
ship or friendship with many of the foremost men                     and families    in
the country    — his   cordial    hospitality    and polished manners — and,
joined to these, the still higher qualities of large liberality of              senti
 ment, great moral courage, and Christian philanthropy and benefi

                                                     225
cence   —gained         him the love and                    esteem of his friends and          fellow-
citizens, and made               his loss be felt, even at his advanced years, as a
public    bereavement, and as a personal affliction to all who had felt
or witnessed the influence of his character.
     We have     lost in this year the last of a most distinguished
                    also
family of medical teachers, Dr Alexander Monro of Craiglockart,
for many years Professor                        of Anatomy in the University of Edin
burgh.         He   was      in his 86th           year when he died, having been born
on    the 25th of November                      1773.          He     was    the son of Alexander
Monro the       second, who again was the son                         of    a distinguished father    of
the     same    name —all              three      being Professors               in this University.
The late Dr Monro                     was    appointed         assistant and successor          to his
father    in 1798;           and after his father's death, he occupied the chair
with great reputation and                       success     until 1845, when            he resigned   it,
having, during that long period, numbered among his pupils                                       many
who became the most eminent physicians and surgeons of our day
in both        ends     of      the    island.       Dr Monro              was    an active member
of the medical and literary         of Edinburgh and at the time
                                                societies                         ;
of his death he was the Father of the Royal Society. The Papers
which he contributed, as well as his other published works, are
highly creditable to his talent and industry.  His character, in
every way indeed, though latterly less known from his advanced
years and retired mode of life, was deserving of the high respect
which    it    always        received       ;   and he ought especially to be remem
bered as one of those whose cultivated tastes                                in departments beyond
the range of his profession contributed to secure for the society of
Edinburgh the reputation which      has so long maintained, and
                                                          it
which others,    to be hoped, will take care that
                      it   is                      does not now                       it
lose.     Dr Monro's death                  seemed     to sever the last tie which              united
the present generation                 to one long passed away, but ever illustrious
and memorable              as     containing         the founders            of that great medical
school among            us, which           still flourishes in undiminished                splendour,
and which,     I      trust,     is   not soon destined to decay.
     Alexander James Adie, optician in Edinburgh,                                  is   another valued
member         of   the Society             whom      we       have     lost.      He was born at
Edinburgh in 1775                ;    and from the early death of his father, was

                                        226
thrown upon the care of a maternal uncle,            Mr John Miller,      optician
in Edinburgh, a well-informed          and kind-hearted        old man, fond of
books and philosophy,        and a great friend of one to whom Scotland
is under considerable        obligations,    Mr  David     Herd,   a well-known
editor of Scottish ballads.        Under his uncle's instructions,       Mr   Adie
became    an optician, and followed        his profession with great diligence
and assiduity    ;   while, from a sense of his imperfect education in
youth, he was not ashamed as he grew up to attend lectures,                     and
take lessons   at his leisure hours in all branches of science in which
he found   himself deficient.
   His attention      to business, with his    skill  as a mechanic, his quick
inventive    powers, and his sound judgment,           led to his being much
employed     by    all kinds    of   inventors,    to  give    their   schemes      a
practical   form   ;  and  in this way      he acquired     great readiness     and
experience    in the higher parts of his profession.               His attention
was   at the same time directed at an early period to meteorological
observations, with       a view to which, and also with reference to             the
study of astronomy, he erected on his house              in Merchant Court          a
small private observatory, long before any public               establishment      of
the kind existed in Edinburgh.            To his experiments the public           are
indebted for the important invention of the sympiesometer, an                     in
strument of great value at sea, and which may be considered                        as
having contributed        much to the safety of shipping.          Mr Adie     took
great   interest     and  gave   valuable assistance     in the preparation of
apparatus and instruments required by scientific men in the course
of their discoveries.       He assisted Sir James Hall in his experiments
for illustrating geological      formations    under high      pressure, and      his
ingenuity was of great service in the construction of the minute but
powerful lenses      of garnet to which Sir David Brewster             resorted    in
his improvements of the microscope.
    In such operations, in the daily conduct of his business,               and in
the education of his family, he spent the active part of a long                 life.
In   his later   years he was an        assiduous and successful gardener,
and carried on experiments in that art           till a late period.        At   the
ago   of eighty-four he died as quietly as he had lived, respected
and revered by all his family and acquaintance.             I  ought to mention,
 that in his youth he was a keen Volunteer,             and always maintained
 that no invader could ever have got to Edinburgh except over                    the

                                             227
    dead bodies    of the Volunteers.          I have no doubt he would have felt
    an equal    interest, and an equal confidence, in the volunteer move
                                       •
    ment of the present day.
       While these      pages    were in preparation, we were deprived of an
    other eminent      and    valuable      member of the Society        in  Professor
    George    Wilson, who has           been   suddenly carried off in the prime
   of life.
       Dr Wilson      was   born in Edinburgh in the year             1818,   and was
   thus, at his death, in the         41st year of his      age.   His parents     were
   highly    respectable,     though     not in such an elevated        station as to
   diminish the credit due to his own exertions in attaining the position
   which he     ultimately reached       ;  but  it deserves   to be noticed, that he
   may be included in the number              of distinguished   men who have been
   in a great degree       indebted for the development           of their talents to
   the  maternal character and influence.             Dr Wilson's mother,     a lady of
  remarkable      intelligence,    energy, and piety, is still living, to cherish
  the memory        of his   love   to   her, and of his many virtues and high
  reputation.
      He    was educated at the       High School, where       he always maintained
  a good    place in his class.        He entered the University of Edinburgh
  in or about the year          1834, and took his medical          degree   in 1839.
  In   the interval,    his attention      came   to be more specially directed to
 the chemical department            of medical     science, and he was successively
 engaged       as  chemical      assistant    to  Dr Christison    and to Professor
 Graham       of London.
      In 1840 he      began     to lecture in    Edinburgh on chemistry in con
 nection      with the extra Academical Medical School.                  But at this
 time his health received          a severe shock from the effects       of excessive
 exertion during a pedestrian tour, which rendered amputation of the
 foot necessary, and ultimately            led to a delicacy of constitution     which
settled upon       his lungs.
      He continued       to teach as a private lecturer       for upwards of fifteen
years, and during that period               secured the admiration, respect, and
love of     all who   came in contact       with him.      His pursuit of knowledge
was      extensive     and indefatigable, and         his power of exposition was
marked by the greatest clearness and animation, such as never failed
to awaken        in his hearers     the strongest interest in the subject he was
treating.       He all along continued         to cultivate a wide range    of general
     VOL. IV.                                                             2 H

literature, and his elegance of taste and reach of illustration were
of much service in adding to the attraction of his prelections, as well
as  giving   a great charm to his conversation, and to his literary pro
ductions.       His published       works     and    contributions     to periodical
literature     are too well known          to require    detailed   notice.     Those
which related to scientific subjects were distinguished               by a minute
ness   of research      and   a precision     of statement which give         them a
very great value, and which could hardly have been expected in                      one
who was able at the same              time to embellish       them with so      many
beauties derived from          his ample stores of imagination            and fancy.
His " Treatise       on   Colour Blindness      "  is a remarkable example of
the exhaustive        and   practical   manner in which he could treat            such
a subject    ;  and his     Lives of Scientific      Men, while laudably         com
pressed    into     a narrow     compass, as compared          with   most modern
biographies, are pregnant          with    valuable information      and important
results.     He    was in every way admirably          qualified to diffuse among
a wide circle of hearers         and readers a strong interest in science            as
intimately connected with art           and   ordinary life.
    In  the spring of 1855 he was           appointed Director of the Industrial
Museum,       a situation   for which     he was eminently      suited  ;  and in the
autumn of the same year he was appointed to the Chair of Techno
logy, then recently founded in the University of Edinburgh, in                    con
nection with the Museum.            It   is needless   to say in this meeting with
what ability and success he discharged these duties.                  It  was fondly
hoped that in this congenial position, in the midst of friends and fellow-
citizens who loved and appreciated him, and in the bosom of his                    own
affectionate family, his constitution might gain strength, and that                  he
 might live to develop more fully, and perhaps in some new and original
shape, the talents and genius of which he was possessed.                    But   such
 was   not the destiny appointed for him.               He   was   sometimes,     per
haps, too careless of consequences, where the call of supposed duty
 was heard, or where an opening of usefulness was afforded ; and in
 the middle of much          ill  health, and     many warnings       of  danger,    he
 continued to exert himself in a manner that would have been                      more
 appropriate      in one of robuster frame.           But his pleasure lay      in the
 exercise of his intellectual faculties, in the advancement of                science,
 and in availing himself of every opportunity                 to do good or show
 kindness   ;    and   it is probable that the pious resignation                  with
 which he long contemplated his precarious condition,                  and the    state

                                         229
of preparation which he constantly endeavoured to maintain against
the   approach of death, may have                 led him     to fear that event less,
and    to   despise    precautions   for his own safety which               his friends
would     have wished him to adopt.                I need    not say that his talents
and merits,       as a man of science          and literature,      were equalled     by
the amiableness         of his disposition,        and by his moral and religious
excellencies.       He won, and      he preserved, the friendship            of  some  of
the most eminent men of his time             ;   and no one who came within the
sphere    of his influence could resist its attraction.             The honours that
he   attained,     and   the  success    that attended him in           life,  were   not
considered     by others to be more than he well deserved               :  but he him
self was humble        and unassuming ;          thankful for the mercies that he
considered     he had received, and, in the midst of much bodily suffer
ing and distress, not merely patient and submissive, but cheerful and
happy.       His   last illness was only a severer form of many previous
attacks   :  but  he had continued to labour to the            last; and in particular
his duties    at the meeting of the British Association at Aberdeen, in
the   autumn of this year, were discharged by him under great
debility, such as probably tended to unfit him for the severity of the
winter that was at hand.           The    disease of the lungs having assumed
a serious aspect, made         rapid progress, and his death ensued on the
22d of November          1859.      His   end was calm and peaceful, such as
became the       pious, innocent, and       useful life which he had led,            and
left  his friends no cause       to mourn, except for the loss which                they
themselves      sustained.
    The unusual number of deceased                 members in the past year, as
well as the     eminence in their various departments of those whom                     I
have now specially        noticed, must furnish my apology,               first, for the
imperfect nature of the preceding sketches, and, next, for my for
bearing     to attempt     any similar account of the other members of
whom we have been deprived.                Some of these need no eulogy from
any one, while       there are others on whose worth and value it would
                                               ....
have been a pleasing task to expatiate,               if  time and the pressure of
other   claims had permitted         it.       I   must therefore content myself
with the simple enumeration of their names.

 men of the most distinguished        eminence    :—
                           Baron Humboldt.
                           Mr Hallam.
                           Mr Robert Stephenson.
   The Fellows elected during Session 1858-59, are 10 : —
       Dr John Brown.                          Dr Lyon Playfair, C.B.
       Rev. John 1'uns.                        Prof. Richardson, Durham.

       Lieut. John Hills.                       Wm. F. Skene, Esq.
All   of whom have      been cheerfully    welcomed among us      ;  while   some
of them,    I  feel assured, will consent to take an active part in             our
proceedings, and lend their personal influence, as well as their           names,
to maintain the reputation and usefulness of the Society.
    I  now proceed to advert to some of the business proceedings                   of
the Society which        deserve   attention.     During the    past    year     the
Council have awarded two of the medals and prizes with which                  they
are entrusted.
    I.  The medal      and   prize founded by the liberality     of our    vener
able President     Sir Thomas M. Brisbane,           was in the   first  instance
proposed     by the Council to be given for a biographical           notice   of    a
Scotchman eminent in science.           No satisfactory replies having        been
received to the programme of the Council, they were unwilling to
delay much longer the application of the fund destined by the
founder    for the reward of scientific        labour.    They   considered        it
would be creditable        to  the  Society, and     in conformity      with    the
wishes of     Sir Thomas Brisbane,         to take    the opportunity      of   the
Meeting     of the British      Association    in Aberdeen,     to   confer    this

                                     231
honorary distinction    on  Sir Roderick      Murchison    (who was present
at the meeting),     in consideration    of his original, persevering, and
successful exertions    to throw light upon the super-position and real
age    of vast geological formations of extreme antiquity in the
north-western Highlands.        The medal was, by permission of the
British Association, presented to Sir Roderick Murchison by Sir
David Brewster our Senior Vice-President, at one of the evening
meetings at Aberdeen.
   II.   The  Neill   Medal and Prize, founded by our late member
Dr Patrick      Neill, for the encouragement of the natural history
studies in which he took a life-long        interest, has been awarded by
the Council to   Dr Lauder Lindsay, a Scotchman, but not a fellow
of this Society, for a paper on     the  Lichens, showing immense labour
and research. This paper has       been submitted to competent botanists
for their opinion, and the Council have pleasure in stating that it
has received their high approbation.           It will therefore not merely
be rewarded by the     Neill Medal and Prize, but it       is in the course  of
being printed at length in the Transactions,         and of being illustrated
by numerous     plates, beautifully   executed by the well-known        artist,
Mr Tuffen West of London.               The delay which Fellows of the
 Society have experienced in receiving their fasciculus of transactions
arises from the wish of the Council to include in it this important
contribution,   which will very soon be completed.
    A  change in the arrangement of the Society's apartments, which
the Council hope will be universally considered to       be an   improvement,
 has  (after  many delays) been      carried   into effect during the past
 summer.
     While formally entering with the Board of Manufactures into an
 extension of the lease of the Society's present premises, the Council
 very readily agreed to exchange the Old Museum                upstairs for an
 apartment of the very same size on the ground-floor,           immediately to
 the south of the present suite, with which it is made to communicate
 by opening a new door.       The increased convenience of this for our
 conversational   evening   meetings must be plain         to every one, and
 will, we hope, be experienced this evening, when           the  New Museum
 will be opened for the first time.
    It  may be added, that though some outlay has been incurred in con
 nection with this improvement (as well as for the cleaning and decora
tion of the old rooms) no additional rent will be paid by the Society.

                                                 232
   It   may also be mentioned that the Museum has been transferred                                 to
its new place of deposit, under the charge of the Curator,                              with      the
assistance    of     some other members                of the Society, after distributing
among several public bodies                 some isolated specimens formerly con
tained in      it,   which were of little value to us, and which will                        be      of
more use to science when forming                   a     part of other collections.            The
Society's collection          in Geology and Mineralogy has been fully                         pre
served, and      is   very valuable and useful.
   Mr     Swan, who was one of our Secretaries, has, to the regret                           of   the
Council, resigned his office             in   consequence          of being appointed to          the
Chair of Natural Philosophy in St Andrews.                          But the Society     has been
so fortunate as to secure in his place the services of                       Dr Lyon Playfair.
  Mr Carruthers, the Sub-Librarian, having                             removed to London,
Mr John Livingston has been appointed his                                   successor; and        the
Council      have every reason           to hope        that his services will give          satis
faction to the Fellows of the Society.
   Lord Neaves then delivered                     the    Neill Medal, which            had    been
awarded to         Dr Lauder Lindsay, for his Paper on                        the Spermogones
and Pycnides of Lichens.
 The followingCandidate was elected an Ordinary Fellow:—

 1.  Note on      some   Numerical Relations between             the Specific
        Gravities of the Diamond, Graphite, and Charcoal Forms
       of Carbon and its Atomic Weight.              By Dr Lyon Playfair,
       C.B., F.R.S.
    Recent researches have shown that there is an intimate            relation
 between the specific gravities       and atomic weights or equivalents       of
 solid and  liquid  bodies.    This relation  is not so simple as that which
prevails in regard to the volumes and combining           numbers of gaseous
bodies, and yet    it is sufficiently   marked to indicate many important
chemical analogies.       The formula for eliciting    these relations is —
in which    E   is the equivalent,      d the specific gravities, and V tho
atomic volume.
    It is to be  borne in mind, that the unities      or starting-points    for
specific gravities and for atomic weights are essentially distinct.          In
    vol. iv.                                                 2 K

                                            242
 the    first   case,   the  weights of the bodies           are compared with          the
 weight of an equal bulk of water             ;   in the second    instance, the      com
 bining numbers refer to a unit weight of hydrogen.                       Nevertheless,
 the relations observed between the specific gravities and the atomic
 weights are well marked in bodies of a like character.
     It  has always been considered interesting to examine these                      rela
tions in regard to Carbon, which has three well-characterised                         allo-
tropic forms.          The atomic volumes obtained by the               above     formula
show       no   satisfactory relations       between the numbers           obtained     for
each     of  the states in which the element presents itself.
    Before we examine them in another way, it is desirable to                       obtain
a mean       specific gravity for the Diamond,            Graphite, and Charcoal,        as
the recorded results of experiment show a considerable variation.
                                      1. Diamond.
    The     specific   gravity of this gem is generally stated in           elementary
works to range from 3-5 to 3-55                ;  but these numbers do not          repre
sent the mean         of recorded experiments,         as  will  be  seen   by the fol
lowing table       : —

    If we   reject the second Borneo diamond of Rivot, which                     has too
low a specific gravity, we have a mean sp. gr. of 3-48, which                      is the
same number as that found by Wilson Lowry for the mean specific
            of   " his beautiful       collection      of                     diamonds"
gravity                                                      crystallized
(Thomson's Mineralogy, vol. i. p. 46).
    It is to be expected that the experimental                 determination      of the
specific   gravity of diamonds should be rather above than below the
truth   ;  for we are aware that          they all leave         a minute quantity      of
ash on burning,        and   that this ash, according to Petzhold,               contains
silica and iron.
                                    2.  Graphite.
    This variety of carbon         is often       impure, being      not unfrequently
contaminated with upwards             of five per        cent,  of earthy impurities.
Recorded specific gravities upon such impure                    specimens are of no
value for the mean result as regards pure graphite.                      The following
determinations      are all those which         I  can   find upon specimens which
have been chemically examined to establish their purity                    : —

      It   would have been interesting to have added to this list                              a deter
mination of the specific gravity of Brodies' purified Ceylon graphite                                     ;
but its minute division causes the air to adhere to                            it   so tenaciously,
that       I have failed in getting       any correct determinations                  of   its density.
                                          3.   Charcoal.
      There are comparatively             few determinations          of the specific gravity
of pure charcoal.              It is in fact not so    easy to obtain this substance.                 A
specimen of charcoal from pure sugar, repeatedly calcined, and                                  treated
with chlorine to remove the last                    traces of hydrogen, and                again   cal
cined, gave me the sp. gr. 1-80                 ;    but bubbles of air still adhered                 to
it,   although      it   was    kept for several hours under                 a   good      air-pump.
The following determinations are                     those recorded      :—

    These numbers do not bear to each other any simple relation.
    6.   If  we now take the atomic             weight of carbon        (£=12),     and
 then extract      from it its square, cube, and fourth                roots, numbers
 are obtained which bear a         striking approximation        to the mean specific
 gravity of the three forms of carbon: —

In other words, if       we raise the specific          gravity of diamond       to  its
second power, that      of graphite        to its  third power, and that of char
coal to its fourth power, we           obtain numbers closely approaching             in
                                         ...
each case to 12, the atomic weight               of carbon.

    These approximations           are  remarkable, and the relations           of the
numbers are natural           and simple.           The differences between the
mean      experimental    numbers and the corresponding roots of the
atomic     weight of carbon are not so great as the differences observed
in the specific gravities of the same form of carbon.

    These relations appear to be           so  simple, that it is scarcely      possible
to conceive      that they may not have              been described before      ;   but   I
have been unable to find such descriptions.                  The nearest       approach
to    it which    I   know,   is the fact that        Mr Hawksley, the        engineer,
stated     to me,    many years since, that            he  had brought      under      the
attention     of the late Mr Cooper the relation which seemed                     to sub
sist   between the specific gravities of silver and gold and their                 atomic
weights, this being approximative^                the square root of their         atomic
weights, or of multiples of these numbers.                  But    I cannot find      any
record either of       Mr Hawksley's or Mr Cooper's             views on the subject.
     8.  We know two other              bodies    besides   carbon      which     possess
diamond, graphite, and amorphous forms — viz., Silicon and Boron.
If the    same relation were observed          between    the specific gravities      and
atomic weights of these bodies, it would go far to establish                   as a law
what, in an isolated case, might be due to a remarkable combination
of chances.      Unfortunately,     we know only the specific gravity of              the
diamond forms of these elements               :—
    Silicon diamond,                  .            .          2 '49       Deville.
            Do.,          moan on six specimens,             2-48         Playfair.
     In quoting     these results   some explanation         is necessary.         In  the
original memoirs of Deville, it is left uncertain whether he                  examined
the specific     gravity of diamond or graphite silicon ; and manuals of
chemistry give it as the result due to the latter form ; but from its coin
cidence with my own experiments on diamond silicon, it must unques
tionably refer to that variety.          Among the six specimens examined                by
myself, one preparation was           in peculiarly fine crystals, and gave             the
sp. gr. 2 46     ;  two out of tho six specimens             were     prepared by Dr

                                          247
 Matthiesien,   and gave a mean sp. gr. of 2-47.              The remainder were
 inferior samples, and probably contained zinc and other impurities.
     Professor Miller has kindly examined for me the specific gravity
 of a good specimen of graphite silicon in his        possession     (not analyzed),
 and found it to be 2-337.
     Deville gives as the specific gravity of boron diamond 2'68.
     The crystalline form of the boron diamond is the same as that of
the carbon diamond, and similar relations seem to exist between the
 specific gravity and atomic weights.            The atomic weight of boron         is
7'2, viewing its oxide     as corresponding to carbonic acid in composition.
                    t/T2 = 2-683.               sp. gr. = 2-68.
    But the   same relation      would not appear to hold for silicon, which
does not affect the     like tendency       to  crystallize in the      same   forms
as carbon and boron, although the relations between the numbers in
its case also are in the same direction, and not devoid of simplicity.
    The atomic weight of silicon         is 14-2.
   Si \/l4:2 = 2-42          sp,  gr. of diamond silicon, =2 46            to 2-48.
   Si V28-4 = 2'30           sp.  gr. of graphite silicon,       =2-33.
    The differences exhibited         in this case from the similar forms of
Carbon and Boron are not sufficiently             marked to throw doubt upon
the relations as being due to some unexplained                law.     As  an  arith
metical probability,      indeed,   the discordance lessens the value of the
testimony    in the previous cases.          But our chemical knowledgo of
the manner in which Silicon doubles and quadruples itself in the
silicates, to unite with the same quantity of base, gives support to
the    idea that its atomic weights may be different                 in the various
forms of the separate element.
    When    we consider how much           we   multiply the errors of experi
 ment in raising the observed specific gravities            to the second,     third,
and fourth     powers, it remains          scarcely   possible     that the simple
relations   between   them and the atomic weights, in the cases which
 I  have pointed out, can be due to chance.             I have   purposely avoided
 any speculation    as to the      bearing which these         relations may have
 on the molecular arrangement             of the particles of the elements in
 their various forms,       as  I  desire, in the first place, to submit the
testimony     on which      the relations      themselves     are founded to the
consideration    of chemists.

     But it may    be   fairly     asked,   whether any similar relations exist
 between the specific gravities and atomic weights of the remaining
 solid or liquid non-metallic          elements.            I   take the following     mean
 specific gravity for bromine, iodine, sulphur, and selenium, and                       omit
 the only two remaining        elements — phosphorus and tellurium                   — from
 the list, because    they do not appear to yield relations at all                    analo

2.   Some Miscellaneous           Observations on the Tadpole,             and on
    the Albumen of the Newly-laid Egg.                By John Davy, M.D.,
    F.R.S. Lond. and Edin.
    On the Tadpole     of  the  Frog. — The author first notices       the jelly —
the peculiar      enveloping     matter of the ova —describing        its proper
ties and   uses, — the   latter, according to him, for the double purpose
of defending the      eggs before     being hatched, and affording        the tad
poles food after their hatching.            He considers the substance of the
jelly a variety of albumen.
    Secondly, He notices the        ova, which he describes as resembling, in
their properties and composition, those of fishes.
    Thirdly, He enters into some details respecting the growth of the
tadpole and its metamorphosis,             specially dwelling on the fact, that
whilst in the change to the advanced form there is a diminution of
volume, there is an increase of solid matter — the young frog having
a bony skeleton, which the tadpole is destitute of.
    Fourthly, Experiments are given showing the effect of different
degrees of temperature on the tadpole, and that of salt water of
different   degrees   of saltness.        From the last it would appear that
even brackish      water is fatal to them, thus limiting the habitat of
the species   ;  from the former,       that a temperature      exceeding 98° or
 100° has the same effect; whilst one a little lower seems to promote
a torpid   state,   such as the alligator is said to acquire during the
season   of tropical heat     and drought.
    On the Albumen of        the  Newly-laid Egg of the Common Fowl. —
 From the experiments           described, it would appear that the albu
 men of the newly-laid          egg   differs from that of the egg kept for
some time:      1st,  In  becoming milky at about 150° Fahr., owing to
the formation of innumerable granules, so small as barely to be seen
 with the microscope, — a quality which may be preserved for a con
 siderable time by the exclusion of oxygen, effected               by lubricating
 the shell with oil or butter;       2dly,   In forming, at    a higher tempera
 ture, a softer coagulum.
 3. On Acupressure,         a  New Method of Arresting Haemorrhage.
                           By Professor Simpson.
    Professor Simpson made a communication                  on   acupressure, as a
new mode of arresting surgical haemorrhage.                 After describing     the
       vot. iv.                                                     2 l

various methods of stanching             haemorrhage       in surgical wounds        and
operations which the Greek, Roman, Arabic, and Mediaeval                     surgeons
employed, he gave a short history of the introduction of the ligature
of arteries,     and spoke of it as — with the occasional exception                    of
torsion for the smallest       arteries — the     haemostatic     means  almost uni
versally employed in chirurgical practice at the present day.                        But
he thought that        surgery must advance forward a step farther                 than
the ligature of arteries, particularly if surgeons expected — as                seemed
to be their unanimous         desire — to   close  their operative wounds        by the
immediate union or primary adhesion of their sides or walls.
     All  the march of modern surgery has been                   in the   direction of
 attempting to increase the chances             of the union of surgical        wounds
 by the first intention, by diminishing             more and more the irritation
 derived from the presence and action of the ligatures supposed                    to be
 inevitably required for the arrestment of the haemorrhage.                     By    the
 new haemostatic       process   of acupressure,       Dr Simpson      hopes to over
 come in a great degree         all  those   difficulties,   as by  it he expected      to
 arrest the haemorrhage        attendant upon surgical wounds without               leav
 ing permanently any foreign body whatever in the wound itself.                         It
 was an attempt to bring bleeding wounds, in common surgery,                      to the
 condition of wounds in plastic surgery, where no arterial                    ligatures
 were used, and where union by the first intention was in consequence
 the rule, and not the exception to           it.
     Dr Simpson       stated that     he had tested, with perfect          success, the
  effects  of acupressure      as a means      of effectually closing     arteries and
  stanching     haemorrhage,      first upon the lower animals, and lately               in
  two or three operations on the human                 subject.     The   instruments
  which he      proposed     should     be   used    for   the   purpose    were      very
  sharp-pointed     slender needles        or  pins of passive or non-oxidizable
  iron, headed with       wax or glass, and in other respects             also like the
  hare-lip   needles commonly used by surgeons at the present day, but
  longer when circumstances required. They might be coated with silver
  or zinc on the surface, if such protection were deemed requisite.
      That    needles    used   for the purpose of acupressure, and                passed
  freely through the walls and flaps of wounds, will not be attended                      by
  any great degree         of disturbance       or irritation, is rendered in           the
  highest degree probable by all that we know of the tolerance of living
  animal tissues to the contact of metallic bodies.                    Long ago John
  Hunter pointed out that small -shot, needles, pins, &c., when passed

                                                   251
into and imbedded              in tho living body, seldom or never produced any
inflammatory action, or none at least                      beyond the stage of adhesive
inflammation, even when                   lodged for years.          Some time ago, when
the subject of acupuncture specially attracted the attention of medical
men, Cloquet, Pelletan,               Pouillet, and others,      showed     that the passage
and retention         of long acupuncture             needles  was attended with      little or
no   irritation in       the implicated         living tissues.      The reviewer of their
works and experiments in the                   Edinburgh Medical Journal for 1827
observes,    — " It       is a remarkable            circumstance      that the acupuncture
needles never cause inflammation                      in their neighbourhood.         If   they
are rudely handled or ruffled by the clothes                     of the patient, they may
produce a       little irritation       ;   but   if they  are properly secured and pro
tected, they may be left in the body for an indefinite                        length of time
without causing any of the effects which usually arise on account of
the   presence of foreign bodies.                  In  one of M. Cloquet's patients. they
were left     in the temples for eighteen                   days  ;  and in cases in which
needles have been               swallowed, they have           remained without        causing
inflammation           for     a much longer period.                 It   appears probable,
from the facts collected on the subject, that metallic bodies                        of every
kind may remain              imbedded        in the animal tissues without being pro
ductive     of injury."          (Page      197.)        All  the late observations and
experiments upon metallic sutures are confirmatory of the same great
pathological law, of the tolerance of living tissues for the contact of
metallic bodies imbedded                  within their substance.           In the operation
 for  hare-lip, where           the whole success or failure of the operation de
 pends    on the      establishment or not of union by the first intention,
surgeons use needles                to keep     the lips of tho wound approximated,
often compressing these                needles       strongly   with their    figure-of-eight
 ligatures,    and find this measure the most                      successful    means   which
they can adopt for accomplishing                     primary    adhesion.
     The acupressure of arteries, when compared with tho ligature of
 them, appears, as a means                  of arresting hemorrhage,           to present va
 rious important          advantages        :—
     1st, Acupressure           will   bo found more easy, simple, and expeditious
 in its application         than the ligature.
     2d,   The      needles       in acupressure         can   scarcely    be considered      as
 foreign    irritating       bodies      in the wound, and may always be entirely
 removed       in    two      or three days, or as soon as the artery is con
 sidered     closed    ;    whilst      the    ligatures     are truly foreign      irritating

                                        252
 bodies,   and cannot be removed       till they have ulcerated through           the
 tied vessels.
     3d, The ligature inevitably      produces ulceration,     suppuration,      and
gangrene at each arterial point at which            it  is applied   ; whilst     the
closure of arterial tubes by acupressure is not attended by any                such
 severe and morbid consequences.
     4th, The chances, therefore, of the union of wounds by the first
 intention should be much greater under the arrestment of surgical
 haemorrhage     by acupressure than by the ligature.
     5th, Phlebitis, Pyaemia, &c., or, in         other    words, traumatic        or
 surgical fever, seem not unfrequently to be excited by the unhealthy
 local suppurations     and limited sloughings which are liable to           be set
 up in wounds by the presence and irritation of the ligatures.
     6th, Such dangerous and fatal complications are less likely              to be
excited     by the employment        of acupressure, seeing         the   presence
of a metallic needle has      no  such     tendency to create local      suppura
tions and sloughs in the wound, such as occur in the seats of arterial
 ligatures.
    And 7th, Hence, under the use of acupressure, we are entitled to
expect both, first, that surgical wounds will heal more kindly and
close more speedily;      and, secondly, that surgical operations and            in
juries will   be less frequently   attended     than at present by the       disas
trous effects and perils of surgical fever.

1. Some       Miscellaneous      Observations on the Growth of Birds,
    their   Specific Gravity, and on the Stomach of Fishes in
    Relation to Digestion.           By John Davy, M.D., F.R.S. Lond.
    and  Edin.
    On the Growth        of Birds. — The author's observations             on this
 subject   are chiefly    confined to the martin, the common fowl, the
turkey, and goose.        They all tend to show a rapid growth, varying
in degree    according to the habits of the species.            The young mar
tin was found      on   leaving   its nest   heavier than the        parent bird  ;
and this the growth, as         to time,   of about twenty days, reckoning
from the hatching       of the   egg.    A turkey poult, the day it quitted
the egg,     weighed one ounco        and  three quarters   ;   in five months it
 had increased to      ten pounds.       A  gosling, in thirty-four days, had
 increased   in weight from six ounces        to six pounds.      A   chick of the
 Dorking breed, in three months, had increased from an ounce and a
 half to three pounds.        This rapidity of growth — a rapidity in the
 instance   of nestlings   fed   by the parent birds essential to their ex
 istence — is referred to two principal causes, an active digestion and

                                           254
  abundance of food, other circumstances aiding.                  The relation        of  the
  size of the egg of different species            to that    of the parent birds            is
 suggested as an interesting subject for inquiry             ;  and the conjecture          is
 offered, illustrated    by some examples, that the circumstances                    chiefly
 influencing    that relation      may be the manner            in which the         young
 birds are fed, whether          by the old     birds, or unaided by them,               and
 the proportional     abundance of food.
     On the Specific Gravity         of Birds. — The birds submitted               to trial
 were the martin,        the water-ouzel,        snipe, wood-owl,        merlin-hawk,
 and wren.       These, deprived of their feathers, were found to                      be of
 nearly the same       specific gravity as the water in which they were
 weighed.      With the feathers on, in common with birds generally,
 they all floated in water, buoyed up by the lightness of their feathers,
 — these    so light owing to the air they contain.              As the air       becomes
 disengaged    on forced    submersion, so the specific gravity of the                  bird
 increases.     A  wren, the specific gravity of which when                    first   sunk
 in water was 0'890, after a continuance                   under     water of       twelve
 hours, had increased to 0'960.              The specific gravity of         the water-
 ouzel with its feathers on was found to             be  about 0-724     ;   that of     the
 merlin-hawk      about 0"570.          It  is pointed     out, in conclusion,          how
little the specific gravity of the bird is concerned as regards apti
tude for aerial locomotion, and how it is subordinate to various cir
cumstances, such as lightness from included air and a high tempera
ture, and a great impulsive power of wing.
     On the Stomach        of Fish in relation          to  Digestion. — In        the in
stances of the salmon and sea-trout, and indeed                of all the  fish tried —
these    including   the   common trout, charr,            grayling,    haddock,        and
dogfish — the     stomach,      when empty, was found by test-papers                      to
be commonly neutral, and on              the contrary acid when any             food was
present;     leading to the conclusion that the gastric juice is                 secreted
only    when the      organ     is   stimulated     and    that   fluid   is    required.
From observations       on fish after death, kept for a certain time, suffi
ciently long for the fluids to act on the containing solids, denoted by
softening and rupture, tho inference is come to that the fluid of the
appendices pyloricae is most active in producing the post-mortem
effects ; and that the migratory species of the salmonidae, the salmon
and    sea-trout,   taking    little   food   in fresh water, exhibit         least    this
effect, and are least subject, from the emptiness              of their prima; vi-r,
to putrefaction.

2.   Notice of certain Remarkable Laws connected with the
    Oscillations of Flexible Pendulums : With Illustrative
    Experiments.           By Edward Sang, Esq.
    In   a previous     paper there had been            given a general      method of
investigating      the   motions   of elastic       systems,    when the redressing
tendencies are proportional         to the extents of the disturbance.               The
present paper contains the results of the application                  of this method
to the oscillations of flexible pendulums, composed of weights attached
by their       centres of gravity       to   a    thread.     These results,     though
strictly applicable only       to oscillations      of infinitely small extent, may
yet be held as indicating         the general characters             of oscillations    of
moderate dimensions.
    The exceedingly complex motions of                such a pendulum      may always
 be resolved into as many simple             oscillations     as there are bodies       in
 the system      ;  a simple    oscillation      being such      that,  if it subsisted
 alone, all the moving points would pass                 through     their  mean posi
tions    at the same       instant, and would          also   all reach the extreme
limits of their motion at        once.
    The periodic times and the configurations of those simple motions
can be computed by help of an equation                    rising   to the degree indi
cated by the number of the bodies              ;   and we obtain this very singular
 result, that
                 " Whatever may       be the     details       the system,   the sum
                                                           of                           of
 the   squares     of  these  periodic times is equal           to the   square    of  the
periodic time of        a simple pendulum having the entire length                 of  the
flexible one;" or, in other words, that              "If simple     pendulums    be con
 structed vibrating in accordance with               the simple oscillations      of such
 a flexible series, the sum of their lengths is equal to the whole length
 of  the  flexible line."
     In   order to cause any given pendulum to perform one of its simple
 oscillations, we would need to give to each one of its component parts
 a properly regulated impulse         :   thus we might compute their extreme
 positions   ;  and, having placed each body properly, let them all go at
 the same instant.          Hence it is a matter of great difficulty to exhibit
 a simple oscillation       when the system consists of even so few as three
 or four parts.
     When all the bodies        are of one weight         and uniformly      distributed
 along the chord, the configuration              of a simple oscillation is given by
  the formula —

                                          256
          f,     n  / 1\      nn-\ /                 nn-ln-2//\t                           I
in which    Z is the length     of  one  of the links, p that of        a simple       pen
dulum oscillating       in the same       time, xK the ordinate of the              lowest
body    A, and   xn  that of a body situated n intervals above A.
    When     a flexible    pendulum       consists of two weights            A    and B,
attached by their centres of gravity to two threads                 AB, BC       of   equal
lengths, the ratio of the periodic times of              its two simple oscillations
may be exhibited         by constructing a right-angled           trigon    PQX, such
that the square of      PQ   may be proportional to the weight           A, the square
of   QR   to the weight      B  ;  this being done, the periodic time of                 the
slower is to that of the quicker oscillation as             QP   +  PR : QR.
    The truth of this law       was exhibited experimentally            by making A
nine and    B sixteen     ounces   :  an arrangement which gives the periodic
times as 2 to     1 ;  and also by making        A   sixteen and     B nine, in      which
case the ratio is as 3 to 1.
    When, by augmenting indefinitely             the number of the weights,               we
pass from the discrete         series to a continuous           uniform flexible       line,
the previous equation takes the form
 in which p is the length of the corresponding simple pendulum,                       c the
distance upwards from the lowest point             A, and     xA the horizontal       ordi
nate of A.     These formula differ, the one from the well-known                 develop-

                                                      the    squares  of
                                                                        for the      deno
                                                                            the natural
 numbers instead of those numbers themselves.
     From this latter equation it follows, that if a uniform                      flexible
 chain could he made to perform one of its simple oscillations,                  its   con
 figuration would always have the character of the curve                   so indicated.
  Starting from the lowest point in a direction                  which,   if  continued,
 would cross the vertical         axis at the height p, this curve           crosses and
 re-crosses that axis, each wave being longer and flatter than the pre
 ceding : the first crossing is at the height pxl'445 7965; the
 second at p x 7-617 8156; and the third at p x 18721 7517= hence

                                       257
the slowest oscillation of a uniform flexible chain of which I             is the
length accords with that of a single pendulum I x -691 6603 long:
the second oscillation agrees with that of a simple pendulum having
/ x -131 2712 for its length, while the third oscillation corresponds
to   Ix  -053 4138.
     The three oscillations of a chain were exhibited, and were shown
to agree exactly with the computed times as well as with the figures
 which had been prepared.
     In conclusion, it was remarked that, although           these  speculations
be   of interest chiefly to those    whose    attention is particularly turned
 to   mechanical   science,   they are not devoid of attractions         for the
student     of general physics, as they bear closely upon the received
doctrines of acoustics, and also upon the undulatory theory of light.
 In these doctrines it is assumed,          as the very foundation     on which
 they are built, that the disturbance of an elastic medium engenders
 a series  of  waves which     progress through       that medium producing,
 in the case of air, the phenomenon of sound, — in the case of the sup
 posed luminous      ether, waves     of  light; yet a strict investigation
 shows that, when an elastic system is deranged at any one point, all
 the species of vibration of which the system is capable are at once
 called into existence, and that the isolation of one of the simple oscil
 lations would require the simultaneous action of              as many   distinct
 and properly regulated impulses as there are particles in the system             :
 in other words, it shows that the formation of the supposed                aerial
 pulses, or of the imagined luminous waves, is physically            impossible.
     When we strike the string of      a harp or     of a clavichord,  we do not
 cause   it to perform its major vibration alone— on the contrary,             we
  produce many of its partial motions also         ; and although the number
  of beats per second of its slowest oscillation be the principal argu
  ment of the theoretical      musician,   it by  no means follows that those
  beats constitute   more than an important           element in what is truly
  the sound   of the string.

    The following Communications              were read      : —
 1. Suggested     Explanation of Messrs Carrington and Hodgson's
    recently    observed Solar Phenomenon.                By Professor C.
    Piazzi Smyth.
    The Royal Society of Edinburgh having            been   the arena    wherein
 Professor  W. Thomson first described his calculations and            admirable
 extensions of   Mr   Waterston's    meteoro-dynamic theory of solar         light
 and  heat,  I  beg   leave to call the attention       of the    same learned
 Society to an apparent       instance of confirmation       which that    theory
 appears to me to have received, by a phenomenon of very                  unique
 character, recently observed     in an independent and most satisfactory

                                          259
manner, by either of two able scientific men — viz.,             Mr   Carrington   of
the  Observatory, Red Hill, and           Mr   Hodgson at Highgate.
    The respective observations           of these   gentlemen are to be found
in the monthly notices        of   the   Royal Astronomical Society for No -
vember     1859,    and seem       quite sufficient   to prove, after making      all
due allowance       for the different      instrumental     methods employed in
either case, and the peculiar nature of the subject observed, that on
September 1, at about 11 h. 18 m. a.m., Greenwich                  time, two small
telescopic    bodies of light, in close proximity, and elongated in the
direction of their motion,         suddenly burst into view on the surface of
the sun, not very far from its central portion, than which they were very
much brighter.        They  moved side by side in arcs nearly parallel           with
the plane      of the ecliptic   ;  first for  a time increasing      in brightness,
and then     again gradually fading away, so as to be quite lost in about
five  minutes after their first appearance. Though apparently on the
surface    of the sun, yet that appearance          was considered to arise from
optical projection     only, as they did not alter the shape of a group of
large    black    spots, which lay directly in their paths.             They must,
 nevertheless, have been exceedingly close to the surface; and on that
 supposition,     the paths which they described during their period of
 visibility   must, from their angular extent, have measured                    about
 35,000 miles, giving a mean rate of 117 miles per second.
    The first remark that we may make on the facts of observation,
 save  that nothing so momentary has ever been                witnessed before     by
 astronomers, is, that 117 miles per second               constitutes a velocity so
 exceedingly great, that we can only look to the gravitation               influences
 of the sun     for its efficient producing       cause.     Nevertheless,    we are
 at the same time bound to acknowledge, that the full rate of orbital
 motion,    for a body nearly in contact with the surface of the sun, is
 rather over 276 miles per second; and the rate of falling to the sun
 from infinite space, considerably more.              Evidently, then, something
 prevented     these bodies of September        1  from moving at their full rate,
 and produced a retardation in          their orbit equal to 159 miles a second,
 to take     Professor W. Thomson's form of the gravitation theory as
 the more probable.
     What that retarding          something     was,   it is not   so   much to our
  purpose    now to inquire,     as   long as we can show that it is not alto
  gether a baseless supposition, to assume the existence of any extensive
  material belonging to the sun, outside his visible, luminous surface.

                                                   260
 Now, this is fortunately              easy   of demonstration,          for we have only             to
 point to the red prominences, borders, and clouds, seen stretching                                   to
 a distance       of 60,000 miles sometimes from the                 edge    of the         solar orb
 during solar eclipses           ;   or to those unmistakable        evidences of a             large
 amount of outer absorbent and obstructing atmosphere, indicated                                   by
 the gradual yellowing and de-photographical                      properties       of       the sun's
 light, with every advance from the centre to the circumference of                                his
 disc.    (See Teneriffe         Report, " Philosophical Transactions"                  for 1858,
p, 487.)  Something material, therefore, and forming to all intents
and purposes one body with the sun, does exist round about him ;
and capable, we cannot but allow, of affording impediment                                     to the
motion of any extraneous body, before it actually comes into                                 contact
with that intensely bright surface which                     is   vulgarly held         to consti
tute the outside of the sun.
   Hence,         when we find our solar meteors of September                           1    moving
at a rate slower by 159 miles a second than they should do                                   accord
ing to the laws of gravitation, the simplest assumption that we can
make      is,
         that there has been   mechanical retardation to that amount.
                                         a
Let this        be granted, and then          it   necessarily follows from the dyna
mical theory of heat, that precisely in accordance with the disappear
ance     of motion will        be the appearance         of heat.        And when           we fur
ther take account of the previous high                      temperature       to which           the
matter of the meteor (for the two, we are inclined to look                                    on as
fragments of one unless Bielas' double comet
                         ;                      to be taken         is                        as an
argument for constant double meteors also) was brought, during the
long ages of its circulation around the sun, in an orbit whose mean
distance decreased only secularly              ;   and when we also consider the ex
traordinary        warmth of the region where the observed rapid retarda
tion took place,         it   will   be understood that everything           was    extremely
favourable to the heat produced by conversion of motion, appearing
with     so intense an expression, as to be accompanied by                     a    most vivid
display of light.
   Even in the cold external atmosphere of the earth, and with                                    a
speed of only 19 miles in    second on the average to be converted,
                                        a
M. Joule        has shown that meteors should become intensely white hot;
and Professor       Swan has described in the               " Proceedings" of this               So
ciety,   Vol.    III.,   p. 220, a case of one           bright enough      to be conspicu
ously seen at noonday.
   It    is   true that, according to          Mr Waters ton's form of             the theory,

                                                 261
and even the first expression               of Professor W. Thomson's also, where
the sun is fed           by lumps of meteoric matter, there is some difficulty
in explaining         why the occurrence of luminous meteors in the sun is
not frequently observed,            if   remarkably visible in one instance       ;   while,
according          to the subsequent modification            of the Iatter's view, the
generality of meteors must be distilled away into impalpable clouds of
finely-divided meteoric matter some time before they actually reach the
sun    ;   and neither gentleman had expected that an actual impact would
ever be seen by mortal eye.
   These objections, however, will be at once, to a great extent, re
lieved      by the very fair assumption of as superior a mass to the
September          1st meteor, over the generality of those which fall to the
sun,       in any and       every   manner, as men have           already     recorded of
those which          have actually fallen to, or have            been    seen very near,
the earth ;         for while the majority          (see   the museums of Vienna, St
Petersburg,  and London) measure only a few inches, with occa
sional masses of 2 and 3 feet, there was one unusually well observed
by many able spectators                  in Scotland, England, and France,            on the
18th August 1783, which                   was estimated to be more than half a
mile in length.
   It      may indeed                      with this superior size of
                             be argued that,                                           body,
the decrease          of the meteor's radius-vector in its orbit would                 have
been       slower than with smaller lumps revolving               in the denser parts
of the ethereal medium in the sun's immediate neighbourhood
                                                              (see
"
  Edinburgh  Astronomical Observations," vol. xi. p. 266); and   it
would therefore have been exposed so much longer                        to the fiery heat
of that region as to be distilled                away, equally with the smaller ones,
before actually          touching the grosser parts of the solar atmosphere.
   This argument, even carried to the extreme, does but remove the
probability of the phenomenon of September 1st from being a me
teor of the W. Thomson character, circulating around the sun, to
one of Waterston's,             falling     to   the sun from     distant    space ;    and
while Professor           W. Thomson has most satisfactorily                demonstrated
that, whatever may be the real character of the greater part of the
solar      light   and   heat, some of it must be due to meteoric action, so,
while we freely concede to him that the majority of meteoric matter
falling      to the sun is of the planetary or satellite character, we are
still entitled, according to his own reasoning on p. 67 of " Transac
tions of Royal Society of Edinburgh," vol. xxi. part        as well as      i.,

                                       262
 from some of the paths computed by           M. Petit, of    the Toulouse Ob
 servatory, to assume that some meteoric matter           arrives from distant
 space, and    falls nearly directly to the sun.       In such case,     the final
 rate of its motion being 390 miles per second, there would              be small
 time for much more to be effected,         than that that fused crust       we so
often find on terrestrial     meteoric stones     should be formed, prior         to
the commencement of rapid retardation,              and before     conversion     of
mechanical energy into heat      ; followed, doubtless, almost immediately
by the breaking up of the matter from explosion and deflagration.
    Let  us inquire, then, how far       the known meteoric mass of 18th
August 1783 would suffice to produce the effects observed on Sep
tember 1st, 1859, had it then fallen to the sun.                  Professor W.
Thomson      gives the amount of meteoric matter that would                be re
quired, according to      Mr  Waterston, to produce, by striking the           sun,
the average solar illumination, as 0-000060 lb. per square foot                 per
second.
    For the period of our phenomenon, or           5 minutes,   this is '018     lb.
per square foot, and 501'811 lb. per square mile for the same                time.
    Now the meteor in question, said by Mr Cavalho to                  have had
a diameter of 1070 yards, can hardly have contained                    less than
15,000,000,000 cubic feet; and if            we  take for its specific gravity
a mean     between    what has been determined         by many measures of
earthy meteorites       on  one  hand,    and   meteoric   iron   on the     other
(which comes extremely near the mean density of the earth), then
the total weight must have been 5,250,000,000,000 lb. Whence it
is evident that there was enough material in that one meteor,                 pro
perly   distributed,   to keep a space      5,000,000    square miles of the
sun's surface in a state of luminous ignition, twice as intense           as that
of the ordinary solar disc during         all the time of     observation   ; and
therefore, by the transparency of flame, to have tripled the bright
ness   of the parts passed over— a phenomenon which, from angular
subtense, as well as intensity of light, would be abundantly visible
to telescopic observation from our earth.
    * To this we may further add another consideration, which would
 notably   increase   the   quantity   of light given      out   by the     same
 meteor;    for in the remarkable                        which    Professor    W .
                                        investigations
 Thomson      has appended to his paper above quoted, relative            to the
                  * This paragraph  added on  January  16, 1860.

                                      263
rotation and the age of the sun, he appears to have assumed, if I read
him aright, that all the meteors in the solar neighbourhood are cir
culating   in the same direction      as the planets    ;  and it is extremely
probable that this is true for the greater number of them.                Indeed,
the publication      in France, since this paper was placed in the hands
of your Secretary, of the apparent discovery of a planet interior to
Mercury, at considerably less than half his heliocentric distance,
and revolving       direct, might  be taken   as a remarkable        proof of the
correctness     of the assumption.      Nevertheless, we cannot close our
eyes to the fact, that the members of the solar system which occa
sionally  come visibly closest to the sun are not planets, but comets,
and that, amongst these, retrograde motion is frequent ; while of all
comets, the one which has made the closest known approach, since
the age of exact astronomy, was that of 1843, which was retrograde,
and passed only 60,000 miles from the sun's surface.                  Hence it is
by no means        an unwarranted     supposition for us to make, that an
occasional meteor moves retrograde also          ;  as,   in fact, this    one   of
September       1st appears to have done; and        if it     should, in such a
course,   encounter      another   moving   direct,   in    the    crowded   solar
vicinity —a      casualty   that  must become more and more probable
with every advance towards the sun — there would                be double speeds
of motion to be converted into heat; there would                 be much such a
sudden blaze of light as the observers described             ;  and then a rapid
descent of both bodies to the sun's surface, through that remaining
distance in which they might otherwise have long continued to cir
culate before their final absorption.
    On the whole, then, it appears exceedingly probable that the
 solar phenomenon of September 1st was a meteor falling to the
sun, and giving out the heat of its mechanical energy in accordance
with the laws of that dynamical theory of thermotics, first and
chiefly in this country brought before the Royal Society of Edin
burgh by Professors W. Thomson and Macquorn Rankine.                            In
which   case, there is another example added, to several that            might be
extracted     from    the history  of science, showing that hardly has a
true theory       been   published  to  the world,    before a confirmatory
phenomenon,        previously quite unexpected, is almost providentially
witnessed   ;   and in no case by less prejudiced or more able observers
than the gentlemen upon whom we depend in the present instance.

2.   On the Fallacy of the Present Mode                     of Estimating the
    Mean Temperature in England.                   By James Stark, M.D.
    In   the Meteorological      Tables     for   England, published         at the
public expense, viz., those of Greenwich            Observatory,    and those          of
the  fifty-five meteorological stations in England, appended to the
Registrar-General's Quarterly Reports, the mean temperature as
given    is not the true mean, but is an estimated mean,                    deduced
from the united observations made with the                  self-registering        and
dry-bulb thermometers,          the   exact     means    of  these    instruments
being first altered     by certain     tables, with     the view of correcting
them for diurnal and monthly range.               The author objected         to this
mode    of estimating the     mean temperature,       because    the tables        used
for the purpose of correction were drawn             up from insufficient         data,
and    because the principle     was bad     of having observations        made by
one instrument,     whose    readings were liable to constant errors,            made
the basis    for the correction of observations         made by a more trust
worthy instrument.
    The tables for the correction of diurnal range               used  in  England
were drawn      up from a five years' series of observations;              but by a
reference to the Scottish observations, it was attempted to be                 shown
that a five years' period was far too short to elicit even a true                mean
annual temperature      ;  while, by a reference to the mean temperature
of corresponding months during five consecutive years, it was                    found
that such a period gave still more incorrect results for the months.
    It   was  then demonstrated,        by a reference        to  the Greenwich
monthly     and daily observations, that the readings of the dry-bulb
thermometer,      at every two-hourly         period, failed to give the            true
 mean temperature        either of the day or of the             month,     as     they
 always    missed the period        of the day when the maximum                    tem
 perature    was  attained,   which,    as   indicated   by the self-registering
 thermometer, was from 1° to 5° higher               than any of the        readings
 taken at the two-hourly        periods.      The   consequence     was, that        the
 mean temperature deduced from            the dry-bulb two-hourly           readings
 was    always below the truth, and it was impossible from them                        to
 ascertain at what period of the day the highest temperature                         was
 attained, so that the chief elements         for the calculation of the     amount
 of diurnal range were wanting.
     The data, however, which were          used for the formation         of   tables

                                        265
of correction for the self-registering       thermometric observations were
shown to be even more faulty than those used              for that of the dry-
bulb; firstly, from the circumstance that           the faulty   dry-bulb mean
was held to be the only true mean, and made the basis for the cor
rection of the self-registering       mean ; and secondly, from the circum
stance that the whole of the self-registering         observations were made
with Six's registering thermometer, an instrument now considered
inaccurate.        By a reference to the Makerstoun Observations for a
period of three years, and to those of Scotland for the last two
years, it was demonstrated that, when the self-registering thermo
meters are       of proper construction, the strict mean of the maximum
and minimum          readings appear to require       no correction      whatever,
but indicate the true mean temperature.              Particular    attention   was
 directed     to the Makerstoun Observations          for   1844,   when     hourly
 readings      were taken with the dry-bulb thermometer,              their strict
 mean giving the mean annual            temperature as 44°9, while the strict
 mean of Rutherford's        self-registering   thermometer      gave the annual
 temperature as 45°0, than which no results could be closer.
      In  the present state of the science, the author contended that the
  only safe     rule for the estimation of mean temperature was to take
  the strict mean of the self-registering        thermometers, provided these
  were of proper construction       ;  and he strongly denounced the practice
 followed in England, of withholding          the strict means of the different
 series of dry and wet bulb readings, and only publishing              deductions,
 which the facts brought forward          in his paper proved must, in most
  instances, be erroneous.
    3.  Description of the Plant which produces the Ordeal Bean
                    of Calabar.     By Professor Balfour.
       After noticing   the various plants used in     Africa   as ordeal poisons,
  the author gave an account of the introduction of the Calabar Ordeal
  Bean     into   Scotland,  by the Rev.     W. Waddell, and mentioned its
  peculiar poisonous qualities,       as  determined by Dr Christison.           To
   Dr Hewan, and the Rev. Zerub Baillie, who are connected with the
  United Presbyterian Mission in Old Calabar,                he  was   indebted for
   some observations      on actual cases of poisoning in     Africa.     The Rev.
       vol. iv.                                                         2 ir

W. C. Thomson,          another missionary,       was    the first who     procured
flowering specimens of the plant.           Some of these had been given            to
the author by Mr Baillie, and from them, along with the legume
and seeds, the characters of the plant had been drawn up. The
plant belongs to the natural order Leguminosae, sub-order                   Papilio-
naceae,  and tribe Phaseoleae,     and appears to be a new genus to            which
the name of Physostigma         (jrvo-aa, to inflate)     has been given, from
the peculiar inflated appearance of the stigma.               To the    species the
name of venenosum has been given, in allusion to its poisonous quali
ties.   The genus     is nearly allied to Phaseolus,        from which it differs
in the stigma, and in the long, grooved hilum of the seed.                    In  the
last character    it approaches Mucuna.
    Physostigma      venenosum     is a large     twining plant, with        a thick
stem, and pinnately-trifoliolate       leaves.    The inflorescence is      nodoso-
racemose, the flowers being curved, and of a pale pink colour,                    the
stamens 10, diadelphous, the style bearded            at its upper part, and      the
stigma covered with a remarkable            crescentic ventricular       sac.    The
legume is 7 inches long, of a brown colour, containing two or                  three
dark-brown     seeds, with a long, deep       hilum.
    The paper    was illustrated    by drawings, executed by         Dr  Greville.

    The following Communications               were read       : —
       1 . On the Capture of Whales with the aid of Poison.
                               By Dr Christison.
    This paper was an account of a plan proposed and tried many
years ago for poisoning whales, by introducing hydrocyanic acid into
their bodies when struck with the harpoon.
    In   1831,    the author    was   consulted on the subject by the             late
Messrs G. and       W. Young of Leith, at that time concerned                  in the
northern whale-fishery.          It  appeared to the author           that the    idea
was feasible ; that     it   was sufficient  to paralyse the animal,          so that
the boats could speedily come           up with    it  ;   and that a quantity of
concentrated       hydrocyanic    acid, adequate to produce that effect              at
least, could be introduced by means of two glass tubes, one                  on each
side of the shank of the harpoon, where they would be protected by
the barbs     of the blade.      After various   devices were thought           of for
breaking     the tubes at the right moment, the contrivance                 fixed on
was,    that the double barb, with which each side of the blade ter
minates, should be jointed movably on the upper portion of the blade                    ;
so that, when traction        was exerted,   on the whale starting          off with
the harpoon in its body, the external            ends     of the barbs would         be
thrown outwards so as to increase the hold of the harpoon, while                    the
 inner ends     of the barbs would be        squeezed      against the tubes,       and
crush them to pieces.
    Harpoons so constructed, one of which was exhibited                  to the So
 ciety, were sent out in a Greenland ship, with a large supply of con
 centrated hydrocyanic        acid, in the spring        of 1832;      but the ship
 was nipped between two ice-fields on its first arrival among the
 whales, and just when all was ready for the trial. In 1834, another
 vessel was sent out by the Messrs Young, provided with the same
 kind of harpoons, and with          a harpoon gun for          firing them.        Not
 having    been    aware  till lately of this   second      trial, the author had
been able to inquire       into the result only a few weeks ago.             The     ac
 counts he received were discrepant.           According      to the most credible
 report, the experiment succeeded         ; but the crew were so alarmed at

                                                271
the effects, that they           were afraid     of being poisoned in removing the
blubber,          and would not persevere        in using the harpoons.*
   The paper concluded with observations, showing that increased
facilities might be secured, in consequence of the comparative ease
with which concentrated prussic acid might now bo made and pre
served in hermetically sealed tubes, and likewise because poisons
were now known even more potent than hydrocyanic acid.
2.       Notice regarding the Branchial Sac of the Simple Ascidite.
                          By Andrew Murray.
         In   a paper which      I   read last year before this Society,           "   On the
Structure and Functions of the Branchial Sac of the Simple A aci
diae,"        I
        stated that I had fed and injected ascidise with indigo and
other         coloured sea-water,       and that in those           so fed,     the coloured
material          was    never found on the exterior              of the   sac, but always
deposited on the inner wall, and that injection                        by the mouth into
the sac failed to push the coloured matter through                         its walls, except
by rupturing them.
     These experiments were not isolated or few in number.                         I   showed
the results to various           friends — among       others, Professor Goodsir,          Dr
Wright, and             Dr Cleland — and never,       in any of the experiments which
I  made, did a single instance occur of tho indigo passing through the
stigmata of the sac ; and, in that paper,                    I
                                               naturally reasoned from
this fact.           Subsequent observation has shown mo that,                    in relying
upon these negative instances,              I
                               was generalising too hastily. Since
I read that paper,           I
                     have in two instances found, on feeding the
Ascidia virginea with indigo, that it                 had passed through the windows
of the sac and was partially deposited on each side of the sac, and
some of it sticking in the meshes ; and                  I   hasten to correct the      erro
neous impression conveyed by the negative instances in my former
paper.            Of course, all the reasoning in        it,     founded on the supposed
impenetrability of the sac, falls to the ground and would appear  ;        it
that my error has arisen from the animal having the power of re
jecting or passing through              these    stigmata the contents of the sac as
it   pleases, which          accounts for various other observers having                 seen
     *
     Since the Author's paper was read, he has received distinct information,
that at the first trial, the whale "sounded," but in   surprisingly short time
                                                                   a
came up again — dead.

                                            272
currents running past the fenestrae without entering them                               ;    and my
previous experiments         probably failed from                  the fact of the indigo
being distasteful to the animal, which exercised its power of not ad
mitting it to pass the walls of the sac.
  Another correction which             I
                                  wish to make is this                        :    I   stated that
Dr Wright and       I    thought that, under a high power of the micro
scope, we saw a diaphanous            membrane              stretching      across the bran
chial stigmata, which showed a polygonal                       structure      similar            to that
of epithelica.     I     have never been able to detect this again                           ;    but    I
have seen something          approaching to            it,   which  I    am satisfied was               a
compressed     aggregation     of blood -globules,                 and
                                                                     I      strongly suspect
(particularly since finding that the indigo has                      passed through these
stigmata) that my former observation                   is    to be referred        to some           de
ceptive appearance of this kind.

1. On the        Action of Uncrystallised Films upon Common and
    Polarised Light.         By Sir David Brewster, K.H., F.R.S.
    Since the discovery of the polarisation         of light by refraction,     the
action of a pile of transparent         plates upon common and polarised
light    has not been studied by any      of the   writers   on physical    optics.
It   was believed that a pencil          of common light          was completely
polarised in the plane of refraction when the plates were sufficiently
 numerous, no special notice having been taken of the light thrown
back by reflexion       into the transmitted       and polarised       beam.    Sir
John Herschel, indeed, had referred to it           ; but he   remarks that     " it
mixes with the transmitted          beam, and, being in an opposite plane,
destroys     a  part of its polarisation."*      So long ago as 1814, Sir
David Brewster had shown that this reflected light is distinctly
visible as light polarised by reflexion       ;f but owing to the difficulty
of procuring very thin plates of glass with perfectly parallel surfaces,
it was impossible      to ascertain the true     character      of the oppositely
 polarised pencils.
    Having obtained, however, films of             decomposed      glass of great
thinness, and perfectly colourless, the author was enabled to prove
that the transmitted      beam    consisted of two pencils oppositely polar
 ised,    and   that  when   polarised    light   was    incident    obliquely   on
 such a pile, and subsequently analysed, the pile          of films exhibited all
 the properties of a plate cut perpendicular          to the axis of a negative
uniaxal crystal, the tints produced by the interference of the pencils
rising to the blue of the      second order   of Newton's        scale  of colours,
by increasing the obliquity of the incident pencil.
    A    line perpendicular to the plates or films at the point of inci
dence corresponds with the axis of the uniaxal crystal; and the dif
ferent azimuths in which the polarised ray may be inclined to this
axis correspond      with the principal sections of the crystal.

       When the films of          decomposed            glass are circular              spherical        seg
 ments and colourless, the black cross and its accompanying tints are
 finely displayed,         as in the system             of rings        seen      along the axis of
uniaxal      crystals.       When the films have the colour of thin                                 plates,
and^are deeply spherical segments, the tints of the rings which                                           ac

       2. On    Mr Darwin's Theory of                        the     Origin of Species.
                                  By Andrew Murray.
       The position taken by Mr Darwin                     is,
                                              that all species have arisen
 by    the natural process of ordinary generation.    That the differences
which we now see in them have arisen from slight variations                                          in   in
dividuals       having     from time to time occurred, which have been                                   per
petuated        by inheritance,         by successive stages                 and        slow degrees,
through unlimited           spaces    of time.           Some      of  slight variations
                                                                         these
he considers to originate             in causes        beyond our power of explanation,
and which, although not the work of chance, we may call chance,                                           for
want of a better appellation                — others       to arise from              habit, or       from
the excessive use or disuse of certain organs                      ;     but that when such                a
variation      has once appeared,            it   is   preserved          by   hereditary         descent
                principle which         he calls           natural
                                                       "                 selection,"          and which
through     a
he deduces       as   a   corollary from the struggle for existence which                                 we
see constantly going on around us.
                                                         " As      many more individuals,"
says he,
             " of   each species are born than can possibly survive                           ;   and     as,
consequently, there               frequently recurring struggle for existence,
                             is
                             a                                                                             it
follows     that any being,        if   it   vary, however slightly in any manner
profitable to itself, under the complex                     and sometimes varying                     con
ditions    of life, will       have    a    better chance of surviving,                        and    thus
be     naturally      selected.    From the strong                 principle of           inheritance
any selected variety will tend to propagate its new and modified form"
   5). Mr Darwin
 (p.                         by
                    no means shuns pushing his theory to its legiti
mate conclusion. In arguing as to the acquisition of new habits                                            by
some      of his supposed transitional animals,                         he
                                                                                         " In North
                                                                               says,
America      the black       bear was        seen      by Hearne swimming                     for   hours
with widely-open           mouth, thus catching, like                a   whale, insects             in   the
water.      Even in so extreme              a   case    as this,   if    the supply of            insects
were     constant, and       if   better adapted competitors                      did    not already
exist in the        country,      I   can    see no        difficulty        in   a    race    of   bears

structure        and habits, with large and larger                          mouths,      till a creature
was produced as monstrous as a whale"                                (p. 184).*          And the final
conclusion to which               he        has arrived        is   summed         up    as   follows   :   —
"
    Analogy would lead                     me one step        farther,      namely,       to the belief
that    all animals and plants have                    descended from some one prototype.
But analogy may be a deceitful guide. Nevertheless, all living things
have much in common in their chemical composition, their germinal
vesicles, their cellular               structure, and their laws of growth and re
production.             Therefore,          I should      infer from analogy, that probably
all the organic beings which have ever lived                                on    this earth have de
scended from             some         one    primordial form into which life                     was    first
breathed"         (p.    484).
    Such is a general statement of the position taken by                                  Mr Darwin          ;
and in support of               it,   as    might   be anticipated           from so accomplished
a   naturalist,         we have       in his work         not only the chief arguments on
which       it   rests ably stated, but numerous                         phenomena and facts in
natural history            applied to it, so as to test                      its probability       by its
consistency or inconsistency                    with them.            These illustrations           form,
however, only a very small portion of the facts which he has accumu
lated, and which, he informs                        us,    will     be afterwards         published         in
a larger and more elaborate treatise, and are now to be looked
upon as no more than mere indications of the nature of the evi
dence he possesses, and proposes                     hereafter to adduce.                 A    few of the
most important             of    these     I    shall briefly notice, but               I     think their
value       may be perhaps better appreciated                       if
                                                                     I      first state what     I     con
sider to be the essential                    qualities        requisite for the existence and
preservation of a species.                  I   conceive       that all species bear implanted
within them two essential laws, without which they could not exist.
The one,   power of accommodating themselves to
                 a                                  certain extent                   a
to circumstances           ;    in other words,           a   power of modification or varia
tion, as     Darwin calls it.                Without this the individuals composing the
 *     In   quoting this,    I   do not at all mean to give           it   as a   fair illustration of Mr
Darwin's views.      only refer to it as indicating the extent to which he is
                         I
prepared to go.   The   example here given      look upon (as Ihave reason to        I
know Mr Darwin does himself) merely as an extreme and somewhat extrava
                                                                     " natural
gant illustration, imagined expressly to show in a forcible way how
selection"       would operate in making            a   mouth bigger and bigger, because more
advantageous.

                                        276
species would, under any change of circumstances, die, and, of course,
the species    would die with them.             Now, it   is not difficult to prove
that this power of modification is possessed               by plants and animals.
I may    instance the change which takes place in the wool of                 sheep,
according as the animal is transferred from one climate to another —
the change in the size of the chest and lungs which is said to take
place in the second generation of animals transported from ordinary
elevations to the intensely         rarified air of lofty mountains,          or the
alteration   that is found in shells, whether             fresh-water    or  marine,
when transferred       into brackish      water.       But for evidence of     this   I
need not go beyond the examples given by                 Mr Darwin      himself.      I
think that all the instances of variation              mentioned by him may          bo
referred to this principle of modification.             To this principle, and as
designed for a similar purpose, do          I   refer the phenomena of hybridi
zation.   Putting aside a few exceptional cases, which may be explained
on special grounds,      I  conceive   that the well-known         and undeniable
general fact, that two distinct species may produce hybrid offspring,
which hybrid offspring will be sterile either               in the first or   second
generation, is strictly an instance of modification,             allowed    and     in
tended for the preservation of the species.                Conceive, for instance,
a herd    of deer, or any other animal, of which all the males have
died off — conceive it to be the last herd of that species on the face of
the earth.     Except for this power of hybridization, the species is
extinct, although it yet lives.           Its propagation is at an end. No
young can replenish its numbers, and the species endures only until
the last individual     has   died off.    But with the power of having           fer
tile intercourse with       a distinct species,      another   chance is given for
its preservation.      A   hybrid is born     ;  and  if a male,  it can have     fer
tile offspring    from the females of the original             herd, and in a      few
generations all trace of the foreign blood will have been washed                  out.
Such,   I  conceive,  to be the uses of the principle of modification in             its
various phases, viz., the preservation            of the species by the preser
vation and propagation of the individual.                But the species may be
lost in another way than by the death of its component individuals.
It  might, were there no check upon this power of modification,                       be
lost by hybrids and modified individuals taking the place of species;
in fact, were the power of variation unlimited               and uncontrolled,       all
species   would be confounded, and there would be nothing but                         an
indiscriminate      mass    of creatures running all into           each   other,     as

                                              277
 should be the case under             Mr Darwin's       theory were it true in fact.*
  Centaurs      and mermaids, nay, even dryads, would cease to be im
 possible      fables, and the beauty of creation                 would be lost in one
 undistingnishable          chaos.      To guard against this, and to preserve
 species     from     extinction      by confusion,      as   well from extinction          by
 death,     nature has furnished             species    with    another attribute        as a
 counterpoise        to   the     facility of modification           and    variation,    and
 that is the tendency to reversion to type.                   This    is   seen working     in
 two ways ; the one in the reappearance                      of typical forms or pecu
 liarities     after    having      been   absent for one         or more generations.
 We     see   it well in our own race, where a parent's                  face   and talents,
 lost in the child, reappear in the grandchild                    — where       even    here
 ditary    diseases     show themselves after the intermission                 of a genera
 tion or two.           This phase of reversion to type is slightly alluded
 to, and slightingly admitted as an element by Darwin.                              But the
 second,     and, as it appears to me, by much the most important phase
 of reversion       to type      (and     which   is practically,      if   not altogether
 ignored      by   Mr Darwin),           is the instinctive       inclination     which in
 duces individuals         of the     same     species   by preference        to intercross
 with    those   possessing the qualities           which they themselves want, so
 as to preserve the            purity or equilibrium          of the breed.         I   again
 refer to our own race for an apt example.                     It  is trite to a proverb,
 that tall    men    marry little women, tall women little men                  ;  a man of
 genius marries a fool, a great beauty the ugliest man she can find                           ;
 and we are told that this is the result of the charm of contrast, or of
 qualities     admired       in others     because     we   ourselves do not possess
 them.       I  do not so explain it.           I  imagine it is the effort of nature
 to preserve the typical medium of the race.                     Did  a different     feeling
 prevail, we should have our species broken up into giants and dwarfs,
 Newtons and idiots, Venuses                  or Apollos        and satyrs,       Sampsons
 and weaklings        ;  or,  if we should adopt       Darwin's notions, the dwarfs,
 weaklings, and idiots, would all be extirpated by the predominancy
 of the stronger varieties.             Now     we know      that this is not the case       ;
   *  One of Mr Darwin's          explanations of the absence of intermediate forms
 may be taken as his answer to this objection — viz., that these forms are, in
point of fact, numerically weaker than the forms on each side which they link
together, and thus are liable to be exterminated sooner than them. But, ad
mitting the fact to be that they are less numerous, why should they be so
under     Mr Darwin's theory        ?   With unlimited      powers of modification, why
should the intermediate forms always be originally fewer.

and we may guess               how strong the instinctive inclination for rever
sion to typical form              is,   when we look abroad among our acquaint
ances       and    see, notwithstanding            the manifold inducements to disre
gard the promptings of nature consequent upon the artificial state
in which we live, how few have refused compliance to this mys
terious law.            The control of parents,                the desire for easily acquired
wealth, the promptings of ambition, the cravings of vanity, and the
accidents of opportunity, all suggesting other matrimonial con
nections, and, backed with what may be looked on as of more im
portance than either, the strong control over one's own feelings and
desires      acquired by the habits of civilised                       life, generally give              way
before this imperious   constraint for reversion to type.     It less                             is
easy to give similar evidence  of this phase of the revertive  principle
in other animals.              In   the wild, we only see its result in the unifor
mity of all individuals             ;    in the domestic, man interferes, and by his
breeding compels departure                     from the type, and increases it.                          But
I   believe       it   requires     man's greatest care and watchfulness to pre
vent reversion, and that                 a     breed neglected retrogrades                  in   a   very
short time        ;    and what         is   called the prepotent               influence   of pollen
from the typical plant over that of neighbouring varieties   an in                          is
stance which will be admitted by most hybridizers; and an analogous
influence may be equally exercised                        in the      case       of hermaphrodites
and fixed animals.                This    is   my belief   :    but   it   is   not that of all the;
possibility of the new variety made by breeders and gardeners revert
ing to their parent forms     doubted                      by
                                          many, and denied by some.
                                          is
Mr Darwin of                course disputes       it,   or at least does not admit                 it,   and
desiderates the evidence                on which the statement has been                          so often
made,       that our         domestic        varieties, when          wild, gradually but
                                                                      run
certainly         revert     in character        to     their aboriginal stocks. Such                      a
demand for proof may not be capable of immediate satisfaction.                                           But
where a fact            is   very generally accepted*                 as true,      it   will usually
    *The point      one well worthy the attention of those who may have the
                       is
opportunity of testing it.    have no doubt that many unscientific breeders could
                                    I
give at once instances  which would bear upon it; but it will be observed that
the question of whether they do bear upon it      one not unattended with diffi
                                                                is
culty   for instance, in our breeds of cattle how are we to know when a race or

variety    reverting to its parent type — what was the parent form of our do
            is
mestic cattle   — Quien tab*. But that they naturally retrograde or go away
                  ?
from the something which has been the aim set up in breeding to something
else, certainly cannot be denied.

be found to be based on some foundation.                             Vox populi, vox Dei,             is
true       in more      sciences        than     politics.         Passing    this,    however,       I
would        next notice that           the phenomena of hybridization                      do       not
stop with the law allowing the hybrid to have fertile offspring
from the parent stock ; there is another law which prevents it
having       such     offspring     from       other hybrids            or other species, and
this is quite in accordance with my view of the precautions adopted
by nature    for the preservation of species.       In the first place,
fertility, to preserve it from extinction by extirpation of indivi
 duals ; in the second place, sterility, to preserve it from extinction
 by confusion of races.   Such are my views of the purpose and work
ing of the compensating qualities implanted in species.   And my
first objection to the principles on which Mr Darwin's theory rests
is,   that   it is   founded on exaggerated and undue estimate                        of the   one   —
the power of modification               ;    and   if   not   a   negation, at least an inade
quate concession of the other, viz. the principle                               of reversion to
type-
      Seeing, then, that the power of modification                         or variation        is   the
principle       on which his whole superstructure                    rests,   Mr Darwin wisely
takes care to fortify  by adducing striking instances illustrative of
                             it
the extent to which this may take place.   As the power of modifi
cation     is   to be seen in its most developed                   form in domestic animals,
it    is   from them      chiefly — indeed,             so far as       support to his theory
goes,  I      may say     it   is   from       them     entirely — that        his    illustrations
are drawn.            Now,   it    is   usually said that domestic animals are not
fair examples from which to reason in inquiries into species and
their origin  and ;    thought that the artificial circumstances
                             it    is
under which they live alter their system so much as to render any
argument drawn from them not worthy of reliance.                              I      have no doubt
that such artificial life and great change of habits has an impor
tant effect upon these animals, and more especially upon their re
productive system, different                   conditions         of which     (as    Mr Darwin
has well shown) have much effect in inducing subsequent variations
in their descendants; but,                  as already said,       I     imagine      a   still more
potent cause of the greater variability of domesticated animals to
lie in their being deprived, through the agency of man, of the
opportunity  of allowing the revertive principle to come into opera
tion by intercrossing.   But     no part of my argument to dispute
                                            it   is
the power of variation within certain limits    and as, for the above
                                                                    ;

                                           280
 reasons,   I    admit   them to be greatest in domesticated species, I
 need   not dally over the instances given by Mr Darwin, however
 interesting    and suggestive they may be.                 I  shall merely observe,
 with regard to those facts which he adduces as instances of natural
 variation, in contradistinction to artificial or domesticated variation,
 that they are limited,         and consist (as it appears to me) entirely
of such minor modifications as               I   have already alluded to, as per
 mitted    more or less        in all     species     for the preservation       of    the
individual.       Seizing upon the variations (of which there is no want)
 which have given rise to disputes among naturalists as to whether
particular forms are mere varieties or true species, he thence infers
 that these are species in the course of transmutation.                    That some
 naturalists,     with   too    quick    a    perception      of differences,    should
attempt to make species           or sub-species         out of varieties, should not
prejudice the question ; the blunders of the few are frail ground
on which to rest a theory ; and if the concurrent opinion of the ma
jority  be taken, the number          of forms    as to which doubt may       fairly     be
entertained is comparatively few.                And this Mr Darwin, with               his
usual fairness, frankly admits.             " It   may be asked," says he,        " how
is it that varieties which        I have called       incipient species become ulti
mately converted into good and distinct                 species, which in most       cases
obviously differ from each other more than do the varieties of the
same species;" and he sets himself to account for this, but does not
dispute the fact.        He gives     no instance       of any wild plant or animal,
subject to no restriction           as   to    intermixture,     having within the
knowledge       of man deviated into            a well-established     constant form,
which     would be admitted as a species                 by naturalists.    He    refers
 to  Mr   Buckman's      experiments, as showing the extent of variation
capable of being assumed by plants                 ;  but, on the one hand,         these
 experiments may be classed as instances of artificial selection                  ;   and
on    the other,      I  hear    (I   have      no    personal    knowledge     on the
 subject)   that    there    is considerable         difference   of opinion among
botanists as to     their trustworthiness.           And   even although they were
trustworthy,      their result   is  merely     to   show   how various the modifi
cations are which take place under altered circumstances, a fact
which   I do   not deny.      A   writer in the " National Review " offers               to
supplement such instances by quoting from                  M. Roulin two naturally
modified breeds       of cattle   descended      from the cattle of the Pampas,
and now       found in the hottest           parts of South        America   ;   one of

                                              281
them called Pelones, and the other Calougas ; the former possess
ing a very scanty fine fur, and the latter without any hair at all,
and each peculiar to the district it inhabits, and either not trans
ferable, or with difficulty transferable, into any colder region.                                He
thinks that these would              be admitted as species        by naturalists.              Far
from it.      It    is merely a simple case of modification                      to suit altered
condition of life.          It    is exactly the same case in oxen as we see in
the Merino          and Australian           sheep   ;   but such a variation              is    not
what we desiderate.               Show us an animal between the ox and the
sheep, or rather a series of animals                     exhibiting the transitions              be
tween them.          But      Mr Darwin, in reply,            tells us, that we cannot
expect to trace these              new species       in their actual transit.              While
commencing their variation, we call them varieties                           ;    when they are
farther removed, we dispute which they are ; when they are com
plete, we call them species. He with some justice (but not entire
justice) remarks, that we are here, as compared with the great spaces
of time which        he requires        for the development of his new                    species,
merely at a single point of view, and at no one point can you expect
to see a passage taking place, because                    the assumption is that every
passage is gradual.             We   see the present species       ;       but we do not know
that    we either      see       its parent or its descendant.                    I   admit that,
under such premises, we cannot                 see   the passage       ;   but surely over the
whole surface of            the    earth,    and out of all the living                  creatures
swarming       upon     it,   we ought to detect some species whose parents
have not yet perished, and whose descendants have already appeared.
Mr Darwin would like to escape from this position — but he cannot.
He says " It should always be borne in mind what sort of interme
diate forms         must on        my theory         have formerly           existed.   I       have
found   difficult, when looking at any two species, to avoid picturing
        it
to myself forms directly intermediate between them.      But this    a                          is
wholly false view       ;     we should      always look for forms — intermediate
between      each species,        and   a   common but unknown                   progenitor" (p.
280).       Now this       is    merely confusing        the thing     ;     the process being
gradual, there must be some exactly and directly true half-way in
termediate form between the parent species and the descendant spe
cies, and   matters not to us that we know only one of these, nor
              it
does   it    matter that we know neither.                  What concerns               us is, that
there ought to be half-way steps between every form and something
else which   either now living, or which has lived, on the face of the
               is

                                                           282
earth, and       if    such do exist, we ought to find, —                          I do not say all, — but
certainly many, or at least some of these.                                    So far as regards the        pre
sent age,    Mr Darwin                 apologises for the absence of such intermediate
forms, by supposing migrations to have taken place over large contin
uous areas, and the links to have been lost in the intermediate districts
from unsuitableness of condition, or from geological                                      changes having
submerged certain districts, when, of course, the links existing                                           here
would be lost, and concludes a very specious and plausible argument
on this head            thus     :   — " Lastly,           looking        not to any one time, but           to
all time,        if    my theory be true, numberless                              intermediate     varieties,
linking most closely all the species of the                                 same group together, must
assuredly have               existed        ;    but the very process               of natural     selection
constantly tends to exterminate the parent forms and the interme
diate links, consequently evidence of their former existence could be
found only amongst fossil remains"   (pp. 177-9).   Now, so far as
these explanations are merely an answer to the question, Why we
do not find such intermediate passages in any one particular portion
of the    globed        they might be accepted as an apology for their                             absence ;
but when applied to the whole of                             it,   and to such myriads of creatures
as     inhabit        it,   it   seems           beyond all reasonable application                    of    the
doctrine of chances                   to accept        it       as a      sufficient   or even     probable
explanation.                The very            essence     of the        new theory     is   gradual      pas
sage, and slow descent by natural                                generation and inheritance — the
parent species and the incipient species both subsisting at the same
time, and the process of substitution being gradual and protracted.
Mr Darwin's            own map of divergence, and the whole of his reasoning
go to show how parent forms, and descendant and collateral forms,
may all subsist and be going on in different localities and climates
at the same time.                     It   will not therefore                do    to say that     the     new
varieties developed                  by natural selection
                                                                          " continually take      the place

rence of innumerable intermediate links everywhere throughout                                               na
ture.      But supposing that, for the                             sake    of argument, we allow this
apology for the moment, at least     can only apply to the present age
                                                           it                                                of
nature, or to some one definite period — itcannot also apply to past ages,
or to any two or more consecutive ages                               ;    and     Mr Darwin,     as we have
just   seen, admits that
                                        "       evidence    of their former existence should                 be
found amongst fossil remains" (p. 280).   Are fossil remains of                                          these
then found   Is there any evidence in support of this to be drawn
                 ?                                                                                       from

                                                  283
fossil remains?  Mr Darwin himself shall answer the question. "Why,
then," says he,  " is not every geological formation and every stratum
full of such intermediate links ? Geology assuredly does not reveal
any such finely graduated organic chain ; and this perhaps                                       is the
most obvious and gravest objection which                           can be urged against my
theory" (p. 280). And a very grave objection it certainly   that                               is,
in the only two quarters where actual proof of facts (which must
exist  the theory be true) can be sought for, and where,
        if                                                priori,                          A
they might reasonably have been expected to be found, namely, the
present and the past, they should be absent, or at least undiscoverable.
     Those who are new to the subject may naturally be puzzled                                         to
guess how he escapes from such                          an embarrassing dilemma.                     The
solution     is   abundantly simple.
                                                  " The        explanation,"        says   he,   "   lies,
as
 I      believe, in the extreme imperfection                      of the geological record."
Now   I    believe no one will dispute as an abstract proposition                                     the
extreme imperfection          of the geological record. But    cannot admit     I
that its imperfection          of that character or degree that will entitle
Mr Darwin to plead          it is         He dwells on the poorness
                                    in his favour.
of our palaeontological collections — the great spaces of time wholly,
or nearly wholly, unrepresented in them — the extreme rarity of
terrestrial       animals in the deposits — the destruction of the soft parts
of most animals, and the crushed                       state    of many others.       I     shall not
follow him into his details on these points.                          All   that he says on tho
subject may be very         true —         is   very   true — but will      avail him nought            if,
in any portion of the geological records, we can find any one succes
sion of strata of moderate depth which may be fairly held to have been
deposited unintermittently,                 and in which we find          liberal representa
                                                                            a
tion of the animals of any one class.                          And such records many of the
enormous deposits of limestone rocks beyond doubt are — their whole
phenomena indicating                an   uninterrupted             period of tranquil          deposi
tion, extending over ages beyond our numbering, and the strata them
selves bearing        in their      bosoms an excellent report on the molluscous
animals of the period.*             I       have quite sufficient to test             Mr Darwin's
     * Mr Darwin      himself remarks, that            " two    palaeontologists,    whose opinion      is
worthy of much deference, namely, Bronn and Woodward, have concluded that
the average duration of each formation is twice or thrice as long as the average
duration of specific forms" (p. 293). This opinion may be well-founded or
not—  Iimagine it is; but       difficult of application to the point at issue, on
                                 it   is
account of the real or possible intermissions which may have taken place in
these formations.

                                             284
apology,    if   I   have, first, a lengthened
                                         and uninterrupted period of
deposit, and next, the marine fossils in any one class of that period
well represented in it.            If I     am told that such representation in
fossils is not only imperfect as             regards terrestrial and soft animals,
but also as regards molluscous shell-bearing                      animals,       I    shall   go to
issue upon the point, and,              I
                                       think, prove that we ought to have,
and do      have,     as good a    knowledge of what were the species of
shell-bearing        molluscs    which       lived     in the     seas    which         produced
many of our fossil deposits, as we have of those living at the bottom
of our own seas at the present day ; and no one will say that that
knowledge is very imperfect.    A moment's consideration of the re
spective means we have of knowing                    each   will show the            probability
of this.    The only means         we       have of knowing          the species           in   our
present seas is by dredging,            or by the still more imperfect                    system
of picking      up those shells which may be cast ashore.                   Now,        dredging
is a mere scraping       of a little morsel of the bottom of the                 sea here and
there ; and yet, by adding up the accumulated observations made in
various quarters, we have arrived at a most accurate knowledge of                               the
inhabitants      of those      seas which have been examined.                        Some shells
remain rare, others unique, but this does not prevent us believing in
the accuracy of our knowledge.               Compare this scraping here and there
in the dark, with the deliberate open-day examinations which                              we can
make of most geological strata ; miles upon miles of coast                               cliffs —
transverse sections in ravines          — and        piece by piece manipulation in
quarries and mines — and           I   think it must        be admitted, that so far            as
that class of animals           which    can be preserved in deposits                    goes, it
cannot be said that our knowledge of them in continuous strata                                   is
imperfect   ;    and as, therefore, we should there find the intervening
links   between      older and younger        species    if     they existed, and yet           do
not find them, the inevitable inference is that they do not exist.
    Untenable        as they appear to be,            however, these arguments                  or
apologies have satisfied         Mr Darwin,          and his system of natural varia
tion being once admitted or held as proved, the remaining                                steps to
natural selection are easy.            The most essential, and             one as to which
I   do not suppose there can be any difference                   of opinion, is         founded
on what he calls the struggle for existence.                     That such a            struggle
is constantly going on is familiar to us all                ;   but, as   I neither dispute
its existence nor its bearing (always                 supposing      his other          premises
to be correct),      I shall   not make any remarks upon                  it,   or on    some   of

                                                    285
the other minor branches of his argument, such as sexual selection,
divergence of character, the effects of use and disuse, acclimatization,
laws of variation and geographical distribution
                                                                         (on all of which, had
I    space   and time,   I see       much which              I    feel disposed to modify or
controvert).      These must either                     stand or fall with the other parts
of his theory already noticed, or do not come into direct collision
with the more vital objections which  have to it.           I
                                                  There is, how
ever, one topic still remaining which                       I    should not wish        so   to pass
over — viz.,    the effect of physical condition in influencing form origi
nally, and affecting it afterwards.                        On this point   Mr Darwin          and    I
are widely at issue.   He believes                       that it has had little or no in
fluence upon them.              " Neither           the similarity nor the dissimilarity
of the inhabitants of various regions," says he, " can be accounted
for by their climatal and other physical conditions." To me, again,
it appears that the effect of physical condition is one of the most
powerful agents in determining the form of organic creatures ; and
I    must be pardoned           if   I    devote a few sentences              to this part of
the subject, because        I   look upon it               as    of the greatest importance,
and ranking in the         category and scarcely less powerful as
                                same
a proof of design on the part of the Creator than that drawn from
the anatomical        structure          of the animal frame.               Some of the in
stances bearing on      given by Mr Darwin, are certainly difficult
                          it,
of explanation    but then, how little do we know of what the real
                  ;
essence of physical condition      Look at North America, which in
                                              is
                                               !
temperature      and many other respects has a physical                            condition not
greatly differing from our own.    See how the inappreciable diffe
rence in physical condition  telling upon the white race there; the
                                         is
women in youth retaining the normal beauty of their race, but becom
ing prematurely old the men becoming thin and sallow

decaying more rapidly    the average duration of life diminishing, —
                                ;
besides various other tokens of unsuitableness of climate.    We all
know very well that Bangalore, Darjeeling,                          and other hill stations in
India, are mere expedients, better than nothing, but that the only real
remedy for the sick Englishman     home, — home to the native physical
                                                   is
condition.    Seeing, then, that the essential part of physical condition
is   something of so subtle and undetectable     nature,        fair esti
                                                                   a          is   it   a
mate of its effect to say, as        Mr Darwin             does, that certain large tracts          in
South Africa and South America are placed under like physical con
ditions; therefore, there

Archipelago, under similar physical                           conditions     with arid South
Africa ? Even the unassisted eye can                          see that    this is not so.           But
Mr Darwin               chooses a test by which            I am willing    to abide (and which
I     had indeed selected for the same purpose in a paper                         I   read on the
Disguises          of Nature        at the meeting of the British Association                          at
Aberdeen).    It is the blind cave animals found in the limestone
caverns both in Europe and America. Mr Darwin says, " It is diffi
cult to imagine conditions of life more similar than deep limestone
caverns under a nearly similar climate ; so that on the common view
of the blind animals having                    been   separately created for the Ameri
can and European                caverns, close similarity in the organisation and
affinities might have been expected                    ;    but as Schiodte and others have
remarked, this is not the case, and the cave insects* of the two conti
nents are not more closely allied                     than might have been anticipated
from the general               resemblance of the other inhabitants                     of North
America and Europe."      Now Mr Darwin, in this passage, has quite
mistaken the gist of Schiodte's remark, and consequently misapplied
it.     It   is quite correct for him              to say that     we should          expect       close
similarity in the           caves   in question, but it is incorrect to say that
"     this is not the case;"          for the similarity in some is marvellously
close    ; it is also incorrect to say that Schiodte and others have
             and
remarked that " this is not the case." As to the " others," indeed, I
cannot speak, for           I do not know to whom he refers,               and   I do   not know
any other author than Schiodte except                        Miiller, who has written,         from
original observation, otherwise than incidentally upon the                         subject     ;    but
neither he nor Schiodte make any such remark.                            I presume the others
alluded to by           Mr Darwin          are those who have followed Schiodte, and
adopted or quoted his remark.                      The remark which he makes,             and      Mr
Darwin has misapplied,               is,   "   that the cave insects of the two continents
are not more closely allied than might have been anticipated from
the general resemblance of the other inhabitants of North America
and Europe         ;"   — a   loose general remark, which,            like an    ancient oracle,
        Although Mr Darwin here uses the observations of Schiodte upon blind
    *
insects as an illustration,
                          his remarks (as he himself has had the kindness to
inform me) are not meant to be confined to them, but also to be applied to the
whole of the animals found in caves.  But as his theory, if true, should meet
every case,  clear flaw in even one would be fatal to the whole, and would
               a                                                                         I
have tested    with these insects, whether they had been referred to
                   it                                                      Mr                by
Darwin himself or not.

                                                287
may be read either way.                Darwin    (a disbeliever in the effects             of physi
cal condition), we see, reads it that the resemblance is slight                       ;    Schiodte,
on the other hand, who appears to be a thorough believer                         in its         effects,
sees nothing more            in the marvellous resemblance than might                             have
been anticipated.             I say that      he seems to be a thorough believer, be
cause he goes so far as to separate those insects which are found in
stalactite caves from those in other caverns, maintaining (and believe                     I
with justice) that the two kinds were respectively confined to these
classes   of   caves.        But let   us see how the fact actually               stands as to
resemblance.            I   shall take the eyeless Anophthalmi.                  It       is not the
only one which would suit me, but it is the most striking.                                Although
belonging to the family of Trechidae, it possesses                        very marked and
distinctive     characters,         besides    the want of eyes.               Nothing          comes
very close to it.            It   stands out and apart, and can be distinguished
in   a moment.          It   is found nowhere but deep in limestone caverns                              ;
but this       generic form          is repeated        by different species              in almost
every cave which has been examined.                        In the caves of Adelsberg
in Carn io la, the two             species    Anophthalmus Schmidtii and Anoph-
thalmus     Bilimekii are found.              Anophthalmus hirtus and Anophthal
mus  Hacquetii, in the Grotto of Krimberg in Oberiggdorf ; Anoph
thalmus Scopolii, in the Grotto of Setz in Corinthia ; Anophthalmus
Dorice in the Grotto des Ours in Eastern Liguria.                              Anophthalmus
Ghiliani       has been           taken in a cavern at Monte Viso, near the
French frontiers.            Anophthalmus         Gallicus and Anophthalmus Pan-
dellei in the Grotto of Betharram in the low Pyrenees                      ;   Anophthalmus
Crypticola and Anophthalmus Orcinus, in the Grotto of Gargas, high
Pyrenees;    Anophthalmus Raymondi in two caves near Marseilles ;
and    Anophthalmus Tellkampfii in the Mammoth Caves of Ken
tucky, all confined to their own caves, or districts of caves, and found
nowhere else.           Now, how is this \ When              I   first   became acquainted
with   Mr Darwin's            theory, it was from the perusal of the short no
ticeof its main elements, published about eighteen months ago in the
Linnean Society's Proceedings ; and the imperfect account of it there
given induced       me       to suppose       that he held that every species                      was
descended from the one nearest to                it,   and hence, to infer that he would
hold that      all the Anophthalmi were connected                  one   with the other by
direct descent, and         I     imagined that the fact         of closely allied             species
being found in the caves of Kentucky and the caves of Carniola,
without any means of communication with each other, must be fatal

                                                   288
 to his theory         ;    but now that       I   understand         it more correctly,          I   see
 that this difficulty can be got over by referring the two (as diverg
 ing descendants) to some common ancestor, not eyeless, who may
 have     lived where the Atlantic                    Ocean now           rolls, at     some    distant
period when America and Europe were united.                                     Therefore, the fact
 has not the significance                I  Trechus may have wan
                                             supposed.          A
dered into each of these caves, and by process of natural selection,
after frequent variation into all manner of other forms, which being
unsuitable have not been preserved, have at last hit upon the form of
an Anophthalmia.                 But    if   he thus saves his            theory, what becomes
of his disbelief in the          effects     of physical condition          1     If it has no effect,
why have they all turned into Anophthalmi ? The only explication
which         I
       can imagine for him                      is,
                                that in every cave Trechi entered,
and in each and       all threw off descendants of all different kinds, as
well     as   Anophthalmi, none of which were suited to the physical con
dition except the Anophthalmi, and therefore                               the latter alone sur
vived.            Whether this     is   a more philosophical                explanation        of their
presence than the view that their production was influenced by the
physical condition of the place,              I       leave to the reader to determine.
 I      shall only follow          Mr Darwin for few lines farther in his re
                                                            a
marks on this              subject.  He says, " On my view, we must suppose
that     American animals               having        ordinary       power of vision            slowly
migrated           by successive generations                from the outer world into the
deeper and deeper recesses of the Kentucky Caves, as did European
animals into the caves of Europe.                        We have had              some evidence       of
this gradation of habit                 for, as Schiodte remarks,                    animals not far
                                                                                 '
                                  ;
remote from ordinary forms                     prepare the transition                 from     light to
darkness.      Next follow those that are constructed for twilight and                          ;
last of all, those destined for total darkness.'
                                                 " If Darwin reads this
as meaning that there             is    a gradation         in form        and     affinity between
the animals which are found at the entrance, and those found in total
darkness, he         is    in error —there      is    none.     It   is   the gradation in adap
tation        to darkness that          Schiodte       is    speaking       of.      Those      at the
entrance, with small eyes,                   belong to the Pristonychi, large black
beetles found in cellars and such places.  The Anophthalmi belong
to   the small Trechidce, of which there are none specially found at
the entrance.
I      might take other exception                  to the facts adduced by                   Mr Dar
win, or to his application              of them.            For instance,            he says    of the

                                             289
woodpecker,
                 "   Can a more striking instance of adaptation be given
than that of a woodpecker for climbing trees, and for seizing insects
in the chinks of the bark ? Yet in North America there are wood
peckers which feed largely on fruit, and others with elongated wings
which    chase     insects     on   the wing      ;    and on the plains of     La Plata,
where not a tree grows, there is a woodpecker, which in every essen
tial part of its organisation, even in its colouring, in the harsh tone
of its voice, and undulatory flight, told me plainly of its close blood
relationship to our common species ; yet it is a woodpecker which
never climbs a tree." (P. 184.)               I
                                have selected this instance both as
a statement bearing upon the effect of physical condition which appears
to me to require correction, and also as an illustration of the neces
sity, in such an investigation as this, of testing every fact before ad
mitting it. This is          a statement made upon          Mr Darwin's own      personal
observation, confirming that of Azara.                     I do   not believe there is a
more upright and truthful man in Britain than                      Mr Darwin,     and yet
we look at things           from such an opposite point of view, that                 I    not
only do not see what he avers in the above                     instance, but see quite
the reverse.         The woodpeckers he refers to are Colaptes (the                        La
Plata species         is,
                       I      believe, the Colaptes          campestris)   ;   and so far
from appearing to me to possess every essential point of the organi
sation of   a   woodpecker, they are one of the very instances which                       I
have been in use to give as showing the alteration                      of structure in     a
type consequent             upon different     physical      conditions    of life.       The
Colaptes, although            allied to the woodpeckers, differ from them in
mode     of life, inasmuch          as they feed upon ants         ;   and, in structure,
inasmuch as not requiring that most essential part of the organisa
tion of a woodpecker (its peculiar hammering bill and strong tail)
they do not possess them, while they retain the peculiar tongue and
accessory      muscles still necessary for securing their insect food.
  The strongest points in favour of the general results come to                             by
Mr Darwin, are a class of facts which can scarcely be said to bear
distinctively    on    his theory more than upon various other theories
already promulgated, and more or less adopted.                      One of these      is   the
fact, that all animals, and    all plants, throughout all time and space,
should    be    related to each other in group subordinate to group.
Another not       less formidable fact       is       the existence of the same homo-
logical parts in different animals, sometimes aborted, and sometimes
largely developed.

                                                      200
     These are two of the great difficulties                        attendant on the view of
the independent creation of each                        individual       species.        But      although
they were fatal to that view, it does                         not fall to      Mr Darwin            as sole
(Edipus      to solve them. The doctrine of progressive development                                          (to
which     Mr   Darwin's view has many points of affinity), or any                                       doc
trine in which development of                        species ex ovo plays a part, will ex
plain     these    facts    equally         well.      The germ must bear                    some trace
of its origin      ;   and        hence we should,               under       such       a theory,           see
not only the relationships                  and homologies referred                to, but also          cer
tain appearances which                  bear indications          of reversion to type,                 such
as the appearance of the stripes               of the tiger in the young                            of   the
lion, &c.         These,  I      own, are difficult to be explained   do                (I         not say
unexplainable)         under the theory of independent creation, but natural,
and to be expected, under any theory of development ex ovo, — not
more under         Mr Darwin's              than     under any other.                The      distinctive
character of       Mr Darwin's              theory     is   not development             ex ovo     ;    that
is   the theory of Oken,            of Agassiz,             of the author of the             "    Vestiges
of Creation       ;"   nay,     I   may go farther               back.       It    is   the theory           of
Bonnet and of Priestley, who, however involved                                 their ideas          might
be, still held
               " that all the germs of future plants,
                                                      organical bodies
of all kinds, and the reproducible parts of them, were really con
tained in the first germ."                   Darwin's,        on the other hand,             is    gradual
transition     by slow and scarcely perceptible                          degrees    ;       and, so      far
as that specialty is concerned,                   it   has no more bearing than Oken's
upon the classes            of facts         above     referred     to   ;    and the distinction
between them         is    not confined merely to the modus operandi of the
process    of development          ;    it   is     much more material               than        that   ;    it
embraces       the     question         of final       causes,     and       bears      on    the very
existence of design in the organic creation. The views of Agassiz
and Oken do not challenge the fact of design existing in the
wonderful      adaptations of structure                     to purpose which we see every
where     displayedin living organisms.  Their theory allowed                                                ns
to retain our belief in the great argument on which the whole                                                of
natural theology           is   based   ;    nay, even to place          it   on higher grounds,
as the intelligence         which performs its work                    by   the intervention of              a
law or machinery designed by itself, and operating on                                   a   great scale,
is superior to the intelligence which executes each individual detail
directly and without such intervention.                           If
                                                 furnished no expla    it
nation of the causes of adaptation                      of structure         to habit, at least              it

                                                   291
did not prevent       us from           holding,        if    we chose,     that, by some unex
plained     means, the germ of life was supplied with such a principle
of growth        as, under certain                physical         conditions,        developed itself
into   these adaptations.               We could              hold design still to be there,
although     its direct means of operation was shrouded from our view
in the laboratory of Nature.                      But    Mr Darwin's          theory is not only
opposed, but absolutely inconsistent with any such idea.                                   The talons
of the eagle have not been framed as they are by design, to seize
and hold its prey.  The wonderfully constructed hand of the mole
was not a designed              gift from the Creator, but merely                       some    variety
of the hedgehog, which had broadest paws, and, being most adapted
to digging, adopted the mode of life of the mole.                                     The implement
was not made for the animal,                       but the animal            for the implement.
The assumption            is,   that   it   is   not alone beneficial variations                   which
Nature makes.             She      makes them in any and every way                             ;    some
being profitable,         others the reverse                 ;    and the reason why we find
all that have ever          been                   of the earth beneficially
                                       seen on the face
endowed (that       is,   provided with structures which, to the unillumi-
nated eye, indicate              design)         is,   that      only    those variations          which
happen to have been so endowed have been                                  preserved, —the           blots
which Nature made having become extinct through the preponderance
of the beneficially endowed.                     To    use    Mr Darwin's         words,
                                                                                              " Natural
selection   is   daily and hourly scrutinizing throughout the world every
variation, even the slightest               ;    rejecting that which            is   bad, preserving
and    adding up all that              is       good, silently and insensibly         working
whenever      and wherever             opportunity               offers at the improvement of
each organic being, in relation to its organic and inorganic                                       condi
tions of life."     (P. 84.)            Now,     I      cannot believe in such doctrine.
When   I    look at the anatomy of any part of the body, and see exactly
the    same mechanism              and contrivances                 had recourse to which              a
mechanician       would         have used to secure                  similar results,     I     cannot
bring myself to believe that                 it   is    fortuitous, or other than evidence
of the presence of direct design.                       A     belief in such design        I     should
be most loath to surrender,                 and   I      am therefore glad that, on other
grounds, viz. the legitimate result of the argument already discussed,
I have come to be of opinion that Mr Darwin's theory         unsound,                    is
and that  I      am to be spared any collision                          between       my inclinations
and my convictions.

1. On the Utmost  Horizontal Distance which can be Spanned
   by a Chain of a given Material.  By Edward Sang, Esq.
   The method of investigation followed in this paper for finding the
                                                                                                    all

                                                                                                    at
having   a   common vertex, and to take, in each of them, that                              point
which the tension           is   fixed.       The curve passing through all                 of   these
points has for its equation —
                        z=s        (1   — sin     i),
                                                                    i

             is   the tension,          z     the vertical, and x the horizontal ordi
nate.

     This curve,     a correct figure             of which    was     exhibited,           has   its
extreme      horizontal       limit when 0=33°,               32',         03",    from     which
the    utmost   horizontal         span       of a uniform     chain        is found        to be
» x 1325 4838, the height or versed sine being x 447 5659, and
the length of the chain s x 1-667 1130 when s is taken equal to
the modulus of strength of the material.
     This, however,     does not show the absolute            limit    ;    for, by reducing
the thickness of the chain at each point                  till it be just able             to bear
the strain to which it is subjected, we shall                   remove all redundant
weight.   The form which such a chain assumes may                                 be called the
catenary of regulated strength.

two vertical    asymptotes placed at the distance                    <rs   from each other,
which distance     is   thus the absolute extreme horizontal span that can
be reached by    a   chain having         s   for its modulus of strength.             A correct
drawing of this curve         was also shown.
2. On the Climate    of Edinburgh for Fifty-six Years, from 1795
     to 1850, deduced principally from Mr Adie's Observations                                     ;
     with an Account of other and earlier Registers. — On the
     Climate of Dunfermline, from the Registers of the late
     Rev. Henry Fergus. By Professor        D. Forbes.     J.
     The paper on the Climate of Edinburgh                      is    divided       into    seven
sections.
    The First Section includes an account of the earliest records of the
thermometer at Edinburgh which are to bo found in the Edinburgh
Medical Essays.   They date from 1731.   They were made with a
thermometer      having an arbitrary scale, which                is   described in          Mar-
tine's Essays, and they appear to have been                          recorded with much
     VOL. IV.                                                                      2   R

                                      294
care  ;  but they cease     in   1736.    The next series, printed in the
Essays of      the  Philosophical Society of Edinburgh, commence in
1764, and are continued till 1770.          A parallel Register was begun
at Hawkhill, near Edinburgh, and continued till 1776, and probably
later.    Professor Playfair's Observations (printed in the Royal Society
Transactions) only supply one year (1794) of the interval which
elapses before we enter upon the elaborate Register kept by the late
Mr Adie      and his family.
   Second Section.     Mr Adie's    Observations were continued from 1795
to the middle of 1805.            They then   ceased   until the year 1821,
after which they were steadily pursued, with the assistance of differ
ent members of his family, until 1850.              In  order to supply      the
missing years 1805-1820, the author was fortunate enough to recover
(through the kind agency of Mr David Laing) a Register kept at
Dunfermline for above thirty years by the late Rev. Henry Fergus,
whose son,      the Rev.   John Fergus, kindly lent the Register, and
allowed him to make use of it.*
    The history of this Register and its results are given in a short
separate paper.        The climate of Dunfermline has a very close
approximation      in character to that of Edinburgh, not only as regards
the mean annual temperature, but also as to the distribution of heat
at different seasons.
    By availing himself of the Dunfermline Register for the years
 1805-1820, and using simple reductions, the author is enabled to
estimate with considerable confidence the mean temperature of each
year, and each month of each year, from 1795 to 1850, at Edin
burgh.
    The Third Section contains the monthly means of the entire            series
 in a tabular form.      The highest mean annual temperature (49'"' 60)
 was   that of 1846, the lowest (44°-44) that of 1799.           The mean of
the    whole   period, deduced from       nearly 35,000 observations, was
 460,77,    or, excluding     the Dunfermline observations,       460-88.     A
series of Tables is also given, classifying the seasons according to
the annual range, and by the temperature of the hottest and coldest
 months respectively.      The hottest month was      July 1808,   the coldest,
   * Mr Fergus has, since this paper was read, presented this interesting MS
register to the Koyal Society.

                                            295
January 1814. In 56 years June               was 5 times the hottest month,                   July
36 times, and August 15 times.    November was twice the coldest
month of winter, March 1J times, February 10J times,* December
15, and January 27 times.             A     classification of the years according
to the earliness        or lateness of the greatest              summer heat is next
given.
     Section   Fourth contains      the monthly          and annual    fall of rain from
Mr Adie's        observations, viz. from        1795       to 1804, and from 1822
to 1849.        The             fall is exactly 25 inches, ranging from
                       mean annual
36-60 in 1795 to 15-27 in 1826. The distribution of rain in the
different seasons is then given, being greatest in summer and least in
spring.
     In    Section   Fifth, the author has considered whether any law can
be traced in the succession      of the      seasons throughout            the period em
braced by these observations.  But beyond the fact, that hot and
cold years usually occur in groups of from 7 to 12 years' duration,
nothing definite can be deduced from the Tables.     Conformably
with this remark, there       is a slight appearance of maximum                      tempera
tures      occurring   about the years 1809,               1829, and 1849; and of
minima in 1799, 1819, 1839.
     Section Sixth is on the form of the Annual Curve of Temperature
and its Fluctuations.        Adopting the usual mode of notation by the
sines of arcs, and making the given date reckoned from January 0
(the extent of the year being denoted by 360°), we have for the
temperature, y, of the given epoch x.
         y = 46°-88-10°-98 sin       (a:   + 68° 28')      +   0°-96 sin   (2   x   +    22°).
The average temperature of each day of the year being taken for the
40 years of Mr Adie's observations, and being projected in   curve,                  a
                                                                                              It
                                               is by
is well represented on the whole                       the preceding formula.                      is
plain, however, that even 40 years                     by much too short        a   period to
give with accuracy the mean temperature                     of any given day.                 The
following Table contains       the mean temperature                 of each day of the
year, founded on        Mr Adie's    observations.

    In this section are farther considered the inflections or       "  periodic
anomalies"     of the annual curve.      When the normal curve deduced
from the preceding        equation   (p. 295) is projected and compared
with that which the projection        of  the daily temperatures produces,
the latter   is found to fluctuate considerably,     and to pass   in an irre
gular manner, sometimes above, and sometimes below, the geo
metric curve, which, however, fairly represents the totality of the
observations.
    We find, however, that there are deviations from the average or
normal curve, which occur at certain seasons, and which do not appear

                                        297
to be entirely accidental. Several of these may be traced, for example,
in each of the four decennial periods into which the series may be
divided.     These are called "    periodic   anomalies ;" and their occur
rence has previously      been   announced by De Humboldt, Arago,                M.
Quetelet, and others.
    The most conspicuous of          these   anomalies    occur in December,
January,     and February.         An irregular elevation of temperature
usually    happens in the two middle weeks of December,                   followed
early in January by an       accession    of cold, which accelerates the      epoch
of lowest temperature by at least a week, when we compare it with
the geometric curve.       This is again succeeded, in the latter part of
January     and beginning      of February, by a period of comparative
warmth.       These anomalies seem to obtain at least over a great part
of the west of Europe.
    The author gives the name of " fluctuation" to the variation in
the temperature of a given day of the year, from one year to
another, arising from causes        purely local and temporary, or, as we
may call them, accidental.         By applying the calculus of probability
to the forty years' observations, we might              assign   the    " probable
uncertainty" in the determination of the temperature                 of any given
day.     The author has, however, confined himself                to   noting    tho
highest    and lowest mean temperature            on  a given     day which     has
occurred during 40 years.            These differences     are sometimes very
large.     But they vary from      one    season    to another   according     to a
well-marked     law.    The " fluctuation"      is greatest in January, when
it amounts to 28° or 29°, and least in July, when it               is only 16° or
 17°.     On the contrary,      the diurnal       range  or difference      of the
 maximum and minimum reading              in 24 hours is least in December
 (9°-5), and greatest in    June (18°).
    Section Seventh. — The author          concludes the paper with a com
parison between the meteorological character of the seasons for fifty-
six years, and the price of oats in the Edinburgh                market    for the
same period, which was        obligingly furnished     to him by      Mr  Lawson.
He has     been quite    unable   to   trace any connection       between these
classes   of facts, and he recommends the subject to the consideration
of those who are now occupied in considering the bearings of meteor
ology upon agriculture.         When the     seasons from 1795 to        1850 are
arranged according to the price of oats, their order bears no intelli
gible   relation   to one or any   of   the  previous   classifications of those

                                         298
years according      to    warmth,    moisture,     or earliness.      Thus much
appears from the inquiry, that the attempt of               Sir William Herschel
to deduce the climatic influence of the solar spots from the market
price of wheat, rests on a fallacious         basis.      It  is only fair to add,
that   Sir William    Herschel employed it with a reservation as to its
reliability  as a criterion    of the temperature.
3. On      the Mountain Limestone               and      Lower Carboniferous
    Rocks of the Fifeshire Coast.             By the Rev. Thomas Brown.
    Communicated by Dr Allman.
    The writer stated that this paper           was   the result of observations
made while staying at the sea-coast         for a few weeks in autumn.         Near
Ardross a    bed   of limestone had       been discovered,       with peculiar fos
sils, which promised geological results of some              interest.    To deter
mine its stratigraphical       position, it was necessary to reduce to order
a portion of the coast, hitherto held to be in a state of hopeless con
fusion.     This led    to   fuller inquiries, till the rocks underlying the
coal-field had been      examined from Burntisland to St Andrews.
    Section   I. A   general description of the rocks was given, as seen
along the shore, accompanied by a section in which they were laid
down to scale.
    Section  II.   Two     classes   of trap-rocks    were referred      to, viz. —
1 .  The contemporaneous and interstratifled           ;  2. The intrusive   —this
term being designedly used as expressing no opinion in regard to
their origin, merely that the surrounding strata had been fractured,
and through these fractures the traps in question had come into their
present position.        No proof had presented itself that            these intru
sive traps had exerted an upheaving agency, except perhaps at one
point, and there only to a small extent.
    Section  III.   The Mountain Limestone             was described     as consist
ing of three parts, viz. —
    1.  The six upper limestones,         A  to  F.     These, with their inter
calated strata, immediately        underlie the coal-fields.        They   are ma
rine, and to them the term Mountain Limestone has usually                      been
restricted.     Their fossils      were described. — Of crustaceans,          there
were one species of Trilobite, one of Eurypterus, one of Gampsonyx,
(a genus not hitherto found in Britain), and two of Dithyrocaris,
both, it is believed, new. Of fish, besides Rhyzodus, Holoptychius, &c.

                                       299
there were two new species, a Cochliodus and a Ctenacanthus.                  The
plates also of a tuberculated fish, belonging either to Pterichthys or
some allied genus, were exhibited,        proving that this great class had
passed far up into the carboniferous system.
    2. Estuarine strata, between       F and L.       These comprise the well-
known      Burntisland    limestones,    corresponding       with  beds   west of
Pittenweem.
    One remarkable jaw of a pycnodont           fish was exhibited from this
part of the series near Kilwinning.          Only one example of this class
of fish-remains had previously occurred in the whole Palaeozoic sys
tem — a small jaw found near Leeds.
    3. The limestone      L,  the line of Lower Encrinites.           This occurs
east   of Pittenweem,    at  Crail and St Andrews.          The fossils were de
scribed similar as a whole to those of the beds A F.
   Forty    species of fossil  shells occurring      in  these   rocks were enu
merated, only twelve of which are given            in Professor Nicol's list of
Scottish fossils.    Among those here added, were Sanguinolites tri-
costatus, Chemnitzia gracilis, Murchisonia trilineata, &c. &c.
    Section   IV.   Lower Carboniferous.         This great underlying series
was described in its leading features, especially — 1. The Myalina
beds —limestones composed of a single bivalve allied to Unio.                    2.
 The deep-sea character of the fossils found at different levels, spe
cies   of Orthoceras, Natica, Lingula, &c.            3.  A   limestone   charged
with great abundance of a new annelid, a            species   of Spirorbis,  beau
tifully curved in    a serpentine form.
    Section    V.  Results.      The two groups.
    The writer explained that he had been led to deviate from the
 usually received classification of these rocks.              Taking the upper
portion of what Mr Maclaren terms the calciferous sandstones down
as  far   as the bed   L,   and adding these to the upper zone, usually
called the Mountain Limestone,           two well-marked        groups would be
formed, and a well-defined line of division obtained.
    1.   The Mountain Limestone.           The bed      L,  containing the same
fossils with the six upper limestones, must (notwithstanding                the in
tervening     Estuarine    beds)   be classed   along with them, and forms
the base line of the upper group.           The whole strata, from A to L,
are approximately about         1 000 feet in thickness.      The limit upwards
was not examined.          The fossils all belong to the Mountain Lime
stone, and are extremely        characteristic.

                                       300
    2. The underlying group, the LowerCarboniferous,             is characterised
 by — 1. The great Myalina          beds.    2. The relative       abundance    of
 Cyclopteris    ; the Sphenopteris being the specially characteristic plant
 of the upper group.         3. The circumstance that the carboniferous
 fauna occurs only in an incipient state.          The few species of Ortho-
ceras, Aviculo-pecten,       &c., which    do occur, are    of  a carboniferous
character,    and prove the presence        of deep-sea     conditions ; but all
that specially marks the Mountain Limestone fauna (the Encrinites,
 Corals, Brachiopods) are either absent, or occur very scantily.
    It  would thus appear, that in this great series, which exhibits
 with singular clearness the development of the carboniferous              epoch,
the bed     L  marks the point of time when the Mountain Limestone
fauna in its full strength came into view, while the lower carboni
ferous shows the same fauna in an incipient            state.   The latter may
be studied with singular advantage on these shores, especially from
Fife Ness to beyond Kingbarns.

1. On an Apprehended            Depreciation    of Money, arising from
   New Supplies of Gold.          By Patrick James Stirling, F.R.S.E.
    The annual production of gold, in Europe, America, and Northern
Asia, at the beginning of the present century, which was estimated
by Baron Humboldt in round numbers at something over two and a
half millions sterling, continued at about the same rate until additions
began to be received from the renewed working of the Russian mines.
These additions, which, for the period intervening between 1810
and 1822, are estimated by         M. Michel Chevalier     not to have     ex
ceeded    in all one million  and   a  half, gradually increased, until in
1847 they amounted       to  upwards of four millions per annum.
   vol. iv.                                                      2 s

                                              302
       In  the end of 1847,           auriferous   deposits   of unequalled     richness
    were discovered in California.            In the succeeding year, about             one
    million was received from this new source.               Next year, the       supply
   from the same source           increased to four millions ; in 1850, to         twelve
   millions  ;    and in 1857, to fifteen and a half millions sterling.
      In February        1851, rich gold-fields were discovered in the territory
   of New South Wales           ;   and in the August following still richer,          and
   apparently inexhaustible,           deposits   were found      in the Province          of
   Victoria.       In   1857,      the annual     produce of that province           alone
   amounted to nearly eleven millions.
      Thus, the total annual supply of gold, which at the beginning of
   the century, and for several years afterwards, did not much exceed
   two and a half millions, has now come to average about thirty-seven
   millions sterling.
      The entire stock of gold in Europe and America, which                   was esti
  mated at the beginning of this century at 354 millions                  sterling,       is
  supposed      in 1848 to have amounted to about 560 millions.             America,
  in the 356 years which intervened between                  the memorable voyage
  of Columbus and the first discovery of gold               on the Sacramento, had
 furnished of this quantity about 400 millions.                  In the twelve     years
 from 1848 to 1860, the additions made to the stock amount to                          no
 less a sum (assuming the rate             of yield of 1858 to have been             con
tinued in 1859) than 280 millions, — equal to one-half of the                        pre
 viously existing stock.            In other words, one year's supply at present
 is nearly equal to one-tenth           of the entire American supply for         three
 centuries and a half.
     When the produce of the Russian mines had roached four                   millions
per annum, the late Sir R. Peel expressed an apprehension                      that    so
unusual a supply might create an action on general prices                   ;   and it
is    not to be wondered at that                the vastly    increased supplies       of
the last twelve years should have given rise to inquiry and                        con
troversy.
     In France,     the question      of probable depreciation       was  felt to     be
more urgent and pressing than with us, from the circumstance                        that
the Government of that country has persisted, in defiance of all                 sound
principle,     in maintaining a double standard of money, which                we had
long before got rid of.            The silver coins of France, as had been pre
dicted by M. Chevalier, began soon to disappear, and have since
been exported,        it is believed,    to the amount of not less than sixty

                                         303
  millions sterling, equal to one-half of what         was supposed      to be the
 entire French metallic circulation.
     With us the question was, whether the new and greatly enlarged
 supplies of that metal, which since 1816 has formed the sole standard
 of our money — the universal medium of exchange, the common mea
 sure of commerce, in relation to which all pecuniary contracts are
 adjusted, and the value of all commodities estimated — a metal, too,
 (unlike silver) found in a comparatively pure state, and produced at
 a much less expense of labour and capital, — whether these supplies,
 if continued, as they seemed likely to be, would produce a deprecia
 tion of money, or, what is the same thing, a universal rise in the
 money value of labour and commodities, affecting                 in this way all
 contracts having reference to the future, and the purchasing                power
 of fixed incomes.
    Such    a disturbance  of the relations of property, it was remembered,
 had already occurred in our history.             Three centuries ago, silver
 was the universal      standard of money in Europe.              Before the dis
covery of the rich mines of Potosi, and the introduction               of Medina's
process     for separating silver from       its ores by amalgamation          with
mercury, wheat in England was sold for 6s. 8d.            a quarter   ; beef at  Id.
a pound ; ale at       Id.  a gallon ;     and claret at 3d. a quart.           The
wages    of  a mason or carpenter were 4d. a day, and          of  a day-labourer
2d.  ;  while   a clergyman    received L.5     a year, and an     Oxford scholar
 lOd.   a week.     After  these discoveries, and as the direct consequence
of them, wages and general prices — not in England alone,                   but in
France, in Spain, and generally             over Europe     — were    quadrupled,
and continued at the higher level ever afterwards.              This remarkable
phenomenon occurred about the year 1572.                There     was no war, or
commercial disturbance, or other accidental circumstance to account
for it.   The coinage had       been    reformed twenty      years before,     and
brought to very nearly our present standard, and there was neither
dearth nor scarcity in the land      ; for the old chronicler tells us,    " there
was no want to him who wanted not            money."*       The value of labour
and commodities appeared to have universally             risen  ;  but in reality
it was the value of money which had fallen.              The change was not
in the things valued, but in the measure of value.
    The wise councillors of Queen Elizabeth had not shut their                eyes
to the changes     which were then impending,          and their political     and

 social consequences.             The revenues of the Universities of               Oxford
 and Cambridge, and of the Colleges of Eton and Winchester,                         arising
 principally from land, wore anciently payable in money.                       The Lord
 Treasurer Burleigh, and other far-seeing men of that                      day,     became
 sensible of the great diminution          of the value of money which was
 about to be the consequence           of the increased American supplies of
 silver, and to elude the effect of the impending                  depreciation,         they
 had an act of Parliament passed, by which it was enacted, that in
 all future    leases to be granted by the several colleges, one              third part
 at least of the old rent should be reserved in corn, and should                    be con
 verted into money each year, according to the average market-prices
 of grain. The money arising from this corn-rent, although originally
 but a third of the whole, is now worth double the other two thirds ;
 and thus, by the wise precautions and foresight of the great men                          of
 that time, were these            venerable    seats    of learning prevented            from
 falling into comparative poverty and decay.
    The question which now presents itself for solution is this                      :   Are
the recent discoveries of gold (now the standard of our money), and
the vast accessions now making to the previous stock of that metal,
producing at present, or are they likely to produce hereafter,                      effects
similar in kind, although, it may             be, inferior in degree, to the        effects
produced in the sixteenth century by the discovery of the American
mines, and the great subsequent fall in the cost of producing silver?
Or,     on the contrary,     are the situation of the world, and the circum
stances of society, now so totally different as to place us altogether
beyond the danger of any such revolution in the relations of property
as our ancestors       experienced in the days of the Tudors           1
    This subject gave rise to much controversy in 1852, after the
first accounts of the Australian discoveries had reached this country.
On reviewing the arguments on both sides (of which the author gare
a summary), many of those whose attention had been previously
directed to the subject, both here and on the Continent,                     felt   them
selves constrained to conclude that the preponderance of probability
(to say the least of    was on the side of those who maintained the
                            it)
likelihood of an ultimate general rise of wages and prices in Europe.
   Of    course,   at that early period, all reasonings with reference                    to
the future were, and could only be, conjectural,                   But judging      from
the past, and the effects           formerly produced by the American                sup
plies    of silver,   it   was    concluded    that    if   the Australian   and Call-

  it then promised,     we   should    sooner or later witness the following
  among other striking effects, viz. — (1.)         A    marked and sudden rise
  of wages and prices in the gold-producing          countries themselves      ; (2.)
   A  general and sustained      rise, to a greater or less extent, of wages
  and prices in Great Britain, the United States, and other countries
  which employ gold as the exclusive standard of their money              ; (3.) In
  countries,   like France, which maintain          a   double standard of gold
  and silver (that is to say, where both metals are equally legal tender,
  and interchangeable, in certain fixed proportions), a continued dis
  appearance of silver, and the gradual substitution            of gold, followed
  by a rise of wages and prices in such countries             ;
                                                                 (4.) A  great and
  unusual impetus given to trade in all departments, and a marked
  increase of exports      and imports     ; (5.) No direct effect on the rate
  of interest, but a felt diminution in the purchasing power of fixed
  pecuniary incomes     ;  (Lastly) It     was   pointed out that these antici
  pated changes would probably be more or less retarded by the time
  necessary for the displacement         of silver, and that the tendency to
 dearness would in some degree be counteracted by increased facilities
 of communication, improvements in agriculture, improved machinery,
 and the discovery and adoption of cheaper processes in manufactures.
     Whether any or all of        these    anticipated    results have as yet ac
 tually exhibited themselves, has given rise to much difference of
 opinion.     Ten years are perhaps too short a period to enable us to
 come to a decided conclusion ; and within the last ten years several
 events have occurred to render            the problem      more complex,        and
 its solution, for the present, more difficult        ; — among    others, the un
 usual drain of silver to the East, the displacement of silver in France,
 the demonetization of that metal in Holland and in our own East
 Indian   possessions,  — above    all, the free-trade legislation inaugurated
 by Sir R. Peel, and the commercial and monetary crisis of 1857.
 From 1851 to 1857 the rise of wages and prices had been continu
 ous.    After the crisis      a  reaction    took place, from the       effects  of
 which we aro only now recovering, although              it is believed that, in
all departments of trade and industry, wages and prices are higher
now (1860) than they were anterior to the Australian discoveries.
    On the   first of the   probable effects which       have been indicated, it
is unnecessary to      enlarge — the    rise of prices in the gold-producing
countries    was marked       and   immediate.        In California, the prices

                                              306
which prevailed in 1848 and 1849 were fabulous;                                 and in Australia
the rise of prices in 1851 was equally striking.                               From facts   so ex
ceptional no sound inference can be drawn.
      A   more difficult, and to us a more interesting and important sub
ject of inquiry, is the action of the new gold supplies here at home —
in the gold-receiving countries.
   The price of grain, although the                  best available            basis for institut
ing a comparison of prices from century to century, is perhaps the very
worst on which to found such a comparison from year to year, or even
for   a period extending           over a limited         number             of years.    We may
notice     it,   however, for what       it   is   worth, during             the period we        are
considering.         Taking       the average price         of wheat in England for the
"   farmers' years," ending at Michaelmas,                       as given        by    Mr Willich,
the Actuary of the Tithe Commutation                       Commissioners,             the prices of
the last eight years ended Michaelmas                           1859,    exceed those of the
previous eight years, ended Michaelmas                     1851,        by   nearly 12 per cent.
    In provisions and butchers' meat, the rise in the London markets
(as in those of      Paris) has      been continuous and progressive, exceeding
at present the       average prices      of 1851 by from 20                    to 30 per cent.
    In    colonial and tropical         produce, tea, sugar, coffee, tobacco,                   silk,
and cotton, there has likewise  been an advance, although not to so
great an extent; while in most of the materials of our manufactures —
flax, timber, wool, and especially in metals, tallow, and some kinds
of oils   and dye-stuffs    — there     was   a    general and progressive rise,                until
the prices of 1857           exceeded     those of 1851                 by    from 30 to 60 per
cent.      Consequent        on    the crisis of 1857 there was                    a   sudden    fall,
but in very few instances to nearly                 so   low     a   range of prices       as pre
vailed in 1851       ;    while    since 1858        there has again               been   in most
articles a continuous rise — in some instances to the extent of from
40 to 50 per cent, over the prices of 1851.
    In July       1853,   Mr Newmarch,         in his able brochure               " On the New
Supplies of Gold," gave            a   list of the prices of 38 leading                    articles
from the London Prices Current,                    selected impartially for the pur
pose of showing, that while many               of the articles quoted had advanced
in price, several of them, and these of great importance, such as
sugar, tobacco, cotton, and silk, had either declined or remained
stationary.      I   have since then kept            a    copy of this list, with blank
columns, in which         I   have continued to          fill   in   the prices every quarter
from the same Price Current, in the same way as had been done for

                                           307
the preceding two years and a half.                  The result brought out in this
way     is,   that, in the face of greatly enlarged production, and constantly
increasing importations, with one or two exceptions all the 38 articles
inserted have risen in price — most of them very materially, and
many of them continuously              and progressively, though, as might be
expected, the constantly advancing tide has in the majority of in
stances been         marked     by   fluctuations,    exhibited       most       prominently
after the crisis of 1857.
   Now, this rise of prices during the last nine years (for the list
begins in January 1851, and ends in January 1860) would be                                    a
serious look-out, especially for the working classes, were  not ac                 it
companied, as        it   appears to have been, by       a   simultaneous          and corre
sponding          in the money wages of all kinds of labour, both
                advance
agricultural and manufacturing, skilled and unskilled.
      Communications        from eminent agriculturists            represent the wages
both    of farm-servants        and of day-labourers           as    having risen since
1850 fully 25 per cent.              In Edinburgh, masons'             wages,       which    in
1852      were 20s.        per week of sixty hours, are now 5d. per hour,
equal to 25s. a week, or an advance of 25 per cent.                        Joiners'     wages,
which            were 18s., are now 23s., or 27 per cent. higher.
              in 1852
Upholsterers, then 19s., are now 23s., or 21 per cent, higher.
   From an important paper, " On the Money Rate of Wages in
Glasgow and the West of Scotland," communicated     Dr Strang to           by
the Cheltenham Meeting of the British Association in 1856, and
founded on actual returns, appears that the increase of wages in
                                     it
1856 over the rates of 1850—51 had been,                      in    the case of masons,
carpenters,        and joiners, 20        per cent.  ;   of unskilled           labourers    in
the building trades, 48 per cent.              ;   of engineers, 17 per cent.   of       ;
quarriers,       30 per cent.; of cotton-spinners,         25 per cent.; of power-
loom weavers, 15 per cent.                In   a subsequent paper, communicated
 by   the same gentleman to the meeting of the British Association                           at
Leeds in 1858, he states, as the result of his more recent inquiries,
that although the rate of wages in 1858 was lower than in 1856,                              it
was still higher than in 1851.      In Report on the Statistics of
                                                     a
                            Dr Strang                    " the              of labour, now
Glasgow for 1859,                         states that              wages
given for a week of diminished hours, have greatly advanced, and
are still on the rise; and when measured either in grain or in time,
are generally       higher than they ever were known to be."
  The price of labour, especially of unskilled labour,                     is   perhaps the

                                         308
   surest test we can apply         in judging of the comparative value             of
   money at different periods.
      That  the rate   of  wages   in the gold-producing      countries should     be
  acted   on  directly    by the conditions      under which     the material of
  money is produced is not to be wondered at.              The manner in      which
  it acts on wages in Europe is not so obvious, but is by no means in
  capable of explanation.        The price of labour is subject to the law of
  supply and demand, depending as it does on the numbers of the
  working population on the one hand, compared with the fund for
  the payment of wages        on   the other.     If the   gold discoveries, then,
  have caused unusual emigration,         and  so   thinned the labour-market,
  while the equally unprecedented          impetus given to trade, and attri
 butable in part at least to these           discoveries, has greatly increased
 the fund for the employment of labour, we discover a twofold                 cause
 for the rise which has taken place.
     The average annual emigration from the United Kingdom, which
 for the five years ending 1846 had been 87,850, increased for the
 five years ending 1855 to 299,300.
     The increase of the fund for the payment of wages may be judged
of from the unparalleled extension of trade which has taken place
since   1848.     The real value of the exports of British produce, which
 in 1848 amounted to L.52,849,445, rose in 1857 to L.122,066,10",
and, according to the Board of Trade               tables recently   issued, after
falling in 1858 to        L.l 16,608,756, reached        in 1859 the    absolutely
unprecedented sum        of L.l 30,440,427.         No   doubt much of this in
crease must be set down to the credit           of our recent free-trade     legis
lation  ; but a considerable proportion of the increase, especially           since
 1851,    consists  of additions     to  our trade with the gold-producing
countries.      Our exports      to  Australia, for example, which in        1848
amounted to less than one        million and a half, had increased in        1859
to eleven millions and a quarter.
     The coinage of gold in Great Britain, France, and the United
States, has kept pace with the increased supplies of that metal.                 In
this country, between 1848 and the end of 1856, we had                     coined
gold to the value of fifty millions.             In the United States,     during
the same      period,   the  gold coinage amounted to the value of             68 J
millions sterling; while in France, between 1850 and the end of
1858, it amounted to a sum equal to L. 129, 587,735 sterling. The
importance of these figures will be appreciated when it is remembered

                                             30!)
  that during   the    forty-five      years   which   preceded    1848, France had
  coined gold at the rate of less than one million sterling per annum —
  less than is now       issued each year by the Royal           Mint of Sydney—
  and that the coinage of England during the                  seven years    preceding
   1850 amounted       to  little more than four millions per annum.
      Assuming that       these unprecedented        additions to the stock of gold
  in circulation must sooner or later depreciate             the value of money, we
  should naturally proceed           next to inquire what the effects       of such    a
  depreciation are likely to be on the condition              of different  classes   of
  society ; in what manner, and to what extent, it may affect the in
 terest of landlords and tenants, debtors and creditors, labourers and
 capitalists,  annuitants,         shareholders,   stipendiaries, families    prospec
 tively dependent       on policies     of life assurance, and others having an
  interest not only in the present but the future value of money ; what
  precautions   such impending changes should suggest with reference
 to investments    ;   what legislative measures,        if any, they invite    ; what
 are likely to be their effects in lightening the pressure of our public
 debt, or increasing          the exactions     of Government        for the current
 service of the State       ;  whether, and to what extent, these changes are
 likely to be modified or retarded by countervailing causes ; and how
 far the tendency to dearness caused by a depreciation of money may
 not be compensated by the tendency to cheapness                     which   improve
 ments in agriculture,          in manufactures, and in the various depart
 ments of industry and           production, never fail to carry in their train.
 These are inquiries of great interest and importance, but they open
up too wide a field to be entered on at present.                   The more imme
diate question    is — Are        there indications that a depreciation of money
 is imminent,    or has it already actually begun?
2. On the Chronology                 of the Trap-Rocks of Scotland.                By
     Archibald Geikie, F.G.S., of the Geological Survey of Great
     Britain.    Communicated by Robert Chambers, Esq.
     The first part of this paper contained a review of the existing
nomenclature of trappean-rocks, and the following arrangement was
given as that which the author had found to be most useful for prac
tice in the field    : — 1st, Ash       and volcanic conglomerate.         2d, Inter-
bedded    augitic traps (greenstones and basalts).                  3d, Interbedded
felspathic    traps     (felstones,      porphyries).      4th,   Intrusive    augitic
     VOL. IV.                                                            2 T

                                       310
 traps.     5th, Intrusive fe I spathic     traps.    By adopting      a different
 colour for each of these classes, the general          relations of an intricate
 trappean district could be shown at a glance.
     Although it     was well    known      that   the trap-rocks     of Scotland
 belonged to several distinct       geological    epochs,   much still remained
 to be done, both in determining         their exact age and in working         out
 the details of their structure.          The author had been engaged             in
 this subject for several years, and the present paper was intended               as
 the  first of a series elucidatory    of Scottish trappean geology.
    Silurian. — It    was remarked that, both in the        Lower Silurian grits
 of the Lammermuirs,       and in the Upper Silurian grits of the Pentlands,
 there is an abundance of felspathic matter, pointing to the existence
 of felspathic rocks, either then or previously ejected.           The Lammer-
 muir chain is likewise traversed by innumerable                  felstone dykes,
 probably produced at the time         of the folding of the Silurians.          At
 Reston, in Berwickshire, beds of ash occur in the Lower Silurian.
     Old Red Sandstone.      —The      author referred      to a previous paper
 (read before the Geological Society) in which he had shown that the
 Old Red Sandstone of the south of Scotland consists of two distinct
 portions — one conformable with          the Upper Silurian, and traversed
 by the same foldings and dykes        ;   the other lying utterly unconform-
ably,    both on the Upper Silurian and the Lower Old Red.                     The
 igneous rocks of the older series probably occur in the Sidlaw Hills               ;
those   of the newer series are well displayed in the Pentlands,                the
 structure of which was detailed.
    Carboniferous.
                      — The great abundance, the variety of character,
 the local nature, and the great vertical range of the carboniferous
traps of central      Scotland,    was   shown by a detailed sketch of the
geology of the Lothians.         The range of hilly ground between Bath
gate and Linlithgow was pointed out as an eminently characteristic
district.     A  careful survey had shown that no well-marked                 zone
of the 6000 or 8000           feet  of carboniferous       strata in some     part
of the Lothians        was   without   traces of contemporaneous          igneous
eruptions.
    Oolitic. — The structure of Skye and Raasay was described. These
islands (when examined along a section from Dun Can, in Raasay, to
Dunvegan, in Skye) consist of successive            sheets  of greenstone,    with
intercalated    seams   of estuary limestone, shell, sandstone, and           coal,
belonging to    the Oolitic series.

                                          311
       Secondary,    or Tertiary. — Allusion        was    made    to   the Tertiary
    basalts of Mull, and    to the possibility     of there being other igneous
    rocks of that age on the mainland.          A section of Arthur's Seat was
    exhibited, showing    a series of volcanic eruptions,        resting quite un-
    conformably    upon some of Carboniferous            date.   This later group
    must be greatly posterior      to that below      ;  and the author collected
    evidence to show that it may be regarded as later Secondary,                     or
   older Tertiary.
      Letter from the Rev. Dr Livingstone.                F.R.S.,    to  Dr Lyon
                                 Playfair, C.B.
                                                River Shirk,     2Stlt Oct. 1859.
       My dear Dr Playfair, — We left England in April 1858, and                    up
   to this time we have not received a single private letter from home.
   This  saves me the trouble    of apologising to any of my friends whom
  I   have neglected.     So here goes into the middle of things.                  We
  have just traced this river up to its point of emergence                  from the
  hitherto undiscovered Lake of Nyassa or Nyinyessi.                This discovery
  is of more importance than at first sight appears, for it opens a
  cotton-field   superior,  I  imagine, to the American, inasmuch as
  there are no frosts to endanger or cut off the crops ; and instead of
 the unmerciful     toil required to raise the staple there,          one sowing    of
 foreign, probably American         seed,  introduced      into several parts by
 the natives themselves, serves        for three     years'  crops.      Even when
 burned down, the plants spring          up fresh again.        It  may have dis
 advantages to counterbalance these points in its favour, but                of these
 I   am at present ignorant.      There     is a good day's channel from the
 sea at Kongone       harbour   up   to Murchison's Cataracts            in lat. 15°
 55' south.      We  have then only 33 miles of cataracts, past which a
 common road could easily be made           —and       the Shire itself is again
 navigable    right into Nyassa in lat.         14°     55' south.       Above    the
cataracts the land is arranged into terraces east of the river.                  The
lower or Shire Valley is about 1200 feet high, and exactly like the
valley of the     Nile at Cairo, only         a  little broader.        The   second
terrace is over 2000 feet and three or four miles broad           ;   the third over
3000, or about equal to Table Mountain at the Cape (long spoken of
as the highest in South Africa).          We travelled in the hottest season
of the year, or that called in the West the " smokes," when, from

                                                      312
the burning of tens                of thousands of               acres    of tall grass,          the atmo
sphere becomes              like      a    partial     cloud or fog, but insufferably                      hot.
 When we ascended the second terrace, the air felt delightfully                                           cool,
and on the third it was perfect, neither                            too     cold nor too hot.              All
these     terraces are wonderfully                    well supplied with             running rills           of
deliriously       cool water ; and cotton                   of the indigenous variety                (which
feels     more      like wool than cotton, and requires                               to     be    cropped
annually)     is cultivated               to a very considerable extent.                     On     the last
terrace rises Mount Zomba, which we ascended, and found to                                            be in
round numbers 7000 to 8000 feet high.                                     Here it     was     cold    ;    but
there is cultivation            and a fine stream in a large valley on its                                top.
It    has a base of 20 or 30 miles.                              We have thus differences                    of
climate within a few miles of each other.                                 This for keeping            Euro
peans     well.     Then        we are      indulging the pleasant belief, from                       which
you may deduct a percentage, that we can cure the fever,                                            even     in
the lowlands, quickly and without                           loss   of strength        to the patient.
We shall beat Holloway yet!                       only we tell every one what our pills
are made of.           It    is the system followed when                     I   was alone, and ad
verted to at the end of my book.                              Wo have, thank God, not lost a
man yet, and gave the quinine a                            fair trial. It never prevented an
attack.      We have given it                 up now.           We took it after our wine                  was
done, partly        for the sake            of the dram, and partly                  to prevent you
folks blaming us after we were dead.
      Well, beyond Zomba the land                      between      Shire and the two lakes of
Shirwa, or,       as its name really                 is,   Tamandua, and Nyassa or Nyin-
yessi, contracts into           a     narrow isthmus, and all the slave trade from
the     interior must           cross,      in order           to get past the lakes without
embarking         on   either.            We met           a   large slaving         party    there.       I
think they are what people                      suppose          to be    Arabs at the Angoxia
river, but they could not                      speak        Arabic.        They were the most
blackguard-looking              setI      ever saw.            When they understood                wo were
English,    they made off by night, probably                             with the same opinion               of
us as we      had      of them.            They      had       an immense number of slaves.
A     station for lawful commerce here would root out that traffic.
     The lake     at its southern end seemed eight or ten miles broad — had
a   heavy swell on         it   though there was no wind — and                       it   must be large
to give    off the Shire constantly (80                         to 120 yards wide,           2     fathoms
deep, and      knot current) the whole year, with

  1. On the      Solidification of Limes and Cements.                           By     George
                              Robertson, C.E.
    The paper was deduced from a series of experiments, made on the
 London Dock Works with blue lias and Dorking limes ; and at
 Leith Docks with         the limes      in the neighbourhood               of Edinburgh,
 and with cements both natural and artificial.                     A   short account          was
 first given of the nature of the experiments                    at the London           Docks,
 with    the points     investigated.       A      longer        and more professional
account of these is to be found in the Transactions                       of the Institu
tion of Civil Engineers for 1857-58.
   The solidification         of lime    was      considered        under       two     general
heads.
   1st, That of ordinary limes and plasters, in which                       the action             of
setting    was   proved to be at first entirely             of    a mechanical          nature,
when slaked lime         is used for mortar          ;    when quick lime              is used,
though the set is hastened by the chemical act of hydration,                                 it    is
still, in practice,     caused       by mechanical        causes, — the         set    in    both
cases being due to the absorption           into the pores of the lime of                              a
great part of the water of mixture, accompanied by a contraction                                   in
the bulk of the mortar.             After the first       set,    induration      increases;
at first from the evaporation of some of the water of mixture,                                and
afterwards from the absorption of carbonic acid from the atmosphere.
The author found, that when limestones were cemented                                  together,
the mortar absorbed carbonic acid from the stones themselves,                            some
what in proportion to the quantity in the limestone.                        He   also found
that    the presence of silica          in chemical         combination          with        lime
deadened     the desire of the lime for carbonic acid.                      In    hydraulic
lime,    therefore,   which     owes    the permanence of its set to silica                       in
combination      with   it,   the    induration     due     to carbonic         acid    is   less
than in ordinary      and purer limes.
  The second division            of the subject          comprised        all    limes       and
cements which set permanently             hard     under         water.     In this         case,

                                           315
  though the first set is caused by the same              absorption   of the  water
  of mixture as in ordinary            limes, the permanent hardness cannot,
  evidently, result from desiccation, either from absorption or evapora
 tion.    A  chemical combination          between the lime and some           agent
 capable of resisting        the    softening    action    of water is    necessary.
  Silica was proved to be the only substance              found naturally in limes,
 which was capable        of   furnishing     this   protection ; and it was only
 useful when present in combination with alumina, as clay, in a
 hydrated form.       Double silicates of lime and alumina             form harder
 mortars than silicate of lime alone.                Iron, manganese, magnesia,
 and alumina by itself,       were shown to have no chemical effect in
 setting lime under water, though they furnish a kind of temporary
 mechanical     protection     from     solubility.      The   iron  in pozzuolana
 may even be withdrawn by an acid, without to any extent                    injuring
 the hydraulic properties        of the earth.         The author believed that in
 properly calcined hydraulic          lime no union between the silica and
 lime took place in the kiln, but only on the completion of a hydrate
 by slaking, and then only when surplus water was present.                      This
 theory was founded on experiments upon the adhesion of mortar at
 different  stages   of setting, silicate of lime having little power of
cementation.       The degree of adhesion, marked tolerably exactly
 the progress of the silicification         of the lime.      Experiments     on the
 quantity of silica derived from Portland cement, digested in a weak
 acid, both when fresh from the kiln and after having been set for
six days, gave still more direct evidence of the truth of this theory,
which was proved by the author to be of great practical importance
in the application of limes.              It was stated that, oxalic acid had
been    ascertained to be capable of setting limes permanently hard
underwater, when mixed with the water used in slaking; but the
oxalate of lime does not possess the same flinty hardness as the
silicate, and of course is much more expensive — at the present price
of oxalic acid.     The paper closed with          some remarks on
                                                                       " cements,"
both natural and artificial       ; the properties of which, under the gene
ric types of Roman and Portland cements, were shortly explained.
          2. On    Zinc-Methyl.            By   J.  A. Wanklyn, Esq.
    Considerable    difficulties    attend the preparation         of zinc-methyl.
Frankland, who discovered the              body,    obtained it by heating pure

                                          316
   iodide of methyl     and zinc enclosed in small glass tubes.              Owing      to
   the high temperature        at which     reaction takes place, much gas               is
   formed    ;  hence the operation    must be confined to very small             quan
   tities of materials.
       No determination of     the  boiling-point, specific gravity, nor          yet of
   the vapour density of zinc-methyl,         was made by its discoverer         ; from
   which fact may be inferred how small -was the product available                    for
   investigation.
       Frankland* has recently endeavoured            to   improve    the process      of
  preparation.       He  has tried a modification        similar   to that which he
  had introduced for zinc-ethyl.         He mixed ether with the             iodide of
  methyl, and heated with zinc in his copper digester.                By this   means
  ready decomposition       of the organic iodide         was    obtained, and      very
  little  gas was evolved;     but subsequently      it  was   found impossible        to
  separate the ether from the zinc-methyl.              By this process Frank-
  land did not succeed in obtaining any pure zinc-methyl.
      To meet this difficulty is the object aimed at by the author                     of
 the paper.
      Instead of using ether to mix with iodide of methyl, the author
 uses either a strong solution       of zinc-methyl in ether, or pure zinc-
 methyl    ;  either of which he   has found capable of rendering the action
 of zinc upon the organic iodide easy, and unaccompanied by                      much
 gaseous products.       All his digestions he makes in glass tubes            heated
 in the water-bath to 100° C.        The strong solution of zinc-methyl             was
 obtained, in the first instance, by digesting together ether, iodide                  of
 methyl, and zinc, and afterwards distilling.              The distillate   was then
 employed in a second        operation     in  place of ether, and so a still
 stronger solution of zinc-methyl        resulted.
      By repeating the     process   zinc-methyl      was   finally obtained      in a
state of tolerable     purity.    A  single tube, which had undergone four
digestions, furnished about half an ounce of product, which analysis
showed to consist of zinc-methyl nearly pure.
     A   determination of the vapour density of zinc-methyl                made     by
Gay Lussac's method gave 3'29 1. The calculated theoretical num
ber is 3'299.        Accordingly, the condensation of zinc-methyl corre
sponds to that of ether, and not to that of hydride of methyl
                                                                                — in
this respect resembling zinc-ethyl.
     In  addition to the properties of zinc-methyl mentioned by Frank-
     * Annalen der Chemie   u Pharmacie von     Liebig, cxi.  p. 62.   Frankland

                                          317
 land, viz. its extreme inflammability, its action upon water, &c.,
 the author has observed that the body may be heated                         to 200° C.
 without decomposition.          At   270° C.     it begins to yield metallic zinc.
     The boiling-point of zinc-methyl lies between 50° C. and 60°                      C,
 but the author reserves the accurate determination until he shall                     be
 in possession of several      ounces    of the pure body.
     In   one respect the author's observations do not accord with                Frank-
 land's    ; he has   not been able to verify what has been advanced con
 cerning the poisonous nature of zinc-methyl fumes.*                      Having per
 formed more than a dozen distillations of the body, and having been
 much exposed to the fumes, he has not been able to mark any spe
 cial effect upon his health.         With regard to the disagreeable odour
 of the body, he has also to remark, that a mixture of zinc-methyl
 with much ether is more offensive than zinc-methyl pure, or con
 taining only a little ether.
     The author remarks, that considerations drawn from the                      state  of
 condensation of the so-called organo-metallic             bodies,    lead to the con
 clusion     that the metals are not the representatives of hydrogen.

   3. Notes      of the Dissection       of a Female         Beaver.         By John
      Cleland,     M.D., Demonstrator          of Anatomy, University of
      Edinburgh.        Communicated by Dr Douglas Maclagan.*
      In  this paper the writer directed attention to the remarkably                  de
   veloped parotid glands of the beaver, which form a single large                 mass
   covering the whole front and sides of the neck, and cannot be                  sepa
   rated from one another.       He  showed    how the apparent disproportion
   between    the anterior and posterior extremities        of the beaver      was in
  creased    by the way in which the parietes of the abdomen overhung
   the thighs, and the margin of the panniculus carnosus passed                    over
  the knees so as to include them in the muscular investment                        that
  enveloped the trunk.
      The   use  of the horny development, called by zoologists an addi
  tional nail, on the second toe of the hind foot, was explained thus :—
  the toes, especially the first and second, are curved inwards for pur
  poses connected      with the animal's aquatic habits ; and when it
  supports itself in its favourite posture on its hind legs and tail, these
  two toes lie with their outer sides downwards.               The innermost is
  small, and bears none of the weight        ; but the second toe bears a          con
  siderable amount, and the tender matrix of the nail would be                     con
  stantly   pressed   against  the ground,      were it not that          the horny
 development is so shaped that, while it presents its under surface                   to
 the earth, the superior aspect fits in to the concavity of the claw            above.
     The dilatation of the vena cava for diving purposes was               described,
 and the arrangement of the castor sacs.
     The principal points with regard to the latter are              as follows     : —
 The rectum and genito-urinary aperture open into                   a common        de
 pression as in the male, and the oil glands and general form of the
 castor sacs resemble those of the male ; but while in the male the
 necks   of the castor   sacs of opposite tides      are united by a communi
cation above the preputial       opening — t.    «., between     the prepuce       and
 rectum — in the female they are united by a dilatation                like a small
third   lobe, situated, not on the superior aspect         of the genito-urinary
aperture as      in the male, but on the pubic aspect          ;   and the clitoris
appears on the anterior margin of the dilatation immediately inferior
to the urethral orifice.      The castor    sacs and oil glands        are invested
by a muscular tunic,       whose  fibres, arising      superiorly   in connection

with the compressors of the rectum,           pass round      and   are inserted on
the inferior aspect of the sacs into         a circular     set    of fibres which
surround      an uninvested space in the middle line, opposite the median
dilatation.      The round ligaments of the uterus              end   on this mus
cular tunic.       The rectum is surrounded by a               set  of remarkably
developed compressors.
4.   On the Thyroid Gland in the Cetacea ; with Observations
    on the Relations of the Thymus to the Thyroid in these
    and some other Mammals.                   By William Turner, M.B.
    (Lond.), Senior Demonstrator of Anatomy, University of
    Edinburgh.        Communicated by Professor Goodsir.
    The author, in the first instance, directed attention                to the dis
crepant      statements    of   various    comparative       anatomists      respect
ing the thyroid gland in the Cetacea, quoting from the writings of
John Hunter, Meckel, Cuvier, Carus, and Dr Martyn.                          He then
related    the result of his   own   dissections made on three specimens of
the   common      porpoise    (Phocana     communis),       one    being a foetus,
another a well grown         male, the third an adult male.               In  each of
these animals     a well marked thyroid        gland    was found,     lying   on the
anterior and lateral surfaces of the trachea at its upper end, and
extending slightly upwards on each side over the outer surface of the
cricoid cartilage.     It   presented no division        into two lateral       lobes,
as  described by Cuvier and Carus, but consisted of a single uniform
 mass extending across the middle line.           In   the adult animal,        which
was examined in the fresh state, the other             specimens      having     been
 some   time in spirits, the gland     presented    a dark      purple tint,    and a
soft and somewhat        succulent aspect.       Both in the       foetus   and well
grown     animal, the thymus gland was exceedingly well developed.
 A detailed description of the position and relations of this gland was
 then given, the long ascending processes          which pass upwards, by the
 side of the great vessels, as far as the     thyroid gland, being especially
 pointed out.     These processes      were   intimately connected         with    tho
 lateral portions   of the thyroid    by cellular    tissue, but were not con
 tinuous    with them.
    The author next referred to       Mr  Simon's description of the thymus
 in the   fetal dolphin.
    The microscopic      characters     of the thymus gland in the well-
 grown porpoise were      then given.      It was found to consist of small

                                         320
  closely packed corpuscles, about the size of, or a little larger than,
  the red corpuscles     of human      blood  — its     structure, in fact, exactly
  corresponding    with that which is familiar to            us  in the  foetal gland.
  Thus this animal gave us         an additional       illustration of the truth       of
  the statement    made     by Haugsted       and Simon, that the thymus               is
  not merely a foetal structure,       but that      it plays an important          part
  in the animal economy for some          time after birth.
      The author considered that the         close relation which was found in
  these  porpoises   between    the thymus         and thyroid glands, might          be
  regarded as confirmatory      of the view entertained by Professor Good-
  sir, that they are developed from a common structure.
      He next described    a dissection    of  the thymus        and thyroid, which
  he had   made in an adult male Hartebeest               (Bubalus Caama).          The
 thyroid in this animal     was   separated into two distinct lateral lobes,
  each lobe having connected      with it a long slender glandular process,
  which passed down the sides         and front of the trachea, behind the
 sternum, into the anterior mediastinum.                These glandular processes
 exhibited microscopically the characters           of   the thymus, so that, both
 as regards structure and position, they            must be regarded as consti
 tuting that gland.
     The thymus    and thyroid glands in        the Nylghau (Antilope pieta)
 were then     described.     The animal         dissected      was   a magnificent
 specimen of an adult male, standing             one    foot above the recorded
 average height of the male.          In it     the thyroid        was  divided    into
 two distinct   lateral   lobes, each      lobe extending          from  the cricoid
cartilage as far as     the fourth      tracheal      ring.     Situated on the     an
terior surface of the trachea,        and    on   the crico-thyroid       membrane
between these thyroidean       lobes, were scattered           lobules  of glandular
tissue of a slightly reddish tint.        These were not connected with the
thyroid, but were lying in the cellular tissue between its lobes.
Similar scattered lobules extended for some distance down the trachea,
but about thirteen inches above the sternum they became aggregated
together, so as to form two long lines of glandular tissue, which
passed beneath    the sternum into the anterior mediastinum.                Structur
ally this gland presented the character of the thymus.                      It  corre
sponded also to it in position.           In addition to the proper             gland
structure, the microscope brought           into    view numerous        three-sided
prismatic crystals, resembling         those    of the triple phosphate, lying
in and about the connective tissue of the gland.

                                           321
     From    the evidence   afforded by the dissection of the Hartebeest and
 Nylghau, the conclusion must              be drawn    that   in these    Antilopidae
 the thymus is a permanent gland              ; for there could be no doubt but
 that both these animals         had     reached the adult      period   of life,  and
 even acquired a considerable           age, — their    large   size, and the worn
 appearance of the teeth rendered this sufficiently manifest.                  So far,
 then, as regards these animals, the thymus               must be looked upon as
 possessing a more enduring function than has hitherto been ascribed
 to it in the economy, — not disappearing             or altogether degenerating
 in   the early period    of extra-uterine      life, but persisting     even   in the
 adult animal.        The paper concluded by            some    remarks    upon the
 thyroid and thymus glands in the human subject.
 5.   Notice on the Boring of the Pholadidae. By Alexander
       Bryson, Esq., President of the Royal Physical Society.
     In   this communication the author referred to the various theories
 advanced to account for the boring of the Pholadida? in rocks.
     The first hypothesis, which supposes that the molluscs perforate
 by means of the rotation of the valves acting as augers, he disproved
 by exhibiting old individuals            of the Pholus crispata with the den-
 tated costae as sharp as      in any young specimen. That these animals
 bore by silicious particles secreted by the foot, as suggested                by  Mr
 Hancock,      has been disproved       by microscopic observation;         and that
 currents of water set in motion by vibratilo cilia, seemed also insuf
 ficient to account for the phenomenon.
     Another theory       supposes     that an acid is secreted         by the foot,
 capable of dissolving the rock.
     This the author     showed     was not tenable, as      the strongest Nord-
 hausen sulphuric acid fails to dissolve aluminous shales and Silurian
slates   ;  and also that any such acid secretion would act more readily
on the valves themselves.            From many experiments           on the cutting
 of hard silicious     substances, the author found that the softer the
substance was        in which      the    cutting   material    was   impacted, the
greater the amount of the work done.                 He was thus led to the con
clusion that the      Pholadida;    bore with the strong muscular foot alone,
and that they obtain the silica from the waves                  or the arenaceous
rocks in which they are found           ;  and hence there is no necessity for
either an acid or silicious       secretion.      That the foot     was  the boring

                                            322
 apparatus,       and not the valves, he proved from a specimen of                      a
 Pholas hole in shale, where the pedal depression of the animal                     was
 distinctly   seen.
    He    also exhihited     a piece of glass bored to the depth           of 1'50    of
 an inch, by means of the point of the finger and emery alone.

                             F.R.S.E,    Torphichen.
    The author, having roferred to the value of carefully prepared
reports      on the ornithology of particular districts, characterised
 the physical features of that part of Linlithgowshire in which his
observations had mainly          been   made, and showed that it is well
fitted for the support      of a comparatively    large number of species of
birds.     He stated that the following list      had been gradually    formed
as the    result of observations spread over fifteen years.       Most of the
species named       had come under        his own notice   ; for a few he had
been indebted to Thomas Durham              Weir, Esq. of Boghead, an     accu
rate    observer.     The classification followed is that which he          had
found     most helpful     to his own studies.      Species seldom met with

2. On an unusual                 Drought in the Lake District in 1859.                    By
               John Davy, M.D., F.R.SS. Lond. & Edin.
   This occurrence, following an unusual fall of rain in January,
took place in May, June, and July.   The ordinary amount of rain
in these months              — taking
                           is,              the average of the last eleven years, —
   vol. iv.                                                                 2   x

                                      320
at Lesketh    How, Ambleside,       12-36 inches; during the months in
question, at the same place, it was only 4 '54 inches.
   Three tables are given by the author in elucidation          ;  the first    re
lating  to the  fall of rain in five different places in the district       ;  the
second affording a summary of general meteorological observations at
Kendal, more or      less  applicable to other parts of the district        ;  the
third containing, for the sake of comparison, the rain-fall at           various
places in the United Kingdom.
   The author concludes with noticing the abnormal state                  of the
weather during the whole of the year, marked by great vicissitudes
of wet and drought, of heat and cold, and their effects,          especially    on
vegetation.
3. On the Constitution        of the Essential Oil of Cajeput. By Mr
   Maximilian Schmidl, Assistant to Dr T. Anderson, Univer
   sity of Glasgow.
   The author shows, that oil of cajeput is a mixture of an oil boiling
about 175° Cent., and one or more oils of higher boiling point. In
the present paper he investigates the first of those substances.
When purified by repeated distillation, it is a colourless, limpid fluid,
which by analysis and determination of its vapour density, is shown
to have the formula C2U H16 + 2HO.                When treated with an
hydrous phosphoric acid, it is decomposed,         and yields a mixture of
three different hydrocarbons,      to which the author gives the names           of
Cajputene,    Isocajputene,     and   Metacajputene.       The two      former,
though differing in properties, have both the formula C20 Hl(.                The
last, which is a very heavy oil, with a lemon yellow colour and
brilliant fluorescence,   is C40 H32.
   Monohydrate of Cajputene, C20 H16 + HO, is obtained by treat
ing the original oil with commercial sulphuric acid at the boiling
temperature, under particular precautions. The substance condenses
to 4 volumes    of vapour, although containing one atom of oxygen.
   Hexhydrate of Cajputene, C20 H16 + 6HO is obtained by agitat
ing the bihydrate with dilute sulphuric acid, and leaving the mixture
at rest for some      time.   Beautiful crystals     gradually    form in     the
mixture.     The hexhydrate melts at 120° and solidifies at 85°. It
is soluble in boiling alcohol and ether, from which it is deposited on
cooling.    Another compound,        the constitution  of which     is not yet
determined, is obtained     by the action of dilute    nitric acid in the cold.

                                          327
     Bihydrochlorate of Cajputene, C,0 H16 + 2H C1 is obtained by
 mixing the oil with one-third of its bulk of strong aqueous hydro
 chloric acid, and then passing a current of the gas through the mix
 ture   ;  after the lapse of 10 or 12 minutes, the whole solidifies into a
 mass of crystals.        These, when purified by expression and crystal
 lisation from       boiling alcohol, melt at 53", and when repeatedly
 distilled, or when acted on by alcoholic potash, lose one-half of
 hydrochloric acid, and yield the monohydrochlorate.                It is entirely
 devoid    of taste and smell, and in this respect differs remarkably from
 the  isomeric compound obtained from oil of turpentine.
    Monohydrochlorate of Cajputene,                                          fluid,
                                                 C20 H16 + HC1 is an oily
 with a pleasant ethereal odour.
     Tetrabromide of Cajputene, C20 H16 Br4.                 Bromine is added to
the bihydrate, and the mixture left for some weeks, when a granular
 substance     is seen to deposit.    As   soon as this is observed, the whole is
dissolved     in boiling alcohol, and on cooling, glittering scales, resem
bling cholesterin, are deposited.            It is soluble in alcohol and ether,
 melts at 60°, and may be          distilled apparently unchanged.
    Hydriodate of the         hydrate of Cajputene.        When iodine is   added
to oil of Cajeput, the temperature rises, and on cooling a black
crystalline compound is deposited.               This substance, after purifica
tion    by cold alcohol, forms black crystals           fusible at 80°, and very
readily decomposed.           Its formula is    C20 H16   HO + HI.
    Hydriodate of Cajputene, CJ0 H16 +               HI. To obtain this      com
pound, oil of cajeput is mixed with a solution of iodine in bisulphide
of carbon, and to this a solution of phosphorus, in the same men
struum, is added.       A   brisk reaction takes place, the temperature rising
to about       80°.    After   some weeks fine black crystals are       deposited,
which are soluble          in   alcohol   and    ether, and exceedingly stable,
being unaffected even by alkaline solutions.
    The author proposes to make the composition of the other constit
uents of the oil of cajeput the subject of a future paper.
4. On the       Action of Chlorine on Citric Acid, llexachlorinated
                      Acetone.       By John Galletly, Esq.
    At    the recommendation of         Dr Anderson, Glasgow       University,     I
have re-examined          the oil which Plantamour obtained by acting on
citric    acid with    chlorine.     Owing to the slowness with which it is
formed, its complete investigation is somewhat lengthened, and                  the

                                               328
following      results are all        I   have as yet obtained.                 A    considerable
part of the work has            been done in the Glasgow College Laboratory.
     Plantamour        found that when a strong solution of citric acid                              was
exposed      to   the action of chlorine            in the sunshine, a heavy oil                     ap
peared on the surface of the liquid, gathering in drops and sinking
to the bottom.     He describes the properties of this oil,* and ascribes
to    it the formula Ct Clt Os. In his examination of acetone.t
Staedeler found that a substitution                   product of this body, with                     five
atoms of chlorine replacing hydrogen, resembled Plantamour's                                       oil   in
every respect, and that the percentage composition of hexachlorinated
acetone       corresponded          exactly    with Plantamour's            formula.           There
could therefore be very little doubt left as to its composition;                               but as
I    had the following analyses made before                I    was aware           of Staedelers
suggestion, and as Plantamour procured a potash salt from it to which
he assigns a formula                having    eight atoms carbon, and as his                         own
analyses were not given in the memoir,                      I       have published            the fol
lowing to remove any doubt.
     Upwards of twenty half-gallon bottles filled with chlorine, having
a little of a saturated solution of citric acid in each, required many
weeks exposure to sunshine to                 yield about a fluid ounce of                    the oil.
There      seemed to be no other substance formed, unless, perhaps, hydro
chloric acid and water.               After drying over chloride of                        calcium       it
distilled entirely about 400° Fahr.                  I found its density        at 60° Fahr.             to
be       1'748.       Its properties agree very exactly with                        Plantamour'^

      The formula      C6 Cl6 O2 requires        265 x        0346  = 9-169.
    This oil is not  decomposed        by sodium, or at least very slowly, even
with  heat.    It  is not affected      by boiling     with oxide of silver, oxide
of mercury, or     even baryta water.
    When the substance         is agitated with water and cooled to 6° Cent,
a crystalline hydrate        is   formed,    which,     according   to Plantamour,
fuses at 15° Cent. = 59" Fahr.              This hydrate is C6 Cl6 O2+ 2HO
(Staedeler).     It often appears as        a net-work of long crystals on the
sides of the bottles in which the oil is formed, but these crystals may
sometimes be heated          considerably above the fusing point given             by
Plantamour without          melting.      I   found, on     keeping   the oil under
water for some months, that it turned into an opaque white mass
of crystalline    plates, which       did not fuse till heated to a tempera
ture   of about 40° Fahr.           When     these    crystals were melted again
 under water, they solidified shortly after cooling, without the fusing
point being lowered.         As this does not happen when the oil is freshly
made, it is probable that the hexachlorinated acetone passes into
 some isomeric modification         like the analogous body chloral.            This
 hydrate disolves very readily in ether in the cold, giving long crys
tals covering the sides of the basin as the ether evaporates.                If heat
 be employed to dissolve the crystals, the hydrate is decomposed                 and
 the oil separates.
    When    gaseous    ammonia is passed into hexachlorinated             acetone,  it
 becomes solid, and there is an evolution             of chloroform.      The solid
substance was washed with water, and crystalised from alcohol, when
it formed large pearly square tables. A few grains of this body
left some hours in the water-bath entirely volatilises.                Its character
and composition      agree exactly with trichloracetamide,             the following
numbers     having been obtained on analysis             :—

     The  same body is got by using aqueous          ammonia; the       decompo
 sition taking place according to the following equation           :—
     C4Cl6O2     +    NH3      =    C4CI, O2NH2            +    Ca
                                                                    H   CI,
     Hexachlor.     Acetone.         Chloracetamide.           Chloroform.
     The products of decomposition with ammonia are therefore the
 same as those obtained when this alkali acts on the chlorinated
 ethers and aldehydes.        I got a similar result with potash, which
 differs from the experience of Plantamour, who found the salt of                a
new acid which he names Bichloroxalic Acid.              On dissolving the oil
 in alcoholic potass, it  became   warm and       deposited chloride of potas
sium    ; and the alcoholic mother liquor, when left to spontaneous          eva
poration, gave long silky needles containing 53-08 per cent. chlorine.
This agrees exactly with trichloracetate of potass, which contains
52-85 per cent. chlorine.       The decomposition being evidently

    Hexachlor.      Acetone.          Trichloracetate Potas.        Chloroform.
     The paper in which    these crystals were pressed when heated with
water     gave a solution which abundantly         reduced   nitrate of silver,
showing the presence of formic acid from the further decomposition
of the chloroform by the alcoholic        potass.
    It seemed to me probable that, by treating ethylate            of  soda with
the oil, a decomposition would ensue in which a homologue              of chloro
form would be obtained, the ethyl          replacing   the hydrogen       in this
body.      The decomposition, however, turned            out   differently.     A
considerable quantity of trichloracetic          ether  was   produced, easily
recognised by its fragrant peculiar odour, and          among other bodies,
chloroform and common salt.
    The remainder of my material        was expended in one or two preli
minary experiments      on its action   on the volatile organic bases.          It

                                                331
appears that like ammonia they give ordinary chloroform,                                   when one
of   the radicals is hydrogen, the compound radical entering the                             chlora-
cetamide.         Thus the decomposition with aniline is                   as follows        :   —
(C12HS) H.,N           +     C6C16O2

                                                                                                 H
                                                                                                CI,
    Aniline.                Hexachlor Ac.         Trichloracetanilide.                 Chloroform.
The change occurs in the cold.                     Trichloracetanilide crystalises                    in
colourless prisms of some size.                  It    is insoluble,      or very sparingly
soluble, in cold water, but dissolves                    in warm      water pretty readily,
filling the liquid with silky needles as the solution cools. expected                  I
that, like chloracetamide, it would sublime without decomposition,
which    it partly did        ;    but there is a great loss, and much charcoal is
left.    I   had barely             enough     left to ascertain by          experiment              its
exact composition,            and the analysis of the sublimed substance gave
an excess both in carbon and hydrogen,                         but the method of forma
tion and its properties                leave   no doubt about the formula.                       As    I
intend to continue the subject,                I shall    probably have an opportunity
of publishing an exact analysis.                  When rapidly distilled with strong
solution     of   potass,    or with soda lime, there is formed besides aniline
a new volatile base, with a very peculiar pungent odour.                               This body
seems     rather easily           decomposed,    but     I   had   far too little to be able
to give a particular              account of it at present.
     When the oil          is mixed with a base containing              a triatomic         radical,
such as lutidine,           no chloroform       is evolved.          The liquids           mix, but
there is no apparent action in the cold, and when heat is applied,
the decomposition is so violent that only a charcoal-like                        residue is left.
  The summer being the only season when the oil can be conveni
ently prepared by Plantmour's process,                        I
                                           have made some experi
ments with a view to find other methods of procuring which   may             it,            I
mention here.              Staedeler found that chlorinated acetones were pro
cured by distilling citric acid with chlorate of potass and hydrochloric
acid.     The oil which           I   procured in this way had           a   specific gravity
of 1-726, and boiled between 360° and 400° F.                              It    was       evidently
a    mixture of his pentachlorinated               and hexachlorinated             acetone.           It
is   extremely       irritating, causing great             pain in the eyes, and can
scarcely     be distilled           except with       special arrangement for carry
ing off the vapours.              I   procured by     a      few distillations     a   portion of

                                        332
fluid    having   very nearly the specific gravity and boiling point of
 Plantamour's     oil, but the irritating action of its vapour was scarcely
diminished.       It  gave likewise   the solid compound when mixed with
aniline, so that there is no doubt about the identity of the bodies.
I   distilled in the sunshine the mixture given above, in the hope that
the product      might    be  only hexachlorinated      acetone,  but a violent
explosion put an end to the experiment.             The mixture obtained       in
this way is evidently the same           as  that  Plantamour got by      acting
with    chlorine on a citrate.
     The similar     oil got from     citric acid, oxide of manganese, and
hydrochloric acid, had only a        specific gravity of 1'50 and a portion
boils even below 212°, but the greater part seems to be pentachlo-
 rinated acetone.       From the low boiling point of some of the fractions,
 it may      be  questioned whether these bodies are all chlorinated
 acetones.
     The action of chlorochronic       acid is too violent, and    I  have    not
 been able to find a better mode         of preparing the oil than the      slow
 action of chlorine in the sunshine, which gives it pure without             any
 trouble.
     The pentachlorinated acetone decomposes with aniline in a similar
 manner with the body described, giving what is probably bichlora-
 cetanilide.
 5.   Notice of a Panoramic Sketch of Kashmir, recently received
             from India.       By Professor C. Piazzi Smyth.
     A   recent panoramic      topographical view of the interesting      region
 of Kashmir       having   been   just communicated      to me   by my friend,
 Mr Roger       Montgomerie,     Advocate,    I  have found it so remarkably
 well executed, in its almost photographic           representation of natural
 features of hill and plain, that       I  have obtained   his leave to present
 it  to the    Royal Society, accompanying         the presentation    with the
 following few particulars, abstracted from          MS. reports.
     The view in question is by Captain Montgomerie, B.E., who.
 under the general direction of Col. A. Scott Waugh, the Director
 of the Indian Trigonometrical          Survey, has been constantly at work
 in Kashmir        and   Thibet since 1855, and with such energy and

                                          333
success, that he has completed the accurate triangulation,                      as well as
the topographical       surveying, of 40,000        square miles of country in
four years.      The whole of that extent, too, lay in a very difficult
region,     abounding in snowy peaks ; one of which, a newly dis
covered point on the Kara-Koran,                is probably         the second    highest
mountain       in the world   ;    the measured height,              subject only    to a
small probable correction, to            be determined          by an extensive level
ling operation now in progress, being 28,278 feet.
    The most important part, however, socially of the whole region
visited, was the world-famous valley of Kashmir, where the splen
did climate, traces of an ancient civilization, and considerable present
wealth, skill, and industry,        combined to add their influence to the
beauties of mountain scenery.
     Of    the leading features in the physical                geography of Kashmir
Captain       Montgomerie's       panorama      seems    to give        a very   accurate
idea   ;   for, before the skill of the artist      was        called in to represent
light and     shade, the vertical       and horizontal         angles between      all im
portant      points were laid down with          a theodolite.           In    length,     he
describes the valley to measure one hundred and ten miles, in a                      S.E.
and    N.W.    direction, with a breadth of about seventeen                   miles, and a
mean elevation above the sea of 5200 feet.                     A   considerable portion,
or about ninety miles in length,              is so nearly flat, that the river
Vedusta (Jhelum), which flows through           navigable for that
                                                         it,   is
extent in large boats. The flat ground is, however, in two terraces,
the upper one consisting of remains of an ancient clayey stratum,
some two to three hundred feet thick. It found often in isolated
                                                        is
patches, several miles long and broad, with steep cliff-like edges.
   The higher level thus formed was once artificially irrigated, but
isnow sadly neglected, while the greater part of the lower level                            is
subject to inundation, and   more or less in
                                   is         marshy condition, or
                                                           a
absolute lake, as in the immediate neighbourhood of the capital city.
The country,       however,   including      the surrounding            mountains,       still
contains no less than 4606 villages, spread over an extent of 8100
square miles.
     On the      of the hills cultivated tracts are again met with
               slopes
alternating with grazing grounds, and forests of cedars, pines, and
firs. At 7000 and 9000 feet these predominate while above that      ;
level, and extending to 12,000 feet, there are grassy regions visited
   VOL. IV.                                             Y                2

 by the ponies, cows, and sheep, during half June, all               July,   August,
 and half September       ;  these   being, in fact, the only months when
 localities  so elevated    are free from snow.         On the higher          peaks,
 rising to 15,000 and 18,000          feet, snow is perpetual;        and there are
large glaciers between their spurs.
    Even when among the smaller hills, the surveyor's labours                     were
 by no means      light; and according to the extensive experience of
 Colonel    Waugh, the Director of the Indian operations, it is not
often that sufficient mathematical and artistic skill are found in any
one individual, conjoined to the necessary        bodily vigour; t. e., to be able
to clamber out of hot       Himalayan valleys up the         steep slopes leading
to exposed and windy eminences, and there stand uninjured, while
making all the necessary observations, with the full amount of atten
tion to accuracy and fulness of detail that is proper            ;  and even when
these desirable qualities are found, they do not last, he says, in the
generality    of individuals    more than a few seasons.
    The inconveniences, however, of the lower country, and the                 " fill
ing    in" survey, were greatly surpassed by what                 was   experienced
during the scientific part of the triangulation,           which was necessarily
for the most part carried on amongst the peaks of the snowy range;
out of sixteen principal        stations    in Thibet, fourteen        being above
 15,000 feet high, and two of them, Shinishah and Shunika, being
respectively 18,417 and 18,224 feet.             Nevertheless, no pains were
spared in procuring      good work, as the following           extracts    may best
show in Captain Montgomerie's            own words   :—
    " 12. The triangulation depends on the Kashmir                     series  which
emanates from a side of the            N.W. longitudinal        series in the low
hills near Sealkote.
    13.   " In  order to connect the triangulation           in the Punjab        with
Kashmir, it    was necessary to carry the triangles across           the Chatadhar
and    Pir Paujal   snowy ridges.       This was done by taking        observations
from the tops       of the snowy      peaks   best adapted to form a series
of symmetrical      polygons and quadrilaterals.          In this way the       trian
gulation    has been carried       on   systematically     from the foundation.
It  consists of one main axis, viz., the principal triangulation,              which
is   composed     of  polygons      and   quadrilaterals.        From     this    axis
diverge numerous minor series of triangles, which, starting from                   one
side of the    principal series, are tested by closing on another             side of
the   same, or upon a side of the N.W. Himalayan series.

                                          335
      " 14. From     these minor      series,   secondary     stations   have   been
  fixed, so as to cover the whole country with tested trigonometrical
  points.
      " 15. Though      the country     to be surveyed was         so elevated,  the
  rigorous   rules of the Great Trigonometrical             Survey of India were
  adhered to throughout.
      " 16. The highest points suited to the triangulation were always
 occupied, and observations were taken from stations upwards of
  16,000   feet above the level     of the  sea.
      " 17. On the principal series of                     the observations were
                                              triangles,
 invariably   made to luminous signals, viz., heliotropes and lamps, not
 withstanding    the physical   difficulties and the severity of the climate
 on the snowy peaks, so especially trying to the natives of India who
 served the signals.
     "  18. Numerous      observations being required, it was necessary for
 me to reside on the peaks for at least two days and nights, generally
 more.
      " 19. Some of the peaks below 14,000 feet lose the greater part
 of their snow by September       ;  but practically,    it  was necessary to ob
 serve from most of the stations earlier in the season, when the snow
 was still heavy at 11,000 feet.

            Occasionally, in consequence of clouds and storms, the party
Lad to remain pitched on the snow for upwards of a week at a
time.
     "21.   On the     Pir Paujal    peaks, the electricity       was  so trouble
some, even when there was no storm, that it was found necessary to
carry a portable lightning conductor for the protection of the theo
dolite.

•           Space sufficient,
be got quite close to the stations on the peaks ; during the day this
did not matter, but at night, though the distance might not be more
than 200 yards,       it  was rather     a difficult matter to get back from
the Observatory tent to the camps, after           I had finished taking the ob
servations.     Soon after sunset the surface of the snow becomes as
slippery as glass, affording      by no means a satisfactory footing on a
narrow ridge, with a precipitous slope, or a precipice, on either side."
    In addition to these physical difficulties, it should be mentioned
that there were others of a political kind ; for Kashmir and Thibet
are independent countries, and the inhabitants saw their hills as

                                     336
cended   and encamped       on  by  British surveyors with great distrust.
Nevertheless,    Captain Montgomerie       displayed   so much tact that he
completely won the confidence and regard at last both of the Maha
Rajah Golab Sing and the Maha Rajah Rumheer Sing. Then                     the
too memorable mutiny of 1857 broke out; and while most of                  the
captain's European assistants were withdrawn           to assist in the mili
tary operations,    the natives who were left      with him had come from
the same plains of Hindostan as the rebellious Sipahis, nevertheless
all the attendants proved faithful ; and except on one occasion the
progress of the survey was not interfered with.
    It will thus  be seen, that the great    Indian trigonometrical survey
which began amongst the pestilential jungles of southern India, and
worked gradually, northward under Lambton and Everest, has now
at last reached the greatest mountain chain in the world ; and never
before were such great heights submitted to the processes of accurate
geodesy.     The occasion appears to have called forth a deal of pecu
liar talent among our Indian officers ; and amongst those who haTe
specially shone forth in this calling was an assistant of Captain Mont-
gomerie's, who subsequently joined the army before Delhi and Luck-
now, and was killed before the latter place by an accidental explosion
of powder.     He was lamented much by the surveyors, among             whom
he   was  unrivalled   in physical    power, endurance, and cheerfulness
under fatigue   ;  his adventures and achievements amongst the snowy
mountains had been the frequent theme of praise and admiration in
 many an encampment        ;  and he had intended to devote his rare and
splendid qualities as a mountain         surveyor, had he survived,     to the
 exploration  of central Asia on rigorous principles.
    Captain   Montgomerie      is  now actively     at work,   continuing    in
 the higher regions of Thibet what he began and carried out            so well
 in the lower valley of Kashmir.

     (Falconer), which have recently flowered and fruited in
     the Edinburgh Botanic Garden.                 By Professor Balfour.
     The author     gave an account     of the cultivation     of plants of Asa-
 foetida   in the Edinburgh Botanic Garden since the year 1842, and
 of the flowering and fruiting of specimens in 1858 and 1859.                  He
 then described the characters of the plant (Narthex Asafcetida                 of

  plant, by photographs, and by drawings from the accurate pencil of
  Dr Greville.
  2. On the Composition         of the Glassy Surface of some Vitrified
     Forts. By Thomas Bloxam, F.C.S., Assistant Chemist to
     the Industrial Museum of Scotland.
     The present paper was undertaken at the suggestion of the late
  Professor George Wilson, as forming an interesting inquiry, both to
 the antiquarian    and the chemist, and as a sequel to the paper           upon
 old Scotch glass, communicated          by me   to this   Society some time
 since.
     The investigation had for its object, —
     1st,  To ascertain the exact composition of the glassy surfaces of
 the various specimens.
     2d, The composition of the rocks upon which the glass was formed.
     3d,   To account for the formation of such glass by the information
 afforded by the first two inquiries.
     Vitrified forts, or sites, as some prefer to    call them, are   spaces of
 ground enclosed    by a wall composed of pieces       of rocks placed      upon
 each other without      mortar, and the surfaces of which are covered
 with a glassy matter.       It is scarcely the province    of the chemist      to
 speculate as to the purpose for which these sites were erected, or the
manner in which the vitrification was brought about           : we   will there
fore proceed with the inquiries set forth at the commencement.
    Of the many vitrified forts existing in Scotland, two of           the   best
were selected for investigation — the       one,  " Duno'deer,"    from Aber
deenshire, kindly forwarded by Mr          Stuart   of the Society of Anti
quaries ; the other,
                          " Knockfarrel," from Strathpeffer, Ross-shire,
procured for me by my friend Dr M. Thomson.
    Both    these specimens exhibited vitrification in a marked degree.
The specimen from Duno'deer presented two surfaces of a vitrified
nature, the one being more porous in appearance than the other                   ;
separate portions     of these    surfaces were carefully      broken off for
analysis, and distinguished as upper and under surface, the under
one being the more porous.           The specimen was coated with moss
in parts, but these       were excluded    from   the quantity    selected   for
analysis.      The vitrified surfaces were spread over rocks of       different

                                        339
nature, such as coarse sandstone,           and pinkish white       portions     of  a
body resembling felspar.
   By a preliminary test, the powdered glassy matter was found to
contain metallic iron, and where the vitrified material existed in
sufficient quantity, the following points were ascertained             : —
                     1.  The specific gravity.
                    2. Action of alkalies and acids.
                      3. Chemical composition.
   The specific gravity ascertained in the manner usually                adopted    in
the laboratory was found to be 2-35.
   The method       used  for the analysis    was the same      that is generally
employed       for silicates, the iron,    as  peroxide,    separated from the
alumina by reduction in hydrogen, and subsequent separation by
permanganate of potash ; the metallic iron was estimated by measur
ing the quantity of hydrogen evolved from a known weight                    of sub
stance.
   The alkalies present         were  estimated by fusion of the substance
with baryta.
   The upper surface of Duno'deer was soluble in acids to the amount
of 20-46 per cent., consisting of silica, peroxide iron, protoxide of
iron, alumina, and lime.
    Alkalies acted upon it to a small extent, dissolving only 0-93 of
a grain per cent., which was composed            mainly of silica and alumina.
   The quantitative composition          was found to be the following        : —
       Silica,                       46-80

                                     9998
   The under surface of this specimen           was not so uniform       in appear
ance as the upper            one, small   crystals   resembling     felspar     being
scattered through it       ;  these crystals, however, were not included            in
the portion taken for analysis.           As the vitrified   surface was smaller
in extent than that of the preceding specimen,               the   action of acids
and alkalies had to be omitted.

                                      10052
   The body resembling felspar was next examined ; the crystals did
not effervesce    with acids, were easily powdered, and, when heated
at the blow-pipe       flame, they fused at the edges,              and were easily
marked with a knife.
   The specific gravity          was     2-37, and the chemical composition: —
      Silica,       .        .          78' 45    Oxygen ratio as 1 : 5.
      Alumina,     .         .         13 39
      Lime,        .         .           148

                                      100-77
   From the     above analysis,        the substance most resembles albite           or
soda-felspar  ;  the excess      of silica, and consequent reduction of             the
oxygen quotient, may be accounted for by the fact of its having
undergone considerable weathering, and also that small quanities                      of
quartz    might    have    been       associated    with the specimen         used for
analysis.
   The sandstone forming part of the fort                  was  of  a coarse variety,
and evidently, from its appearance, had been exposed to considerable
heat ;   it contained     less    silica    than   is usually    found     in building
sandstones.
   Analysis afforded the following results             : —
                  Silica,          .           .         .      6880

   The last specimen of vitrified fort examined was from Knock-
farrel ; the vitrified portion was very distinct, but owing to the
small quantity at my disposal, the preliminary experiments                      had to
be omitted.       The rocks collected in the immediate vicinity were for
the most part red granite and gneiss.
   The specific gravity was         2-85, and the chemical composition             —
      Silica,       .        .     54-42
      Peroxide iron,         .     15-19       Oxygen ratio as      1 : 2.
      Alumina,       .        .     1972
      Magnesia,      .         .     2°49
      Lime,          .        .      6-42      Oxygen quotient,     0'57.
      Soda,          .        .      007
      Potash,        .        .      061
                                    9892
   It  will   be seen   by comparing       the whole analyses, that the two
surfaces of the vitrified fort Duno'deer,           differ from each other in
very slight degree, and, from the presence of alumina and soda, it
appears most probable that the felspar with which                  it is associated
has played an important          part   in   the formation      of the glass, its
fusion being aided by the alkali furnished            in the ashes of the wood
used, the lime might also be derived from the same source.
   The vitrified fort, Knockfarrel, resembles that of Duno'deer,                    al
though not closely, and from the fact of micaceous rocks being found
in the vicinity, it     is  most likely that these rocks entered into the
composition of the vitrified material.
    Of the small quantity of metallic iron found in Duno'deer it per
haps is scarcely necessary       to say much ; but       it is quite possible that
it may either have existed       as such    in  the basaltic rocks, or have been
reduced from the state of oxide, a constituent              of augite and olivine.
   The following general conclusions may             be drawn from the infor
mation afforded by the analyses         :—
    1st, That these vitrified surfaces must have been produced by the
bringing together of certain rocks, and exposing them                      to a high
temperature.
   2d, That these rocks were not collected without regard                      to their
relative powers of melting.
   3c/, That such a collection of rocks, basaltic, gneiss, and felspathic,
would at high temperature produce a glass with wood ashes, simi
lar in composition      to these vitrifications.

3. On the Reduction          of Observations of Underground Tempera
    ture,    with applications to Professor Forbes' Edinburgh
    Observations        and the continued          Calton      Hill    Series.        By
    Professor     William Thomson, Glasgow.
    The principle followed in the reductions which form the                      subject
of this communication         may be briefly     stated thus     :—
     The varying temperature during            a year, shown by any one of the
underground       thermometers on an average for a series                 of  years, is
expressed by the ordinary            method in a trigonometrical              series of
terms representing         simple harmonic        variations*,    — the first     having
a year for its period, the second          a  half year,   the    third a third      part
of a year, and so on.          The yearly term of        the   series is dealt with
separately for the thermometers             at the different         depths, the half
yearly term also separately, and           so on, each term being treated            as if
the simple periodic variation which it represents were the sole varia
tion experienced.         The elements into which the whole               variation     is
thus analysed are examined            so as    to test their agreement with the
elementary formulae        by which Fourier expressed the periodic varia
 tions of temperature in a bar protected from lateral conduction,                    and
experiencing a simple harmonic variation of temperature at                     one end,
    * By a simple harmonic variation     is meant  a variation     in proportion   to the
height of   a point which moves uniformly in a vertical circle.

                                                    343
or in an infinite solid                  experiencing         at every point        of an     infinito
piano through            it    a variation        of temperature according             to the same
elomentary law.                 In any locality in which the surface of the earth
is sensibly plane and uniform all round to distances amounting                                     at
least to considerable multiples                    of the depth of the lowest thermo
meter, and in which the conducting power of the soil or rock below
the surface is perfectly uniform                    to like distances round and below
the thermometers, this theory must necessarily be found in exces
sively close agreement with the observed                             results.      The comparison
which     is made        in     the investigations            now brought         forward must be
regarded, therefore, not as a test of the correctness of a theory
which has mathematical certainty, but as a means of finding                                      how
much the law of propagation                       of heat into the soil is affected by the
very notable deviations from the assumed conditions of uniformity
as to surface, or by possible inequalities of underground conductivity
existing in the localities of observation.  When those conditions of
uniformity are perfectly fulfilled both by the surface and by the
substance below               it,   the law of variation         in the interior produced by
a   simple harmonic variation                     of temperature         at the surface, as        in
vestigated         by   Fourier, may          be stated in general terms in the three
following propositions               : — (1.) The      temperature at every interior point
varies according to the simple harmonic law, in                           a     period retarded by
an equal interval of time, and with an amplitude                                 diminished    in one
and the same proportion, for all equal additions of depth.              (2.) The
absolute measure               in ratio of arc to radius, for the retardation of
phase,    is   equal to the diminution of the Napierian logarithm of the
amplitude      ;    and each             of these, reckoned per unit of length as to
augmentation of distance from                        the surface,        is     equal to the square
root of the quotient obtained by dividing the product of the ratio of
the circumference of                 a   circle to its diameter into the thermal capa
city of   a    unit of bulk of            the solid,     by   the thermal conductivity of the
same estimated for the period of the variation as unity of time.                                  (3)
For different periods, the retardations                         of   phase,     measured each in
terms of a whole period, and the diminutions of the logarithm of tho
amplitude,  all reckoned per unit of depth, are inversely proportional
to the square roots of the periods.
    The first series of observations examined by the method thus                                  de
scribed       were those             instituted     by   Professor      Forbes, and conducted
under his superintendence                    during five years, in three localities of

                                       344
Edinburgh     and the immediate neighbourhood          ;
                                                         (1.) The trap rock of
Calton Hill ; (2.) The sand below the soil of the Experimental Gar
dens ; and (3.) The sandstone of Craigleith Quarry.                In each place
there were, besides a surface thermometer, four thermometers at the
depths of 3, 6, 12, and 24 French feet respectively.               The diminu
tion in the amplitude, and the retardation          of phase in going down
wards, has been determined          for the annual, for the half-yearly,
third-yearly, and the quarterly term, on the average for these five
years for each locality.      The same has been determined for the
average of twelve years of observation, continued on Calton                 Hill  by
the staff of the Royal Edinburgh Observatory.
   The following results with reference       to the annual harmonic           term
are selected for example     :—

   If  Fourier's conditions of uniformity, stated above,           were fulfilled
strictly, the numbers shown in the second column for                each locality

                                    345
would be equal to one another, and equal to those in the third column.
The differences between the actual numbers are surprisingly small, but
are so consistent that they cannot be attributed to errors of observa
tion.   It  is possible they may be due to a want of perfect agreement
in the values of a    degree  on the different thermometric            scales ; but
it  seems more probable that they represent true discrepancies from
theory,   and are therefore      excessively interesting,          and possibly of
high importance with a view to estimating the effects of inequalities
of surface and of interior conductivity.         The final means of the num
bers in the second and third columns are

    The thermal capacities of specimens of the trap rock, the sand, and
the sandstone of the three localities were, at the request of Professor
Forbes, measured by Regnault and found to                 be respectively
                       •5283,   -3006,       and      -4623.
Hence, according to proposition (3), stated             above, the thermal con
ductivities are as follows : —

          Sandstone of Craigleith Quarry,            .        .      273-6
    These numbers do not differ much from those given by Professor
Forbes, who for the first time derived determinations                   of thermal
conductivity    in absolute measure from observations of terrestrial
temperature.      In  consequence of the peculiar               mode  of reduction,
followed   in the present investigation,        it may      be assumed     that the
estimates of conductivity now given are closer approximations                 to the
truth.    To reduce    to the English foot as unit of length, we must
multiply by the square of 1-06575; to reduce, further, to the
quantity of heat required to raise 1 lb of water by 1° as unit of heat,
we must multiply by 66-447 ; and lastly, to reduce to a day as unit of
time, we must divide by 365|-. 'We thus find the following results               : —
         Trap rock of Calton Hill,            .         .       .     23-5
         Sand of Experimental Garden,                           .     15-0
         Sandstone of Craigleith Quarry,               .        .     53-5
    These numbers show the quantities            of heat per square foot con
ducted in a day through a layer of the material one foot thick, kept
with its two surfaces ata difference of temperature of one degree, — the

                                                       346
unit of heat being, for instance, the quantity required to raise 1000
lbs of water by i^ooth of a degree in temperature.
   The same system of reduction applied to the observations con
tinued at the Calton          Hill         station, has led to results from which the
following are selected          :—

  By       these results   it will    be seen that the discrepancies from the theory
based on the hypothetical                      conditions of uniformity, noticed above                     as
found in the reduction of the first five years' series of observations, are
maintained with the same character, and to nearly the same amount,
in the succeeding series              of thirteen years.                   An investigation of          the
changes of conductivity              and specific heat, which,                   if   the ground were
level and the surface uniform, would be required to account for theso
discrepancies, is made, so far as the data suffice for determining them.
The paper concludes with the solution                                of   some practical        problems
regarding the conduction                   of heat through rock possessing                       the con
ductivity determined by the reductions which form the chief part of
the paper.
4. On a     Method of Reducing Observations of Underground
     Temperatures, with its Application to the Monthly Means
     recorded in the Report of the Royal Observatory of Edin
     burgh, &c.         By Professor Everett.
     In this paper the         same             general      method of reduction as that of
Professor Thomson, explained in the preceding                                    paper, is followed.
The numerical labour                 is,       however, much diminished                   by using     the
monthly means          given        in the obsorvatory roport as data for twelve

                                    347
equations of condition,    instead of the methods      by which    Professor
Forbes    had obtained data for twelve, and Professor Thomson             for
thirty-two equations of condition.          The method adopted in the
present    communication,    although not susceptible of such minute
accuracy as the more elaborate methods         referred to, seems to be as
accurate as is necessary for a    fair representation of the phenomena,
and has a great advantage in point of simplicity and ease of working.
In the present communication the practical methods of calculating
the amplitudes and arguments of the successive            terms in the har
monic expression of a periodic variation are fully explained, as it is
believed the method will be found useful in the reduction of almost

    One of the duties which         devolve upon me to-night, and         one with
which it is perhaps best that         I should begin, is the melancholy        duty

    I grieve   to add, that the last twenty-four        hours has added to       the
list of deaths the distinguished name of the Rev. Dr James Robert
son, Professor of Church History in the University of Edinburgh.
    As   I rejoice to hear that a detailed memoir of our late President
is to be communicated to the Society at a later period,                I shall   not
feel it incumbent on me to do more than trace the main outlines of
his public career.
    Sir  T. Brisbane       was descended    from an ancient and honourable
 family, whose representative occupied the high place of Chancellor
of Scotland in the middle of the fourteenth            century.     He    was   born
 in 1773,     and    entered the army        in  1789.      A  contemporary of
Arthur Wellesley,         he was early thrown into      his society in Ireland      ;

                                             351
  and thus began        a friendship      which was cemented by a close          com
  panionship     in arms, and lasted          to the end     of the great captain's
  life.   Sir Thomas Brisbane's active military service began in 1793,
  in which year his regiment formed part of the Duke of York's
  expedition     to   Holland.       From 1795 to 1798 he was engaged in
 the various affairs by which              the West India Islands were succes
 sively reduced.         It  was during his voyage out in 1795, that having
 been in imminent danger of shipwreck in a collier transport, from
 the ignorance of the captain, he was first led to direct his attention
 to astronomical observation.             "
                                             Reflecting," he says,          I
                                                                    " that might
 often, even in the course of my life and services, be exposed to
 similar errors, I was determined to make myself acquainted with
 navigation and nautical astronomy              ;  and for that purpose   I got    the
 best books and instruments,            and in time became so well acquainted
 with those     sciences,    that, when     I was   returning home,  I was enabled
 to work the ship's way          : and having since crossed the tropics eleven
 times, and circumnavigated              the globe,    I  have found the greatest
 possible advantage          from my knowledge of lunar observation               and
 calculations     of the longitude."
      Having acquired by purchase in 1799 the lieutenant-colonelcy of
 the 69th regiment, he returned to England, but finding that that
 regiment had meanwhile been sent to Jamaica, he was obliged to
 repair   to that    island    in the following year.          The corps of which
 Sir Thomas thus took the command appears to have                    been  brought
 by carelessness and inefficiency             on   the  part of its previous     com
 manders      into a very        disorganised      condition,  from  which    it  was
 speedily redeemed         under the management of Brisbane, and this so
 effectually   as to secure for him the highest encomiums of            Sir George
 Nugent, then governor of Jamaica.
      Sir Thomas Brisbane's health having suffered severely from the
 effects   of climate,      he was     obliged    to retire on half-pay, when in
 1804 his regiment           was    ordered to India.       But in 1810     he    was
 appointed to the staff at Canterbury               as assistant adjutant-general     ;
 and on the army going out to Portugal, he applied for an appoint
 ment     under    his old friend        Sir Arthur Wellesley.        In 1812       he
secured this great object of his ambition, and as brigadier-general
                                                                               " The
joined the head-quarters of the army then at Coimbra.
Duke," says Sir Thomas,            " received me with the utmost kindness, and
said he was glad to         see me, as he      had two brigades vacant for me."

                                          352
     Sir Thomas       remained      in this    high command throughout the
 remainder of the Peninsular war, and for his distinguished services,
 especially at the battle of Orthes          on    the 27th February 1814, he
 had the honour        of receiving by name the thanks              of the British
 Parliament.
    At    the  close   of the Peninsular war, Sir Thomas Brisbane was
 selected   for the command         of  one   of the brigades which were          then
 sent out to Canada, where he used his influence in putting an end
 to the barbarous practices too often resorted to by both parties in
 the unfortunate war with America.                The  escape   of Napoleon      from
 Elba recalled Sir Thomas          in haste to Europe, where, however, he
arrived too late to     take part in the final triumph of his great Com
 mander.       It  is interesting     to  read     Sir Thomas's account of          the
Duke's language when twelve fine fresh regiments                   of his best     and
oldest troops joined         him   at Paris.        Looking down the lines of
nearly 5000 men each, the Duke exclaimed,
                                                              " Had     I  had these
men at Waterloo,          I   should    not    have wanted       the   assistance of
Prussians."
    There is    one curious incident      of this period of Sir T. Brisbane's
life which    is specially interesting      to us.    It  is well known      how in
tense was the feeling       of bitterness against the French government
and people roused in the German nations by the cruel                      humiliation
they had all successively undergone from the successful tyranny of
Napoleon.        Some of the public buildings of Paris, commemorative
of his victories, were      saved only by the personal interference            of  the
Duke of Wellington.            It appears that another, the abode of no            less
celebrated a body than the Institute of France, was saved                    through
the appropriate      agency of Sir      T. Brisbane.        The claim thus      estab
lished on the favour of the most distinguished                 scientific  society in
the world, in addition to that founded on his own acquirements and
pursuits, was speedily acknowledged.                On the motion of Bouvard,
the French astronomer, Sir Thomas Brisbane's name was added, by
an unanimous vote, to that roll of membership, which affords, and
has long afforded, one of the most valued honours attainable                   by the
successful cultivators of science.          It  is impossible not to be reminded
by this circumstance of that other not dissimilar reward which                   Mil
ton,  in the proud consciousness of his own immortal powers, pro
mises to him who should defend and spare his house from the dangers
of   a captured    city : —

                                        353
                " Captain, or Colonel, or Knight in arms,
                  Whose chance on these defenceless doors may seize,
                  If deed of honour did thee ever please,
                  Guard them; and him within protect from harms.
                  He can requite thee, for he knows the charms
                  That call fame on such gentle acts as these   ;
                  And   he can spread thy name o'er lands and seas,
                  Whatever clime the sun's bright circle warms."
   No better tribute      can be    rendered to the military character and
abilities of Sir T. Brisbane,        whose active    professional   career closed
with the    end  of the war in 1815, than that rendered by the Duko
of Wellington in an answer which is recorded by our late President
himself. " On my return from America, the late Major-General Sir
Manby Power, and the late Lord Kean, informed me that they had
written to the Duke of Wellington at Brussels, offering themselves
for employment in the army which he was forming for Waterloo.
His    grace replied     that he     should be happy to comply with           their
request,    but he     could hold out no promise to them              until Sir T.
Brisbane had received the division               which he preferred.        This  I
learned    from    the above-named generals, but the duke never men
tioned it to me himself."
    In 1820 the continued favour of his old commander procured for
him the governorship of the important colony of New South Wales.
It  was this command at the Antipodes            which enabled     Sir Thomas    to
render    to astronomical       science   those   new and important        services
which procured for him, four years after his return, the gold medal
of the Royal Astronomical Society of London.                 He established, and
maintained     entirely at his own expense, the now celebrated observa
tory at Paramatta.          So early as 1808, when his health had com
pelled him to retire for a time from active service, he had erected
an observatory        at Brisbane,     his native    place  ;  and some     of the
instruments procured for this establishment were the first with which
observations were begun at the Antipodes.
    I  am indebted       to my friend      Principal Forbes for an interesting
note on that portion          of Sir T. Brisbane's life which bears most
closely on his connection with this Society.
    " Sir T.   Brisbane was elected        an   F.R.S.E. in 1811, but in       con
sequence     of his various military appointments             abroad, he did not
personally    take    much part in its proceedings            until about 1826,
 when his name appears on the list of the Council.                 He had,     how

                                          354
ever, manifested his warm           interest    in the Society by the contribu
tion of several papers connected with                his favourite subjects of     As
tronomy and Meteorology.              In  1832 he succeeded         Sir W. Scott     as
President     of the Society, an honour          which     he   fully appreciated to
the very last.       While his health remained tolerably good, he took a
very active and warm interest in the proceedings of the Society, and
to his considerable personal inconvenience he, for many years, came
by coach     from    Kelso   to  Edinburgh,       on   the first Monday of every
month during the winter, when he                attended the Club dinner, and
afterwards presided at the evening Meeting.
    "A   certain    simplicity   of character, combined with           a  dignity and
courtesy which       peculiarly     became     him, made       him deservedly       and
universally    popular    among the fellows.            The perfect disinterested
ness  with which he devoted himself to             science,   added to this favour
able impression        a  feeling    of sincere respect. Ho was lavish of
money when any scientific object was in view. Many an unfriended
but ingenious      person has been         encouraged by his liberality, which
only erred sometimes on the side of being too indiscriminate.
    " Sir Thomas
                       may be said to have spent, not one, but several
fortunes    in the cause       of science;     and all the while         his personal
habits were of the most            simple    and unpretending          kind.    About
seventeen    years ago, having       fallen   heir to a considerable property,
his first thought was how to            spend it best for the advancement of
his favourite sciences.        After consultation with          one   or two persons
on whose     judgment      he relied, he determined           on erecting the mag-
netical and meteorological          observatory at Makerstoun,            and on sup
porting the needful staff of observers at his own expense.
    " The valuable observations which were made there, most ably
superintended,      for  the most part, by           Mr   J.   Allan Brown,       were
afterwards printed at great length            in the Transactions          of the   So
ciety, at the joint expense of the Society and of Sir Thomas                      him
self.   Tho value of      these   records   — extending to three thick quarto
volumes — will be hereafter even more appreciated than they are at
present.     They form probably the greatest contribution made to
science  by Sir T. Brisbane; hardly even excepting the establish
ment of the Australian Observatory.                They have      a double interest
for us, as being a unique contribution              to the    science   of his  native
country   :  and he      was liberally      anxious      that the     Royal    Society
should be so far associated       with him in this truly patriotic work.

                                           355
    i!
       The Society has striven to show how much they appreciated the
zeal of Sir T. Brisbane in this matter by taking the initiative in
providing for the publication of the final, but             less continuous, obser
vations, both magnetical and               meteorological,   which     were    made   at
Makerstoun       subsequently to the year 1846, with which the records
contained in     Vol.     XIX.     of our Transactions    terminates.
    " Sir Thomas,         as  usual, entered warmly          into the scheme, and
defrayed an equal share of the expense.                 A  great part of the proof
sheets were put into his hands not long before his death                  ;  and it will
be    with a melancholy satisfaction that the fellows            will  receive, on this
first anniversary meeting            since  his death, the fasciculus containing
the last bequest to science             of our late eminent        and disinterested
President.
     " It  would     be unjust      to  Sir Thomas Brisbane's memory not to
add, that when from             increasing    weakness and disease          he  became
wholly     incapable       of attending      the meetings,       he, not     once,   but
repeatedly, placed his resignation in the hands of the Council.                     But
they, acting as just interpreters of the feeling of the Society on each
of those    occasions,     besought the veteran general          to remain      at their
head, confident         that, in heart at least, he was as devoted as ever to
the cause in which they, as well as he, had laboured."
     For myself,     I    must    express my great regret that           I  havo never
had the honour of knowing, or even                 seeing Sir Thomas          Brisbane,
and     that   therefore     I    have no means       of speaking, except        on the
authority of others, of those personal qualities which are alluded to
by Principal Forbes in the passage                  I  have now read. But from
other sources      I  know enough of the incidents and tenor of his life to
entitle me to say that, eminent             as  Sir T. Brisbane       was as a soldier
and as a man of science, he was               not less remarkable        for the   bene
 volence     of his heart, and the highest virtues                 of the Christian
character.
     Among the Fellows of this Society whom we                  have lost    during the
 present     year,   there     is   another   whose name       I  cannot pass by in
 silence, or with mere mention only,              I   mean the name          of Mount-
 stuart Elphinstone.          In all     probability   there are few members of
 this Society now present to whom this distinguished man                       was per
 sonally    known     :   because     the greater part of his life was spent in
 India, and the remainder             of it in very close retirement.            But his
 name is familiar to all of          us as one  of the   most eminent among thoso

                                         356
  whose courage and ability have          built   up   the colossal fabric of our
  Indian empire.      So far as active service is concerned, he was a              yet
  earlier  companion      in  arms of the great Duke than              Sir Thomas
  Brisbane.    Alternately acting as soldier and civilian, as in the earlier
 days of the
                " Company" all her great servants occasionally did, he
  took an active part in the campaign which founded the fame of
 Arthur Wellesley, and, to          use  the striking words of        Lord Ellen-
 borough on      a late occasion, " He       saw on the field       of Assaye     the
 promise of the field of Waterloo."
     Mountstuart Elphinstone has, however, a higher claim on the
 grateful recollection of his country.           When war had done its work,
 and the time had come for governing the people who had been                     con
 quered, his powers of administration             were as conspicuous         as his
 courage in the field.        By the universal consent of all who know            the
 history of our Indian empire, he is regarded as one                   of  the very
 greatest of those whose        wisdom and virtue        have tended to reconcile
 its people to British        rule,   and have founded those traditions             of
government which,         modified more or less by the progress of events,
 must continue in the main to be the guide, not only of us in India,
but of all nations who undertake           the difficult    and   responsible duty
of ruling other nations, different from themselves in race, language,
and religion.
     GeorgeBuist, LL.D.,F.R.S.S. L.and E., and G.S., another recently
deceased fellow     of the Society,     was   born at Tannadice        in the   year
 1805.      His father having       been  minister of that parish, which is in
the presbytery of Forfar, Dr Buist was educated at St Andrews,
and studied divinity for the purpose of becoming a minister of the
Church of Scotland      ;   but, though licensed to be a preacher, he never
was ordained as a minister of the          Church.       He cultivated with     assi
duity the study of         science,   especially    in its bearings     on  natural
history and geology, founded a provincial society for its prosecution,
and gained the       prize     offered by the Highland and Agricultural
Society for an account of the Geology of Perthshire, which is pub
lished in the Transactions        of that Society.       During his residence in
India he contributed          many     papers    of   interest   to  the scientific
societies   of that country.        In  addition to these, he also published
papers of interest on its antiquities         and history.        Many important
public    works   enjoyed much benefit from his              active co-operation.
Among      these may be mentioned the establishment at Bombay                  of an

                                        357
 industrial school for natives, wherein       a knowledge of    British manu
factures was taught, and which led the way to similar industrial               in
stitutions   for the other presidencies.       His energy and abilities were
appreciated by the Indian Government, notwithstanding                that he was
in frequent political opposition to it ; and when the superintendence
of the government printing-press and government Gazette at Allaha
bad became vacant,       Dr Buist    was appointed to   it by Lord Canning.
Dr Buist died      on a voyage to Calcutta,      on the 1st day of October
last.
    I wish   I were capable of presenting to the Society anything like
a really useful review of the progress of science            during      the year
 which is about to    close.     This  I  cannot pretend to do   ;   but perhaps
 I may be allowed to direct your attention          to one or two subjects to
 which that progress has been important.
    To begin with our own country, and with an investigation the
 importance and interest of which has been acknowledged by the
 Society in the grant of the Brisbane medal, —        I have  reason to believe
 that Sir Roderick Murchison has          been prosecuting with      farther  suc
cess his examination      and reclassification of the more ancient rocks of
 Scotland.     The clue afforded       some   years ago by the discovery of
 Mr   Peach, that the limestones of Duirness in Sutherland              contained
fossils of the Lower Silurian age, has been followed up by our distin
guished countryman        Sir Roderick, with his usual indefatigable per
 severance, and his usual sagacity of interpretation.              The result of
 his last researches   goes    far to extend the light already thrown on
 the rocks of Sutherland and Ross to the vast series of micaceous
 and quartzose strata which constitute the great bulk of the Western
 Highlands in the counties of Argyll and Inverness.                 And I think
 it a circumstance worthy of mention, that some years before the
discovery of the Sutherland         fossils, and before, therefore, any clue
from    organic   remains     had been afforded,     Sir Roderick Murchison
 had suspected that the whole series of metamorphic slates in the
district   to which   I  refer were nothing      more nor less than altered
strata of Silurian age. He expressed that suspicion strongly to
myself in 1850, when         I  had an opportunity of pointing out to him
some of the more characteristic beds in the neighbourhood of Inver
aray.     During this last summer and autumn,              he' has traced      the
upward     series of rocks from what he calls the fundamental               gneiss

in Sutherland and Lewis, southward to the islands of             I slay and Jura,
and by a close examination of the stratigraphical              relations, is now
prepared to furnish       proof of the truth of the conclusion to which by
a species    of instinct   he  had been led before.         In  one   of the  facts
upon which this determination           rests, I  think   I  can    venture, from
personal observation,       to confirm    his argument.        The term      gneiss
had been correctly applied by M'Culloch              to the fundamental rock
of the outer Hebrides, a rock which reappears in great mass on                  the
 south-west coast of Sutherland.          But unfortunately he applied          the
same     term to other rocks, which are now proved to overlie                  beds
 containing Lower Silurian fossils.         He thus confounded strata which
 are separated by immense ages         from each other. Now, Sir Roderick
 Murchison has pointed out the essential differences of lithological
 character which distinguish the fundamental               gneiss from all the
 rocks of the overlying       series.     When    these   differences    are   once
 pointed out, it is impossible to mistake the two.             The fundamental
 gneiss    is distinguished     by  the   predominance       of hornblende,       so
 thickly laid, generally in lines parallel       to the   stratification,  as fre
 quently to render the stone almost black.           The felspar and mica       are
 generally found in large separate crystals and plates ; and it is              not
 unfrequently     intersected    by veins and masses        in which the same
 mineral constituents are more perfectly mixed in the form of granite.
     To this rock, which is largely developed          in our North American
 possessions,    where also it is succeeded by        a very  -similar series     of
 overlying deposits, the term "Lawrentian"             has been applied by Sir
 William Logan.
     This term Sir Roderick Murchison proposes to retain for the
 oldest stratified rock yet known in the world.               Upon this funda
  mental Lawrentian gneiss are piled the vast series of Cambrian
  strata which constitute the great mass, and sometimes the whole, of
  the most striking mountain-forms on the west coast of Sutherland and
  Ross.     These strata are estimated by Murchison to measure some
  ten or twelve thousand feet in thickness.          Resting again unconform-
  ably   upon these      Cambrian     beds,  and capping with their white
  quartzites many of the mountains, the true Silurian rocks appear, dis
  tinguished   — mainly in    the limestone    bands,   but also, though more
  rarely, in the quartzites    — by   orthoceratites, and other characteristic
  fossils.   Intercalated   among these, and therefore         having their rela
  tive age clearly determined, occur those         other more crystalline and

                                         359
metamorphic strata to which the same term gneiss had been also un
fortunately applied.        But no two rocks can be more different than
those overlying     rocks from the fundamental            gneiss.    I have never
seen in any part of the South-west Highlands,                 among the moun
tains which M'Culloch          assigns to gneiss, any rock approaching in
character    to the gneiss of the Hebrides             and of the north.        The
question, however, will,     I have every reason to believe, be finally settled
by the proofs which are about to be brought                before the Geological
Society.   SirR.Murchison        has found that the islands of Islayand        Jura
present perfect repetitions of the phenomena of Sutherland, and that
the quartz rocks and limestones of Silurian age are superposed
conformably     and without       a  break by the micaceous and chloritic
series   which occupies such large tracts           on the opposite mainland,
and which, folding over a little south of Loch Tay, and clasping
round Schiehallion, again rises up to the north of Loch Rannoch,
and allows the lower quartzites and limestones to reappear.                    Very
curious questions arise as to the causes of the metamorphic                   action
which    has so completely        altered the structure       of  beds  lying over
others    which   remain     comparatively      unaffected.       Some geologists
have been inclined to deny the existence of true stratification               in the
micaceous chloritic       schists of the South-west          Highlands, and        to
assign the appearances to lamination or slaty cleavage.                I must    say
I  agree entirely     in the view taken by         Sir R. Murchison, that this
doctrine   is wholly untenable.            Indeed,  I   can  with difficulty    sup
pose   its being held by any one who is familiar with the districts
in which these rocks prevail.           It may safely be affirmed that there
is no one    indication    or feature of true aqueous stratification          which
is awanting, except the presence           of organic remains.       There are the
same alternations       of siliceous, muddy, and calcareous beds, which
everywhere characterise a long continuance of marine deposit thrown
down under various mineral conditions.
   It  is well to observe that this new classification            of the rocks in
the north-west of Scotland adds additional            force to an argument long
ago used    by Sir Roderick Murchison in reference to the bearing of
geological evidence on the great question of the beginning and suc
cession of life.      The Silurian strata, in which fossils have been
discovered, are more crystalline          and more highly metamorphic than
the Cambrian       strata   which     lie below them.        Yet, in Scotland at
least,   no organic     remains     whatever have as yet been            discovered

                                       360
throughout    the vast series    of   beds which     belong to those old de
posits  ; whilst elsewhere the few forms of life hitherto             discovered
indicate what   M. Barrande     has called a    " Primordial Zone."        These
successive  formations    have now been traced, and more or less exa
mined, in almost every region of the globe, and everywhere the same
limited assemblage of organic remains             has been     established  — the
same total absence     of any indication of terrestrial life — the same few
generic types, chiefly of crustacea, cephalopoda, brachiopoda, most of
 which have long since ceased to be, whilst one at least has survived
 every subsequent revolution,        and is still living in the present day.
 On the other hand, it     will no doubt    be argued by those who take an
 opposite view, that the circumstances attending this reclassification of
 the older rocks of Scotland tend more than ever to teach the necessity
 of caution in the interpretation of negative evidence. The abundant
 existence, it will be said, of organic life during the ages of the Silurian
 deposit is beyond question.      Yet all traces of it    have been obliterated
 absolutely throughout    a vast series of beds    :  in others, the indications
 are so exceedingly obscure that their character is altogether doubtful;
 whilst only in one or two thin seams of limestone, and in still rarer
 quartzite beds, has an unequivocal record been preserved of the highly
organised and abundant molluscan life of the Silurian seas.
    Before passing from the Geology of Scotland,             I  must direct the
 attention of the Society to the very beautiful geological map of this
 city and its vicinity which        has  been   lately published     by the De
 partment over which     Sir R. Murchison presides        as Director-General.
 The coal-basin, with its coal crops and faults, was the work of Mr
 Howel ; the rest was surveyed by Mr Geikie ; both these gentle
 men being geologists of the Government Survey.                 The admirable
 care and exactness with which they have given the minutest details
 of  a very varied and intricate district,    is an excellent example of       the
 high economical     as well as scientific   value we may anticipate of        the
 geological survey of the country.
     The oldest formation in this     sheet is the Lower Silurian, of      which
 two small patches occur along the southern edge of the map.                They
 belong   to the great     Silurian tract of southern Scotland,           against
 which the upper Old Red Sandstone and carboniferous rocks of                 the
 Lothians rest unconformably.           There are at present known only
 two areas of Upper Silurian strata in Scotland, of which one occurs
 in the Pentland Hills, and      is mapped in the present sheet.          It con

                                          361
sists  of highly inclined shales and sandstone.              Mr  Charles Maclaren
was the      first  to   detect organic remains          in these strata.     About
twenty-five     years ago he found two orthoceratites, but in a frag
mentary      state.    In   the year 1857, when the Geological               Survey
extended into the district in question,            Mr Geikie first    made    known
the richly fossiliferous character of these Silurian strata, the assem
blage of fossils unequivocally         indicating     the horizon of the Ludlow
 rocks of England.          On the    edges     of the upper Silurian      beds rest
 unconformably       the upper Old Red Sandstones and conglomerates,
 with enormous interbedded          sheets    of felstone, which form the chain
 of the Pentland Hills.
     The great Lower Carboniferous group               is well  shown in the area
 embraced by the present map.               It  occupies   the whole of the district
 between the Bathgate hills and the Pentlands,                 and contains in that
 region a seam     of limestone, which is the equivalent of the Burdie-
 house limestone on the east side           of the Pentland ridge, and also a
 seam of coal that appears to be           quite local.      The line of outcrop of
 these two seams, as traced on the map,                    will show the intricate
 character of the geological         details.      Perhaps    the most remarkable
 feature in the Lower Carboniferous              series of the Lothians is the
 abundance and variety          of its associated contemporaneous            igneous
 rocks.     There is    no well   marked       zone in the series which does not
 at some locality        in this region display          its sheets  of greenstone,
 felstone, or ash.
     The Carboniferous limestone of this            sheet shows characteristically
  the Scottish type of that sub-formation.               Its  base consists of lime
  stone  bands, with associated         shales, sandstone, and coals.          Above
 these comes the group of coal-bearing strata, known as the
                                                                              " Edge
 coals" of Midlothian.           But     these    are not the Coal-measures        of
  England, seeing that       above them there are bands of limestone, with
 true Carboniferous       limestone fossils.       The Millstone grit   has not yet
  been satisfactorily     determined, but its place may be represented by
  some   of the thick    sandstones   of Roslin.
     The Coal-measures proper, or " Flat coals" of Midlothian, oc
  cupy the centre of the Edinburgh coal-basin.                  They are truly the
  equivalents in position as well as fossils of the Coal-measures of
  England.
     It is deserving of remark, that while, in the Lower Carboniferous
 strata and in the "Edge-coals" of Linlithgowshire, volcanic rocks

                                      362
 abound, none occur in the Edinburgh coal-field,          although they were
 abundant in that district during the earlier part of the Carboniferous
 period.
     The system of parallel faulting of the Pentland Hills is also
 worthy of notice, as accounting for the small development of Lower
 Carboniferous strata on the east of the chain, and their great expan
sion to the west.    The highly inclined character of these strata           along
 the east  side of the hills (some being quite on edge, hence               called
 " Edge-coals"),    arises from the downthrow of the whole coal-field
against the older rocks of the chain.        A   detailed description of the
sheet from the geologists before named is at present in the press.
     The attention, not of geologists only, but of         men     of  science   in
 several departments, has, during this and the preceding year,                been
 fully awakened to the importance of a discovery which is really of
 much older date — viz., that flint implements, the work of man, are
 found in beds of drift gravel associated with the bones of the last
generation of the great extinct mammalia.           The full significance of
 this fact is only now being fully recognised, and many of the con
clusions which it may tend to establish are subject to much doubt,
and will probably form the subject of increasing            controversy.       But
 it is only necessary to have a clear idea of the          facts   as they have
been now ascertained, to see that one conclusion            at least is placed
beyond    all question — viz., that great physical changes on tho surface
of the earth, and these, in part at least, effected by the agency of
water, have taken place since the creation of man.
    Whether this conclusion carries the creation of man farther back
than had commonly been supposed, or whether it merely brings
nearer to us than we had before conceived, the last great changes
which    have produced the existing surface, is the main question on
which debate arises.        As geology gives no certain data for com
puting positive, but only relative time, this question is necessarily
involved in much obscurity.         But there are certain limits within
which, after all, the controversy is confined.          It   is well to observe
that, according to the principle on which geological times and epochs
are classified, the human epoch remains, after these discoveries, very
much where       it stood before.    It  is true that many of the large
animals, with which the traces       of man    seem   to be connected, are
now extinct ; but a very much larger number are              still living.    The

                                          3G3
Molluscan Fauna, which plays             so important    a part  in   ages  of  geo
logic time, is absolutely the same.             The general aspect of animal
life is the present aspect, with the exception that a certain number
of   species of the      larger Herbivora and Carnivora have become ex
tinct.      But such extinctions, local in many instances, and total in
some, have taken place in historic times, and are in visiblo                process
of accomplishment even now.               Such extinctions do not constitute a
new Fauna, nor, according to the received principle of classifying
past times, do they mark a new geological               age.    The era of man,
therefore, remains, geologically speaking, in the same relative                place
in which it       stood   before — the  very last and latest of the world.
     But the fact that human implements are found under great                   beds
 of gravel and of earth formed by water, whether of rivers or of the
sea, at an elevation which in either case would imply changes of
 level,    such as,     if general,   would be enough to revolutionize            the
 whole aspect of our now habitable surface, is a fact which casts new
 and important light         on the (geologically    speaking) very recent date
 at which those changes have taken place.
      Whether the men who formed the implements                  were or were not
 contemporary with the living quadrupeds whose bones are associated
  with    these    implements,    seems to me a subordinate        question.     The
 mere fact of such association may not absolutely                prove the point,
  because    it  is conceivable that tho bones       may have been       merely re-
  aggregated from an older fossiliferous deposit.             But    I suspect that
 the reluctance to admit the contemporaneity of man with those
  animals results from the reluctance to admit             man's priority to such
  physical    changes as are supposed          to separate    us   from    a Fauna
  typified by the Mammoth            and the   Elk.    If, therefore, the fact of
  such priority be proved from the stratigraphical           position of the flint
  relics,   wholly    independent     of any argument derived from organic
  remains, the importance of the question             respecting the human age
  of the great mammals will be much diminished.                   It may be well,
  therefore, to keep our attention firmly fixed on what is the really
  important question — the nature and position of the strata in which,
  and under which, the flint implements             have been interred.        Going
  no farther for light upon this question than the particular                beds at
  Amiens and Abbeville in France, where the implements have been
  found in greatest abundance, it is enough to record the facts.                 The
  flints are    embedded     in a stratum of gravel, which rests directly on an

                                         364
eroded   surface of the chalk, and contains along with the hatchets                the
bones  of the great extinct mammalia. This is again surmounted by
a bed  of sand from seven to ten feet thick, in which only a few rare
bones and implements            have been found.        This  is again capped by
a second     bed    of gravel from two to five feet thick        ;   and lastly,     on
the top   of all, is a bed of brick-earth, in which, as            if  to afford    the
very poetry of illustration, are to be seen the tombs of Roman Gaul.
Such is the position of the beds with reference to each other.                     But
what is their position with reference, not to each other, but to the sur
rounding country        ?   The gravel-bed extends to points upwards of a
hundred feet above        the level of the river Somme, which occupies the
bottom of the existing valley.           It  is described by Professor Rogers,
a   most    competent and accurate            observer,   as   extending       to   the
summits      of the plateaux which          determine    the existing drainage.
Whether, therefore, the water which formed those                beds were marine
or fluviatile,     in either    case such changes of level are implied                as
would be sufficient,       if general, to alter widely the existing distribu
tion of land and sea.
   Here, then, the question arises, Were those               changes     local— con
fined perhaps to the district of Western France               ?     Connected with
this question, another immediately occurs           :  Is  not this bed of gravel
identical in character and composition with similar deposits in other
countries    ?    Is   there anything    to distinguish     it from      the gravels
containing precisely the same mammalian bones which are familiar                      to
geologists in almost every country, and which have been recognised
every here and there over the whole of Europe,                    from     Siberia    to
Palermo,       and   from the basin of the Thames           to the valley of the
Danube     ?     So far as    I have been able to gather         from the       papers
which have detailed the facts,          there is nothing to indicate          any dif
ference whatever,         except that, at least until this discussion            arose,
human implements had nowhere else been recognised as associated
with the drift.         The   absence of such remains        elsewhere, however,
would go for little in establishing a difference, because it is clear
that the men who existed before the formation of the Abbeville beds
 were rude, and probably widely scattered savages,              distant outliers of
their race.     The chances, therefore, were infinite against the preserva
tion either of them or of their works. But even this distinction, it would
appear, is being broken down.            It  is now recollected that so long          as
sixty years      ago,   human implements had been           discovered in Suffolk

                                           365
  under    similar conditions, and the fact communicated               to the public
 in an archaeological journal            by  the discoverer       Mr Frere.        The
  spot has been      since visited by    Mr   Prestwich,     fresh from the Abbe
 ville   beds, and he recognises the same         phenomena.          But this is not
 all.     The scent,    once taken up, is becoming stronger            and stronger,
 every day.       Closely connected      with   the period of the drift-gravels
 are the ossiferous caves and caverns so common all over Europe
 where limestones prevail.          They have been long known to contain a
 profusion    of   bones   of  the   extinct as well as of living mammalia.
 Here, again, it is now confidently asserted that human implements
 are being found under conditions which leave no doubt that, whether
 man was or was not contemporary with these                   animals,    he must at
 least have preceded       the action of those     agencies      which brought the
 bones together.          The evidence in this         case   must necessarily      be
 more liable      to erroneous     interpretation    than in the case of imple
 ments found in undisturbed beds of gravel, because caverns must at
 all times have      been a resort    of  savage tribes whenever the entrances
 were accessible      from the surface.        But the      evidence    seems    to be
 such as is sufficient to convince examiners              so careful and acute as
Dr Falconer        and   Mr   Prestwich     of the undoubted priority of man
to that      diluvial action which appears to have swept into those
caverns their mixed contents.               But this is not all. It is now re
called to mind, that so long ago as 1833, a             M. Schmerling       had pub
 lished Researches into the Ossiferous Caverns of Belgium, in which,
not implements of man            only,     but his   teeth and his        bones,   and
portions of his skull, had been found so thoroughly                  mixed up with
the remains        of the lower mammalia,         as to    leave    in his mind     no
doubt,     if not of their contemporaneous          life,   at least of their con
temporaneous        entombment       in the   spots where they are now found.
These are remarkable facts ; and in so far as they indicate that the
phenomena of Abbeville are closely related to others observed                       in
many different parts of Europe,           they go far to prove that the French
gravel-beds      were due to no mere local cause,             but to somo diluvial
action which was general,           and therefore      in all probability     due   in
great part to the waters of the sea.
     I  need   not point out how many and how interesting                    are the
questions which this discovery raises in our minds.                    Was this in
cursion of the waters of the sea, over a pre-existing land, sudden
and    transient, or gradual,     and   of long duration       ?   In the Abbeville
    vol. iv.                                                             3 c

                                          366
 beds there seems      to be clear      evidence    of four  successive    stages    of
 submergence, each distinguished from the other by different mineral
 conditions.     The first   bed,   that in which the bones       were entombed
 along with the human implements, indicates an action strong,                   if not
 violent, but not of long duration.          The    second indicates, by its finer
 materials,    the action of a gentler         force.    The third    seems     to   be
 very much a repetition          of the first    ;  whilst the last can only         be
 accounted for on the supposition             that fine sediment had time            to
 accumulate in comparatively tranquil              waters.   The interest     of   the
 question is very much centred in the nature of the action                     which
 began this     series of events.       Perhaps it may be well to look at the
 conclusion come to in respect to the origin of the mammaliferous drift-
 gravel by the geologist who has devoted                most special attention       to
 the subject, and before the discoveries of Abbeville had disturbed
 any preconceived idea.          I  find  Mr Prestwich,     in a lecture delivered
 in 1857, coming to this conclusion in respect to the                     ossiferous
                                  "
 gravels of the Thames : — Taking into consideration the                 absence of
 contemporaneous       marine remains, and noting the immense mass                   of
 but slightly worn debris derived from and covering irregularly the
 sedimentary deposits      ;  and the fact that      it has evidently  been trans
 ported from greater or less distances, combined with the occurrence
 in the gravel of the remains of large land-animals,              of trees,   and of
 fresh-water     land-shells,    wo have,    I conceive,   at all events in these
 facts,  indications   of at least     one land-surface      here destroyed, and
 its rocks, plants,     and animals involved in one common wreck and
 ruin."
    An able and elaborate paper on the " Distribution of the Flint-
 Drift of the South-east of England," &c., was communicated to the
 Geological Society of London by Sir R. Murchison in 1851.                       The
 phenomena he describes seem everywhere to be a precise repetition
 of those of Abbeville.        Everywhere      the flint-drift, which is often,     as
 there, covered by brick earth, clay, or loam, is characterised by the
 bones of the great extinct       mammalia, and everywhere, according to
the author's view, gives          evidence of sudden        and   violent   diluvial
action.     Everywhere,       also, this drift-gravel rises high        above the
levels of the existing        drainage, whilst, at the same         time, it gives
evidence   that the general configuration           of the surface   was substan
tially the    same   as now.       Everywhere,       also, wherever    shells have
been    preserved, they belong to our existing fauna, and thus prove

                                        367
 beyond a doubt that, geologically speaking, the age of the drift is the
                                     " In                          " the
 age of the      existing world.            short,"    he  says,          cliffs of
 Brighton     afford distinct proofs that a period        of perfect quiescence
 and ordinary shore action, very modern in geological               parlance, but
  very ancient as respects history, was followed            by oscillations     and
 violent fractures of the crust, producing the tumultuous               accumula
 tions to which attention has been drawn."
     Unless, then, the Abbeville       beds   of drift  can    be separated from
 those so widely prevalent in other countries, the discovery of human
 implements      underneath this drift will rather tend to bring nearer to
 us than had       ever been    supposed     some   great and sudden diluvial
 action, than to cast any very clear light on the absolute time — that
 is, on the time measured by years or centuries — which has elapsed
 since the creation of our race.        The facts which      have   been brought
to light prove, indeed, clearly enough, that since man walked the
 earth some great changes have affected the condition of its surface ;
and it    is impossible as yet to say what bearing            this discovery may
 be found to have on that remembrance of at least one great catas
trophe, which is not more a part of sacred history than it is of pro
fane tradition.
     We must not, however, shut our         eyes to the indirect effect which
this discovery must have      on the question of positive time.        In the first
place, there is a school of geologists, led by our distinguished             coun
tryman Sir Charles Lyell, who disbelieve generally in               those conclu
sions which point to violent and sudden changes             ;   and, in the next
place,  it must    be remembered that changes         which in point of geolo
gical time might well be accounted rapid, might nevertheless well
occupy thousands of our years.           There is proof in those gravel- beds
of the Soinme of a double motion,          one   of submergence to the depth
of certainly more than 100          feet,  another of subsequent elevation,
during which the immense mass of material which had been brought
down and deposited by water, has been worn through and broken into
escarpments,      either by the existing stream or by more powerful
currents.      We have no data from which to measure in years the
time which the accomplishment of such a series of changes may
imply.      But   I  think the general impression left upon the mind
must be in favour of a very high antiquity.               Farther light may      be
cast upon     this subject   if the drift-gravels of France, the south           of
England, and other countries,         can   be co-ordinated      with any one of

                                        368
  tho stages of operation to which we owe the superficial deposits of
  Scotland and the north of Europe generally.           It is well known that
  in these   last there is one prominent characteristic which is absent
  farther south.     I  mean the abundant proofs      of glacial conditions, or
  an arctic climate.      On this subject there is   a paper of great interest
  in the last  '•
                  Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society," by Mr
 Jamieson, founded on observations made mainly in the county of
  Aberdeen.      The cycle of changes which this geologist thinks        can be
 clearly traced, as necessary to account for the superficial        deposits of
 our own country, amount to no less than five great epochs, including
  two of submergence and two of elevation, and involving changes of
 level to the extent of more than 2000 feet.            Scotland has long ago
 furnished    evidence   as clear as that founded     on the  French flint   im
 plements, that at least previous to the last of these elevations man
 had reached her shores, and navigated her rivers and estuaries in
 those rude canoes,     hollowed out of trunks of oak by stone hatchets,
 which have been frequently found in elevated beds of silt and gravel
 in the valley of the Clyde.          And hero we strike upon evidence
 which has some bearing upon the question of time.                Closely con
 nected with the period      preceding the last elevation of the land, we
 have proof that an arctic climate prevailed over a large part of the
 northern    hemisphere, whose climate is now comparatively temperate.
 But this period seems clearly to have been one of long duration — that
 is to say, of such duration, and lasting under such conditions of com
 parative rest, as to allow the development of a glacial fauna.           Close
 to my own residence on the Clyde,          each low   ebb exposes   numerous
 examples of the Pecten Islandicus, and of those very large Balani,
 which are now confined to arctic seas.       These beds of shells, which are
all of existing    species, but of species which have retired from our now
more genial      temperature to a northern      habitat, were first described
by my friend      Mr  Smith of Jordanhill,     and his observations and    con
clusions have since been abundantly confirmed.             We havo no    know
ledge how this period was brought to a close.              But there seems to
be evidence that it had come to an end, and that for a long time
before    tho last elevation of      the   land, and before man had ap
peared in Scotland.         This seems   to  be a legitimate deduction from
the fact that the canoes       in the elevated    Clyde   beds are formed of
oak of large dimensions and of great age.             Forests which afforded
such timber must have flourished in a climate not much more rigor-

                                        3G9
  ous than that which exists at present.        Here again, then, the earliest
  footprints of our    race  are traced up to a point,       preceding indeed
  some important physical changes, but       clearly subsequent    to the estab
 lishment of all the main conditions which now affect the distribution
  of animal and    vegetable   life.
     As regards the extinction of       some animals,    I have spoken as      if
 the contemporaneousness of man with them whilst              yet living ought
  not to be absolutely assumed         merely from the fact that his imple
  ments are associated     with their   bones.    But  on this  point new evi
 dence is being       rapidly collected and brought together.             Mons.
 Lartet, a distinguished French naturalist, has found what he consi
 ders to be distinct evidence of the mark of human weapons on various
 parts of the skeletons of the extinct mammalia of the drift.             These
 marks have been detected on the skull of the Megaceros Hibernicus,
 or great Irish elk, — an animal which stood some ten feet high — on
the bones of the Rhinoceros tichorinus, and on those of various species
of the ox and deer, which are now either extinct or confined to the
 last remnants of a declining race. The marks are of various kinds —
some of them peculiar — indicating a sort of sawing with some instru
 ment not of the smoothest edge.           M. Lartet has ascertained that
these blows and cuttings could not be made except on fresh bones             —
that is to say, on bones undried and retaining their animal cartilage.
 Farther, he has succeeded in producing on the bones of existing
 animals    precisely the same peculiar forms of incision         by using one
of the old flint implements found in the same beds of gravel, whilst
he has equally found that similar marks are incapable of being pro
duced by implements of metallic edge.           His conclusion   is thus stated
by himself     : — " If,  therefore, the presence     of worked flints in the
diluvial banks of the Somme, long            since  brought to light by      M.
Boucher     de Perthes,     and    more recently confirmed by the rigorous
 verifications    of several of your learned fellow-countrymen,            have
established the certainty of the existence of man at the time when
those erratic deposits were formed, the traces of an intentional ope
ration on the bones of the rhinoceros, the aurochs, the megaceros,
the cervus sommensis, &c. &c., supply equally the inductive demon
stration of the contemporaneousness of those species with the human
race."
    The great number of flint implements which have been found in
the French beds
                    —said to amount to upwards of a thousand in a few

                                        370
years — when compared with their great rarity elsewhere, is not per
haps so curious as at first sight it may appear to be.              Flint  imple
ments can only be made where flints are accessible             ;  and   it is  well
known that the flints of particular beds, or strata, of the chalk, are
more easily fashioned than others.             It  is therefore   probable     that
some such favourable locality had existed in the chalk              of that part
of France, and that what may          be called a manufactory       of them     had
consequently been established there.            It is remarkable that some of
the implements       are only half finished, whilst all of them exhibit
such   sharp  edges     and angles as are sufficient to prove that they
have not been transported far from the spot where they were made,
nor subjected to long wear from use.
    On the whole, then, it is not to be doubted that the discovery of
human implements under repeated beds of aqueous                  drift and    sedi
ment, so high above the levels of existing rivers, or of the existing
sea, is  a fact   of very great significance and importance.                In its
bearing on geology, it is principally interesting as proving at how
recent a period portions at least of the earth have been subject to
powerful    and   rapid     diluvial action.      In   its bearing    on   human
chronology,   everything       depends on the degree        of suddenness      and
rapidity with which water         may have been brought to act upon the
former surface.      But here anything like data for positive computa
tion entirely fails us.       We have no knowledge, in historic times, of
any aqueous      operation on so grand           a scale.   Making,      however,
every deduction which can be made, we must be prepared to find that
the facts thus brought to light in the valley of the Somme will be
held to furnish      important     collateral   evidence in     support    of   the
reasoning founded on other sciences, such as philology and ethnology,
which has long demanded, for the development of our race, a number
of years far exceeding that which         is allowed by the chronology pre
viously   received.      It  is the  beautiful     expression   of Sir Thomas
Browne, which      I  find quoted by Dr Mantell in         a former     paper on
this subject, that   " Time     conferreth a dignity upon the most trifling
thing that resisteth his power;" and it is impossible to look at
these rude implements — perhaps the earliest efforts of our race, in
the  simplest   arts of life — without       being impressed with the high
interest  of the questions with which they            seem   to be   inseparably
connected.

     I
     think it is impossible not to consider the publication of Mr
 Darwin's work on the " Origin of Species" as an event in the history
 of scientific        speculation.             The influence which such theories have
 had in stimulating              and directing the progress of actual discovery,
 entitles them, when they come from distinguished                                      men, and when
 they rest on any large amount of careful observation, to the marked
 attention of such Societies as this.                         Tt cannot be denied that                   Mr
 Darwin's     book claims our respect on                      both these        grounds.            It   may
 be true, as      I    think it
                         that all the facts he has brought together,
                                    is,
 supposing them to be clearly established (or even much extended                                          by
 the volume of proof which                     is   still in reserve), bear        a   very small pro
portion to the purely speculative conclusions which go to make up his
theory on the "Origin of Species."     Yet probably there    no other                          is
 man now living who could have made                            such     a    rich collection.            No
other man since the death of Humboldt has had such powers of obser
vation, combined with such opportunities of observing.                                  " The
                                                                                                    Voyage
of the Beagle" shows how large and wide has been his experience of
the general aspects of nature whilst his monograph on the Cirripedes,
                                               ;
and other papers on zoology, testify to his unwearied assiduity in the
examination           of detail.      His book, therefore,              comes      before the world
with every claim            to     respectful consideration              which         can     be founded
on   the high scientific             reputation          of its author.            The " Origin of
Species," however, means nothing less than the method of creation                                             ;
and this     is   a   subject so profoundly dark, that no amount of existing
knowledge         can enable any man to do more than walk carefully
round  its outer margin, noting where, here and there, some fact,
more significant than others, seems to give hope of entrance into the
obscurity within.  The particular theory advanced                                  by   Mr Darwin         is
but a special form of the old theory of development                                ;    special in this
respect, that      it    professes        to   point out the particular law under which
every animal and vegetable form may have been derived from those
pre-existing,         by ordinary         generation.         One general admission may,
I   think,   be safely made in reference to                   all such theories.                They are
undoubtedly        more easily conceived                 than what       is   called         " creation."
But this     is   not saying much.                   The truth    is,   that creation, of which
we often talk so easily,
                                          is
                                          a         work of which we have no knowledge
and can have no             conception.   Something     known of the laws
                                                                        is
under which           organic beings, once created, are enabled to continue
their existence          and     to propagate their kind;                    and   it    is,   of   course,

                                                 372
comparatively         easy      for us to conceive           some     such modification          of
those laws       as    Mr Darwin           suggests,     —   to suppose that        any given
animal should occasionally produce offspring slightly different from
itself in some one portion of its structure, and that such differences
should go        on accumulating,           until       finally they end in the            most
divergent forms.             But to imagine        processes      which shall be the most
easily conceivable goes but a very little way in science                       ;    and, after
all, the difficulty is but postponed.                   Mr Darwin himself is           obliged
to have recourse at last to the ordinary forms of language                           in which
the idea of creation            is expressed, and speaks of a primordial form
into which      " life   was     first breathed."          In   science we may sometimes
allow the question to be             asked, " What is most easily conceivable ?"
but only on condition that it be followed hard by the farther question,
" How     much of this easiness of conception is gained at the expense
of departure from the evidence of facts and the experience of nature ?"
In answer to this inquiry, it may well be doubted whether Mr Dar
win has proved           one    single fact capable of sustaining the very first
step   in his ingenious argument.                   That argument          seems     to be      as
follows: Man has               succeeded    by
                                                  " artificial selection" — that          is,    by
careful   "breeding" — in establishing                 certain modifications   in   the forms
of domestic animals.               Therefore,     similar results may       be produced to
an infinitely greater degree               by   nature.      Only, the principle of       selec
tion   will   be different.         Man    chooses        those qualities which are most
useful to him as master.                Nature will       choose those    which are most
useful to the animal itself.               But the qualities which are most useful
to an animal          will     be those which           enable   it   to survive     when its
fellows and congeners die.                  If,   therefore, any such qualities            arise
in any particular family              or breed, they will be preserved and per
petuated.       This      is   a    beautiful     theory.        But when      we    ask how
far the   facts carry us towards the               " origin
                                                of new species," we find
that there      in reality no perceptible advance.
               is                                     The changes pro
ducible by breeding, or by "artificial selection," are all confined
within    acircle which indicates       restraining law.
                                                  a        The changes
                 " natural selection " are, so far as
                by                                                      we know and
producible                                                                                   can
observe, under similar,            if   not under still narrower           limitation.          As
regards the first,        Mr Darwin himself             supplies us with an illustration
beyond all others striking, of that law of reversion to type, the
existence of which he nevertheless disputes. Pigeons are his favourite
example of extreme modification of form.                         They have   been     "   bred"

                                                       373
or selected for three thousand years.                                 Mr Darwin took two of the
unlikest and most aberrant parents he                                 could select, a black " barb"
and a white         " fantail."            The result            was, that a grandchild           of these
parents exhibited              a   close     return         to the old primal type, the rock-
pigeon, from which all domestic pigeons originally sprung.   Yet
who knows through how many generations of " selected parents" —
perhaps from the days of the Pharaohs                             — this    chick had inherited its
ancestral     colours      !       Can      there          be    a stronger     illustration          of that
restraining        law of reversion to type, which, so far as we know, con
fines within a very narrow circle, not only the extent, but the dura
tion of aberrant forms of life                    ?        Then,       as regards natural selection,
do we know          of any         one authentic            instance in which new conditions
of life     have    been       met by such modifications of structure as might
enable an animal to survive its congeners in the                                    "    battle of life    ?"
Our experience in this                way is perhaps                   fully more extensive than in
any other.          The truth          is,   that man            is   himself the greatest modifier
of the natural conditions under which the lower animals                                       are placed.
He    is   year    by   year producing revolutions which might be equivalent
to centuries of natural                  change.               Nor are     these without      a   powerful
effect on animal life.                Mr Darwin
                                  has traced the changes thus pro
duced with singular ingenuity and beauty of description.   But all
those changes are produced     the substitution of one species for
                                                      by
another, — never by the modification of the same species to the new
conditions which surround it.                          There          need be no dispute that, under
the law so beautifully traced by Darwin, such modifications,                                  if  they    did
arise, would tend to survive and be perpetuated.                                    But what      we want
is— facts     to   justify the supposition that any such modifications                                do actu
ally arise    ;    such, for example, as would enable an animal adapted                                    for
marshy land to survive on land which had become dry                                       ;— or   arboreal
forms to survive the destruction of their native forests;                                      — or      land-
animals      to adapt themselves to                        a    country which       is   being gradually
submerged.              These are all operations of which man has had expe
rience, and to some of which he                             is   every day contributing           ;    yet no
instance      is    recorded of nature having ever had any opportunity of
                   in favour of any animal that "selecting" power which
                                                                                                            is by is
exercising
the assumed origin of new species.                               The Fauna     is   indeed    changed
such changes of condition                    as  I     have supposed.               But that      change
effected by substitution,                  not    by   conversion.          One animal or plant in-
     vol. iv.                                                                                 3   D

vades    the   former      territory of another.          In   our own country,           for
example, the grouse gives way to the partridge, or the snipe to the
landrail   ; or, more rarely , the lark may be supplanted by the waders and
the gulls — the field-mouse and the mole by the water-rat and the otter.
But in no case that we know of, or that Mr Darwin has adduced, has
any wild animal been enabled, by any modification of form, however
slight, to survive any essential changes in that condition for which it
was   first adapted. And as this is the law which obtains in the present,
so also it is the law which appears to have obtained in the past. The
absence of any evidence of the passage of one form into another, dis
coverable in the records of former worlds, is confessed by our author
himself.      All   his arguments are directed, not to deny this fact, but                  to
explain it.      It has  been   truly  said, in a very able and interesting         paper
on the subject which was communicated to this Society by one                         of    its
 members early in the present year, that           "The strongest points in        favour
of the general results       come to by     Mr Darwin,        are a class of facts  which
can scarcely be said to bear distinctively                on   his theory     more than
 upon various other theories already promulgated, and more or                           less
adopted.        One of these        is  the fact     that all animals        and plants,
 throughout       all time and       space, should be         related to each other in
group subordinate to group                              another    not less formidable
fact is the existence of the same                 homological       parts   in different
 animals,     sometimes aborted,          and    sometimes        largely    developed."
 The endeavour        to explain and account for these strange connections
 and relationships       is one of the highest aims of science.                 To    refer
 them to the great law of hereditary descent                 is a very natural sugges
 tion, and for a moment some minds may be disposed to rest in it                            as
 a  kind of explanation.          Reduction      to   a   known and familiar law is
 the nearest approach to explanation              which      science can afford.        But
 we must beware         of the subtle error which lies in changing a                     law
 well known        and    familiar, into another law entirely unknown                   and
 new, by ascribing to        it effects   and   operations       of which    we have no
 experience.        If  the    law of descent       by ordinary      generation is     con
 sistent with       the origin, through        this means, of new species,            some
  proof must be given of the fact.            Until      such   proof is   adduced,      the
 assumed      law is not that of ordinary             generation, but of extraordi
 nary—of       a new    kind of generation essentially different from             that of
  which we have any knowledge.
     It is well worthy of remark, that          Mr Darwin         holds strongly    to the

                        single centres of creation" — or as, to suit his special
doctrine of
                   "
theory, they ought perhaps to be called, single centres of birth.                                  Ho
believes     that each new species came into being at some one spot only,
and that, however wide may be its distribution                             now, such distribution
has been due wholly to dispersion.                         "   If   the same species," he says,
" can       be                     at two separate points, why do we not find a
                  produced
single mammal common to Europe, Australia, and South America?
The conditions of life              are nearly the same."                 But surely this belief
in single centres of creation or of birth is not very easily reconcilable
with the rest of             Mr Darwin's             theory.         The essential       idea of that
theory      is,   that new species        arise from any accidental variety which
enables the animal possessing                   it   to have some special advantage in
the struggle for existence.                 But,      as       similar modifications of struc
ture would in this             respect    confer similar advantages, at one time or
other, under some                 circumstances        or other all over the globe,               it   is
impossible         to    understand why they should not frequently arise at
many different points, either at once, or in succession.                            We may freely
grant, therefore, to              Mr Darwin      that his reasoning explains to us how
a given species, once born, and which begins the battle of life under
favourable conditions, should rapidly spread,                            and    should extinguish
its congeners and predecessors,                      which are less favourably endowed.
But   gives us no sort of explanation, or even suggestion, of the law
       it
under vjhich any such new species     first produced.    How such
                                                        is                                             a
new birth comes to be determined, and above all how                                 it   can only be
determined at some one spot of all the million spots on which the
same parents flourish, remains as profound                           a   mystery as before    ;   and
we have in          reality not advanced              a    single step      towards the " origin
of species."
   The conclusions arrived                 at    by    Mr Darwin               are essentially but
another form of the old theory of development,                                  and as such       they
 will meet with the same vigorous resistance. We may cordially
join in tho warning of Professor Huxley, that the arguments of
such   a    naturalist       as    Mr Darwin         must be met on scientific grounds
alone.       And yet         the    difficulty, to     use      no    stronger word, of recon
ciling this theory when applied                  to man, with            all that   we know    of his
physical and moral                 nature, and all that we have                  hitherto   believed
respecting his early history,              is   at least one among the many diffi
culties which may well call for the most jealous and critical analysis
of every step   Mr Darwin's argument. He himself, indeed, seems
                        in

                                                   376
to feel no difficulty in the matter — lineal descent from                                  some early
fish or reptile — "           some ancient          prototype furnished            with         a floating
apparatus or swimming-bladder"                      — Mr
                                      Darwin regards as the noblest
claim of ancestry.  " When     view all beings," he says, " not as
                                               I
special creations, but as the lineal                     descendants of some                few beings
who lived          long      before the first           bed    of the    Silurian          system      was
deposited, they seem to me to be ennobled."                              I   am afraid that            the
honour of this parentage, as regards our own species,                                      will not     be
universally              The question, however, is not whether it
                      appreciated.
be "ennobling"   or the reverse, but whether it can be proved or
rendered in any degree probable.   Yet, in judging of the sufficiency
of evidence,          it   is well to recollect the           full weight of the conclusion
which that evidence                must be strong enough to bear                      ;   nor, in this
point of view, do             I
                    think it wholly unphilosophical                              to   bear in        mind
the innate beliefs and instincts of mankind.
     It     is not, however, my duty or my desire,                        in this place and             on
this occasion, to enter more deeply into the specific argument                                          on
the     "   origin of species;"          I   would rather indicate wherein the discus
sion, and the argument which has raised that discussion, has                                          most
directly tended to the advance of science.                          In   this respect, it is not
too much to say that the whole book is                          full of the      most curious and
original observation,              and    exhibits in an eminent degree                    that     power
and habit of arranging and co-ordinating                         physical phenomena which
is essential to the attainment                  of great results,        and which         it     has been
the special use of such theories                       in the history of science to evoke
and to direct.               In particular,        I    think    no one      can      read Darwin's
chapter on the
               "                             for existence,"       or the two chapters                  on
                 struggle
"
    geographical distribution," without feeling that new and important
light       has been cast on subjects which are as interesting                             as     they are
difficult and obscure.
    I     hope    I   need not assure the Members                 of this Society how highly
I   value the honour which places                      me     in this chair.   To be chosen
President         of a Society           of which the two former Presidents                          were
Sir W. Scott and Sir T. Brisbane                         is indeed an honour              of which    any
Scotchman             may well       be      proud.         But whilst    these       names are of
themselves sufficient to indicate                      how great    that honour             is,   they are
not less         sufficient       to remind        me that your         choice     of President         is
determined on different                  occasions       by   considerations       of very various

                                          377
nature.       Sir W. Scott's unbounded literary fame, and the personal
affection     in which he was held in Edinburgh, placed him in the
front of all    men who could be competitors for the chair           of  a Society
of which already      he was the most illustrious       member.      Sir  T. Bris
bane was not only one of the most renowned soldiers of his day,
but was besides a man of high scientific attainment, and a promoter
of   science    as wise as     he  was    munificent.    I can  draw from       the
choice which you have lately made of a successor to such distinguished
men no other inference than that this Society places a very large
and generous interpretation         upon the qualifications     requisite    in its
President, — that you are willing occasionally to connect the office
with those pursuits of public life which, whilst they are unfavourable,
I am     afraid, to any sustained scientific inquiry, are not incompatible
with    a sincere interest in the progress of science,       and a high     appre
ciation of its value to mankind.

 2. On     the Pediculi         infesting the Different Races of Man.
                              By Andrew Murray.
     The object of this paper        was  to determine whether        the pediculi
 infesting the different races of man were of the same or of distinct
 species,  and thereby       to ascertain    whether any inference could be
 drawn therefrom, bearing upon the disputed question of the unity of
 the human species.
     The author had obtained specimens of pediculi taken from sixteen
 or eighteen different      races of mankind, and had discovered certain
 minute differences which appeared to be constant in the different
 races.    These differences, however, did not appear so different              in
 particulars,    or marked in degree, as to justify their being considered
 different  species.

      1. Note on      Hydrated Sulphuric Acid.                By Dr Lyon
                                Playfair, C.B.
   It  is well known       that hydrated      sulphuric     acid loses sulphuric
anhydrid    on   heating, and that its specific gravity decreases in          con

                                           391
 sequence.       It  is of some practical       importance     to  know the exact
 circumstances under which this takes place, and the following ex
 periments may prove useful in this respect.               Sometimes, in distilling
 and subsequently evaporating            sulphuric   acid,  I obtained a hydrate
 of sp. gr. 1-848, and at other times not exceeding 1-842.                  To    ex
 plain these differences        I took —
     1. Monohydrated          sulphuric   acid, having the sp. gr. 1-848, and
 containing     by alcametrical       testing 81'62 per cent, of anhydrous
 acid, and buried the retort containing           it in hot    sand, and distilled.
 The distillate now contained only 80' 12 anhydrous acid, and had a
 sp. gr. of 1-840 at 60° Fahr.            It had lost in distillation about 1£
 per cent of anhydrid.
    2. The weak acid thus got by distillation              was exposed   to a tem
 perature     near to, but not exceeding, 554° Fahr., for forty minutes.
 On cooling,      its alcametrical     strength was 81-615 of anhydrid,          and
 its specific gravity      1 84798.
     3.  A   portion   of   the first acid, having the strength 81'62 of an
 hydrid, and the specific gravity 1-848, was boiled violently for two
 hours.     On testing, it was now found to contain only 80-01 of an
 hydrid and to have a specific gravity of 1-838.
    4.   The    weak    acid got in the last experiment          was kept  for one
hour at    a temperature       of 550° Fahr.        The concentrated acid thus
got gave 81 62 anhydrid and a specific gravity of 1-84792.
    From these experiments, it follows, notwithstanding Marignac's
researches, that there is a real monohydrated               sulphuric acid obtain
able by evaporation,          and   that its specific gravity      is in reality   as
high    as 1 '848, which is the number formerly given in books                ;  but
that this hydrate         is decomposed      between    the temperature of 550°
Fahr.    and the boiling point       of oil of vitriol.
2.   Note respecting Ampere's Experiment for showing the
    Repulsion of a Rectilinear Electrical Current on itself. By
    Principal Forbes, LL.D., &c
    The experiment          referred to was performed in 1823 by Ampere
in the presence of Mr A. De la Rive.               It is intended to show that
if one portion of a rectilinear conductor is made moveable, it will be
repelled from       the portions     which   form its continuation.       The ar

                                      392
rangement       employed was a copper wire-float in a double trough             of
mercury, which cannot easily be explained without a figure.
    This experiment, though quoted by        most writers on     electricity,   is
understood to be one not easily repeated.            Indeed, the author       has
not found an indication of its ever having        been    repeated with     suc
cess.    The author conceiving that perhaps this repulsion           described
by Ampere might          assist in explaining    the vibrations    of rocking
 bodies through     which an electrical current     passes (as described in a
communication       by him to this Society in January          1859), devised
another, and, as he conceives, a more        delicate method of testing the
supposed      repulsion of a rectilinear   current on itself.    This he      ac
complished      by connecting the two     poles  of   a battery by means of
a piece    of copper- wire shaped like a horse-shoe, and laid upon one
extremity of a slender wooden lever suspended by a fine platinum
wire, after the manner of a torsion balance.            Yet, on the establish
ment of the circuit through         the bent wire,     so far was there from
being any repulsive force tending to separate the torsion            rod from
the battery poles, that the connecting horse-shoe was sensibly and
even    powerfully    attracted  to  the poles,    both while    the   current
lasted, and for some time after.
    This experiment seems to throw a doubt upon Ampere's con
clusion.     The author believes that his mode of experimenting is not
only much more delicate than that of Ampere,                 but also that it
avoids sources of ambiguity      present in the other.
3.   Fragmentary Notes on the Generative Organs of some Car
    tilaginous Fishes.          By John Davy, M.D., F.R.S. Lond.
    and Ed in., &c.
    These notes, it is stated by the author,        were made at different
times and places, as opportunity       favoured, and are offered as a con
tribution to a difficult branch of Ichthyology.
    The generative organs of nine different species are described, with
more or less minuteness of detail.        The species are Sqitalus squa-
tina,   S.  galeus,   S. acanthias, S. carcharias, S. centrina,      S. cani-
cula, Scyllium melctnostomum,        Raia aquila, and R. oxyrhynchus.
   From the observations      made, these species would appear to differ in
some essential points as regards the reproductive process; some, as the
8. squatina,     being viviparous, — their ova  developed or hatched in     the

                                          393
uterine cavity    ;    others, as S. acanthias and S. carearias, being ovi-
porous, their ova included in a shell with a white, yet developed in
the same cavity, the presence            of    a shell    constituting    the difference
comparing      them with        the preceding       ;    others, as   B. aquila, and S.
canicula,    being oviparous,          their   eggs      experiencing     no embryonic
development in the oviducts, and hatched after exclusion in the sea.
   Respecting the anal appendages, the characteristic                       of the male
cartilaginous fish, the opinion the author is most inclined to adopt                      is,
that they are not claspers, but rather organs of intromission   prefer           ;
ring this latter — the old view of their                 use, as noticed    by     Aristotle
— to   the former, which         is   the more recently entertained one, from
considering their structure and certain facts which have come to his
knowledge.
   Concerning         the branchial    filaments,       which    have commonly been
held   to be mainly subservient            to the supplying with air the blood
of the embryo,         he thinks      they may have another use also, that of
aiding the growth of the parts to which they belong.   Their early
absorption, and being sometimes found in other regions of the em
bryo than the branchia,          are brought forward as circumstances favour
able to this idea.

 1. On a Method       of taking Vapour Densities at Low Tempera
      tures.      By Dr Lyon Playfair, C.B., F.R.S., and J. A.
    Wanklyn, F.R.S.E.
    The authors refer           to   Regnault's experiments, which             have shown
 that   aqueous       vapour in the atmosphere has the same vapour density
 at ordinary       temperatures        as aqueous         vapour above      100° C.   ;   and
 they bring forward fresh experiments upon alcohol and ether to show
 that when mixed with hydrogen                these vapors preserve           their normal
density at 20° or 30° C. below the boiling points of the liquids, and
infer generally that vapours, when partially saturating                      a permanent
gas, retain their normal densities at low temperatures.
   From their          researches     the authors deduce the consequence              — re
markable, but quite in harmony with theory, that                          permanent gases
have the property              of rendering     vapour truly gaseous.            Stated    in
more precise terms, the proposition                  maintained       by the authors       is,
" The presence of          a   permanent gas affects       a   vapour, so that its expan
sion-coefficient at temperatures near its point of liquefaction tends
to approximate            to its expansion-coefficient         at the highest    tempera
tures."
   The authors anticipate              that   admixture        with   a   permanent       gas
may     serve    as   a    kind of re-agent to distinguish            between cases of
unusually high expansion-coefficient                 in   vapour, and cases where
                                                          a
chemical       alteration      takes place.     It   will also be possible,   the    by
employment of     permanent gas, to obtain vapour-densities of com
                       a
pounds which will not bear boiling without undergoing decomposition.

taking the specific gravity of vapours.                      A slight       modification          is,   how
ever, necessary.               Previous to the introduction                 of the bulb contain
ing       the weighed substance, dry hydrogen                         is    introduced           into    the
graduated tube and measured                       with all the precautions                belonging       to
a   gas analysis.         It   will   be obvious that in the subsequent calculation
the volume of hydrogen corrected at standard temperature                                     and pres
sure must be subtracted from the volume of mixed gas and vapour,
also corrected at standard temperature and pressure.

is    weighed in dry air, then placed in   bath, being secured   a                                       by   a
retort-holder        grasping          the neck joining the large bulbs                      C    and     C.
The       end    A, projecting over the               one    side of the bath,              is   made     to
communicate with a hydrogen apparatus                            ;   the end     D    passes through
a    hole in the opposite side of the bath, which                          is   plugged up water

         The bath    is   next filled with warm water until the bends a                             and   a
are covered.    The connection with the hydrogen apparatus      then for                     is
a moment interrupted, to allow of the introduction of small quantity                 a
of the substance at A.    The substance, which should not more than
half-fill the small bulb    partially vaporised in the stream of hydro
                                      b,   is

                                        397
temperature     of the bath      is kept   uniform    throughout by constant
stirring, and made to rise very slowly. When within                a few degrees
of the temperature at which the determination is to                 be made,   the
current of hydrogen is almost stopped, so that tho bulbs C and C
may contain less vapour than         will fully saturate the gas at the      tem
perature of sealing.       The water of the bath is then            made to sub
side, by opening a large tap placed near the bottom.                 The bends a
and a are thus exposed, the bulbs CC remaining covered.                    Imme
diately  the  current    of hydrogen having        been    stopped, the flame is
applied at   act, so as to   seal the apparatus      hermetically.       The tem
 perature of the bath, as well as the height            of the barometer, must
 now be observed.       After being cleaned, the apparatus (which now
 consists of three portions, viz., the portion CC hermetically sealed
and the two ends      b and   D) must    be weighed.
    The capacity of the apparatus is found by filling it completely
 with water and weighing ; but previously to this operation the volume
 of hydrogen    enclosed   at the time     of sealing must be found.            On
 breaking one extremity under water, the water will rise in the bulbs,
 and, after a while, will have absorbed all of the vapour, but will leave
 the hydrogen.       The bulbs must then         be lifted    out of the water,
without altering      their temperature, and, with the water that has
 entered, weighed.       The difference between the latter weighing and
 the weight    of   the  bulbs  quite full of water gives the weight in
grammes, which expresses in cubic centimeters the volume of hydro
gen enclosed ; the pressure is the height of the barometer minus
 the column of water which had entered the bulbs               ; the temperature
 is that of the water.

   The authors have extended their experiments              to acetic acid       and
other   substances.      At   low   temperatures       the   vapour-density        of
acetic acid approximates      to 4-00, no matter how much hydrogen                be
employed.      At   higher temperatures, an approximation               to 2-00     is
obtained, but without heating so high as Cahours found necessary.

1. Notes on the Snow         Crystals observed during the late Frost.
                         By Professor Allman.
    On the 26th of December last, about half-past             1 1  a.m., a light
snow shower fell in Edinburgh, and lasted about half an hour.                The
air  was  at the time still, and the sky overcast with a thin haze,
while the thermometer       stood    at many degrees       below    the freezing
point    The appearance of the snow was very remarkable.                   It fell
in loose open flakes, and lay upon the surrounding objects in little
masses like tufts of exquisitely white, soft and light down.
    Remembering     the descriptions     of the crystals      of snow in high
arctic regions,  and  during intense frost even        in our own latitudes,
as given by   Scoresby, Glaisher and others,        I  was desirous     of deter
mining how far the structure of the snow now falling corresponded
with the accounts of these observers.          I accordingly, with the view
of rendering their composition more apparent by contrast with              a dark
surface, collected a few of the falling flakes upon a sheet of blackened
pasteboard, when, even to the unassisted eye, a structure of marvel
lous beauty was at once revealed.          The white down-like snow-flake
was now seen to be an aggregate of symmetrical and transparent ice
stars, many of them more than a quarter             of an inch in diameter.
When examined under        the compound microscope with             the aid of a
two-inch   object-glass,  their beauty      became    still further enhanced,
and it was then seen that every star was         itself composed of a multi
tude of transparent crystals, in some cases tabular, in some acicular,
and all grouped in obedience      to a definite law, so as in      their wonder
ful assemblages to give rise to shapes of exquisite symmetry,           —shapes,
too, of almost infinite variety    ;  the kaleidoscope, in its magical trans
formations,   is not more rich in forms, — yet all pervaded by an un
broken unity, for their type had been already              fixed  ;   and even in
their most sportive    mood,   they could be seen to be under the con

                                                 400
trol of a definite number and                  a definite quantity           — the   number 6 and
the angle of 60° determining their form and limiting their variations.
     Among the various figures which                   I observed on the occasion referred
to, we may perhaps select, as the archetypal combination,                                  a 6 -rayed
star (fig. 1), having for its centre or nucleus a tabular crystal in
the form of a regular hexagon, each of whose angles supports one                                       of
the six rays of the star.               Each of these rays would seem to be a very
much elongated hexagonal prism,                 and every one of them gives off
from each side, and in the common plane of the figure,                                     secondary
arms, which spring from                it with a pinnate arrangement,                     and    at an
angle of 60°.              These secondary arms in the figure under considera
tion are also elongated hexagonal prisms                        ;    in the greater number of
instances, however (figs.              2-5), the secondary arms                   are wedge-shaped,
and probably the result of more complex conditions than those under
which the type form is produced.                       The axis of symmetry of each of
these wedge-shaped arms is inclined                      to the ray at an angle                 of   60°,
but    I    cannot say at what angle the sides of the arms are inclined
to one       another.         The central hexagon in the figure,                         from    which
the sketch was taken, was marked with elegant concentric striae.
     It    is here worth noting,             that the figure             I   have assumed as the
type consists exclusively              (if   we except the termination                  of the arms)
of combination of the two limiting forms of the Rhombohedron m R;
  a
namely, that in which m becomes practically       and that in which          0,
it        infinite, producing in the former case the tabular crystal
     becomes
OR, which constitutes the centre of the figure, and in the latter
case the prismatic crystals                a   R, which constitute the rays and their
branches.
   Assuming then the form now described as the type, there would
seem to be but little difficulty in deducing from    most of the                   it
peculiarities          presented by the other figures which                       I     have had an
opportunity            of observing.       In   fig.   2,   the central           hexagon has dis
appeared, and the rays meet at                  a   point in the centre of the star.
     In    fig.   3,   a   tabular hexagonal      crystal   developed diagonally
                                                                    is                                in
the course of each ray at              a   uniform distance from the centre, and in
the common plane of the star.
                                                                for in order to produce               it,

            is                                          3   ;
we have only to suppose   all the six hexagons to be simultaneously
prolonged in the direction of the ray, until they meet in the centre
of the figure, when, in consequence of mutual and symmetrical

                                      401
interference, they will terminate in an angle of 60°, or of half the
proper angle of the hexagon, thus forming maccles whose plane of
union     is inclined to the principal axis of the ray at an angle
of 30°.
                                                I
     In fig. 5 we have a central      hexagon, carrying symmetrically on
 each of its angles a wedge-shaped five-sided table, which thus takes
 the place of the acicular ray in fig. 1.         Three of the sides of this

 table appear to be those of the regular hexagon, while the remaining
  two sides would,     if continued, meet at an      angle which   I have   not
  been able to measure, somewhere        within the central hexagon.     From
  each   of the free angles of the wedge-shaped ray, a little hexagonal
  prism is developed.
      The simply pinnate rays of fig. 2 occasionally           become  doubly
   pinnate.    I  have found even trebly pinnate varieties.
      I also noticed   a form (fig. 6) which is not exactly traceable to the
   type, and which    I am  inclined to view rather as an abnormal condition
   induced upon one of the other forms by the coalescence, or imperfect
   development, of the secondary arms.           It consisted of a six-rayed
   star, in which the rays, instead of being prismatic or wedge-shaped,
   were lanceolate, the curved boundaries thus bringing this          modiflca

   tion almost entirely into the type of organic               form.     The edges of
   the rays were marked with pinnate serrations or striae.
      In this last form    we are strongly        reminded of the beautiful stel
   late figures,   like six-petalled      flowers,    which      have    been   recently
   described by Professor Tyndal           as being developed          within a    block
   of ice, when the rays of the sun are concentrated                    on  a point in
   the interior of it by a burning lens.
      Besides the forms now described, the snow which fell on the 26th
  contained many others, any one of which would well repay the trouble
  of drawing, though no figure can give an adequate idea of the ele
  gance of the actual object, in which the most beautifully symmetrical
  flowers, and elaborately divided fern leaves, are repeated with that
  marvellous fidelity with which inorganic nature occasionally imitates
  the forms of organisation when the formative forces are directed by
  an undeviating symmetry.
      But the ordinary snow of our latitude is not thus constituted.
  We may seek in vain in the snow as it usually falls with us for the
  beautiful   stellate crystalline    groups now described.             Why is this?
 There    are doubtless needed,      for the perfect development            of the ice
 crystals in the freezing cloud which is about to descend in the form
 of snow, several conditions,          as  yet but partially understood.               Of
 these, it is posssible       that a temperature           considerably     below the
 freezing point may be one, and a stillness             in the higher       regions of
 the atmosphere, where the snow is formed, another.                      It is exceed
 ingly probable, as has been ingeniously suggested by Fr. Vogel,*                      in
 explanation of the phenomena of hail, that if the atmosphere                          be
perfectly still, the particles of visible vapour constituting                the cloud
may be cooled far below the freezing point without                  freezing ; and      if
in this state a crystal of ice be precipitated           into the cloud from some
higher     elevation,   or the    stratum      of cold vapour        be   agitated    by
sudden    exposure to some atmospheric current, the balance between
the forces of cohesion and adhesion will be destroyed, and the whole
cloud will instantly       shoot   into beautiful      ice-crystals,    and will fall
towards the earth as stellate snow           ;  for the peculiar      constitution    of
the visible vapour is such, that unimpeded action will be permitted                   to
the forces of crystallisation,     and no mechanical obstacle will be offered
to the perfectly symmetrical         development of the crystalline           groups.

     If    the temperature           of the inferior             strata of the atmosphere ho
sufficiently           low, the snow-crystals           will reach the earth unaltered                ;
but       if,   in their descent, they happen to pass through                          strata whose
temperature             is   above the freezing         point, they will —        if   they be not
actually converted into rain — lose                    the sharpness and beauty              of their
outline, while partial thawing, followed, at the surfaces of contact,
by the singular phenomenon of regelation, which, as has been shown
by Faraday,             may take place           in an atmosphere considerably                    above
the freezing            point, will probably contribute to their irregular con
glomeration             into an ordinary snow-flake, contrasting                     as    this    does
so    strongly with the light,               open,         down-like       flake produced under
circumstances favourable to the perfect development and persistence
of the crystals.
   On the 27th, the snow which had fallen during the preceding
day was          still lying     on the ground,         and, with the view of continuing
my observations,             I   again placed some               of   it   under the microscope.
I    now, however, found that the crystals                            had lost   all their beauty,
and no longer presented the sharpness of outline                                 and symmetry of
form which had so forcibly struck me the day before.                                       And yet,
during the interval, the thermometer had never risen                               to the freezing
point, nor had the snow been exposed to the direct action of the sun.
The change of form thus undergone                           by    the crystals appears to me to
admit of but one explanation, and                           is   evidently due to         the partial
dissipation         of the crystal by evaporation, thus affording                       an interest
ing example of the ovaporability                      of   ice at temperatures considerably
below the freezing point.
     While        on this subject,    I    may as well mention another fact illus
trative of the same phenomenon.
      It   will   be remembered that on more than one occasion during the
severe frost        a    dense fog settled over the city,                    and was      afterwards
condensed and frozen on the surrounding objects, covering everything
on which   lay, but especially the naked branches of the trees, with
                  it
the most exquisite frostwork.                      This beautiful phenomenon, however,
was but of short duration              ;   for   in   less than twenty-four         hours, though
the temperature continued all the while below the freezing point, and
the air free from wind, which might have shaken the frozen particles
from the trees, yet not               a   trace of the frostwork remained.
     To form, then,            a   true conception of the constitution                  of a snow-
flake produced under the conditions which prevailed during the lato
     vol. iv.                                                                          3   a

 intense frost, we have only to imagine thousands of stellate groups,
 such as those just described, entangled         together by their complex
 arms into little loose flocculent masses.      The peculiar light down-like
 character of the snow which fell on        the 26th of December is thus
 easily understood.
    On the 7th of January,       between 4 and 5 p.m.,          the sky over
 cast, and the thermometer      standing considerably below the freezing
 point, Edinburgh was visited by another snow shower.              On this    oc
 casion the shower was of a very peculiar kind, for the stellate groups
 of crystals, instead of being aggregated into flakes, as in the shower
 of the 26th December, were for the most part isolated and distinct,
 so that the whole atmosphere was        filled with separate ice-stars in in
conceivable multitudes, whirling through the air, and drifting past
 one another in mazy paths which no eye could follow, so endless
 were    their intersections, and inextricable   their labyrinths   ;  the won
derful ice-drift heaping itself up like white sand on the surrounding
objects, but when projected against dark surfaces, revealing itself in
 all the unrivalled symmetry and beauty of its starry atoms. The
chief difference between the present snow shower and that which fell
on the     26th December, consisted in the segregation of its crystalline
particles.     There was a brisk breeze stirring at the time, in the lower
regions of the atmosphere, and this was doubtless the invisible analyst
that broke up the snow-flakes into their component elements, and
flung them in stars and flowers to the earth.

                                    Kf.DBHAE COTTAOE,     lith January   1861.
    My dear Sir, — In December 1859,             I  was  visiting Sir Robert
Peel at Drayton Manor, in Staffordshire          ;  and while there, a very
heavy hoar-frost occurred for nearly two days,— every tree and shrub
and the grass was fringed with most beautiful silver filagree.            When
walking     along the shrubbery in the forenoon,        I   was led, from    the
remarkable exuberance of the hoar-frost, to examine it more minutely
than by a casual glance ; and to my surprise and delight,          I  perceived
that the crystals presented quite a different arrangement on different

                                               405
bushes    of evergreens.           This there        was no doubt of, as       I could   easily
discern the difference in the arrangement of the crystals by the help
of a large magnifying glass which                I
                                     always carry with me when go                         I
from home.         I   regret    I did not take a sketch of the different           arrange
ment of the crystals         ;   but not being prepared for such a proceeding,
and being no          hand   at sketching,       I    contented       myself with    looking
from one bush to another.                And while thus engaged for              some time,
I thought     I
             made an interesting               discovery — namely,
                                                         that while dif
ferent bushes presented a different form of crystallisation, the same
sort   of bush presented the            same    form     of crystals.       This discovery
interested me very much — for discovery                   I deemed      it,   not having ob
served    any mention of such a thing in any book on meteorology                           I
have seen.   Thus, Portugal laurels, laurel bays, laurustinas, different
sorts of Arbor-vita;, the yew, some of the new pines, presented dif
ferent forms of crystals, but the same kind of plant had the same
form  of crystal.   This   made sure of by repeated observation
                                 I                                                            in
different parts of the shrubbery  and more than that, the size of
                                           ;
the    crystals   was about       in proportion to the size of the leaves of the
evergreens.    Thus, the crystals in the Portugal laurel, laurel bays,
and larger leaved kinds of evergreens, were larger than on the leaves
of the laurustina, and these latter larger than in those of the yew
and    Arbor-vitae.   The crystals, moreover, were not spread over the
surface   of the leaves, but only along their margins and the leaves    ;
above,    that were exposed fully          to the        air,   had   the crystals — those
within the bush, or under shelter of the leaves above them, were free
of all hoar-frost.      I        may mention         that the sun was obscured the
first day by frost-fog; the second day was clear, but the crystals
                  a
retained their form where the sun did not strike; and on the follow
ing morning, the whole fairy scene                   had disappeared.          Tall grasses
and sedges    by the side of        a   lake presented different crystals, but the
same  kind of plant similar forms.                     The naked branches of trees
presented similar results

 2.  The Bifilar Magnetometer: its Errors and Corrections.
    By John Allan Broun, F.R.S., Director of the Trevandrum
    Observatory.           Communicated by Professor Tait.
    The bifilar magnetometer has been employed in all the magnetical
 observations, with an exception or two             ;  its theory has been      stated
 generally, but no careful examination of the errors of the instrument,
 as deduced     from experience, has been published.                The author      has
 attempted to supply this deficiency.
    In the theory of the instrument, the proper elasticity of the wires
 has been neglected,        as of little importance.        The author shows      that
 the wires receive      a twist    in the adjustment, which          puts the upper
 suspension-points       into a different    plane from the lower ones; that
 the force   so   produced     enters into the equation of equilibrium in              a
 marked manner.            The theoretical conclusion is verified by experi
 ments on the torsion force of the wires.                  But as a proper twist
generally exists, the angle of torsion, as well as the time of vibra
tion, are unfitted        for an accurate determination           of the coefficient
 which relates the same divisions to the unit.                Different methods       of
determining the unit coefficient are noted, and the results of experi
ments are given.
    The greatest source of error in connection with the observations
is that due to varying         temperature.      It   has   been   usual to suppose
that the temperature affected             only the magnetic        moment      of   the
magnet, and the length of the wires and the interval                      separating
them.     It  is shown that it affects also the coefficient of elasticity of
the wires.      Experiments        made    hourly during       many days, with an
unmagnetic weight suspended             by two wires, are cited, to show that
the varying temperature produces            effects on the position which might
be expected     from theoretical considerations.
    A  method     proposed     by the author in 1842, and described            in the
"Edinburgh Transactions" in 1845 (vol. xvi.                     p. 74), by which a
temperature       coefficient is found, including          all the effects,  is then
noticed, and the results obtained from discussions of all the obser
vations of the bifilars in the colonial            observatories (including        the
observations of nearly twenty-eight            years), are given.       From    these
it appears that      the coefficients usually employed are on the average
nearly   one-half      too   great,    and in some        instances they    are the
double of the true coefficients.

      Tho author concludes by                       a notice       of the accidental         errors    to
which the instrument                 is liable.
 3. On the    Horizontal Force of the Earth's Magnetism.   By
      John Allan Broun, F.R.S., Director of the Observatory of
      the Rajah of Travancore. Communicated by Professor Tait.
   The conclusions of this paper are derived from observations made
at Makerstoun in Scotland; Toronto, Canada; Trevandrum, Travan
core,       and Singapore,       St Helena, the Cape of Good
                                     East Indies            ;
Hope, Hobarton, Van Dieman's Island, &c. The author has cor
rected and discussed all the observations published                                      made   in the
colonial observatories.
      The observations have              been found affected              by different errors, and
frequently         the    series have been                  broken.       An attempt has          been
made to correct these series                   ;    and, in general, to render the series as
near the truth as possible.                        The grounds for all       these corrections are
given in an appendix.*
    The results obtained may                       be summed        up as follows    :   —
                   Secular      Variation and Mean Yearly Force.
      1st, The secular change of the horizontal                             intensity followed the
same law, and had the same value very nearly, at Makerstoun                                            in
Scotland, and            at Hobarton,              Van Dieman's           Island, the units being
the absolute force at the respective places.
      2d, The      law   of change       is,   however, not linear, but had              a   maximum
at both       places,    at the mean               epoch,       January 1844, and        a   minimum
about       July   1847.
      3d,    At    other     stations      the secular change has not always tho
same value as at Makerstoun                          and Hobarton,         nor has   it   always the
same duration.
    4th, The yearly             mean      force was sometimes an increase at                          all
the stations, and          it   is   concluded that the yearly mean intensity of
the magnetism of the whole earth   not                      is     a   constant quantity.
   5th, The secular change   probably      is                      a   result of two causes — one
dependent on the position of the earth's magnetic poles, the other
dependent on their varying intensity.
  *    Some observations examined were found valueless, on account of errois
wliich could not be corrected; and in one case the requisite data for accurate
correction     were wanting.

      6th, The annual period confirmed by each year's observation, and
by groups of years at Makerstoun and Hobarton, at Trevandrum,
 Singapore,            Toronto,          &c.,        is,    that      the horizontal         intensity     of      the
earth's magnetism                   is   a maximum                 near the solstice and a minimum
near the equinoxes.                  The equations for Makerstoun and Hobarton,

are used, and where the probable error due to the varying torsion                                                   of
the silk suspension-fibres,                         and the small directive force of the                        sus
pended     magnet, renders such   confirmation the more remarkable.

to    faulty, from the inaccuracy of the temperature coefficients

   10th, The usual method of taking                     monthly     means gives only
twelve points for the whole year, each                   point corresponding to the
middle of a calendar month, the means                    being supposed to vary re
gularly from point to point.               The author has combined two years'
observations      for four places (Makerstoun,              Trevandrum,      Singapore,
and Hobarton), so as to have four weekly means                       corresponding to
each day in the year (Sundays                  excepted), and the most minute
variations    of these four weekly means for any one place are followed
by those for the others.            This fact     is,   however, only a corrollary     to
the following     :—
                             Daily Mean Variations.
   11th, The daily mean horizontal force at all places on the surface
of the globe increases simultaneously or diminishes simultaneously.
The amount of increase or of diminution has generally the same
value (the horizontal force at each place being the unit), so that
the increase or diminution    in proportion to the absolute value of
                                      is
the horizontal intensity           at the respective places.           The variations
from this result can             be traced to disturbances         which seem some
times to have      a   greater effect on the daily mean near the poles than
near the equator.
   12th,     In   order to follow          the variations       of the daily    mean   in
shorter intervals        than one day, the author has combined the obser
vations so that daily means                are obtained      corresponding      for their
middle points to          each    hour of the twenty-four,          instead of to one
hour only.  This          has    been done for    a     period of six weeks only, in
cluding          26-27 day periods (see 3(A) for the four places
           one of the                                       1
above mentioned (10th), and for Toronto and the Cape of Good
Hope. The results are that the turning-points frequently agree to
the   same hour, though          they also frequently differ to several hours           ;
the greatest variation being connected with large disturbances in high
latitudes.  Marked turning-points, maxima or minima at one place,
are sometimes shown only as minor                  turning-points    ;   at others, and
in the   cases    of   some large disturbances, while the           turning-point (say
the commencing                of force) occurs at the same instant on
                         diminution
all meridians, the rate or velocity of change   not the same in all —
                                                             is
the rate probably depending on the hour of the day at which the
disturbance       has its maximum            value at different       places,   the local

                                          410
law of disturbance        being superposed on the general law of             mean
daily variation.
    13th,  It  follows from these results, that the daily mean absolute
intensity of the whole earth is not a constant quantity, but that it
increases   as a whole, and diminishes          as a whole, from day to day.
    lith, In   the examination of the usual daily means for the years
1842-48 (though the years 1844-45 only are considered in                       this
paper), it appears that there is a period of about 26-2 days on                 the
average,    which    is felt equally      (within the limits of errors of co
efficients) and simultaneously at all the stations.              This period was
remarked by the author in his discussion of the Makerstoun                 Obser
vations for 1844—45        ;  it  was attributed    at that time to the action of
the moon, and the law obtained connected with its synodical revolu
tion.    The author gives grounds to show that it is probably due to
the sun. The identity of the movement at all stations at the same time,
whatever may be the position of the moon, would of itself disprove
the connection of our satellite as the cause of this period.              An    ex
amination of a larger series of observations than that considered in
this paper will show that the minimum frequently takes place at
full moon,    as well as at new moon.
    15*A, The author has avoided theoretical speculations in his paper,
but he believes that the moon acts as a secondary cause, the large
disturbances occurring        most frequently near full moon.          This   fact,
he thinks, hypothetically,         may    be connected    with an electric    fluid
emanating from the sun, acted on by the planets, and drawn towards
the earth most       powerfully when the moon is in opposition.               This
action does not prevent, though it occasionally masks, the period               due
to the rotation of the sun itself, and the unequal electrical              tension
of its different    sides  — this    difference being also probably connected
with the solar     spots.    It  is obvious that should the moon and planets
act in the way supposed, the period due to the sun's rotation will
appear    to  vary within        certain    limits, independently    of the   sup
position that the sun's side of greatest tension is variable.            Such an
hypothesis would connect the secular variations               with the electrical
tension of the sun, and the periods of the planets.              The author   pro
poses to consider this question more at large hereafter, in a discussion
of all the observations from 1840 up to the present time.                He   con
cludes by noticing the appearance of a period of about sixty to           seventy
hours in the daily moan variation.

    4.   Notice of an Instrument intended for the Measurement
        of Small Variations of Gravity. By John Allan Broun.
        Communicated by Professor Tait.
        If we    suspend a weight by two wires, and turn the weight                     sus
   pended from its position of repose through                an angle v by means of
   any force, the wires will no longer be vertical, and the weight will
   be   lifted from its lowest position        by a gravity equal to         I sin  t tan    i
   where      I is the length of      a wire and t is the small angle which                 it
   makes with the vertical.          If we   represent the force which keeps tho
   weight     W from its position of rest by /, and the intervals of the
   wires above and below by a and 6, it is known, as in the case of the
   bifilar magnetometer, that the equation of equilibrium                  is —
                                    /= W I    cos t
                                                   . sin v.
       If we     suppose the force   /  to be constant, and that only            W and      v
  vary by small amounts, then            we find
                                     AW

      The ratio      to the whole weight      of any variation, produced by any
  such cause as recession from           the centre of the earth, whether by
  climbing       a mountain      or by changing         position  on    the terrestrial
  spheroid, will thus be determined by observations of v and its varia
 tion.       Small    variations   of W may      be determined       if  we     give v a
 value approaching to 90°, and           if we can observe small variations of v.
     The following plan is being adopted for the purpose suggested.
 The weight, a cubic inch of lead, is suspended by two fine platinum
 wires; the        cube  has   mirrors   on   three of its vertical       faces, two     of
 which      are capable    of adjustment so as        to make an angle           of about
 86° with the middle mirror : below the                cube a fine  hair spring, like
 that of       a   watch balance, but of platinum            (so as not to       rust),  is
attached by one extremity             to a central pin fixed below into the
weight; the other extremity            is fixed (when the weight hangs freely
and the spring exerts no force) to a hollow cylinder which turns
freely round the pin as a centre.              In this ring another mirror is
fixed parallel to the middle mirror of the weight, and immediately
below and in front of it.            A telescope is so placed that when the
spring     has no action on the weight, the central divisions            of two    scales
    vol. v.                                                                "   1

                                                 412
(divided on glass) are seen reflected, one from the middle mirror
                                                                  of
the weight, the other from tho ring mirror at the same time.   Such
scales      have been employed by the author with small sextant tele
scopes,        for which     one     division        equalled    twenty        seconds,   and     two
seconds could be estimated.
     Let    us now suppose          the two mirrors parallel, the spring exerting
no action on the weight, and that                     the middle mirror faces the south.
The observation          commences          by turning the ring (say directly) through
an exact revolution, which is known by the mirror showing exactly
the same scale division.The eastern mirror, which makes an angle of
about 86° with the middle mirror, will now bring the scale into the
                                                                                                   of by
field of the telescope             (if   the proper precautions have been taken
the maker, in adjusting the force of the spring                             and the interval
the wires to each other) and the scale division being made, the exact
                                     ;
angle (y) through which the weight has been turned will be obtained.
The ring should now                be returned to its       first position, and the           obser
vation repeated by turning the ring in the opposite direction (say
retrograde) through           a    revolution.
     It   is   evident that    it   is   not necessary that the ring should be turned
exactly through          a   revolution     ;   it   may be turned exactly         a   few degrees
more or less by means of the scale, so that observations may be made
with different values of             v,   and therefore with greater or less delicacy.
Thus,      as may easily be shown, when                    u   = 86°,     a   variation in height
of ten     feet   will   be equivalent to        a    variation of three seconds          ;   when
t>=88°, the variation of three seconds will be produced by a rise of
about five feet only.              In proceeding from the poles to the                    equator,
v should vary from 84° to 90° nearly.
     The precautions taken               to render the instrument              portable, so     as to
keep the spring and wires with constant forces, the means of correct
ing for the effect of temperature, Sic, need not be noticed                                till   the
completion of the instrument.
     It   should be pointed out as              a     great advantage of the instrument,
that   a   large weight       is   not required, since         it   is   the ratio of the varia
tion of weight to the whole weight which                        is   shown.

Asteracanthion violaceus (L.) were procured, in the peculiar preg
nant condition described by Sars. The disk was raised into a hump,
and the rays drawn together at the base,     to form the  " marsupium"
for the protection of the young. All the     eggs or embryos in a single
marsupium      were at the same stage of development.        In the least
advanced, the eggs were undergoing the later stages of yelk-segmen
tation, while in others this process had been completed.        In other
individuals the embryos were partially or fully formed.          A speci
men, in whose pouch the mass of eggs were least advanced, was

                                           414
  placed in    ajar of   sea- water,    and the embryos were examined from
  day to day.
      Segmentation      appears to take place            in this   species in the way
  usual in the class, and involves the whole yelk.                   After segmenta
  tion,   the  embryonic     mass   is  at   first spherical, finely granular, and
  still invested by the vitelline membrane.                   This membrane soon
 disappears, and within a few hours the embryo seems perfectly
  homogeneous, regularly oval, and of a delicate flesh-colour.                         No
 trace of cilia could be detected at this stage on the surface.                      Four
 or five hours later, the oval form is still more marked                  ; one end has
 become      slightly dilated, and towards this end there             is an accumula
 tion of the granular substance.              The whole embryo         is now invested
 by a delicate structureless        gelatinous       layer, -which is thinner and
 less apparent towards the narrower end               of the oval.     At    the broader
 end    it invests a dark consistent granular layer,           of considerable thick
 ness, formed of oil globules, and compound-granular                 masses and cells,
 which lines a central cavity, filled with a clearer granular semi-liquid,
 in which there are traces of molecular or ciliary motion.
     The transparent        investment of the narrow             end    now protrudes
 three tubular      processes,   two long and narrow, turned in one direc
 tion, and the third, shorter and thicker, turned in the opposite direc
 tion.      Between    these   tubes in the centre there is a raised              whitish
 imperforate     tubercle.     Each tube is dilated at the extremity into a
 slightly opaque rounded bulb, which at length takes the form of a
 sucker, undistinguishable from the ambulacral suckers of the young
 star- fish.
     The granular fluid of the embryo still             passes freely into the tubes
 through their wide common base.
     This common        base now contracts and lengthens               ;  and this nar
 rower portion      of the clavate embryo           is separated by a       distinct line
 of demarcation from the broader               mass,   which    gradually assumes       a
rounded and then a pentagonal                form.      The embryo during           these
changes increases        rapidly in    size.     The peduncle, with its tubular
appendages,      now assumes     its definite and final form        —a      wide trans
parent contractile       tube, prolonged       inferiorly into three, or sometimes
four, wide tubular        branches, terminated by suckers.               The contents
of the peduncle and tube-feet consist of                a clear colourless      fluid, in
which chyle corpuscles, of the usual form, move and circulate with
the    motion peculiar to such particles           in the vessels     of the     echiuo

                                           415
  dorms.      The    embryo adheres by the suckers             at the ends of the
  tubes to a foreign      body, and moves          along by the contraction         and
  expansion of the three feet.          The peduncle is attached        to the lower
  surface of the rudimentary         star-fish,   slightly excentrically and mid
  way between two of the rays.           The star-fish, though now only about
  once and     a-half the size of the peduncle, has asserted distinctly its
  echinoderm character.           The pentagonal form is distinctly recog
  nisable, and plates of the characteristic calcified areolar tissue have
  begun to appear in the external layer, both on the upper and the
  under surface.        These plates assume a definite arrangement ; and
  shortly a depression appears in the centre of the oral surface of the
  star-fish, and gradually deepens till it communicates with the central
 cavity    of the body, forming          the permanent        mouth.     Round the
  mouth a delicate       tube forms an annular           elevation, passing at one
  point under or into the base of the peduncle — the oesophageal cir
 cular vessel of the ambulacral system ; and from this ring five deli
 cate straight tubes pass to the ends of the rays, each tube flanked on
 either   side by a row     of rudimentary ambulacral suckers.
      Up to this period, the general granular contents of the embryo
 could be forced by slight         pressure    into the tubes of the peduncle.
 Now, however, the attachment of the peduncle to the embryo gradu
 ally contracts, and at length it distinctly coalesces with, and becomes
 attached to, the annular         ambulacral      ring.    Pressure applied to the
 peduncle no longer injects the general cavity of the star-fish             ;   it only
 dilates its ambulacral       vascular system.       The true ambulacral       system
 of the embryo now         develops   rapidly, assuming its proper locomotive
 and respiratory      functions,    and   the peduncle withers       — the    sucking
 feet first breaking off, and the body of the peduncle disappearing
 finally,   as a gradually     contracting     sac   hanging   to  the   ambulacral
 ring, midway       between    two of the rays.       At   the point of disappear
ance no scar is afterwards perceptible.
     It would     appear    from the foregoing        observations, that the first
step in the development of this             form of echinoderm embryo is the
differentiation of      a portion     of  the    yolk into   an investing     layer of
structureless
                   "  Sarcode ;"     that    the   layer   gradually   increases     in
thickness    ;  and that finally, from one part of its surface, a branched
peduncular process is produced, as an extension of the same trans
parent structureless material.             The branches of this organ are ter
minated by suckers, and serve, among other functions, as organs of

                                       416
locomotion.        When fully formed, they are (indistinguishable                in
structure and function from the ambulacral feet of the star-fish               ; a
fluid undistinguishablo from the chylaqueous fluid of the ambulacral
system moves in them with the same               characteristic    motion.    The
peduncle     is closed  externally,   no communication,       except by transu
dation, existing      between   its cavity and the surrounding           medium.
At   first it communicates with the general cavity of the embryo, but
afterwards it becomes       connected    with, and part      of, the ambulacral
circulating      system.   When the ambulacral          vessels and suckers of
the young star-fish become fully developed, this provisional vascular
tuft disappears, leaving no apparent scar.           In  the species described,
the peduncle is not connected in              any way with the madreporic
tubercle, which is not developed        till long after its disappearance,     and
then on the opposite surface of the body.
    The peduncular appendage seems to be essentially a provisional
 development of the ambulacral vascular system, and to be functionally
 analogous to the omphalo-mesenteric and umbilical vessels of the verte
 brate groups, endowed,       however, with a greater amount of versatility
 of function, corresponding to that of the peculiar vascular            system of
 which it forms a part, and to a great degree dependent upon                    the
 peculiar vital properties of the substance       entering into its structure.
 2    Some Observations on the           Albino. By John Davy, M.D.,
                          F.R.S. Lond. and Ed., &c.
    The subjects of these observations were five individuals — four
 females, one male — all natives of Ceylon, of its south-east salubrious
 coast, and the children of coloured parents.
    They are described by the author            as well made, as having      good
 health, and, though all coming under the denomination of Albinos,
 on account      of their unusual fairness, yet     as varying     in degree, the
 lightest having red eyes and almost white hair           ;  the less light, blue
 eyes and     light-brown hair, with      a complexion      that in this country
 would be considered merely that of a pure blonde.
     It  would appear that the Albino in Ceylon, contrary to what has
 been    asserted,   is not held    in contempt, but rather         in respect,   in
 accordance      with the feeling of the people towards persons of high
 caste, who are almost invariably of a lighter hue than the more
 laborious and exposed low caste.

                                            417
      A    speculation of the Singalese is mentioned relative to the white
 races, viz., that they are the descendants             of Albinos, and, ab origin e,
 merely an accidental variety.
      The author      seems to    think that analogy      is not unfavourable to this
 hypothesis, keeping in mind how great is the variety of colour, and
 its gradations       from   light    to dark, amongst      Europeans,            and, in the
 instance of our domesticated animals, how colour is hereditary                        ; and
 also on the ground          that the sun's rays have a greater                   darkening
 effect on persons of brown skin than on those of fair                   ;   and that the
 former, especially the       darkest — the        blacks — are   better able to resist
 malaria        and the effects      of tropical    climates than the whites, and
 have thereby a better chance of escaping disease, and a 'premature
 death and extinction        of race.
 3.    Note on the Bisulphide of Iodine.                  By Frederick Guthrie.
      An examination         of the action of certain             compound         halogens
towards some of the olefines (the results of which                  I
                                                       hope shortly to
lay before this Society), has led me to consider incidentally the pre
paration of some of the compound halogens in the pure state.
      Of compound halogens, while the constitution of                    none       is more
invariable and definite than that of the bisulphide of chlorine, tho
bisulphide of iodine can scarcely be said to have been prepared, de
spite the so strong analogy between chlorine and iodine.
      That iodine combines with sulphur                 is well   known      ;    that such
combination         is attended by the liberation         of heat,      is equally well
established.         And since homogeneous mixtures of the two may                       be
prepared        in all proportions, it     is clear that a substance having             the
percentage composition of the bisulphide of iodine may be formed.
Bodies so formed have little or no title to the name of chemical
compounds.
      If   we remember, on the one hand, the fact which                 I    have abun
dantly proved elsewhere, that an equivalent of bisulphide of chlorine
functions as two equivalents of chlorine, or, as some chemists would
express     it,   that the molecule of bisulphide         of chlorine        is   biatomic   ;
and   if   further remember, that at least two equivalents of chlo
           we
rine or of zinc are required to recompose iodide of ethyl according
to the equations —

                                                         418
                          (1.)* C4H5          1    + 2  CI = C4H5C1 + I CI
                          (2.)      C1H5I          +   2Zn = C4H5Zn + ZnI,
  we must be prepared to anticipate the analogous recomposition                                     —
                             (3.) C4H6I +           S2C1
                                                            = C4HSC1 + S2I.
 This the more, since in the                   case       of certain compound groups,               such
 as    Na Sn,          we find
                             (4.) C4H5I        +   Na Sn = C4H5Sn + Na I.
       The method            I   employ for the preparation                     of the bisulphide        of
 iodine      is,
           in fact, based upon the validity of equation (3).  Recom-
                 akin                           the iodides of methyl     by
 positions quite       to (3) are undergone
 and of amyl, whenco we may assert the general equation                                     (5) —

                                                                     is   preferred.

        is                                                                                           The
 two liquids            may be mixed               in all proportions             without   a    greater
 change      in colour than         is   due to the            dilution of the coloured sulphide
  by   the colourless iodide         ;    neither         is   heat liberated, nor other imme
 diate token given of chemical                          change taking           place.    The    change
 appears to bo complete in about twelve hours.                                  If tho   recomposition
                     air, the chloride of ethyl evaporates as
 vessel be open to tho                                                                              it   is
formed, leaving the bisulphide of iodine in magnificent crystals,
contaminated, however,     tho products of the action of the mois
                                         by
ture of the air upon the bisulphide                             of chlorine.        For this     reason
the process        is    best     conducted in            a    hermetically       sealed tube.      The
co-reagents are used in the proportion                              shown by the equation,               a
very slight excess of the iodide being added.
  On opening      tube so charged which has been left overnight, and
                         a
applying       the heat of the hand, the chloride of ethyl                               escapes.     A
gentle heat suffices to expel the residual iodide of ethyl, whereupon
the bisulphide of iodine             is   left     in    the form of fine tabular crystals,
of the lustre of iodine and in                 a       state   of absolute purity.
   Although the exact composition of the substance may                                      be fairly
deduced      from its synthesis,              it   was     submitted       to analysis in the fol

      Though in this note the recomposition          is considered as a means
 of preparing      the compound halogen           S2I, it is perhaps of equal
 interest as offering a method for obtaining an organic          chloride from
 its  iodide, — a  problem otherwise difficult and cumbrous in solution,
 albeit its inverse is easy and of frequent occurrence.
 4. Notice of an Expeditious Method (believed to be new) for
      Computing the Time of Descent in a Circular Arc.                        By
      Edward Sang, Esq.
     In  determining      the intensity of gravitation from the oscillations
 of a pendulum, and in estimating the directive power of the earth's
 magnetism from the frequency of vibration of a needle, we have to
 make allowance for the extent of the arc through which the motions
take place.
     The formula usually given for this purpose contains a           series con
 verging    rapidly enough for very
small arcs, but which requires a
great amount of labour when the
angle of deflection     exceeds twenty
or   thirty degrees.
     My object is to give notice of
a process by which           the   labour
becomes insignificant.
    Let O    be the centre    of motion,
N    the lowest point of the curve,
and    AN    the arc through which
the     descent   is   to   take    place.
Having       drawn      the   horizontal
tangent      NC,     make     the   angle
NOC      one-fourth part of       NOA     ;
through C draw CD perpendicular
to  OC meeting ON produced in D, and inflect the chord NB equal
    vol. v.                                                        3  k

                                                         420
to twice       ND        ;   then the time of descent in the arc                  AN     is to the time
of descent in                BN   as   OD    is to   ON.
  By treating the arc                      BN in     the same way, we can obtain a third
arc, and so on, thus forming a series of arcs decreasing                                           more and
more rapidly as we proceed.
   Let the angle                  NOA      be denoted       by     4A0, NOB by 4Alt the next
angle of the series by 4A2, and so on                               ; then we have, for any two
consecutive         terms of the progression,
                  (tan A„)8
                             = sin 2An + i,     and
          time in 4A„ = (sec A.)8 x time in 4A„ + L
Now the time of descent in a small circular arc approaches to the
time in a cycloidal one, and hence,
        time in 4A0               =    {sec A0       x sec     Al    x   sec A2     x etc.}2           x
                                                 time in cycloid.
      As an example of the                        ease    and rapidity of the calculation,                       I
subjoin        the work for an angle of 160° from the nadir line, which
shows      that the time of oscillation                     in     an arc   of 320° is rather              more
than double of that in a minute arc.

5. Note on a       Modification of the Apparatus employed for one
    of Ampere's Fundamental Experiments in Electrodynamics.
    By Professor Tait.
    My attention    was recalled by    Principal Forbes's note (read to the
Royal Society      on   January 7th), to his request that          I  should at
leisure    try to repeat Ampere's experiment for the mutual repulsion
of two parts of the    same straight conductor, by means of an apparatus
which he had procured for the Natural Philosophy Collection in the
University.      Some days later    I tried   the experiment, but found that,
on account     of the narrowness of the troughs of mercury, it             was im
possible to prevent the capillary forces from driving the floating wire
to the sides of the vessel.       I therefore constructed an apparatus in
which the troughs were two inches wide, the arms of the float being
also at that distance apart.          Making the experiment according             to
Ampere's method with this arrangement,              I found one small Grove's
cell sufficient   to produce a steady motion of the float from the poles
of the pile ; in    fact, the only difficulty    in repeating the experiment
lies in obtaining    a perfectly clean mercurial       surface.
    Two objections have       been raised against     Ampere's interpretation
of this experiment, one of which is intimately connected with the
subject of Principal Forbes's note.            This is the difficulty of ascer
taining exactly what takes place where a voltaic current             passes from
one conducting body to another of different material.              It    is known
that thermal and thermo-electric           effects  generally accompany such
a passage.      To  get rid  of this source of uncertainty,     I have repeated
 Ampere's experiment in a form which excludes it entirely.                   In this
 form of the experiment the polar conductors and the float form one
continuous metallic mass with the mercury in the troughs               ;   the float
 being formed of glass tube filled with mercury, with its extremities
 slightly curved downwards       so as nearly to dip under the surface of the
 fluid  ; and the wires from the battery being plunged into the upturned
 outward extremities of two glass tubes, which are pushed through
 the ends of the troughs so as to project an inch or two inwards under
 the surface of the mercury.         A  little practice is requisite to success
 in filling the float and immersing it in the troughs without admitting
 a bubble of air.      This float, being heavier than the ordinary copper
 wire, plunges deeper in the fluid, and encounters more resistance to
 its motion, but, with two small Grove's cells only, Ampere's result

                                         422
 was easily reproduced, even when the extremities             of the float   rested
 in contact with those of the polar tubes before the circuit was com
 pleted.     It   is obvious that here no thermo-electric          effects can    be
 produced in the mercury, and         I  have satisfied myself that the motion
commences       before the passage    of the current   can have sensibly heated
the fluid in the tubes.
    The other      class   of objections to Ampere's conclusion from this
experiment, depending on the spreading of the current in the mer
cury of the troughs, is of course not met by this modification.                     I
have made        several experiments      with a view      to obviate this     also,
but my time has been so much occupied that               I  have not been      able
as yet to put       them in a form suitable        for communication       to this
Society.

     The following Communications               were read     : —
  1.  On the Properties of the Secretion of the Human Pancreas.
     By William Turner, M.B. (Lond.), Senior Demonstrator of
     Anatomy, University of Edinburgh.
     The author obtained the pancreatic secretion at a post-mortem
 examination which he made of the body of a patient of Mr Spence's,
 who had died with a medullary tumour in the head of the pancreas,
 which,    by compressing     the biliary and pancreatic ducts,            had    pro
 duced dilatation     of the ducts of     the  liver and gall-bladder, as well
 as  dilatation of   the   ducts and lobules of the pancreas.            The secre
 tion was contained       in the dilated     parts of the gland        last named,
 from which it     was drawn off by means         of  a pipette.    The fluid thus
 obtained    was  of an orange-yellow         colour,    and well-marked        viscid
 consistency —sp.    gr. 1"0105     ; appearance slightly turbid, owing to
 the presence    of small white flakes, which a microscopic examination
 proved to consist of groups of small spherical, colourless cells, re
 sembling, and most probably consisting              of, the epithelial     lining of
 the vesicles of the gland. Reaction faintly yet decidedly acid; heat,
 alcohol, corrosive sublimate, and bichloride of platinum threw down
 copious yellowish-white precipitates,        consisting of the peculiar albu
 minous constituent      of the secretion.       No reduction     was effected      by
 boiling the fluid     with   freshly   precipitated      blue oxide    of copper,
 showing the absence of sugar or any corresponding deoxidizing sub
 stance.    The absence of sulpho-cyanide of potassium was shown by
 no reaction being given with a solution          of perchloride of iron      ;  thus
affording a well-marked       distinction   between      the composition of the
human      saliva and pancreatic juice.         A    partial emulsionizing      effect
was produced by rubbing some of the              fluid with   a little oil.     With
another portion of the secretion, starch was converted into dextrine.
The action of the fluid upon albuminous              substances   was also tested,
but a negative result was obtained.            It should be stated, however,
that but a small quantity of the secretion was now left, and that a
day had elapsed between its withdrawal            from the body and the appli-

                                           426
cation of this test.        The author then adverted          to the accounts which
have been given by various physiologists of the pancreatic fluid ob
tained from the different domestic animals which it is usual to
experiment on when samples of this secretion are required, and con
cluded by showing in what respect the secretion of the human pan
creas agreed with, or differed from, that             of these animals.
2. On the        Acrid Fluid of the Toad (Bufo vulgaris). By John
                 Davy, M.D., F.R.S. Lond. and Edin., &c.
     The author first adverts to the conflicting opinions respecting the
nature of this fluid, and especially to one of the latest, that enter
tained by      MM. Gratiolet       and S. Cloez, that it is an active poison.
     He next describes       some experiments        he has made     for the purpose
of testing their conclusion, the results of which are in opposition to
theirs, and confirmatory of certain ones of his own, showing that
 the fluid is a simple acrid irritant, and as such well adapted to pro
 tect   an animal       otherwise defenceless, and, from its sluggish habits,
 peculiarly      exposed   to danger.
     Incidentally,     he makes      some   remarks     on   the toad of Barbadoes,
 which, brought from Dominica only a few years ago, has so multi
 plied     as   to abound     in every part of the island.           Its comparative
 rareness in Britain he attributes to two causes            :  one, the circumstance
 of  the very young toad being,           as he    believes, destitute of the acrid
  fluid  ;   another,    the intolerance     of the toad of all       ages  of severe
 cold, and in consequence, its           liability  to perish    if the winter tem
 perature be unusually          low.
      In   a foot-note, he expresses the opinion, founded on one observa
  tion, that the female toad during the breeding season is without the
  protecting acrid fluid, the male at that time having it in more than
  ordinary abundance, and, from position, whilst the ova are in tran
 situ, probably defending his mate.
 3. On Gyrolite occurring with Calcite                   in Apophyllite in the
      Trap of the Bay of Fundy. By                   Henry How, Professor of
      Chemistry and Natural History, King's College, Windsor,
      Nova Scotia.
      The mineral gyrolite was first described by Professor Anderson
 of Glasgow,* as a new species from the Isle of Skye ; it is stated by
              * Trana. Roy.   Soc. Edin., and  Phil. Mag.     Feb. 1851.

                                                 427
Greg and Lettsom*              to occur without doubt at two localities              in Green
land, and according to Heddle at Faroe.                          The only other notice of
it that   I  am acquainted with is by                L.  Saemann,       who mentions^ that
he examined        a specimen       — no      locality being given — mixed or inter-
laminated with pectolite, and suggests                    that this       mineral,    losing its
alkali,  becomes        gyrolite, and, losing its lime, becomes okenite.                       No
other analysis than the original                  one    of Professor        Anderson      has,   I
believe,    been      published     ;   the following         account of its occurrence
among the minerals of Nova Scotia shows it in such associations as
affords a mode of explaining                its origin by change in apophyllite.
     I met with        it in Annapolis Co.,             N.S.,     some 25      miles S.W. of
Cape Blomida,          between Margaretville and Port George, on the sur
face   of fractured           crystalline apophyllite, and,             on  further breaking
the mass, a good many spherical concretions of pearly lustrous plates
 were observed in the interior, of sizes varying from that of                            a    pin's
head to nearly              half-an-inch       in diameter       ;  their    outline    was well
defined, and the external               characters,       as given       by   Anderson, were
 recognised on examination                ;   it afforded       the    following    results     on
analysis    : — The         mineral   was       ignited    for    water, and       the residue
treated with hydrochloric             acid, the resulting dried silica was weighed,
 and then fused with carbonated alkali, and the weight of the small
quantities of alumina, &c., so separated, was deducted from that of the
 first silica.       I   place my numbers by the side of those                     of Professor
Anderson,      and give the calculated percentages for                      his formula     : —

    Some of the numerous cavities in                  the apophyllite        were empty,
 some entirely filled with        gyrolite, and in others separate plates of
this mineral were standing            edgewise,     leaving vacant spaces,          while,
 upon and by the side         of the plates were in some cases rhombohedral
crystals,      which proved to consist          of calcite,      and were sometimes
present alone in the cavities, which varied from being quite                      shallow
to  half-an-inch in depth.          It  is mentioned by         Anderson that gyro-
lite occurs associated with stilbite,             laumonite,       and other     zeolites,
and is sometimes found coating crystals of apophyllite.
    The difference in chemical             composition          between      apophyllite
and gyrolite        is very well seen on comparing               the respective      theo
retical percentages of their constituents             ;  thus,

and the existence of the calcite in the cavities seems clearly to show,
that the gyrolite is formed from the apophyllite by the action of the
water which deposited the carbonate of lime, reacting on the silicate
of  potass,     and dissolving out at the same time the fluorine or fluoride
of calcium ;* trial was made for fluorine                  on   two fragments of        the
gyrolite, and no evidence of its existence obtained.
4. On     Natro-boro-calcite, and another Borate occurring in the
    Gypsum of Nova Scotia.                   By Henry How, Professor of
    Chemistry and Natural History, King's College, Windsor,
    N.S.
                                                I
    About three years and a half ago, showed the existence of Natro-
boro-calcite in the gypsum of Windsor, N.S.|                       I  was not aware at
that time that        Dr Hayes of Boston, U.S.,          had announced his convic-
tionj that the       soda which had been attributed            to this mineral was an
impurity, and        had given, as the true expression           of the composition of
the pure mineral, the formula CaO 2                BOt    + 6   HO. Had I known
this,   I    should    have adverted       to   the probability         of his    mineral
(Hayesine,        Dana) constituting      a distinct      species from       Natro-boro-
calcite, whose existence seems            to  be sufficiently        established by    the
repeated      finding of not very dissimilar        quantities of soda in analyses

In   the account of the analysis            by Anderson,         the quantities of soda
and sulphuric          acid, as given above, are reversed           ; from the conclu
sion    drawn by the author, this is evidently a typographical                        error.
As    regards the amount of water present, no mention is made, in
any case but my own, as to the temperature at which the substance
was dried      ;   in my analysis the mineral was air-dried.                  The  soda,   it
will   be observed,        is a constant ingredient,     in pretty uniform amount,
in all but the first two analyses             ;  and in my, examination as stated
at the time, the mineral was washed,                  for the second analysis, with
cold water       till all sulphuric acid        was removed.
    From the preceding data the following                    formula;    have    been    de

all referring to         a mineral   found in rounded masses, consisting of in
terwoven fibres, opaque, snow-white,                 and of a silky lustre.
    The mineral           to which  I  would now draw attention was found in
the same quarry as the preceding, at a distance of about 100 yards,
and at about 20 feet lower level, and also associated with glauber-
salt, which, it is worthy of notice, is generally met with here, accord
ing to the quarrymen, in narrow seams at the line of junction of the
" hard plaster " (anhydrite) with the " soft plaster " (gypsum).                            I
detected it in the form of an opaque white substance without lustre,

the crystalline structure to which       I  shall presently advert, are,          I
think, sufficient to show that it is

I am  very well aware that it is unsafe to base a formula upon a
single analysis, especially of a mineral substance, and most espe
cially after making deductions as above, and                            I   cannot, in this case,
insist   on the one brought out, but it is not anomalous.                                       We find

     I mentioned            that the mineral presented no appearance of crystalline
structure to the naked eye.                      Not having at hand, at the time                    I was
at work upon                it,   a   sufficiently good microscope,         I   sent      a   portion of
the mineral to Professor Robb, of the University of New Brunswick,
at Fredericton, with                   a    letter stating my results and my doubt as to
the substance being crystalline.                   I        received this answer — "              In spite
of your       odd      formula,         the mineral just as         I   got   it,   untouched and

Owing        to   their excessive thinness               I    could not say whether                  they
could be called right or oblique rhombic prisms                         ;    I   suspect the latter
from analogy.             By care the           '
                                                    Tiza' (Natro-boro-calcite) can                        be
shown to consist of very fine prisms, sharp, angular, and long, but
too    fine for me to state their form.                       The diameter was              less     than
•00118 of an English inch.     The long prismatic needles of the Tiza
are in great contrast to the broad tables of the recent mineral in
your last letter ; of that the plates are about '0048 of an inch from
side to side, but some are a little larger, others a little smaller.                                   In
                                 cleavage— that

some you see regular                                         a     small rhomb chipped out
of    one side.      As far      as form goes, therefore,               it   would seem to           be   a
distinct and definite species.              I        presume       it   was      formed     in a      dry
place, for the angles were              quite sharp.               The connection            between
these       borates and sulphates of lime and sulphate of soda                                  is   very
curious."
 I         may state that  I       had subsequently the opportunity                        of   appre
ciating the great accuracy of this description of the appearance of                                   the
two minerals.

                                                                                 I I

allusion to its microscopic crystalline structure.
      The truth of the last sentence in Professor Robb's letter                                 is   very
apparent.          In   my former     paper on the subject,                 I     adverted         to the
existence of Natro-boro-calcite in the gypsum here, as confirming
Dawson's theory of the origin of the rock from the action of volcanic
waters on         carbonate of lime.                It   is   interesting        to observe that
Bechi* found the            same      (?)   mineral,          with other borates, in                  the
lagoons of Tuscany.          The hydrated condition of both the borates
found here,        and of the associated sulphate of soda, shows the action
of water     ;    but that of ordinary sea-water would not account for the
presence       of boracic acid.        As regards the               soda, the sulphate               and
borate  of lime were probably the substances originally present, and
chloride of sodium in water being introduced might remove part                                            of
the calcium         as chloride, and   furnish borate and sulphate of soda.
It    is   confirmatory    of this view that a small quantity of rock-salt                             in
crystalline       grains has recently been found in the gypsum.

5. On some        Derivatives      from the Olefines.         By Frederick
    Guthrie, Professor of Chemistry and Physics in the Royal
    College, Mauritius.
   This paper is supplementary         to, and forms the sequel of, a series
of papers which have       been published     in the  " Quarterly Journal of
the Chemical Society of London."
   In   continuing    the  examination     of the behaviour of the olefines
towards compound halogens, certain compounds previously described
have been submitted to a test of homogeneity, of which the following
is the principle   : —
   "  If a body be     partly dissolved in a solvent, and     if the dissolved
part and  the undissolved part, or the dissolved part and the whole, or
the undissolved part and the whole, have the same composition, then
the body is a simple one."
   Examined in this manner with regard to the solvent alcohol, the
bisulphochlorides of ethylen and amylen were shown to be true
chemical compounds.
   The bisulphochloride of ethylen was submitted to the action of
chlorine, whereupon a body was formed identical with that got by
the action of chlorine      upon the bisulphochloride     of chlorethylen or
upon the bisulphide of ethyl — namely, the         chlorosulphide of bichlor-
ethylen or sulphide of terchlorethyl
                                 C4  H2 CI, S.
   Further, the same body C4 H4 S2 CI was submitted, in alcoholio
solution, to the action of hydrate of potash, which converted it into
                              C4  H4    S2
                                            OHO.
   Again,   the body C10 H10 S2       CI (whose equivalent of chlorine has
been shown to be replacible by        O and by OHO), on treatment with
cyanide   and sulphocyanide       of potassium in alcoholic solution, ex
changes its chlorine      for cyanogen or sulphocyanogen respectively,
giving rise to
             Bithiocyanide    of amylen,               C10 H10 S2    Cy
        and Bithiosulphocyanide       of amylen,    C10 H10 S2 S2    Cy
respectively.
   From    these and analogous          reactions  previously described, the
conclusion   is drawn that the bodies C4 H4 S9 CI and C10 H10 Sg CI

                                      434
 behave towards chlorine     like the sulphides of chloriniferous      radicles,
 while towards metallic oxides, hydrated oxides, cyanides, and sulpho-
cyanides, they behave like chlorides        of sulphuriferous   radicles,

    The bisulphide of amylen,
                                  Cio H10 S2,
was produced by the withdrawal         of the chlorine from C,0 H10       S2 CI
by  means  of metallic  zinc — a    reaction analogous to the reduction of
kakodyl from its chloride.
   The bichloride of amylen,
                                 Cio H10    C12,
could not be formed by the direct union of chlorine and amylen, but
was produced by the       action of amylen       upon the pentachloride        of
phosphorus.
   The binitroxide of amylen,
                                C10 H10 2NO„
which is formed in small quantity when nitric acid and amylen react
on one another, was formed in abundance when NO4 was led into
amylen.     This reaction shows how completely NO4 obeys the laws
of the halogens, and leads to its being called nitroxine.            The   same
property is again illustrated by the conversion of the latter body
into bicyanide of amylen,
                            Cio Hio CJ2 + 5Aq,
by the action    of  cyanide of potassium in alcoholic solution, the
nitrite of potash or nitroxide of potassium KNO4 being formed at
the same time.     The   five equivalents    of water are feebly    combined.
An experiment     to procure the pimelate of potash from the bicyanide
of amylen by the action of caustic potash was without result.
    By the action of nitric acid upon the bisulphochloride          of  amylen
the nitroxisulphide of nitroxamylen is formed,

together with a conjugate sulphur acid.
   Finally, when zinc-ethyl and bisulphochloride              of amylen      are
brought together in ethereal solution, the chlorine of the latter body
is replaced by ethyl, and a body formed having the constitution and
properties of the bisulphide of cenanthyl —

of certain compound halogens upon the olefines cthylen and amylen.

 1.   On the Molecular Theory of Organization.                 By Professor
                       Bennett, M.D., F.R.S.E., &c.
    Parodying the celebrated expression of Harvey, viz., Omne animal
ex  ovo, it has been attempted to formularise the law of development
by the expression omnis cellula      e  cellula, and to maintain      "  that we
must not transfer the seat of real action to any point beyond the
cell." * In the attempts which have been made to support this ex
clusive doctrine,     and to give all the tissues and all vital properties
a cell   origin,  the great    importance    of the molecular      element, it
seemed to the author, had been         strangely overlooked.       It   becomes
important, therefore,      to show that real action, both physical and
vital, may    be seated in minute particles, or molecules much           smaller
than cells, and that we must obtain a knowledge of such action in
these molecules     if we desire to comprehend the laws       of organization.
To this end the author directed attention : 1st, To a       description of the
nature and mode of origin of organic molecules ; 2d, To              a demon
stration of the fact that these molecules possess inherent           powers or
forces, and are present in all those tissues which manifest vital force;
and 3d,   To   a law which governs the combination, arrangement,             and
behaviour of these       molecules during   the development of organised
tissue.
    I. By   a molecule was understood      a minute body, seen under high
magnifying powers in all organic fluids and textures, varying in
size from the four-thousandth of an inch down to a scarcely visible
point, which may be calculated at much less than the twenty-thou
sandth of an inch in diameter.        Optically it is distinguished accord
ing to its size — the smallest presenting dark or light points as the
focus is changed,      and the larger exhibiting a dark or light centre,

surrounded by a distinctly shadowed ring.           These last are frequently
distinguished   by the name of granules.         The ultimate molecule had
never been reached even with the highest            magnifying    powers.     In
the same manner that the astronomer              with his telescope    resolves
nebula; into clusters of stars, and       sees  other nebulae    beyond them,
so the histologist     with    his   microscope   magnifies    molecules    into
granules, and sees further molecules come into view.             The chemical
composition of these molecules must vary infinitely, but the author had
been   in the habit of classifying them into three groups and referring
them to, 1st, the albuminous,          2d, the fatty, and 3cJ, the mineral
compounds.       These    constituents    may be mingled     together in vari
ous proportions,    so as to produce simple and compound molecules.
In   the vast majority of cases they are globular in shape, but they
may be angular, square, and of various            forms.    They may differ
in size or   be of tolerably      uniform size in the same liquid or sub
stance.     They may    be  regularly or irregularly diffused in the matter
examined.      Sometimes they are concentrated          in particular    places,
and at others scattered in groups.           Their colour is various.      Most
of the pigments in plants        and animals are dependent on the forma
tion of molecules, which in the human lung have been proved to be
pure carbon, and in the tissues of plants and animals differently
tinted kinds of fat or of wax.
    These molecules may be formed in two different             ways, — 1st, by
precipitation in fluids ; 2c£, by the disintegration of previously formed
tissues.    The former may be called histogenetic (lerog and y'tmn,
gene-ratio), and the latter histolytic (ierot and Xuovj, dissolutio).
They may      be denominated       molecules of formation and molecules of
disintegration.
    Histogenetic    molecules are formed either from the union of two
simple organic fluids or from precipitations          occurring   in formative
fluids, holding various substances in solution.        Fourteen years ago the
author read to the Society a paper giving an account of the results
obtained by a union of oil and liquid albumen, the two organic fluids
from which molecular matter is most commonly derived.                    It was
 Dr Ascherson of Berlin,       who first discovered the important     fact, that
 the mere contact of oil and fluid albumen caused             the latter to co
agulate in the form       of  a membrane, which       he called the haptogen
 membrane, from
                     '
                       Airro/uil   to come   in contact.    A   more complete
mixture of two such drops             produces, as is well known,       a white

                                        438
opaque    fluid or emulsion, which in structure exactly resembles milk.
That is to say, it consists of molecules composed of a drop of oil
surrounded by a layer or membrane of coagulated albumen.                      Such
compound molecules possessing the property of endosmose                may there
fore readily be produced artificially, and by trituration can be reduced
in size so as to resemble the elementary molecules in chyle or in the
yolk of the egg.        If oil and albumen be introduced into the stomach
and intestinal canal, they are always so reduced; and one          of the   objects
of digestion would appear to be separating from the food, and render
ing fluid its oil and albumen, so as to produce the chyle               molecules
which are ultimately transformed into blood.              Indeed, everywhere in
living organisms it may        be observed,    that oil and albumen formed        as
secretions by plants, and entering the bodies of animals as food, either
separately or united, constitute the chief origin of molecular formations.
    Mr Rainey      has recently pointed out the condition which              causes
molecular mineral         matter to assume the form of rounded             nuclear
bodies.*      This condition     is viscosity.    If carbonate of lime be dis
solved in water, the forms produced on its precipitation              are crystal
line  ; but   if the fluid be glutinous, composed, for example, of fluid,
gelatine, or gum, the forms produced are oval or globular.                   Preci
pitations made in this way on slides of glass, closely resemble the
 appearances called nuclear or cellular in different stages of develop
 ment.      Mr Rainey        has further shown        how starch granules        are
 produced in      the juices    of vegetables      by the    endosmose    of    gum
 into a cell containing a solution of dextrine.f            In the same manner
 that the contact of oil and albumen produces oleo-albuminous mole
 cules, so does the contact of gum and dextrine precipitate                  starch
 molecules.      In this    manner we can comprehend how the mixture
 of various organic fluids gives rise to particles of different kinds.
     Histolytic molecules are the result            of the transformation        and
 disintegration     of fluid and solid substances by chemical or mechanical
 action.     They are generally larger in size than histogenetic molecules,
 are  more purely fatty, and from being associated with the debris of
 broken-down texture may, in most instances, readily be distinguished.
 Thus, in the breaking up of cells and of muscles when they become             fatty,

or in the putrefaction of vegetable or animal            matters, these may be
seen to soften, lose their peculiar structure, break up, and           ultimately
be reduced    to a molecular condition.
   We shall subsequently        see  that these two kinds of molecules are
constantly    changing    places,   or, in other words,        molecular   matter
formed from the process of disintegration          may, when placed under
peculiar circumstances, become the basis of matter which undergoes
development.       In nature, the breaking down of             one   substance is
the necessary step to the formation of another, and the histolytic or
disintegrative molecules of one period become the histogenetic or for
mative molecules of another.          This fact constitutes      the basis of the
law which    I  shall subsequently seek to establish.
   II.   The author pointed out, in the       second place, that these mole
cules are governed by forces, which induce among them a variety of
movements, and cause         them to combine        in definite ways.         This
force, which we may call molecular force, is altogether independent
of cell, nucleus, or other form of structure.
    1st,  He alluded to the well-known molecular          movements     described
by Robert Brown.         These vibratile, circular, serpentine, or irregular
motions may be observed whenever molecules are suspended in fluids
of certain densities, but are too well known            to require notice here.
They occur altogether independent of organised structures, and must
be regarded as in their nature purely physical.
    2d, The peculiar movements            observed    in the interior     of cells
vegetable or animal,       and during the putrefaction of organic matter.
The former     are seen in the large vegetable cells of the Chara,         Vallis-
neria, and Tradescantia,       among plants    ; and those of chyle, the yolk
of the   egg, and   of the salivary cell among animals.           The author had
frequently    watched the formation of the latter         in   putrid fluids.   A
scum composed      of molecules collects on the surface      ;  gradually several
of   these unite in minute     filaments more or less long, which assume
vibratile or serpentine movements.           They    are then called vibriones.
It  has been    much disputed whether this class of molecular motions
be physical or vital.
    3d,   The movements which are unquestionably               vital that occur in
the molecules of       the yolk, on    the  entrance into the ovum of the
spermatozoid.       Here it cannot      be maintained      that the results are
purely physical,     because in different ova we see such widely varying

effects from     apparently the same cause.           Neither can it       be attri
buted to any direct influence of the cell or of its nucleus, the germinal
vesicle.     For example, an        egg    is fully maturated       in the   female
organs of generation, and would prove abortive if a spermatozoid did
not find its way through the zona-pellucida and get among the mole
cules of the yoke.       As  soon as    it  does so, the apparently purposeless
Brunonian movements receive            a   new impulse and       direction.     Both
spermatozoid and germinal           vesicle are    dissolved    among them,       and
that wonderful phenomenon of the division of the yoke takes                    place,
not by cleavage or other action of the cell wall or nucleus, but by
the separation of the mass into two masses instead of one.                       This
was compared to what is observable in a dense crowd                 of men,    called
upon to pass over to the right or left hand in order to settle any
disputed question by a majority.            At first unusual confusion is com
municated to the whole         ;  some     hurry in     one  direction,   others     in
another    ; but after a time there is seen at the margins, where                  the
crowd is least dense,      a clear space, which gradually approaches               the
centre, and at length bisecting the whole, produces a complete segrega
tion of the crowd into two portions. So with the molecules of the yolk
in the egg after impregnation        ; their movements       are directed by con
ditions which did not previously exist, and a stimulus is imparted                    to
them which causes the peculiar result.             It  is the division and subdi
vision of the yolk, wholly or in part, which produces the germinal mass
out of which the embryo is formed, and this not by any direct influ
ence   of the cell or nucleus, but in         consequence    of  a power inherent
in the molecules themselves, which was communicated                    to them for
a specific purpose.
     4«A,  The peculiar movements           so well described by      Briicke, Von
 Wittich, Harless,     and   especially by Lister, in the pigment cells of
 the frog's skin ;* and which occasion           the sudden change of colour in
 the cameleon, in fishes,        and   numerous other animals.           The black
 pigment molecules may be diffused throughout                the cell or concen
 trated in a mass, and all kinds of intermediate gradations may exist
 between     diffusion   and concentration.          The    change in colour is
 owing to these alterations in the molecules, the tint being light when
 they are concentrated, and dark when they are diffused.                 Mr Lister
 ascertained by experiment         that their concentration is caused by ex-

posure to light, by death of the animal, and by sudden section of
the nerve going to the skin — while darkness and irritation of the
nerve or skin causes diffusion.                    Sudden amputation      of a limb pro
duced at first            diffusion,       followed by the concentration          of death.
These         movements       of the pigment            molecules are peculiarly         vital,
and altogether            independent        of   the cell wall or nucleus.         The cell
wall     is    stationary, and acts             only as a sac or investing membrane
around the moving particles, while the concentration of these about
the nucleus is purely accidental, and frequently occurs in other parts
of the cell.  The author had seen these molecules himself, as Mr
Lister describes them, streaming out to and returning from the cir
cumference under the influence of the stimuli referred to, where no
cell nor nuclear action could be thought of.
   5th, There are many other kinds of movements which are evidently
independent of cells       for example, those of cilia and of spermato-
                               :
zoids.        The former are outside cells, and the latter only move when
they are liberated from cells.                    The contractile fibrilhe of muscle are
evidently not dependent for their inherent power on cells or other
form of structure,           but on the square-shaped molecules of which its
substance is composed.                    All   these phenomena, therefore,         are con
nected with the molecules themselves ; the force occasioning them is
a molecular force, and has nothing to do with pre-existing                          cells, or
supposed germinal centres, as some have imagined.
   Again,        the power of combination               between these molecules, which,
under peculiar conditions, not only move, but so move as to advance
towards and press             upon each other,           that they at length      unite and
produce higher forms,                must also be attributed to a molecular              force
operating in obedience              to fixed laws.        Thus it   was demonstrated by
Newton, that in            a sphere         the total attraction     resulting     from the
particular attraction of all its component parts, is,                    as regards       any
body drawn towards                 it,   the same as    if   they had been   concentrated
at the centre.            Hence minute spherical particles, as so many gravi
tating points, will          be drawn        towards each other with     a   force varying
inversely as the squares of the distances between        their respective
centres.        The author referred at length to the able descriptions of
Mr Rainey,*          as to the physical            laws regulating    the formation and
disintegration  of bodies by molecular attraction and repulsion as well
as to the effects of molecular superposition, showing that the same

physical    power    which    leads    to   the formation      of  these   artificial
bodies, when long continued, causes their disintegration              and destruc
tion.    All   these changes occur slowly, and require time ; but their
contemplation,     when regarded as purely physical              phenomena, must
strike us with surprise, as being closely allied to all our conceptions
of   the progress   of life itself.
     Here the author explained, that in making              use  of the expressions
life and vital action, he was only using terms             to indicate phenomena
which, in the present state         of   science,   cannot be accounted for by
 the ordinary laws of physics.              Or it might      be said that     certain
 actions are directed and governed by conditions                 which are as yet
 undetermined,     but which, as they only occur in organic,              as  distin
 guished from inorganic bodies, constitute vital actions.               Not that    an
 organised body is independent of physical forces, but that certain di
 rections are communicated to them            ; which, as invariably resulting in
 specific forms or properties, make up the sum of what we call vitality.
      Hence, although we seemoleculescombining in the forms of crystals
 and nucleated spherules, inasmuch as we have discovered the physical
  conditions   on which they depend, and can produce them                artificially,
  we   have   no  difficulty in classifying these among purely physical
  phenomena, even when they occur in the interior of animals.                      But
  when other molecules unite to form nuclei, cells, and fibres,                    and
  these arrange themselves into tissues and organs to produce                   plants
  and animals, wo are ignorant of the conditions by which these results
  are brought     about — we cannot imitate            them artificially, and       are
   content to call them vital.          But the fact the author was anxious
   to point out was this, that        so far as observation and research had
   enabled us to investigate this difficult matter, it would appear that
   the formations     and disintegrations         of  vegetables   and animals,       as
   well as the peculiar properties they exhibit, are essentially connected
   with the molecular element.          Thus, when we investigate the functions
   of plants  and  animals — for example, generation, nutrition, secretion,
    motion, and sensation, — we find them all necessarily dependent                   on
    the permanent existence and constant formation of molecules.
       Thus generation, both in plants and animals, is accomplished                   by
    the union of certain     molecular particles called the male and female
    elements of reproduction.           Among the Protophyta, the conjuga
    tion of two cells enables their contents, or the endochrome, to mix
    together.    This endochrome is        a mass    of coloured molecules,    and the

                                                 443
union of two such masses constitutes the essential part of the gener
ative act.  In the Cryptogamia, a vibratile autheroid particle enters
a germ cell, and finds this last filled with a mass                       of molecules which,
on receiving the stimulus                it imparts,        assumes     the power of growth.
It   is the same among the Phanerogamia,                              when the germ-cell                       is
impregnated          by the pollen tube.                  In all these    cases it is necessary
to remember           that      the    protoplasm         is a mass of molecules                ;   that a
spore is another mass of molecules                    ;   that sporules are molecules                ;   that
antherozoids are only molecules with vibratile appendages                                  ;   and that
the so-called germinal                matter of the ovule is also nothing but                       a mass
of molecules.             Cell-forms are subsequent                processes,       and once pro
duced may multiply endogenously, by gemmation                                  or cleavage;                   all
that is here contended for               is,   that the primary form           is   molecular, and
that the force-producing action in                     it   is
                                                            a    molecular force.
     In   animals, as in vegetables, every primary act of generation                                           is
brought      about         by   the agency of molecules.                The Protozoa entirely
consist of mere molecular gelatiniform                       masses, in which         it       has never
been pretended that              a    cell wall or central cell exists.              And yet such
masses     have the power             of independent motion, and of multiplying                                by
gemmation.            Considerable          discussion has occurred as to whether,
among Infusorians,               there   is
                                         a      union of sexes or a conjugation similar
to what occurs among the Protophyta                          ;   but in either case,            it       is    by
molecular fusion that the end                   is   accomplished.        In   the higher classes
of animals there are male elements, consisting of molecules, generally
with, but sometimes destitute of, vibratile filaments, and female                                         ele
ments, composed of the yolk within the ovum, containing a germinal
vesicle or included cell.                 Both spermatozoid and germinal vesicle
are dissolved in the molecules of the yolk, which then, either wholly
or in part,          by   successive     divisions and transformations,                constitute               a
germinal        mass out         of which the embryo               is   formed.        Here,             as    in
 plants,   it   is   necessary        to remember that the spermatozoids, the yolk,
and the germinal mass, are all composed                          of molecules, and that these,
combining        together,         form    the nuclei, cells, fibres, and membranes
 which build         up the tissues            and organs of the organism.                      It   is       not
 from either the male or the female element that the embryo                                    is   formed.
The supporters of an exclusive cell doctrine have                                   endeavoured                to
show that there            is   always a direct descent either from the wall of the
ovum or from the germinal vesicle as its nucleus.                                   Thus       some con
sider that the vitelline                membrane sends in partitions                  to divide the

                                          444
 yolk mechanically.           Others have formed the idea that the germinal
 vesicle bursts, and that its included granules constitute the germs of
those cells which subsequently form in the germinal mass.                    Others,
again,    suppose      that on impregnation      the germinal        vesicle divides
first,  and that the molecules of the yolk are attracted                  round the
two centres    so   formed.       But numerous observations had satisfied          the
author that       both spermatozoid        and germinal      vesicles are      simply
dissolved among the molecules of the yolk, from the substance of
which, stimulated          and modified by the mixture so occasioned, the
embryo is formed         ;  a view which has   further the merit of explaining
what is known of the qualities             of both parents observable in the
offspring.    He was only acquainted with one exception to this general
law, viz., the development of Pyrozoma, recently described by Mr
Huxley, the description of which, however,              was   incomplete.*        The
truth appears       to   be, that   in an analogous manner to that in which
the pigment molecules of the skin are stimulated                  by the access of
light   to enter     into certain vital     combinations with one        another,    so
are the molecules of the yolk stimulated by the access             of the sperma
tozoid to produce those            other vital combinations      that result in       a
new being.        The essential action is not       so much connected, as has
hitherto    been    supposed, with the cell wall or nucleus as with the
molecular element of the ovum.
    With regard to nutrition — food and all assimilable material                 must
be reduced, in the first          instance, to the molecular form, while           the
fluid from which           the blood is prepared,     viz. chyle, is essentially
molecular.       Most of the secretions originate          in the effusion       of   a
fluid into    the    gland follicle,    which   becomes    molecular, and gives
rise to cell formation.          In  muscle, the power of contractility is in
herently associated with the ult imate molecules of which the fasciculus
is composed     ;  and lastly, the grey matter         of  the   sensory    ganglia,
and of the brain,        which furnishes     the conditions     necessary    for the
exercise of secretion, and of even intellect itself, is associated with
layers of molecules which are             unquestionably    active    in producing
the various modifications         of nervous force.    These molecules are con
stant and permanent as an integral part of these tissues, as much                   as
cells or fibres are essential parts of others, and their function is not
transitory,   but essential to the organs to which they belong.
   All   these facts     point   to the conclusion    that vital action,      so  far

from being exclusively          seated    in cells, is also intimately      associated
with the elementary molecules of the organism.
     III.   This leads me, in the third place,          to an enunciation of the mo
lecular law of growth, which           a study of the numerous facts previously
 referred to has induced me to frame, viz.                : — That  the development
 and grwuth of organic           tissues  is primarily owing       to the successive
formation of histogenetic and histolytic molecules. We have already
 seen that development             and   growth      in animals    originate    in the
 molecules of the yolk of the egg, or of a germinal molecular                     mass
 formed from it.         The author referred       to numerous careful researches
 recognised by scientific men as giving a correct account of the de
 velopment of various animals              and   textures.     From   these   it would
 appear that the first form was molecular; that the molecules united
 to produce nuclei      and cells    ; that these became disintegrated to pro
 duce a secondary mass of molecules ; that these again united to form
 secondary nuclei and cells          ; and that the same process was repeated
 more     or   less   often in various developments, until the animal                 or
 tissue was formed.         This constituted       the successive   histogenetic and
 histolytic   molecules observable in the process of growth,            — the   former
 building up,      to a certain extent, and the product            disintegrating     to
 produce the latter, which after a time, again, re-arranged                 itself and
 became histogenetic to form cells or tissues, which in their turn broke
 down and       became    histolytic.      In  short, not only     development, but
 growth and secretion, absorption and excretion, were only different
 names given to histogenetic and histolytic processes,                and that these
 were brought        about by formative and disintegrative molecules.                As
 illustrations of this law, the author minutely followed the develop
 ment of Ascarix mystax, as described by Nelson,* and of the pro
 cess  of nutrition in the human body.
     In this, and a vast number of similar observations, it must                be evi
 dent that a certain series of molecular               transformations   is necessary
 for the   one which follows it.           Thereby is produced a continual          ela
  boration of matter,     —a    constant chemical and morphological series of
 changes, — the exact number and order of which, in the production of
  organic    forms, only      requires     time and       perseverance to discover.
 Doubtless various conditions, dynamical, chemical, and vital, must
 co-operate in producing the result, and they must all influence mole-

cular as well as every other kind of combination.         Such   considera
tions and facts must convince        us of the error   of endeavouring     to
place the source     of special vital action in any particular form        or
arrangement of organic matter, whether fibre, cell, nucleus, or mole
cule.    Each and all of these elements, the author contended, had
their vital endowments, which re-operate on the others.           But, inas
much as the molecular element is the first as well as the last         form
which organised      matter assumes, it must constitute      the principal
foundation of organisation itself.
    The author pointed out that it was not his object, in directing
attention to a molecular theory of organisation, to interfere in any
way with the well-observed facts on which physiologists         have based
what has been called the Cell-theory of growth.         True, this last will
require modification,    in so far as unknown processes of growth have
been hypothetically     ascribed to the direct metamorphosis of cell ele
ments.      But a cell once formed     may produce other cells by buds,
by division, or by proliferation,    without a new act of generation, in
the same manner that many plants and animals do, and this fact com
prehends most of the admitted observations having reference to the
cell doctrine.   The molecular, therefore, is in  no way opposed   to a true
cell theory of growth, but constitutes a wider generalisation         and a
broader basis for its operations.        Neither does it give any counte
nance to the doctrines of equivocal or spontaneous generation.          It  is
not a fortuitous concourse of molecules that can give rise to a plant
or animal, but only such a molecular mass as descends from parents,
and receives the appropriate      stimulus to act in certain directions.
    In conclusion, the author remarked that the theory he had        endea
 voured to establish on histological and physiological grounds, is fully
supported by all the known facts of disease and of morbid growths,
which further serve to show that pathology, so far from being cellu
lar, is in truth molecular.
2. Notices     of Early Scotch Planting.         By Prof. Cosmo Innes.
    The   common      opinion  that   Scotland  was  at  one  time   closely
wooded,    is at least questionable, and some circumstances lead to an
opposite belief   : as,
    The careful stipulations found in the most ancient deeds, about
giving or withholding a limited use of wood for building and fuel.

                                         447
      The    use  of foreign timber for our greater buildings, when to be
  had   ;  thus, Norway timber used for building the Abbey of Arbroath,
  in the 15th century.
      The importation of bow-staves and spear-shafts, such long straight
  timber not being procurable at home.
     The     trees found  in peat-mosses, for the most part small and few,
  and confined to      narrow spaces, by no means prove a general cover
  ing of wood in ancient times.
      One reason of the common error is the change of meaning which
  the word forest has undergone.          From its etymology, the word has
  no connection with wood, and of old, and especially with old lawyers,
 it meant merely land privileged          for the chase ; but many people,
 meeting the word in old charters and descriptions of estates, suppose
  it to mean as at present, wood-land.
      It  is clear, however, that there has always been some wood, even
 timber, in Scotland.
     The earliest Christian churches were of timber, probably in all
 countries ; and the building of churches of stone was considered a
 novelty at the beginning         of our acquaintance with church architec
 ture in Scotland.
     The forts built in inland lakes and morasses, which the Irish
 have taught us to call         cranogues, of great antiquity, perhaps the
 most ancient extant dwellings except caves and burrows, are found
 often built on piles of oak of moderate size, and sometimes with
 beams of birch for the cross timber.
     Sometimes beside these forts, but often apart, are found the shells
 of rude but large         canoes,  bespeaking a high   antiquity, each  hol
 lowed out of a single oak.
     Within the period of history (a.d. 1249), the Earl of St Pol and
 Blois, preparing for the Crusades, had         a wonderful  ship (navis mi-
 randa) built at Inverness.
     The Bishop of Caithness, Chancellor of Scotland, and a friend of
 Edward the First, being engaged (a.d. 1291) in putting a roof on
 his cathedral of Dornoch, obtained from the king a grant of 40
oaks, fit for timber, to be taken out of the wood (6o»co) of Darna-
way, in Moray.
     The Bishop of Brechin granting (a.d. 1435) a lease of the         Kirk-
davoch of Strachan for three lives, took the tenant bound              to de
liver, not periodically,      but once only, oak laths enough for roofing

20 perches of the cathedral, or the Bishop's                palace— tantas vulga-
riter dictas lathis bonas      et sujhcientes    de quercu.
    Two centuries later (1606), Alexander Davidson, styled tymber-
man in St Andrews, agrees with " the honest man that has bocht
the wod of Drum, for als mekill               tymber       as   will big ane bark."
The timber    was to   be   floated down the Dee, " how soon the                  water
growis."    This   was evidently       fir-timber.        Nine trees were bought
from the woodmen of Drum (1612-13) to make a sluice for one of the
town of Aberdeen's mills, for the price of £27.                     These may have
been oak.
    The presumption     seems very strong, from the present appearance
of the ground, and all circumstances, that the timber                     in all  these
transactions was not planted, but of the native growth.
    From all the evidence      we have, old historical          Scotland,  —Scotland
of the 14th to the 17th century, both             included, — in      regard to wood
was very much as at present          ;  making     allowance, however, for the
effect of cultivation   which     has curtailed       it  a  little, and plantation,
which    has immensely increased its quantity in the last century.
Speaking    generally, the      levels were cultivated,            or bare moorland
or swamp    ; the upland       pastures, whether          green or heathery, were
bare of wood,      except where the steep             and rough glens,        ravines,
and water-courses,      sheltered      and protected from cattle a fringe of
native   wood— hazel,    birch, or oak — the latter of small size.               There
are, and always have been, districts more or less willing to send up
a native growth     of timber   — as    Braemar     ;    the upper part of Strath
spey ; the upper     part of the valley of the Beauly               ; parts of Glen-
moriston, and Loch Arkeg in Lochiel.
    To remedy the     defect   of wood,     some   of our old codes of criminal
practice appointed a form of procedure              against trespassers and         de
stroyers of wood     ;  and the parliamentary             records of Scotland are
full of ordinances to encourage planting of wood, and even broom,
in minute quantities ; and for the repression of offences against it.
    Following out the intention of the Legislature, the great pro
prietors had made some efforts at planting in the 15th century.
    The Abbot of Cupar (a.d. 1473) set in lease the lands of Bal-
myle, in Strathmore, and bound the tenants to
                                                                " put al the land to
al possibil policie  in biggin      of housis, plantacioun of treis — eschit,
oiaris, and sauch, and froit-treis —gif thei ma."
   From that time downwards, there are documentary proofs of some

                                                  449
attention bestowed upon planting in Scotland                            ;    and, in a few, widely-
scattered instances, we             find places bearing                     marks of culture       and
planting that carry             us back to that century              ;      but all of these mark,
also, that the effort was confined to the planting of a few trees near
the mansion-house and the houses of the greater tenants.
    In   the next century (16th), but rather towards the end of                              it,   con
siderable progress was made                  in the creation and embellishment                       of
country houses.            William, first Earl of Gowrie, who built                      a   gallery,
and decorated     it   with pictures, was              zealous planter, and was fond of
                                                        a
the chestnut and walnut.                    In    1586, James, Lord Ogilvy,       found   is
corresponding     with Sir David Lindsay of Edzell, about their planta
tions, and writes          to    him — "     Your thousand young birkis shall                        be
richt welcom."
    At   the same                      of Glenurchy were creating
                       period the Campbells
the place of Balloch, now Taymouth, enforcing the planting of single
trees amongst their tenants, and using vigorous measures for pro
tecting wood.  Probably similar operations were carried on in that
century at Seaton, at Winton, Lethington, and other places     and                             ;
some remains of still older cultivation are to be found about the
seats of the old Church lords, as at Newbattle,                              Ancrum, Pinkie, and
a few others.
    It   seems very doubtful whether any tree planted before the                              Refor
mation     is   now growing            in    Scotland.            The       date   of the sycamore
at Kippenross         is    not well vouched             ;    and, to judge           from appear
ance, neither    it   nor those at Newbattle                  can be ranked so old as 300
years.      The chestnut at Finhaven                        was    certainly        much overrated
when said in 1760 to be 500 years old.
    Some ancient yews, especially the yew of Fortingall, come under
a   different category.           It   would appear that successive trees grow up
in the bark and round                  the stem of the decayed                     yew, and may go
on decaying and reproducing indefinitely.
   About the period of King James's accession to the English throne
(a.d. 1603) was the era of    great effort for improving and beauti
                                            a
fying our country mansions, as shown                          in
                                           the Aberdeenshire castel
lated mansion, and others of the same taste all over Scotland.                                     That
period of fine taste was marked                    by   great attention to planting, chiefly
in the manner of avenues of                      ash and sycamore, with a timid inter
mixture of chestnut             and walnut.         During "the troubles" of Charles's
reign    and the Commonwealth,                     thero was   cessation of progress
                                                                    a                                    ;

                                       450
but yet    even  in that time   we  find the Earl of Lauderdale sending to
Taymouth for fir seed,     and the Marchioness of Hamilton expressing her
own interest, and that of several of her relations, in young firs grown
from Breadalbane seed, and boasting that she had four or five hun
dred of her own planting.          " Believe me,"  says she,
                                                               "  I  think mair
of them nor ye can imagin, for          I loue them mair nor       I  dou al the
froit-treis in the wordil."      The Restoration (1660) brought a great
change.       Crowds of young men, virtually exiled during the Usur
per's reign, then returned from wandering over the Continent, where
they had learnt to admire the taste of the Italian villa and the
French chateau.         Evelyn tells us how universal         the passion for
rural embellishment        and magnificent     country  houses      was among
the English nobility, and he himself helped to extend the public
attention to restoring and planting wood.
     Scotland kept pace as much as her poverty allowed.          The   botanical
garden of Edinburgh          was   founded (1670).      Country-seats        were
 built or restored, and planting was carried on in many places where
 we    can yet find trees to be ascribed to that period —still chiefly in
 the limited style of straight avenue and hedgerow.               This was the
 date of a great enlargement — almost new modelling          —   of Taymouth,
 Hatton,     Inverary,   Drumlanrig, Hamilton, Hopetoun, Panmure,
 Kinross, Tester, Arniston, with a long et cetera.
     The Revolution (1688) may be said to have renewed the im
 pulse given by the Restoration.          Again, a crowd   of Scotch gentle
 men whom the unhappy courses of the last Stuarts had driven abroad,
 returned to their own country,         imbued with the taste of cultivation
 they had acquired in Holland and Flanders.             Among these          were
 Hume of Marchmont,         the Dalrymples, Lord Haddington, Dundas of
 Arniston, Argyll, Hyndford, &c.
     About this time a style of planting       became fashionable, breaking
  a little from the formal straight avenue, and which was known                 as
  " the wilderness."      The Earl of Mar at Alloa, his brother Lord
  Grange    at Preston,     Lord Haddington, and the First President
  Arniston, adopted this style ; and at Arniston is preserved a plan of
  " the wilderness" as it was in 1726, which can still be
                                                                       distinctly
 traced on the lawn to the west of the house, and shows how little the
 original formality impedes the picturesqueness         of the grown        wood.
 There was a wilderness also at Blair-Atholl.
     Lord Haddington remarks that planting          was  little  understood     in

                                            451
  Scotland      till the beginning of the 18th century (1700), and, of
   planting in     masses,     the remark is nearly correct.       He himself  was
   among the first who planted             on the great    scale, and with method
  and discrimination.             But a little before his time (a.d.         1680)
  Andrew Heron          was    planting at Bargally, in the stewartry of     Kirk
  cudbright, which Loudon considered              " the most interesting place in
  Scotland with respect to the introduction of foreign trees and shrubs."
  Dukes John and Archibald                 of Argyll followed, bringing their
  English experience to bear on Scotland.                 Lord Haddington and
  his wife made the noble wood of Tyningham out of a rabbit-warren.
  The Earl of Bute, Lord Loudoun, and Lord Hyndford, were planters
  in the most favourable situations of Scotland.            The Earl of Panmure
  planted    endless beech avenues at Panmure,            which    within memory
  were grand and growing trees, and proved how the East Coast may
  be made to produce fine timber.
      It  has been said by old foresters that Panmure             and Yester were
  the two places where beech              was first planted largely.     The taste
  spread rapidly.       It  was from Lord Tweeddale that the first President
 Dundas brought a present of thirty beech plants and one elm, which
 were carried in his portmanteau, on his servant's horse, to Arniston.
 The     beeches are     still standing and flourishing in the south avenue.
 They bear the marks of having been headed down in transplanting
 —a     practice of that time.
     Next came the          taste  for larch, which must have     been introduced
 in several      places    as soon    as at Dunkeld,    though    the story of the
 Duke's two flower- pot larches (a.d. 1727) may be true too.
     A few giant larches at Arniston may be as old, and one or two
in the     " Paradise,"      by the river side at Monymusk, are apparently
coeval, as they are coequal, with the finest trees at Dunkeld.
     In   the north      country     the Duchess     of Gordon     (the Mordaunt
Duchess)       was a great improver, and planted to some extent both at
Gordon Castle and in Strathspey.                 Sir William Gordon of Inver-
gordon      planted and drained extensively          ; and other improvers and
planters of that time were Ross of Balnagown, the Grants of
Monymusk, Scott of Scotstarvet, Hope of Rankeillor, Lord Cath-
cart, Sir Francis Kinloch, Sir John Dalrymple, Wauchop of Edmon-
ston, Sir James Dick of Priestfield, Sir James Stewart of Goodtrees,
the Duchess         of Buccleuch,       Sir James Cunninghame, Lord Living
ston.

                                          452
   Reid's " Scots Gardener,"            published   in 1683, shows the      taste
for wood already begun.             Sir Archibald Grant of Monymusk           has
left us a brief but interesting           account of the planting and other
improvements         begun by him in 1716.            The Earl of Haddington
published,     in 1733,      a minute    account of his planting operations.
At Arniston      are preserved original accounts and contemporary docu
ments showing the extent and manner of planting there during almost
the whole of last century, and also a narrative             detailing the results
made up from such materials, written by the Lord Chief Baron
Dundas. An anonymous writer in 1729 (believed to be Mr M'Intosh
of Borlum) mentions          a good many improvers,      enclosers, and planters,
in Scotland at that time.           Mr Walker,   Professor of Natural History
at Edinburgh, in          his "  Economical    History of the Hebrides       and
                                      " Essays,"
Highlands," and his collected                      gives the results of his  own

 1.  Additional Observations on the Chronology of the Trap-
    Rocks of Scotland.            By Archibald Geikie, Esq., F.G.S.
    In  a communication        made to the Society last session, the author
stated the results of a series of explorations               among the trap-rocks
of Scotland, and    showed      that, at successive periods, during the depo
sition   of the Lower       Silurian, Old Red Sandstone, Carboniferous,
Oolitic, and Tertiary formations, there were contemporaneous erup
tions of volcanic material.          During the year 1860, the investigation
was continued across       the Highlands into the             Inner Hebrides, and
throughout     a large part of the central counties southward                   to the
Cheviot    Hills.    The author       was now able to       fill in more fully what
had only been sketched in outline in the previous paper, and to pre
pare a series of maps to illustrate the volcanic areas                    of Scotland
during the     successive    geological      periods.     He showed that, in the
Scottish Highlands, no          distinct trace existed of any igneous rock
erupted    contemporaneously          with the deposition           of  those   Lower
Silurian strata which         are   now metamorphosed into gneiss, mica-
schist, clay-slate, &c.         The greater part of his observations during
the past year had been         devoted to the elucidation of the chronology
of the igneous rocks belonging            to the period of the       Old Red Sand

                                         454
 stone, and he found that, in central Scotland, that formation               exhi
 bited a copious series of contemporaneous felstones             and ash-beds in
 its lower and upper members         ;  the former being exemplified in For
 farshire and Perthshire, and the latter in           Fife and in the Pentland
 Hills.    Several additional facts had also been observed among the
 Carboniferous     trap-rocks, tending to make the series more complete,
 and   to show how       with volcanic movements there were associated
 certain risings and sinkings of the land, whereby the fauna and flora
 of the Carboniferous period       were     locally modified.     Reference     was
 also made to the remarkable           series of greenstone and basalt dykes
 which traverse Scotland from       N.W. to S.E., and enter the northern
 English counties.       From observations         made   at either end of the
 series, the author deduced the inference that these dykes are later
than the Lias, and probably belong to the period of the Middle or
 Upper Oolite.
 2.  Notes on Ancient Glaciers              made    during a brief Visit to
       Chamouni and its neighbourhood in September 1860.
       By David Milne- Home, Esq. of Wedderburn.
    With reference      to the   Mer de Glace, the author described the
great transported blocks on the slope of the hill above Montanvert
Inn ; the smoothed rocks about 250 to 300 feet above the glacier;
the two ancient lateral      moraines on the east side of the valley ; the
action of the ice on a perpendicular         wall of rock near foot of glacier;
the old moraine of Lisboli, which            must have formerly crossed and
blocked up the valley,        and the transported         blocks on the    hill of
Flegere, about 2700        feet above     Chamouni, and probably deposited
there by glacier, when it was at the level of the blocks above the
Montanvert.
    The hill of Chavant      was next described, situated about         six miles
west of Chamouni,       on the north side       of the valley, the south slopes
of which are beautifully        smoothed      and  scratched to the top of     the
hill, which   is   1000 feet high.        The scratches in     some   places   in
clined at an angle of 15° to 20°; their direction near foot of hill,
W.N.W.     ;  about midway       up,    N.W.    ;  and near top    N.N.W.      by
compass.
    On west    side  of valley, opposite to Chavant, at the Haineau of
Le Grange,       there are rocks of soft schist, flattened, smoothed,

                                         455
furrowed, and scratched.          In  several places there are veins of hard
quartz    standing three or four        inches above the general surface of
the smoothed         rocks, on the south side of which veins the furrows
generally      stop, as  if the  furrowing agent had        been  obstructed by
them.      A   model illustrating the phenomenon           was exhibited.     The
direction      of the furrows      and   scratches    is here due    N. and S.
The locality is 1300         feet  above Chamouni,        and 4725 feet above
the sea.
    It  was     mentioned that transported alpine         blocks occur on both
sides of the valley here, and all the way down to the Petit Saleve
mountain       (near Geneva), distant about thirty miles, the S.E. slope
of which     faces the   Arve valley.      These blocks cover the hill to its
top, which is 2800 feet above the sea.
    The author mentioned having visited the glaciers in the higher
parts of Chamouni valley, and that he had satisfied himself of the
fact that an ancient glacier           had passed     northwards   into the    Val
 Orsine.      He considered that the whole of the upper part of Cha
 mouni valley had been filled with ice, which had flowed, not down
that valley, but through the Val Orsine.               The pass into this valley
must at that time have been at least 1000 feet lower than the ob
struction     across the valley   of Chamouni     caused   by the Mer  de Glace.
    Some account was then given of the marks of ancient glaciers in
 the valley of the Rhone ; and attention was more particularly drawn
 to the enormous deposits of gravel, sand, and clay throughout                 low
 Switzerland,      and to the important      fact, that the great transported
 blocks on the      Jura, and elsewhere in low Switzerland, are generally
 imbedded in these pleistocene strata.
    It  was also mentioned that the transported            blocks are at greater
 absolute    heights near the mouth         of the valley of the Rhone than
 anywhere       else ; and that these heights,       both for the blocks and for
 the   gravel     and clay beds, diminish        gradually    towards   the west.
 The sloping line of the latter along the south bank of Lake Leman
 is a  striking object from Lausanne.
    The author expressed his conviction, from the phenomena referred
 to, that glaciers had formerly        descended    to the low country    through
 the valleys of the Arve and Rhone, bringing down and spreading in
 all quarters blocks and detritus.          The only difficulty felt was as to
 the cause of the low temperature            necessary to produce glaciers on
 so great a scale.
    vol. iv.                                                          3 P

                                        456
    He    was   inclined    to the opinion, that    at the time of this low
temperature, the whole of Switzerland            had stood   3000 feet higher
above the sea than at present ; the effect         of which would be to pro
duce    at Geneva a temperature         equal to that now prevalent at the
places   where the alpine glaciers melt.
    In support of this view, he referred        to the upheavals and depres
sions   of this part of Europe, before and after the transportation            of
the blocks.       The former is established by the dislocation and         slope
of the    beds of molasse, a deposit       which immediately      underlies the
gravels and blocks of the great glacial period.            The latter  is estab
lished by the stratification       of the glacial detritus  into regular beds,
mostly horizontal, and in very many instances enveloping transported
blocks.
    His notion of the      sequence   of events  was therefore as follows : —
    1st, Switzerland     elevated   3000 feet higher than at present;          at
which time the        molasse  beds were    fractured and thrown     into steep
slopes.    The temperature of low Switzerland would then be low          enough
to allow the glaciers to descend as far as the          Jura  ; and the whole
country would then be overspread with glacial detritus.
    2d,   A  submergence of Switzerland under the sea, to the extent of
3000 or 4000 feet lower than the existing levels, followed, when
the glacial detritus would be arranged into horizontal beds of gravel,
sand, and clay.
    3d,   A  re-elevation of the country to the present levels took place,
6ince   which event, the pleistocene strata in the valleys have             been
scoured out by the action of the rivers.

1.   On the Aqueous Origin of Granite.              By Alexander Bryson,
                                   P.R.S.S.A.
    In  this paper the author referred        to the labours of    Dr William
Smith, who published his         " Tabular View     of the British Strata" in
1790, and remarked that since that period geology had been studied
mainly in the direction of Palseontology.           Physical, chemical, and

                                          457
dynamic geology, were left almost unregarded by the great masters
of the     science,  who generally accepted          the speculations of Hutton
and the experiments of Hall, as demonstrating the igneous                 origin of
the primary rocks.
   The author       stated    that    the Huttonian theory        was   most ably
attacked,     and, in his      opinion,    overthrown     by  Dr Murray in his
"  Comparative      View of the Huttonian and Neptunian Systems of
 Geology,"     a work most      unaccountably overlooked.         Since that time
it   had suggested      itself to the sagacious mind of Davy, that the
occurrence of fluids in the cavities of crystals seemed to point to an
aqueous origin.       He    also alluded to the writings       of Brewster, Sive-
wright, and Nicol, in the same field              ;   also to Becquerel,    Fuchs,
Bischoff, and Delesse, who have taken             up the subject   of the  aqueous
origin of rocks from a chemical point of view. The author then
laid before the Society the result of ten years' experimental investi
gation into the structure of rocks relative to their formation, more
particularly granite.         While examining microscopically the various
pitchstone veins     abounding in Arran, ho was much struck with the
similarity of their structure, and the marked difference they ex
hibited when compared with sections of granite and its various
mineral constituents.           On extending his observations to obsidian,
marekanite (a volcanic glass from Lake Marekan in Kamtschatka),
and also to the well-known glassy obsidian of Bohemia, he found
they all exhibited a structure analagous            to the pitchstones  of Arran.
He further found that sections of glass              slags,  where the heat had
been    long continued, combined with slow cooling, all presented the
same appearances as the sections of pitchstone.
    This structure, peculiar to igneously formed substances, he found
usually to radiate in a stellate form ; and though many slags
showed large stars visible to the naked eye, the stellate structure is
more easily observed by the aid of the microscope.                  The character
is so marked that no one whose eye is tutored to microscopic observa
tion can fail to recognise at once a mineral substance of igneous origin.
    In granite, on the other hand, the structure, as seen by the mi
croscope, is as persistent as in pitchstone, glass, and obsidian, but
totally different.
    In   the many experiments which the author had tried with gra
nites from various        localities,   he had never succeeded       in obtaining
one   instance of stellate structure, while the constant occurrence of

                                                    458
cavities    containing             fluids    convinced him             that,    if pitchstone         and
glass are types of igneous-formed                         substances, granite              must be         of
aqueous origin.              In    the fluid cavities so abundant in topaz, Cairn-
gorum, beryl, tourmaline,                   and felspar, all constituents of granite, he
found the same               appearance prevailed.                These cavities are seldom
entirely filled with fluid, an air-bubble                         usually occupying more or
less    of the cavity.                  After many hundred                  experiments       on such
cavities, the author found that when exposed to                                  a    temperature          of
94° Fahr.,          the bubble disappeared, the fluid                          entirely     filling the
cavity, and at the temperature of 84° the bubble reappeared with a
singular ebullition, showing that the air had formed an atmosphere
round the fluid.              He        was thus led to infer that those cavities could
not have been filled at a temperature above 84°, and certainly not
above 94°       of Fahrenheit.
     As another proof that these cavities could not have                                    been filled
when the temperature of the surrounding                                rock was higher than the
temperature above                 indicated, the author drew attention to the fact,
that the bubble of air occupied always a much smaller                                        portion of
the cavity than the fluid, a condition which could not obtain,                                       if,   as
other writers hold, the fluids were enclosed under intense heat and
pressure.
     For the purpose of accurately determining                                 the temperatures at
which the bubble vanished and reappeared, the author                                        constructed
an apparatus             which      he     exhibited    and described.                It   consists of     a
microscope with           a       hollow iron stage, having             a    tube in the centre to
admit light from the reflector.                        At   one side, and inserted into the
stage,
          is
          a      small tin retort with             a   stopper    ;    at the other side, a tube
is     inserted and attached to                a    reservoir of water, from which the
hollow stage and retort are filled.                         On applying heat to              the retort,
by means of              a   spirit-lamp, any required temperature under the
boiling-point       of the water may               be obtained in the stage and retort.
     Above the stage               is   placed an iron saucer, in the centre of which
an iron tube        is    rivetted, through which the light                      is   admitted   ;    this
vessel     is   filled    with mercury, and in               it   is   placed an upright ther
mometer, with the bulb                     shielded with cork or any other good non
conductor       ;   by    this means         it   indicates the actual temperature of the
mercury bath.            The cavity to be observed                     is   cemented       with Canada
balsam to a         plate of glass 3x1 inch, and                       is   floated on the surface
of the mercury,              so    that the glass and         mercury are in absolute con

                                       459
tact.    When the temperature            is  raised    until the bubble      nearly
disappears (which       is  seen   by its contraction),       the spirit-lamp     is
withdrawn, and the vanishing point carefully watched, and the tem
perature noted.       The stopper of the retort is then withdrawn, and
the stop-cock of the reservoir of water opened, so that the tempera
ture of the stage and mercury bath is soon reduced, and the ebulli
tion or reappearance of the bubble takes place, when the tempera
ture  is again recorded.       By this method the author felt confident
that his results were correct, as they always were consistent when
observing the same cavity.         By   means    of this instrument the author
had    found    fluid cavities in the trap tuffa of Arthur's Seat, the
greenstone of the Crags, and the basalt of Samson's Ribs.                   He had
also found that the porphyry of Dun Dhu in Arran, which most
geologists assumed as of igneous origin,              was   full of fluid cavities
contained in the doubly          acuminated      crystals   of quartz    for which
this remarkable porphyry is distinguished.                He also showed doubly
 acuminated crystals of quartz in the saliferous gypsums of India,
 both of which were full of fluid cavities, and the quartz               impressed
 with the gypsum ; and as no geologist would hold that this forma
 tion was of igneous origin, but that the quartz, if not contempo
 raneous with the gypsum, must have been                  subsequent, and as the
 same phenomena were presented by the porphyry                   of Dun Dhu, he
 was forced     to the conclusion      that   it  was   as much aqueous       in its
 origin  as the saliferous gypsum        of India.       The author exhibited      a
 specimen     of quartz    which contained        a crystal   of iron pyrites,    to
 which was attached a crystal of galena and also a small massy zinc
 blende,   while over    these  three metals was laid a covering of gold.
 From     this   specimen    he   argued,    that   as   all these metals      were
 fusible at a much lower temperature than quartz, they must have
 aggregated during a gelatinous condition of the quartz ; and further,
 that  as the sulphides     of the three metals were in chemically             com
 bining proportions,       any heat which        would have fused the quartz
 would    have made an alloy or a slag in which chemical combining
 proportions    could not occur.
    He   also exhibited    specimens of schorl which he had obtained in
 the granite of Aberdeen, and drew the inference that schorl, which
 crackles   and splits     with  a   very   small    increment    of temperature,
 could   not    have   been    present during a        molten condition of the
 quartz  ;  and that it was crystallized         prior  to the solidifying   of the

                                     460
latter, as proved by the schorl impressing the quartz.           The author,
from a careful examination       of the schorls in the quartzite of Aber
deen,   was   led to believe that the quartz, while in the process of
crystallization,     expanded   one twenty-fourth    of its bulk, a      force
which appeared to him to be sufficient         to cause   all the upheavals
and disruptions      which had  led geologists to account for such    pheno
mena by a molten condition of the primary          rocks.    If  this view    is
correct, and    if  the highest peak is granite, as the lowest is known
to be granite, the author calculated that as the highest mountain is
only        part of the radius of the earth, a thickness       of the crust
of 168 miles is quite sufficient    to yield  expansive force to raise the
highest peak of the Himalayan range.            He further stated that     the
cause   of the temperature      at which the fluids were confined being
higher than the normal        one, depended on the     rise of temperature
which takes place during solidification.
    The author, in conclusion, trusted     he would soon be     in a position
to confirm these views when he had finished the investigation           of the
trap rocks with which he is now engaged.
2. Notes    of Excursions to the Higher Ranges of the Anamalai
    Hills, South India, in 1858 and 1859. By Hugh Cleghorn,
    M.D., F.L.S., Conservator of Forests, Madras Presidency.
    The southern ranges of the Anamalai (i.e., Elephant) Hills hav
ing been little explored, and only known through the manuscript
report of Captain J. Michael, 39th N.I., formerly of the Forest
Department, the author was induced to project an excursion to these
heights, in concert with       Dr D. Macpherson,     Inspector-General       of
Hospitals, and the Collector and Engineer of the Coimbatore District
(Messrs Cherry and Fraser). The arrangements were made under the
 auspices  of the Right Hon. Lord Harris, Governor of Madras, and
His Excellency Sir P. Grant, complied with the request that Major
Douglas Hamilton, 21st N.I., should accompany them as artist, to
delineate the characteristic features of the country.         (This  officer's
 sketches, seventeen     in number, some of them panoramic, were           ex
 hibited.    A   selection will appear in the Transactions).       Notwith
standing    the unfavourable state of the weather, the result was not
without interest, much additional information       having been obtained,

                                       461
which    elucidates Col. Fred. C. Cotton's narrative           of an expedition
over the Anamalai mountains                                             " Madras
                                       (northern range).         (See
Journal of Literature and Science," vol. ii. p. 80.             1857.)
   The main results of     the excursion were extracted from his            Diary,
             15th Sept. 1858.        " Teak occurred      on some
beginning                                                              undulating
knolls, two or three miles before reaching the village (Punachi), and
on the slopes of the basin leading to the river (Torakadu).              The teak
tree is not of superior dimensions, but is thickly scattered, forming
nearly half of the forest.    Many of the      trees would    yield second-class
logs, and they increased in size as we descended            the gorge.      Being
in flower, the white cross-armed panicles formed             a  striking feature
in the landscape. There       was much fallen and decaying teak             within
three miles of our huts.          I  inspected the jungle both in going
and   returning,    and walked across       in different directions       to esti
mate approximately      the number and size of the trees, and came to
the conclusion    that  the value of standing         wood    might    be  50,000
rupees, and of fallen timber         at least 5000 rupees, a sum which
could   easily be realised,    if  there   had    been  easy    transport.     We
saw, farther    up the valley, much Venge {Pterocarpus              marsupium)
and   blackwood, which became         more   abundant, as the elevation in
creased.     These trees seem to prefer an altitude somewhat greater
than   teak, whilst the Vella Naga (Conocarpus             latifolius), of great
size, occurs with the teak, or prefers a lower            range.      The sholas
(glades) near Punachi, between 3000 and              4000 feet above the sea,
are very dense and rich in their flora.             The following      are   a few
remarkable     forms observed,     a new species      of Jenkinsia (Wallich),
Solenocarpus     Indicia,   a tree called by the Kaders Palli-illi, the
leaves of which are eaten.       Elceocarpus Monoceros, a new species of
Cookia (Mur Kuringi), with a delicious fruit.                 Glycosmis penta-
phylla, Pierardia macrostachys, with an edible fruit.                     Cleidion
Javanicum (Wall) ; Mesua, with very large fruit ; Calophyllum, a
species with narrow lanceolate leaves          ;  Orophea, two new species         ;
 Unona pannosa, Guatteria coffeoides, Cyathocalyx                    zeylanicus ;
 Garcinia, Pterospermum obtusifolium, Sterculia guttata, Machilus,
Casearxa, a new species     ; Euonymus, two apparently new forms, one
with downy    leaves, and the other much like a lime tree. Agrostemma,
two species, Ophioxylon, a new species, with falcate bracts          ;  and Otho-
morphe subpeltata.        Acranthcra zeylanica, Nephelium              erectum,  a

                                        462
very gorgeous species of Pachycentria, and two rare Euphorbiaceous
trees, Dimorphocalyx        glabellus, and Desmostemon zeylanicum,           lately
described by     Mr Thwaites.
   " Many of the trees in the dark          sholas are covered    with beautiful
epiphytes, especially the Hoy a pauci/lora, JEtchynanthut zeylani-
cut, and Sarcanthus filiformis.           The dripping rocks are adorned
with Klugia (two species), Epithema, &c.                 Cardamoms       with rich
aroma, and the true ginger            plant, abound in these       sholas.     The
rocks in the bed of all the rivers, from 3000 to 4500 feet, are quite
covered with a showy orange-coloured             Balsam {Impatient verticil-
lata). It often forms a fringe at the line of watermark, or appears
in patches between the forks of a cascade.               At a higher elevation,
other species seemed to take its place, especially             the  "  Impatient
 Tangachee"     (Beddome).        A truly     aquatic   fern, a new species        of
Pleopeltis,   grows in great abundanco ou rocks at the bottom of the
Torakadu     river.
    " The Rhododendron arboreum            was   first  seen  at an elevation of
about 5000 feet."
   Mr    Beddome has favoured           me   with the following note of his
        :—
ascent      " The     rocky Akka Mountain, which is probably upwards
of 8000 feet, is quite covered near its summit with several new
species  of Impatient.         The only other new form observed             on this
mountain     was    a curious Crassulaceous plant with fleshy               peltate
leaves, growing      in sheltered moist nooks of the rock.           Balsams are
very abundant on these hills.           Impatiens Balsamina, datysperma,
Hentloviana, maculata, Campanula, chinensis, tomentosa, verticil-
lata, oppositifolia, Kleinii, filiformis, tenella, and rivalis."
    " Some of the herbaceous plants observed                     the           hill
                                                       adorning       higher
side pastures were      : — Flemingia    procumbens, Phaseolus Pulniensis,
Anemone       Wightiana,       Lysimacltia Letchenaultii and deltoidea.
 Utricularia, Ranunculut          reniformit, Gentiana pedicellata.           This
list might be extended, but the examples are sufficient              to show    the
similarity of the Flora to that round Utakamand."
    The general appearance and character of these high lands re
semble much the Nilgiri Hills.            Here are the same rounded emi
nences    and   dense     sholas, extending     continuously    for  miles,   their
edges   fringed    with    Strobilanthes,    and   ceasing abruptly    ;  the hills
are conical, and the slopes covered with short, rich grass, abounding
with such plants as Exacum bicolor, and Ophelia elegans : the woods

                                           463
  contain Hymenodyction excelsum,              and other species of the Cinchona
  family.      Heavy rains, evidently the breaking up of the south
  west monsoon, fell continuously during the period of our stay in
  these upper regions.          The want of shelter, and the difficulty of
  procuring supplies, prevented us from proceeding to the highest
  parts of the range, which appeared to be about twelve miles in a
  south-east direction from the extreme point the party reached. We
  therefore     reluctantly  returned     to the low country without       fully at
  taining our object, having been absent eight days.                 Three distinct
  tribes inhabit the Anamalai hills ; they are denominated                  Kaders,
  Paliars,    and Malsars.       The Kaders perform           no menial labour;
  as  their name implies, they are the lords of tho hills; they will carry
  a gun,   and loads also as a favour, and are expert at stalking             game,
  but are deeply offended          if they are called      coolies.    They are a
 truthful,     trustworthy,    and obliging       tribe, and   exercise some in
 fluence over the Paliars and Malsars.                Small in stature, their   fea
 tures resemble the African         ; they have curly hair tied in a knot be
 hind, and file the four front teeth of the upper jaw to a point, as a
 marriage ceremony.          The upper ranges are in undisturbed         possession
 of wild    beasts ; we saw a large herd of bison, with samber and ibex
 in numbers, and also traces of wild elephants.
     The soil      on  the summit      of   these   fine mountains is deep,     and
 covered with good         pasture.     Streams of water are        numerous, and
flow throughout         the  year.    From the extent of forest, the        resem
 blance of the Flora to that of Ceylon and the corresponding altitude,
these hills seem suitable for the cultivation of coffee on a large scale,
and for colonisation of small communities of Englishmen.

 The Very Reverend            Dean Ramsay,           one   of the Vice-Pre
       sidents, delivered the following Opening Address : —
    It  is with no affectation of humility, it is with no mock           modesty
that   I earnestly  bespeak    your kind indulgence       for the discharge      of
the duty to which      I have been called this evening.          My    diffidence
 in this matter arises from no want of interest in the work              assigned
 to me, but from knowing        how much      I lack   that extent of know
ledge and that degree of experience          which seem to be required          for
the position in which     I  am   placed, and for such an audience            as  I
have the honour to address.         I  find different   scientific associations
adopt different rules.       In some cases the secretary makes,          in  name
of the council, a general report of the whole proceedings during the
past year ; in fact, very much in the business style of the secre
tary of a railway company.         In  some cases, the address is delivered
on   the anniversary     of the society by the president, who               makes
a distribution    of its medals and prizes previous to his vacating             his
office.
    The Royal Society of Edinburgh has only of late years adopted
the practice of an address from the chair on the first meeting of
the Session,     with notices of the       deceased   members      during      the
year; the medals and prizes being distributed usually towards the end
of the Session. The address on the first meeting of last Session was
delivered by our recently elected President, the Duke of Argyll;              and
it  was    well observed on that occasion,        I think   by Lord Neaves.
that the address      itself  was  the best proof of the Society having
chosen their President well and wisely.
    As to the statistics of the Society,        I  may mention       that eight
members have died during the past year           :—

     Inglancing backwards on the proceedings of the last year,
it is quite manifest that there has been no falling off in zeal
 and diligence         amongst its members.                      Besides other                business     in
connection with the objects for which the Society was embodied,
thirty-three papers           were read at the ordinary meetings.                             Seven were
on subjects connected           with Geology          ;    nine with Natural History or
Physics    ;   seven    with Chemistry        and Chemical Analyses                           ;    four with
Magnetism or          Electricity ; the rest were of a miscellaneous or
biographical       character.    Without noting particular papers, it is
quite     enough     to say      of   these   communications                     that they are the
result of deep study and careful experiment                           ;       that they are fully in
accordance with the high and advanced state of the several sciences
to which       each of them belongs.                The only regret                   I   have (a regret
which     I cannot     help expressing)         is,       that   we       have not more papers
of   a literary character.            Such papers would be quite in accordance
with the original purpose and object of the Society.                                          They would
make a pleasing variety,         I     believe we might almost say a relaxation
of attention towards the subjects with which our evenings are                                           gene
rally occupied, and (perhaps this              my chief recommendation) they
                                               is
would call forth contributions            from some of our members who have
not given themselves to the study of physical sciences, but whose
present inaction, session after session, we cannot but deplore. We
regret to think that we have             not occasionally papers on such ques
tions as Moral       Philosophy,       Political Economy, History, Classics, or
Belles-Lettres,        from   Fellows of the Society, who, we are sure, could

                                           470
 execute them so ably and so gracefully.                        The productions           of   the
 last Session, and the attendance at the evening meetings, indicate,
then, a continued activity and interest in the cause of science.                               And
 we notice this fact as supplying          the answer to an objection which                     we
have heard raised against the Royal Society of Edinburgh, and against
other j&ssociations of the        same character, viz., that                     their day     had
gone by; that they were well suited to a period                             when there         was
little or no scientific current           literature, but that their place                     has
been superseded        by periodicals    — that      is,   by scientific magazines and
journals, to which men of              science     will now prefer sending their
papers, rather than to the less popular and less known Transactions
of societies.      Experience     has proved the objection altogether                      falla
cious.    Societies have done          for science         and literature           what could
have been accomplished in           no    other     way.         There      is   the advantage
of personal intercourse at their meetings, whether ordinary or ex
traordinary, — of funds for prizes, — of libraries, and of the general
prestige of men of high place and high reputation being associated
in bodies under sanction of Royal patronage.   The Transactions of
home and foreign societies would themselves form                        a   scientific library
of considerable extent.         The library of the Royal Society of London
now exceeds 40,000 volumes, chiefly                  on        scientific   subjects, and       in
mathematical works        is   surpassingly       rich.         At    no    time    were     such
associations, either in this country or the continent of Europe, more
active and more efficient.         No doubt this very activity and efficiency
have produced      a   change, which, to a certain extent, must affect the
old scientific institutions.       The change             to    which I     refer   is   due not
only to the great increase of the number of such institutions, but to
the great subdivision of the labour in scientific inquiries.     The
Royal Society of London was founded in 1663.   Its general object
was the promotion of Science and Literature. The vast number                                    of
illustrious    names connected with that great                   Society, and the extent
of research manifested in its Transactions,   amounting to 200
volumes, are well known to all whom      address.  Other similar
                                                    I
institutions    were formed       in     London       in subsequent years.                  The
Royal Society of Edinburgh followed, and many provincial associa
tions throughout England.     Of these the Literary and Philosophical
Society of Manchester, instituted 1781, has been long distinguished.
Dr Percival        of its early supporters.
                was one                     His papers,                             and com
munications from Mr Dalton, Dr Henry, and others, have                              ever be?n

had in high                esteem.    At Liverpool, Bristol, York,              Bath,    Leeds,
Exeter, and other places, large sums of money have been expended
in buildings for the meetings, museums, libraries, lecture-rooms of
similar        societies,     and were called forth to meet the growing taste for
scientific study, and the vast                   increase of persons in all professions
and ranks of life who delighted in natural history, physical science,
and the study of history, of literature,                       and philosophy.          We now
find the operations of our learned societies becoming                       associated        with
our social system itself.
  The history of the Royal Society of London becomes an important
work, and     in fact, history of science itself during the period
                     is,             a
when the Society was in action.*
     In    reference to the history of scientific                   institutions,       we     can
scarcely         omit to notice the endeavours that                  have been          made     to
draw the members closer together in social as well as scientific rela
tions   — such         as dinners, holding           conversazione meetings, and other
friendly unions.               1   hope   it   will not   be considered unbecoming in this
address to mark how completely the scientific association    adapting              is
itself to the social system, and becoming part and parcel of common
life.     It    is   from this circumstance,        I     apprehend, that   a   certain part of
the history of the Royal Society of London has lately excited so much
attention.            An account of         it   has been printed for private circulation
by Admiral Smyth, to whom the necessary documents connected
with  were intrusted.
          it           mean its Dining Club.
                                      I       The annals of
its proceedings commence in 1743                      ;   but Admiral Smyth, and others,
zealous in all branches of archaeology, are persuaded                            that the club
dates much further back.                       The club was at first called the         " Royal
Philosophers;"  and although the archives of the Royal Society are
unfortunately deficient on many points of its proceedings, they are
very minute in their account of the dinners of the Royal Philosophers.
Thus       we have the satisfaction               of knowing    the precise dinner to which
the Royal Philosophers                    sat down, 27th October 1743       — a dinner, let
it   be remembered, eaten at one o'clock, and a pretty solid one                          :  —
               Turkey boiled and oysters.                    Two dishes of herring.
               Calves head hashed.                           Tongue arid udder.
               Fowls and bacon.                              Leg of pork and peas.
               Chine of mutton.                              Sirloin of beef.
               Apple-pie.                                    Pluin-pudding.

      The dining club     is now generally      adapted as a concomitant of the
   learned association, and with very pleasant results.             But the Royal
   Society of London     were so desirous to consider their dinners part and
   parcel of the Society itself, that it was one of their early rules to
   fine any member a guinea who called it a club.
      The Astronomical       Society have long had a dining club in con
  junction with    their scientific meetings.          From what connection or
  analogy with sidereal investigation        I do   not know, but one invariable
  dish at the astronomical dinners is black pudding.
      The dining club of the Royal Society of London has evidently,
  then, been considered a very important appendage ; indeed, Admiral
  Smyth remarks :
                        " The hospitality of the Royal Society Club has
  been    of material     utility to the well-working of the machine."
  " This   is proved,"   he goes on to state, " by the number of men of
  note, both   in ability and station, who have there congregated pre
  viously to repairing to the evening meeting of the body at large ;
  and many a qualified person, who went thither a guest, has returned
 a candidate."       It  has   been    a sound policy, therefore, as Admiral
  Smyth conceives,     which    so  early in the history of the Royal Society
 dictated the formation of a dining club in connection with the more
 scientific portion of the body.        It introduced a bond of unity of a dif
 ferent character     from the scientific bond.           Dr Johnson and     other
 learned men      have   attached great importance to their dinner, and
 were not in humour          for pursuing      literary thoughts where it was
wanting or where it was bad.             When the discussions were going on
about the propriety of having a cook attached to the French Insti
tute, an eminent Paris judge told            La Place,    as a reason for having
a cook, that     he considered the discovery           of a new dish far     more
important     than the discovery of a new planet, and added this reason
for the opinion     :  We     have already quite enough of planets, but we
 can never have too many good dishes.
     It soon became evident, as years rolled on, that a greater subdivision
of scientific labour must follow       upon the older societies, formed as they
were for general scientific purposes. Enthusiastic cultivators of par
ticular branches of science wanted something more exclusive. The
first actual movement in this direction             was, I  believe, the Linnean
Society, founded in 1788           for promoting the study of zoology         and
botany, as these sciences had been organised and advanced by the              im
mortal naturalist whose name gave            the character to the association.

                                            473
 This society had         a further     division in     its Botanical     Section pro
 moted by such men             as Brown, Lindley, and Hooker,             whose     object
 was to pursue, unfettered by the artificial classification of Linnaeus,
 the natural system of'Jussieu as a more philosophical                      system, and
 already vigorously pursued on the continent by the elder Decandolle
 and other great botanists. Societies formed for promoting special ob
jects in science and natural history sprung up in every quarter. Thus,
 we have the Antiquarian Society, the Royal Astronomical Society,
the Geographical         Society, Geological Society, Entomological              Society,
the Horticultural Society, the Meteorological                 Society  ;  and to show
the extended character            of  these   subdivisions,      I  may mention the
Royal United Service Institution, exclusively                   devoted    to questions
connected      with    warfare,     whether     by sea or land.          Few persons
unconnected with the naval and military professions are aware of its
precise object and character, or of the extent of its operations.                       It
is termed     the   "Royal United Service Institution,"               because    it has a
Royal charter.         It    is in regard to machinery very much like our
own.*     It    has   vice-presidents,      a  library, museum, meetings, and
proceedings     ;  papers are read, and transactions               published, and the
subjects of those        papers are all strictly bearing upon military and
naval service.        To    show the character       of the topics   chosen for these
papers,   I will     read over a few of those already published                 in their
Transactions,      many of which,       I have been       told, are exceedingly able,
and admirably         illustrated     by models, maps, and drawings.                  For
instance, the whole of the number for August is occupied                          with a
dissertation      on Iron-Cased      Ships, by Captain Halsted,           R.N.      June
number     contains a paper on Photography                   and its Application to
Military purposes; another             on the     Military Forces of the Nations
of Europe    ;   one upon Swiss Targets           and Rifle Ranges.          Thero    is a
paper in a late number on National Defence, called the Rifle and the
Rampart    ;   one upon the Sanitary Condition              of the Army ; one upon
Recreations for Soldiers and Sailors            ; one  upon Rifled Ordnance, &c. ;
all connected with warlike affairs.             Then there are models of ships,
forts, arms, battles      ;   and there is a collection        of relics or trophies,
naval and military.            For example,      as to naval relics, there are the
sword worn by Nelson when he took the                     "  San Josef," the chrono
meter used by Cook in his voyages of discovery, the signal                       book of
                                * The Crown its Patron.

                                                  474
the " Chesapeake," and many others.                            As   to   military relics, they                have
the swords of Cromwell                 and   of Wolfe, the            sash with which                  Sir John
Moore      was lowered into his grave, Napoleon and
                                               Tippoo Saib's rifles,
relics of Waterloo, Inkermann, Sebastopol, and others.  The Duke
of Wellington took much interest in this institution in all its de
partments, and entered most   kindly into the wishes of the Council
regarding digging up and placing the skeleton of his favourite horse,
which he rode at Waterloo, into the museum, as already they had the
skeleton         of the Arab         rode    by Napoleon             at Waterloo.                 The       design
never was accomplished, but the museum of relics called forth                                                        a
quiet jocular remark                 from     the great          commander                 to    Sir Charles
Napier       ;   and as the jokes of the Duke of Wellington are rare,                                                I
may mention it in passing.                       It    is the more amusing,                          as    Napier
used    to       tell    the story himself.            Whilst the negotiation about                            the
skeleton of the Duke's                   horse was going                 on,     Charles Napier, the
naval officer of the name, had been                            dining at Walmer Castle                        with
the Duke, as his ship lay in the roads.                             On going away, Napier                      was
putting          on     his cocked    hat, as he was in uniform.                          Charles Napier,
it   is well known, was not very nice as to his                                wardrobe          ;    and so,   as
they had been talking about the museum, the Duke, after eyeing the
cocked hat, suggested,                " Napier,        you      should put your                      cocked    hat
into the museum              — just the      place     for it."
     The immense increase of scientific associations for the furtherance
and pursuit of separate branches of human knowledge is no more
than what might have                   been      expected, and                 is,   in fact, the natural
supply of that vastly increased                  and increasing demand for knowledge
in all departments of study, especially in those which relate to                                                in
quiries connected with the physical sciences.                                 Nor     does      this      increase
at all act injuriously upon the older societies, or deteriorate from
the usefulness or importance                     of their           office.          It   rather calls         out
their exertions, and             places them          in   a   more important                   position.       It
was utterly impossible that they should                         of themselves              meet the whole
growing demand except by                     a   subdivision           of their own body,                   which
would not certainly have been so efficacious an arrangement                                                 as the
formation             of new   bodies.       These children,             if    we may so call them,
of the parent societies,               instead of being rivals and opponents,                                  are
I    apprehend, their best aids and coadjutors.                               The younger              branches
take, as we             might say, the heavy work of departments, whilst                                       the
older      institutions        take      that general           charge          which extends itself

                                             475
to the whole field of human knowledge.                       No subjects      are excluded
from    the parent        society, but none should have               a  monopoly there.
Whatever other           societies    do   they are ready to do          ;   and in their
Proceedings a full and free admission should be given to those sub
jects which cannot so properly                 find a place elsewhere.             I cannot
help thinking that this great multiplication                    of   associations    for the
exclusive      advancement          of  so many       distinct    branches       of natural
science, should lead the older and parent societies to extend as much
 as possible the basis         of their own operations.         The student       who finds
 only his own pet study advanced by the association which bears its
name, naturally         looks for a greater variety of subjects in the Royal
 Society, to which the name of no particular science is attached.                       The
course now pointed out to us is to take the widest range of questions
connected with the pursuit of truth               ; and    this  seems to me a strong
 argument for a more frequent introduction                    of literary papers.        Bo
 tanical   or entomological          societies    draw round        them only botanists
 and entomologists         :   The Royal Society should draw round it men
 of all pursuits.          The continued absence of literary papers natu
rally excludes the full sympathy and cordial co-operation of                           those
 who are keenly interested in literature,                but who do not take interest
 in minute details         on scientific questions, whether of natural history
 or natural philosophy.             My argument, then, in            one    word is this     :
That     as ordinary       scientific    societies   attract only those who pursue
the studies to which they are specially dedicated,                    so   the   Royal So
 ciety is intended to attract and interest              all classes of men of research
 and intelligence.           Iam     aware that      I   require    apology for making
these remarks       ;   but    I offer them not only under a deep feeling of
 their importance, but from            an assurance that persons whose valuable
 aid and countenance we would be proud of are kept away, because
 the Society's     papers and discussions are so seldom upon questions
 other than those connected            with physical inquiries.
    After    these    remarks       upon the labours of the Society past and
 future,   I  would      say a few words on            those of our body who have
departed this life since we met within                  this hall last December.            I
think the practice            adopted    of late years by the Royal Society of
Edinburgh, and which               has   been    pursued by other kindred associa
 tions, — I mean       the practice of introducing, at the opening meeting of
every Session, a short biographical reference to the deceased members
of the past year, — is a most becoming and appropriate arrangement.

 Whilst,   on the one hand,      it enables   the chairman      to offer a suitable
 testimony to many a distinguished          example of zeal for literature        and
 science, and of well-directed      labour in their cause,      and whilst     he is
 thus enabled to enlarge upon ingenious discoveries and useful inven
 tions, at the same     time it indicates a very becoming feeling of in
 terest in the Society        towards    its individual    members       as fellow-
 citizens, and as companions embarked in a common cause, and                     is  a
 graceful recognition of them in their private character, showing the
 friendly bond by which we are united,            as associates     of an   ancient
 and distinguished literary and scientific institute.           Sir R. Murchison
 seems to have had this feeling strong in his mind             during his address
 to the Geographical      Society in 1859.        In  taking leave of the chair
 he says,   " With truth,     I  take leave of my dear friends as the really
good fellows of the Royal Geographical               Society;" and surely the
Royal Society of Edinburgh has just cause to be proud of many
names who now bear, and who have in times past borne, the title of
Fellows.       The present roll of the members embraces many                persons
distinguished     not only at home, but amongst the philosophers of
Europe.      In  the list of past members are recorded names imperish
able in the annals of history,     — names     associated with the highest pro
ductions of the human mind.           This  we may    fairly say, when amongst
our departed members we find such                names as Hume, Robertson,
Black, Adam Smith, Sir Humphry Davy, Sir Walter Scott.                        Now,
in looking back upon the changes which the past year has made in
our list of members, we find that those whom we have lost were all
 men of a certain degree        of weight and influence in their position in
society  ;  all were men much respected           by their    cotemporaries,    and
men whose death called forth many sincere expressions of sympathy
and regret.      It is somewhat remarkable that none            of these members
belonged, properly speaking, to the scientific department of the So
ciety.     No one had adopted the pursuit of pure mathematics, or their
application to the laws of nature.           None were geologists, chemists,
or naturalists, beyond that general acquaintance and intelligence
possessed     now by most men of education.            Our     deceased members
were well known, however, in connection with the business                  of their
day.     We have to mark a past career which                is associated    with a
high place, indeed the highest place, in the government of the country.
We see the vacant places of men who were no ordinary proficients
in the discharge       of life's duties, and the more particular duties to

                                       477
  which    they were called, whether     it were     as ministers     of state,    as
 judges,    as  professors in the university, as landed proprietors,               as
  theologians, or lawyers.      The following    is the    list of departed Fel
  lows of the Society   :—
  Right Hon. the Earl of Aber               Professor J. Shank More, Edin
     deen, K.G. & K.T.                         burgh.

  John    Gordon, Esq.,   Cairnbulg,           Edinburgh.*
     Aberdeenshire.
     Of the late members on our obituary list, the first           is the name'of
 a statesman, a man of the world, a scholar, an antiquary.                 George
  Hamilton     Gordon,   K.G.   and K.T.,   fourth     Earl of Aberdeen, was
  born   in 1784, and died December 14th, 1860, at the ripe age of
 seventy-six.      Although   far from what would            be called   a man of
 brilliant talents, or of great powers of oratory, still, during this long
 life, few men were more distinguished as filling with much ability
 high and responsible      positions, few were more respected for private
 worth, and few more generally known           for scholar-like      attainments.
 Lord Aberdeen       was educated at   Harrow, where         he laid the founda
 tion of a classical taste and acquirement          such as    I am disposed      to
 think nothing can so effectually accomplish as an English public
 school.     He went to St John's College, Cambridge, and graduated
 there in 1804.       But previous to this he had been attached to              the
 embassy     at Paris, and had gone with Lord Cornwallis, who                  was
 there as our ambassador to negotiate the Peace of Amiens in 1801.
He formed intimacies with many leading            men     of the day, and    com
 menced    that knowledge of continental        politics   for which he after
 wards became so celebrated, and from which he was enabled                 so long
 to administer     with much skill and ability the Foreign Department
 of the British Government.
     He did not remain long in Paris in 1801, but                 before   return
 ing to England travelled in Greece, where he brought his classical
attainments      to bear upon    his study of the beautiful         architectural
remains and interesting localities of the country.              This sojourn in
Greece     (when access    to foreign    parts was       less  open to British
travellers than it is      at  present)   procured for Lord Aberdeen            the

    The public official career of Lord Aberdeen; his frequent occu
pation of high place in the administration of his country's affairs                          ;
his close intimacy with the most distinguished                   foreign public       char
acters   of his time, especially his friendship with Guizot and Priuce
Metternich ; his modification of opinion on many points of national
policy, and of the high Tory principles with which he commenced life,
which ultimately           led   to his heading     a coalition     ministry composed
of politicians of all          shades   of opinion    ;  his correspondence with Dr
Chalmers        on Scottish        ecclesiastical matters, and his endeavours              to
prevent that which was not prevented taking place, viz. the disrup
tion in the Scottish Established Church ; his constant and unde-
viating advocacy of the policy of non-interference                   on the part of the
British Government in continental relations,                 and his aversionjto enter
ing    into war with Russia, and the temporary unpopularity                           which
from that cause he incurred with his own countrymen                     ; —these     are all
now matters of history, and belong to history, and we leave them                           to
the historian.^           As   a late Fellow^of the     Royal Society of Edinburgh,
 we look more to the man and the scholar than to the                      politician.     To
whatever part of Lord Aberdeen's career we direct our attention                           we
 find everything         that claims our respect and approval.               As a    landed
proprietor his whole career was marked by energy, by skill, and great
 liberality.       I    am    assured that on no property             in Scotland       were
 greater changes manifest under the direction of the proprietor than
 on his   ; and       all changes were improvements.                Old persons, I am
 assured,    in the     neighbourhood of Haddo House, speak of once barren
 moors becoming              cultivated   farms  — once sterile tracts of          country
 becoming clothed with               beautiful   and valuable       timber.      A    friend
 who was on a visit to him shortly before                  his death, exclaimed, after
    * In  1813 he returned to the Continent, and was our ambassador             to the Aus
 trian Court   ; there he was     long engaged in cementing the alliance formed against
 the power    of Napoleon. He was present at many great battles. — Lutzen, Dres-
 den,  Leipsic — lloreau died in his tent at Dresden ; and it was his impressions
 received from these dreadful battles that gave Lord Aberdeen that great horror
 he entertained for war through life.
    t A kind friend informs me that the best account of Lord Aberdeen's               public
life is a memoir by Comte do Jaumuis, in the "Kevue de deux Mondes."                   But I
 have not had time or opportunity          for consulting it.

                                         479
Lord Aberdeen         had   been    pointing   out to him the success         of his
plantations     in   magnificent       and   extensive    woods,     " You     don't
 mean that you        planted all these yourself ?"         "Yes,"     replied the
 peer  ;
          " and perhaps you will believe what           I  have before told you,
 that my line was not politics," but farming.                 In this light of a
 Scottish proprietor, we must ever consider him as a patriotic and
judicious benefactor of his country.             Lord Aberdeen      was for many
 years the efficient President of the Antiquarian            Society of London,
 and no one was more fitted for such an honour.                He   was    an accu
 rate scholar, and a patient investigator into the remains of antiquity.
 It  is curious to observe      how Lord Aberdeen        preserved, through all
 the circumstances        and stirring incidents      of  an   unusually exciting
 period of public affairs, the love of classical literature which he had
 imbibed at Harrow, at Cambridge, and at Athens.                   His mind had
 been early imbued with a fine taste for the best writers                 of Greece
 and Rome,       and   the  effects were visible    to the last.     It  is often,   I
 believe, thus a taste for life —
                  "
                    Quo semel est inibuta, recens servabit odorem
                    Testa diu."
 We    have specimens      of his accurate scholarship       and ingenious     criti
 cisms in his contributions to Walpole's          " Memoirs     on  Turkey," and
 in his work     on the   " Beauty of Grecian Architecture."
     In   1817 a book was published entitled "Memoirs Relating to Eu
 ropean and      Asiatic Turkey, Edited from MS. Journals, by Robert
 Walpole." It consisted of such extracts from the journals and port
 folios of intelligent and learned travellers, who had of late years
 visited that interesting       portion   of the globe, as were       calculated to
 throw     light upon its present condition          and   ancient grandeur,       its
 geography,      antiquities,    and  natural   history, recorded, too, in their
 own     language.      It  is a very valuable       and   interesting    collection.
  Amongst these papers are some very learned dissertations by Lord
  Aberdeen; one of these is upon the gold and silver coinage of Athens.
 A curious question had been agitated by scholars on the subject of
 Attic coinage, and many learned            men have held that the Athenians
  never coined gold money at all.           There was no doubt gold money,
  but it seems to have been in coins of other countries.                   Gold coin
 seems     to have been      the stater of Persia      or Egina, or the ancient
  bagaxog, so called from Darius.          Aristophanes speaks of gold coin
             in his mocking       way calls the pieces              xa>.x/a,   which

 is not, as Corsini thinks,           copper morey, but base gold money, — i.e.,
 gold alloyed with copper.              Now, Lord Aberdeen            discusses   the ques
 tion with much learning             and ingenuity      ; and     I  will give his   conclu
 sion in his own words, as a specimen                   of his critical style,       because
 scholars are agreed that he settles the question by a more                        satisfac
 tory explanation of the difficulty than had been given by others.

 versal, owing to the deservedly              high reputation        for purity which it
 possessed   ;   and on this account we find several cities                of Crete     copy
 ing precisely in their coins the design, weight, and execution of the
 Attic tetradrachm, in order to facilitate their intercourse with the
 barbarians.          It  is possible   that the general use and estimation                  of
 the produce        of the Attic mines contributed            to render the Athenians
 averse   from a coinage            of another     metal, which, by supplying the
 place of silver money at home, might                 in some degree tend to           lessen
 its reputation abroad."
    " The Attic         silver was of acknowledged purity, and circulated very
extensively      ;   the   Athenian merchants, particularly in their commer
cial dealings with the more distant and barbarous                         nations, appear
 frequently     to     have    made    their payments        in it.     The barbarians,
being once         impressed with these notions of its purity, the Govern
ment of Athens, in all probability,               was afraid        materially   to change
that styled appearance by which their money was known and valued
among these            people.     A similar    proceeding       in the state of Venice
throws the strongest light on the practice of the Athenians.                             The
 Venetian     sechin is perhaps the most unseemly of the coins of modern
 Europe.       It    has long been the current gold            of the Turkish       empire,
in which its purity is universally              and   justly esteemed; any change
in its appearance on the part of the Venetian Government would have
tended to create distrust."
    Lord Aberdeen in this volume gives an account also of two                           curi
ous sculpture marbles found at Amyclse in Lacaonia.                         Each of    these
two marbles represents a hand-basin surrounded with various imple
ments of a female toilet — such               as combs, pins, a bodkin, perfume-
boxes, bottles, mirrors,           curling-irons, toothpicks, and reticules,          or, as
some learned men             believe, nightcaps.       On one of these stones          is an
inscription containing the words,             Av^cuffjj i«roffrarg/a,-    on the other an
inscription     containing        the words,     Xao-xy^rix.    and   itgua,.   These     by
some are supposed             to signify two    priestesses — Anthusa          and   Laoa

                                            481
geta being supposed the names of priestesses by whom the stones
were dedicated.*         Others, again, consider crurgta. to be nothing
more than a hairdresser, and             u icgrurgia, an under-hairdresser           — the
same   as an s^o-Xsxrs/a,      or a tirewoman        ;  and the stones,         therefore,
to be a sort of advertisement              of their profession        by Anthusa and
Laoageta.    Lord Aberdeen follows out              these nice and        critical inqui
ries with much learning and much patience, and with similar                           clear
and convincing effects as in the case of the Attic tetradrachms.
   The treatise of Lord Aberdeen, of which the title                   is " An Inquiry
into the Principles of Beauty in Grecian Architecture," was originally
contributed    as a preface to        Mr Wilkins'         translation      of Vitruvius.
It  was published      afterwards       in a separate form by the author, and
has lately been      brought      out    by  Mr   Weale,      the  architectural      pub
lisher, at the moderate price of            one  shilling.     If we   knew nothing of
Lord Aberdeen's scholarship except by this treatise,                    we should have
abundant proof of its accuracy, its elegance, and its extent.                          The
essay shows a masterly hand in treating the subject.                      Nearly all the
celebrated buildings      of ancient Greece are brought before the reader,
and their characteristic          features      are discriminated         with   a  skilful
touch.    The whole question of the origin of architectural forms is
discussed in reference to the inquiry into the principles of beauty in
Greek architecture, although             I  cannot help thinking that he loses
sight of that point at times.              Lord Aberdeen disputes, and indeed
refutes, the theory of Burke            on the sublime and beautiful,            and sup
ports himself the theory of beauty as grounded on association — the
theory of   Mr Alison,      as developed        in his Essay on Taste, and as ad
mirably supported        and    illustrated      by Francis Jeffrey in his cele
brated critique on      Mr Alison        in the "Edinburgh Review."                I would
speak with     much diffidence on such a question, but                    I  cannot help
thinking there     is very   little satisfaction in        these theories of beauty,
and inquiries    into the principles of beauty.                 The  idea    of beauty is
too refined and too delicate to admit of such analyses and dissections.
The application      of female dialectics to beauty, vulgarly called a wo
man's reason, is after all more satisfactory than analysis and theory.
It  is beautiful,    because      it  is   beautiful;    so we say      of  the orders   of
Greek architecture.         There is a severe and simple grandeur in the
Doric, with its firm-set columns, its massive triglyphs, and deep
entablature  ;  there is a grace in the             Ionic, with its more slender
               * As   the xcrunrpxi, or ornamenters        of  some deity.

                                         482
shaft and beautiful volute        ;  there is an elegance combined with rich
luxuriance in the Corinthian, with its acanths capital,                — which      baffle
all theory, which      speak    to the eye without           any explanation        being
needed on the grounds why they should be admired.                     These remarks,
however, affect not the great merit of the treatise                I  speak of.      Lord
Aberdeen's      work   on    Grecian    architecture       is a work which no one
should be ignorant of who desires to               see   the   subject handled with
scholarship, taste, and discernment.
    It is always interesting        to know something          of   the    personal    ap
pearance, the ordinary address             and manners, of the distinguished
dead.    Lord Aberdeen, though           a man of high        birth, of public     status,
of elegant and refined         tastes,   was to a great degree            plain and un
pretending     in manner.        He had, perhaps,         a good    deal of that cold
and reserved      demeanour which          obtains     for the British         character,
especially for those       in high     positions,    the name of an exclusive,
haughty treatment         of others.      It  is often, as in the case of Lord
Aberdeen, a most fallacious mark               of the real feeling and the true
kindness of the heart within.             I  might have spoken on this point
in some measure from my own observation, as                     I had the honour of
personally    knowing      Lord Aberdeen.            But     I   prefer    offering    the
picture of Lord Aberdeen's personal appearance and manner as they
were observed      from a different and most impartial               point of view, —
I  mean as they struck the mind of a stranger, and that                       stranger    a
visitor from the United States.             In   the year 1835          a  literary   gen
tleman,   Mr N. P. Willis,        from America, visited this country for the
express purpose of writing a tour, which was published in due time
                        "
under the title of         Poncillings by the Way." He had been in
troduced to the Earl of Dalhousie,              father of the late distinguished
Marquis of Dalhousie,        and was received         at Dalhousie        Castle, where
I   met him,    — and     an acute, unscrupulous           observer he was.          Lord
Dalhousie introduced him to the late Duke of Gordon, and at Gor
don Castle he was introduced to the late Lord Aberdeen,                         of whom
he thus writes     : —
    " Lord   Aberdeen has the name of being the proudest and coldest
 aristocrat  of England.         It  is amusing      to see the person who bears
such a character.
    "He   is of the middle height, rather        clumsily made, with          an address
 more of sober       dignity    than of pride or reserve.               With     a black
coat much worn, and always too large for him,'— a pair of coarfo

                                         483
check trousers, very      ill made,  —a   waistcoat buttoned up to his throat,
and a cravat of the most primitive negligS.                  His aristocracy is
certainly    not in his dress.      His manners are of absolute simplicity,
amounting almost to want of style.             He crosses his hands behind
him and balances on his heels ; in conversation, his voice is low and
cold, and he seldom         smiles.    Yet there is     a certain      benignity in
his countenance,        and an indefinable      superiority     and high breed
ing in his simple address, that would betray his rank after a few
minutes' conversation to any shrewd observer.                 It is only in his
manner toward the ladies of the party that he would                     be immedi
ately distinguishable      from men of lower rank."         (N. P. Willis' Pen
cilling   by the   Way.)
    Here we find an American tourist brought into contact with the
British nobleman, surprised at not finding a man exhibiting all the
artificial graces which he had supposed were shadowed forth for
all men of rank in England by Chesterfield's Letters ; and yet the
republican     has acutness   enough to discern, under the cold and simple
demeanour of the peer, the high estimable qualities of head and
heart    by which his character        was  impressed.      He    feels how much
lies  beneath, and he is impressed with               respect    and     admiration.
He    was   right in the estimate       he formed     of him   ;   and further ac
quaintance      would only have       deepened   the impression         of his high
qualities.     From    one who had the first      opportunities       of judging,   I
have this testimony, that "         he considered    him the best man he ever
knew.      That    he really believed he     was   incapable of even compre
hending anything mean or ignoble."              Such, then, was Lord Aber
deen   in his various relations and features of character.               He   was no
ordinary     man, — consider     him as a statesman or scholar, a man of
property,     or in his more private relations of life.       It   is a great bless
ing when men who are called upon to take so prominent a place
in public affairs are really good men.                  The Royal Society of
Edinburgh, of which he          was a    member     for years, his family,        his
country, respect the memory of the late           Earl of Aberdeen.
   Mr Robert Bell,        was son     of Benjamin Bell, the celebrated sur
geon.     He    was  born in 1782, was educated          at the    High School of
Edinburgh, and was called          to the bar in 1809.       He must       soon have
gained some reputation as a lawyer, as he appears in an early cari
cature of Kay as one of those advocates who pleaded in a wig.

From this period he gradually attained considerable practice.                  He
was made Procurator for the Church of Scotland, and Sheriff of
Berwickshire     in 1842.      Mr Bell    had, besides his legal acquirements,
a highly    cultivated     mind.     He   was fond   of mathematical reason
ing as   a  recreation, and did not further apply it.           In art   he had
excellent taste     ;  and indeed was considered by picture-dealers      to have
great knowledge of the old Masters, and much tact to discriminate
their styles.       He made, from his     own judgment, a collection    of Rem
brandt etchings, considered one of the most complete in the king
dom.     Mr Bell       was a member     of the Bannatyne Club, and not          an
inactive member.         He  was a great reader, and deeply conversant espe
cially with works on philology.         Those who knew him well bear high
testimony to his varied powers of conversation, and his skill in discuss
ing and elucidating subjects that were brought forward in society.
    A  certain George Campbell having injured his property by adhe
rence   to his chief, the first Marquis of Argyle, during the trying
times of the Covenant in 1662, left the Highlands, and became the
proprietor of the estate of Baltulla in the neighbourhood             of St An
drews.     The great-grandson of that George Campbell             was the Rev.
Dr George Campbell, for fifty-four years the minister of Cupar- Fife.
In 1776, Dr Campbell married Miss Hallyburton, who was con
nected with some Scottish families          of rank, of whom one     was  Wed-
derburn,    Lord Chancellor.         The fruit of this marriage was five
daughters and two sons.         Of the sons, the elder was Sir G. Campbell
of Edenwood       ;   the second was    John Campbell, born at Springfield,
near Cupar,       September 15, 1781, afterwards destined to rise by
his own talents and industry to become a peer of the realm, Chief-
Justice of the Queen's Bench, and Lord Chancellor of England.
Lord Campbell was always proud of his connection with the Argyle
family   and with Scotland       .He showed this by his kindly and     interest
ed allusions to the Campbell         clan, which very frequently show them
selves  in his " Lives of the Chancellors ;" and when Lord           Chancellor
himself    he marked       his feelings   as a Scotchman     by thanking most
warmly the author of an idle book,         called " Reminiscences of    Scottish
Life and Character,"        when the writer was presented to him, for         the
great pleasure he had derived from these old stories of a                bygone
Scottish race.        He  showed also more decidedly his love for Scotland
by purchasing       Scottish property, and living in Scotland       as much    as

                                       485
tie was able.    I have observed     that in all his publications he is very
particular in having F.R.S.E. appended to his name as author.
    Lord Campbell was educated at St Andrews, where he was a co-
temporary of Thomas Chalmers and of David Wilkie            ;  though younger
than either, for it appears he entered St Andrews at the precocious
age   of ten.    Young Campbell      was intended for the ministry,        but he
soon found that his    calling  was not to the Church.    His    sense  of unfit
ness for clerical studies, joined with ambition to shine at the English
bar, led him to London.         Mr  Sergeant Spankey,      then editor of the
" Morning Chronicle,"        gave him employment as reporter and critic.
He    seemed   to have    retained his connection with that paper up to
1810, and, what      is curious, chiefly as a dramatic   critic, writing thea
trical articles.    Young Campbell        showed also at this time that he
could claim resemblance to accomplished Roman                lawyers, and, for
example, to one celebrated by Horace        — Asinius   Pollio — who      was not
 only   a lawyer   and statesman, historian,        and conversant with       the
"  musa tragoodiae,"     but soldier    also, as Campbell      had joined the
Bloomsbury and Inns of Court Volunteers, which consisted exclusively
of barristers, attorneys, law-students, and clerks.          To this circum
stance he jocularly referred in after life, in a suit he was trying
connected with a volunteer regiment,          by saying that he had       himself
once been a soldier, as a member of the corps, composed                as  I have
said of diverse members of the legal profession, and which he re-
fened to   as well known in the capital under the name           of The Devil's
Own.      His great object, however, was law.          He entered       as a stu
dent of Lincoln's-Inn in 1800, and commenced           special pleading under
that great master of the art, Mr Tidd, who at one time could point
to four pupils of his own sitting in the House of Peers, — Lords Lynd-
hurst, Denman,        Cottenham,     Campbell,  — all of    whom      constantly
acknowledged their deep obligation to their master.              He  was    called
to the bar in 1806, and went the Oxford Circuit, where he soon
obtained    considerable practice.       It  was   to London business, how
ever, that he looked, and he was soon            in great London practice —
getting high fees in shipping cases, and in special jury cases at Guild
hall. It is well known that in establishing practice for a young
lawyer much       depends    upon the favour with which he is regarded
by the attorneys.        Lord Campbell in his " Life of Pratt," Chief-
Justice of the King's Bench, and father of the Marquis of Camp-
den, says of him, that for eight or nine years his practice did not

                                      486
improve,    because   he would not invite        the attorneys     to dinner, or
dance with    their daughters.     Whether Campbell          was a dancing man,
or whether     he danced with attorneys' daughters,           I know not.     But
it is clear that   he took a better and a more        lawyer-like plan of gain
ing the favour of their papas than either dancing or dining.                   He
published a series of Reports of Cases decided at Ni-riPrius between
1809     and 1816, which       was not only in itself very valuable,          and
established his reputation as a lawyer, but which specially interested
the body of solicitors, as the work contained for the first time the
names    of the attorneys who had got up each case.            He had thus   very
early a great connection with       the solicitors, and came into a lucra
tive and immense business.         He   soon became       leader on the Oxford
Circuit.     In  1827 he obtained a silk gown.           In  1830 he came into
Parliament for Stafford.         In 1832,     was    Solicitor- General in the
Melbourne      Ministry,    and  was  returned     to  Parliament for Dudley.
In  1834, he became Attorney-General on             the retirement of Sir Wil
liam Home, but lost his seat for Dudley.                On   Mr Jeffrey's  eleva
tion to the Scottish Bench, and consequent retirement from the re
presentation of Edinburgh, Sir John Campbell was returned as one
of our city members, and sat till 1841.*                Several very important
cases in the common law-courts         occurred whilst he was Attorney-
General, in which he had to take            a prominent      part.   One of his
most conspicuous efforts was his defence of Lord                 Melbourne,   the
prime-minister, in the action brought by            Mr Norton.       Campbell's
defence    was considered so masterly, and           the   gaining  the cause so
important to the stability of the administration,             that when Camp
bell entered the House of Commons the evening of the trial, he was
generally    and loudly    cheered by the members on the ministerial
side of the House, as a testimony to his skill in managing the case,
and his ingenuity in cross-examining the adverse witnesses.                    At
this period many law appointments           had    to be made, but     Sir John
Campbell still continued Attorney- General.              A  purpose of bringing
   * Sir John Campbell, whilst a member of the House of Commons, did good
service to the country by promoting at all times the cause of legal reforms.
He introduced two very important bills which are known by his name.           One
for the protection of proprietors of newspapers who had inserted libels with
out malice of purpose, and having made due apologies. The other for the
protection of persons against malicious arrest for debts which were not due.
The latter arose out of a famous case of arrest, and great hardship, of the Duke
of Caduval on a false affidavit.

failed, as did also a plan for making him Chancellor of Ireland.                  On
Lord Plunket's retirement, however, from that office, Sir John
Campbell, June 1841, was made a Peer and Chancellor of Ireland.
He held the office a very short time, indeed I believe he only sat
as judge     twice.      In  the following      September,     he   resigned along
with the      Melbourne      ministry,    and    for five years lived        without
office,  profession — salary      or pension.     His mind could not         be idle.
He took      to   literary pursuits, and reverted with great zest to the
classical studies of his early days.            He found, however, the disad
vantages of study without           object, and accordingly       concentrated his
attention    on a subject congenial         with   his tastes, and calculated to
call forth his powers. He         determined to    write the Lives of the Chan
cellors,  and   of  the  Chief-Justices   of  England. The first series of the
former was published in 1846, and immediately attained a popularity
which has continued to attend both works.                When Lord John Rus
sell's cabinet was formed in 1846, it was expected              that Lord Camp
bell would have been Chancellor.               He   accepted,   however, the less
important     office of Chancellor of the Duchy        of Lancaster, with      a seat
in the cabinet.          This did not prevent his pursuing his literary
labours   ; but in 1850 he returned to his more active legal occupations,
as, on the resignation       of Lord Denman, he became Chief-Justice of
the Queen's Bench.           It  was a  trial  to succeed Denman,       a man    of a
noble presence, and dignified           eloquence.      Lord Campbell, without
these, carried       universal   respect by his accurate knowledge of law,
his industry, his discretion, and impartiality.              In  1859 he became
the Chancellor of Lord Palmerston's               administration.       This   was a
second    trial for     him to     undergo.      Having hitherto been exclu
sively practised in the administration of common law, it might be
expected he would feel embarrassed as presiding in Chancery, and
the House of Lords.           But his sagacity and his diligence were again
triumphant.         He lost nothing of the reputation he brought with
him    from the Queen's Bench.            He is said     to have been the only
Chancellor taken from the common law, in whom it was impossible
to detect the slightest embarrassment             in the new position      to which
he   was transferred,       and amidst the new principles            on which      he
had    to   adjudicate.      His judgments in equity have               universally
been    deemed      of the highest authority. It          is a   striking proof of
the activity of Lord Campbell's mind, and his readiness, to occupy

                                           488
 his time and thoughts           with    questions not immediately             connected
with   his professional      occupation, that he should              have sustained      so
long and so important a literary effort, as writing the lives of the
Lord Chancellors and Lord Chief-Justices of the Queen's Bench.
There    is no   question of its being a work of great research, great
impartiality, and full of      acute and able remarks            ; the stores of infor
mation are at once various and minute                ;  the   style is far from being
polished, but he is always clear and intelligible to his reader                      ; he
has done his work thoroughly            and well.      He happily unites the        office
of the lawyer and the historian ; for the careful law-student of the
work will find in the personal history of our Chancellors and Chief-
Justices that there     is also pervading      it  a history    of our jurisprudence.
He will trace the gradual establishment of its sounder principles,                      he
will mark the correction of what had              been vague or erroneous.
    But there   is another and a more           striking indication of the       activity
of his mind,   and the versatility of his talent, as regards questions which
did not come before him as a judge, which is contained in his letter
to  Mr Payne Collier,       on the   Legal Acquirements of Shakspeare. He
had glanced at     this  subject  in his " Lives of the Chancellors and Chief-
Justices."     But in this letter,        he  brings     forward the arguments in
favour of an opinion, which            had for sometime been gaining ground
amongst the admirers of Shakspeare — viz., that before he went                          to
London for his theatrical           life,  he had been         clerk in an attorney's
office  at Stratford.         There     are  some      cotemporary        circumstances
which seem to lead to this opinion, and these                  Lord Campbell       states
in the opening of the letter         ;  but his chief argument is derived from
the corroborative       evidence     supplied     by passages       selected   from his
plays.     He quotes from twenty-three                plays, and he conceives that
the passages      he quotes give a probable               evidence     that they must
have been    written by one who had once been a professional lawyer,
and familiar with its technical language.                    I have heard persons
speak rather in a depreciating manner of this little production, and
who seemed to consider it as unworthy of Lord Campbell, and in
fact as in itself of little interest.         I  am    much surprised at this        opi
nion.    I  think the     case is made       out in a very ingenious            manner;
and surely it cannot be a matter devoid of interest to trace back any
of the sentiments and expressions of Shakspeare to their original
sources, and to analyse the materials of a mind like his.                          That
Shakspeare who drew his imagery                 and    his topics from all       sources

                                            489
  in society and in nature, should refer in             a general    manner to the
  legal profession, and to lawyers, as a peculiar and               marked class of
  civil life, could have     caused   no surprise.      It  would have been quite
  natural.      But when     he uses such technical language as can be fami
  liar   to professional men      only, when his illustrations       imply an accu
  rate    knowledge     of legal principles       not generally     known, we     feel
  assured that there must be some special cause for materials of such
  a character being introduced         into his writings      so frequently   and so
  minutely.       It  was   natural   enough, for example,         that  Shakspearo
  should say of skilful lawyers,        "  good   counsellors lack no clients," or
  of lawyers, who are idle in vacation time, that they " sleep between
  term and term," or that he should call time " the common arbitrator."
  That Gratiano would propose for Shylock, besides his two godfathers,
  when he became a Christian, ten more, meaning that he would have
  him before     a  jury  to be  tried for an attempt     to murder Bassanio ; or
  that the fool in Lear should say that the maxims which the old king
  declared were      " nothing,"   were   like  " the  breath of an unfeed lawyer,
  given to the king for nothing," and many other examples.                     But it
  is very different       when he uses terms and makes representations,
  which imply a knowledge of nice points of law, and points not gene
  rally known, except by professional            men.      As, for instance, in the
  " Merry Wives of Windsor," Ford
                                              says, that
                                                          "  his love was like a fair
  house,    built upon another man's ground,          so that he had lost his edi
  fice by mistaking the place where he erected             it," showing that Shak
  speare had a knowledge of real property not generally possessed,                 —
  viz., the knowledge of that maxim of lawyers applicable                   to land   :
  "  cujus est solum, ejus est usque ad coolum," under which any house
  erected    on a freehold becomes the absolute property            of the soil, — so
  that the luckless builder        cannot remove      any of the most costly ad
 juncts of his building, such         as the finely-carved       chimney-pieces, or
 expensive marble pillars, with which he may have adorned the edifice.
 A                      " Comedy of Errors'" draws out a most circumstantial
      passage in the
 and graphic account of what is called in English law '' Arrest on
 Mesne Process in an action on the case."               No one could have adopte-1
 the phraseology in the conversation              between    Adriano and Dromio,
 who had not a technical acquaintance with the point of law               so named.
 It   is very curious also, that Shakspeare, in the grave-diggers'             scene,
 where he speaks in a ludicrous tono pf             " Crowner's Quest Law," —
i.e., the law     as laid down by a coroner when he holds an inquest on

                                          490
 a dead body    — should   show his intimate knowledge of a celebrated case
 of felo  de se, tried in the reign of Philip and Mary before a coroner,
 and which was afterwards brought into the higher courts.                   The    case
 had been reported by the famous Plowden,               and Shakspeare evidently
 intended to ridicule       the counsel who       argued, and the judge who
 decided    it.  Hamlet's own       speech   quotes a string of technicalities,
 with the meaning of which the author is apparently familiar, — such                  as
 speaking of    a lawyer's    recognisances, his fines, his double vouchers,
 his  recoveries, and      of  these   vouchers,    whether     single   or    double,
 vouching him no more of his purchases than a pair of indentures, —
 and of which Lord Campbell declares that it would puzzle practis
 ing barristers of his acquaintance to define each              satisfactorily   ; and
 let it be remembered, that Lord            Campbell quotes upwards of sixty
 examples of such law passages          more or less to the point.          Whether
 Shakspeare      were  or were not trained          in an attorney's       office can
 never now be known beyond conjecture, but the book shows Lord
Campbell's ingenuity, and his readiness on a question of law and lite
rature in curious combination.
    Such     is a brief sketch of the active            and varied life of John
Lord     Campbell.      He    was   assuredly    a very able man,           and    has
achieved a name in his country's            annals which will not pass away.
The leading characteristic of his mind,          as   I  have always heard from
those    who knew him best,          was   determination    — a firm      resolve    to
accomplish his object before him, and to attain the highest place in
the path he had set himself to pursue.              His efforts were successful,
and he never relaxed in his diligence, never swerved from duty.                      A
little incident will illustrate       this adherence to what he considered
was incumbent on him to accomplish, at            all risks   to his own personal
convenience.       When the naval review took place at Portsmouth,                  in
 1853, the nobility and leading commoners of the empire were                        to
attend, and a steamer was appointed to convey the whole House of
Lords from Southampton, and to bring them back to the same point
when the review was done.            They were obliged        to start   from Lon
don, the day of the review, at four           in the morning,          One mishap
succeeded another,      so  that the party did not reach Southampton till
three the following morning, and were not in London till six. Not
withstanding all the fatigue and delay of so long an expedition, Lord
Campbell, then Chief-Justice of the Queen's Bench, was enabled                      to
state in the House of Lords, with great complacency, when com-

                                         491
plaints     were made of the bad arrangement of the expedition, that
the suitors had not suffered from the mismanagement, as he had
taken his seat in Queen's Bench at the usual hour, half-past nine.
He     was then seventy-two.
    Lord Campbell        owed   his success in life entirely to his own exer
tions, and his own innate powers of mind.                  He had not those ex
ternal     accessories   of address or grace to which men are sometimes
indebted for much of their success, and from which they gain artificial
advantage in the public eye and estimation.              He    was plain,   in his ex
terior, nor had      he a polished style   of writing or of speaking. He had
nothing of what is        usually termed eloquence, and yet all he said and
 wrote told and produced good effect.             Like Lord Aberdeen, he on-
joyed in his lifetime the respect and consideration               due to his talents
and his success, but which are posthumous to so many good and able
 men.       For him a cotemporary might very properly                use the address
 made to                   "
             Augustus, Presenti tibi          maturos largiamur honores."
     Lord Campbell never felt what so many able men feel before they
 have to give up their place in this world, — viz., that              " multa   senem
circumveniunt        incommoda."       He had only      one   of  those two seasons
 of childhood which Shakspeare has assigned                to every human being,
 nor could he ever have said with Lear : —
                       " Infirmity doth still neglect all office,
                         To which our health is bound."
 He died in his eightieth year, in           the midst    of full occupation      as a
 statesman      and a judge, and with          faculties,   I  believe, quite unim
 paired.      Few men      can  hope ever to attain        Lord Campbell's emi
 nence    ;  few   can expect to reach his years without               infirmity and
 decay of mental and bodily            faculties.     But all may imitate his
 example in the fixed determination to do their utmost in the path
 which Providence has assigned to them, and all may follow him in
 the full resolve faithfully and honestly to discharge every duty for
 which they have become responsible.*
      John Gordon, Esq. of Cairnbulg, who died during the present
     *  Those who best knew Lord Campbell in private life bear testimony to his
 amiable and affectionate deportment in the domestic circle.            To his habitual
 unselfishness, which made him seek the comfort and happiness of every one
 before his own, and to the freshness and simplicity with which he enjoyed, with
 young people especially, the few simple pleasures for which his immense labours
  left him time.
       VOL. IV.                                                        3 U

                                        492
year at an advanced         age, had long      been    a  Fellow of the Royal
Society.      He spent many years in Edinburgh, and at one time
was in some      practice as an advocate.           I  recollect  him     a regular
attendant on the Society's meetings.         But his natural bent was towards
the duties and avocations of a country gentleman.                These occupied
his attention during the later years of his life.            But he joined, with
all his pursuits,   a love  of literature   to the last, and, with much intel
ligence, took great interest in everything that was going on at home
or abroad in the fields of scientific and literary inquiry.
     John Schank More        was    born at North Shields        in 1784, where
his father was the respected         pastor of a congregation        in connection
with the first    seceders    from the Scottish Established          Church. He
 was educated in Edinburgh, and had an early predilection for the
 bar, to which he was called in 1806.             He had good practice as a
junior counsel, but he       soon showed that        his bent was rather to the
 teaching of the profession, and the exposition of the general principles
 of law as its expounder, than to the practice of court.                   In  1827
 he   published   an   edition   of   " Erskine's Principles of        the Law of
 Scotland,"    a very useful manual for guiding            young students to        a
 correct knowledge of that standard           manual.      But in 1832      he pub
 lished his most important        work, his edition of Lord       Stair's " Insti
 tutions   of the Law of Scotland,           with Notes and Illustrations."
 Lord Stair's work      was the production       of a most philosophical       mind,
 as well as of a profound       lawyer.     It  contains more than a digest of
 municipal     law,  it contains an able treatise of general jurispru
 dence.     His illustration of such a work, therefore, fell in with
 Professor    More's peculiar        habits of mind      and thought.        I  have
 been    assured   by   an eminent       Scottish    lawyer,   that   he was par
 ticularly happy in bringing forward all circumstances in illustra
 tion of his abstract law principles, whether derived from home or
 foreign sources.      He   had extraordinary       knowledge of what may         be
  termed the literature of the law.            Hence his edition of Stair        has
 taken its place as a standard work, and is quoted for general prin
 ciples, both at the bar in argument, and on the bench in judgment.
  A   course of study producing        such happy results as the Professor's
  labours in the two great works of Erskine and Stair                     must  have
  been recognised as the best        preparation    for  a legal    chair, and   the
   best  proof of fitness for its occupancy.           Accordingly,     in 1843, on

                                        493
the death of Professor        John Joseph Bell,     he succeeded    to the chair
of Scots Law in the University of Edinburgh.               It would be unbe
coming, in one not a lawyer, to pretend giving a judgment on the
merits of   a professor's teaching      of law.    But that  he performed his
work    under a solemn sense       of duty — that     he spared    no    pains to
make his class understand the principles and the details of a science
which he had diligently        and successfully studied himself, is a matter
of general notoriety, and the public papers, at the time of his death,
all bore testimony to his merits as a professor.           One feature of his
professional work was very remarkable, and attested by every hard
working student,      I  mean the unwearied       pains he took in going over
their papers, and the careful manner in which he corrected the
essays sent in to him.         There may be something animating and at
tractive in looking over the exercises and theses of Scots law students,
I  am unable to judge of this, but          I  should think, in general, such
examinations      must be a dreary portion of any professor's             labours.
But Professor More never         seemed    to weary.    He never intermitted
his care, and seemed always fresh for doing, and doing kindly, what
he considered      an   act of duty by his pupils.        Professor     More, in
fact, made his studies, and everything connected with his profession,
a part of his daily and ordinary life.           He enjoyed books, because he
made good use of them, and he had collected a library of upwards of
 15,000 volumes.         These books were his delight     — his companions in
 solitude, his comfort in the tedium of hours of sickness.               He could
 turn at  once to the volume he wanted, and to the passage he desired
 to recall.    When      I  say his books were his companions,            I  might
 rather have said the authors         were    his companions.     In   a letter to
 one of his family, shortly before          his death, he draws in himself        a
 pleasing picture of an old man in his study surrounded by his books,
 and holding converse with his favourite authors : —
     " While   reading Leighton quietly in my own room, it struck me
 that the old man      was really   sitting with    me,  and conversing fami
 liarly upon those topics which so entirely engrossed           his own mind       ;
 and it is a curious reflection that, with such books,        I have been con
 versing as truly with Horsley, Hooker, and Leighton as               if they had
 risen from their graves and sat by me."
     Whilst   I remark     the Professor's liberality of feeling in naming as
 his favourites     three authors who were not members of his own
  Church,   I   think my hearers will       excuse   some  personal feelings     ot

                                                494
pride    and satisfaction       in observing that                  Leighton, Horsley,               and
Hooker are ornaments of my own Church.
     There is   a circumstance connected                   with the late Professor's library
which was so peculiar that                I   cannot resist referring to it.                  He     was
a most indefatigable collector of         pamphlets, and formed the largest
collection    of a private       individual,          I
                                             believe, in Scotland; and it is
always curious to notice what any man has done different from other
men.       Some years ago            I    had the honour               of reading before this
Society a memoir of my illustrious                     friend      Dr Chalmers.            Professor
More heard of my intention, and very kindly offered me the use
of a volume, which he had collected, of sermons, memoirs, poems,
&c, all relating to Dr Chalmers.                       I   found this one of a series of
volumes of collected fugitive pieces, then amounting                               to   700 or 800;
but which, before he died, the Professor had raised to the number of
1400 volumes, — that           is,   about 14,000 pamphlets.                       It   would be      de
sirable that the volumes should be purchased unbroken for some public
library.      Such collections are very valuable                        for reference.            Single
pamphlets, lying loose in            a    library, are       a   regular nuisance, and most
troublesome, always getting in the way                      ;    but   if   you look for any par
ticular pamphlet you never find it.                   Pamphlets, however, when formed
into such     a     collection as this, are        a       very different matter, and may,
as
 I      have said, bo extremely valuable, as affording to future students
of history very important information                       on cotemporary circumstances,
which    is   sometimes not otherwise to be obtained                        ;   and for this reason
some rare and curious pamphlets have been sold                               for enormous         prices,
and are much coveted            by       collectors.         One of the most curious his
torical collections of pamphlets in this kingdom                            is   that in the British
 Museum,        which    was    presented in               1763,       by George         III.,    to the
 library of that gigantic institution.                        It   was      made by       a      royalist
 bookseller, named George Thomson, during the Commonwealth.                                            It
 consists of 2220 volumes, and contains about 34,000                                      pamphlets,
 nearly all of which refer to the civil wars, and to the affairs of the
 country between 1640 and 1661.                            To show the comparative extent
 of Professor        More's     collection         by      a private individual, as com
 pared    with public collections,            I   may note here that the Edinburgh
 Subscription         Library    is       advertised to contain 600 volumes, or
 about 1600 pamphlets;                   the Signet Library contains about 5000
 pamphlets   the College Library about 25,000
                ;                             and the Advocates             ;
 Library near 67,000 pamphlets, or 3649 volumes.  In catalogues

                                           495
of  books,   such as   Dr Parr's " Bibliotheca Parriana," and other           cele
brated sale catalogues, there is generally a pretty copious account of
the rarer tracts and pamphlets contained in the collection to which
the catalogue belongs.          But there is     a  history of pamphlets, which
is one of the most extraordinary               books in the English language,
published in London 1715,
                                    — a book well known to librarians and
collectors.      The author was Myles Davies, who seems to have been
odd and eccentric to the last degree.              He   was very poor, and wrote
for bread     ;  very learned and of great research, but his style ram
bling and grotesque. The work, in six volumes, is very scarce, in
deed it is esteemed amongst the rarest books in bibliography, and
 is entitled, Eocoji-     ^tucpo-ySi/JAuoj
                                            — " Sive Icon Libellorum,"
                                                                             (what
 we should call in Scotch
                                     " little  bookies,") or a critical history of
 pamphlets, &c. &c.          In   a long, rambling preface, he enters upon a
 history of pamphlets, and describes their different uses and quali
 ties.    He very coolly says in the preface : — " We need not go
 farther back than 2000 years before the creation of the world."
 Some Jewish rabbins having profanely asserted that heaven itself
 had at that time written the small volume containing the synagogue
 rule of their law ; and he quotes Saldenus, a Dutch divine, who, in
 the    first of forty-one       erudite     dissertations  (Amsterdam, 1684),
  combats the rabbinical         opinion, that Adam and each of the patri
  archs had written a pamphlet.               Davies dedicates  the sixth volume
  of his history of pamphlets to his patron, Dr Crowe, and addresses
  him in this complimentary strain in a Latin poem, commencing,—
                       " O corve, corvo rarior albido ! "
     In all   the intercourse of private life, and all domestic and social
  relations,    nothing could be more exemplary than the conduct and
  demeanour of Professor More.              There  was a gentleness  of disposition
  which    seemed to    shrink from doing an unkind action, or saying a
  harsh word to      any human being.           He had that large-hearted feeling
  for mankind which could not withhold from others the mercy he ex
  pected for himself,       and which would never deny encouragement to
  the most erring when making promises of amendment.                    I  recollect
  his saying, with a charming           simplicity   of character, that he thought
  people were quite right to attend the lectures which Lolla Montes
  was delivering      here at the time, as they proved that now she de
  signed    to turn over a new leaf, and to earn an honest livelihood               !
  I  have spoken      of the pains which he took with his class.            He   was

                                           496
forbearing and patient        with those who were idle or inconsiderate.
When thoughtless        or ungenerous members of the class would                  (as
young men sometimes         will) forget themselves, and take those liberties
which are     so unbecoming in the gentleman and the student, the
kind-hearted      teacher hardly        gave    indication  that   they were    even
noticed by him.        He might        be occasionally grieved or pained,         but
was never irritated.        I have    often thought it is good to have known
such    characters as John Schank More,              — not, mark me, on account
of great accomplishments, high genius, or profound learning, but
because they put one in better humour with the world, and make
one    think better of human nature, as living illustrations of the great
and pure principle of Christian love, and as exhibiting in their lives
and dispositions a rare resemblance to the spirit of Him whose name
 we    all bear.    Let   such   men       be held in honour      by their cotem-
 poraries, and let their survivors           cherish  their  names    with grateful
 remembrance, as true benefactors of their species, who have shown
 to the world, in characters which cannot be mistaken, the power and
 beauty of Christian      gentleness.
     Sir James Miles Riddell, Bart. of Strontian              and Ardnamurchan,
 who died 28th        September       1861, at the age of seventy-four,           was
 long a Fellow of the Society, and at one time took much interest in
 its proceedings.      He    was beloved       and esteemed    by  all his friends  as
 a man of most amiable disposition, and honourable character, through
 life.    Although Sir James could not be called a scientific man, in so
 far as   special study of any branch of natural science was concerned,
 yet his name is associated,         as a landed proprietor       of Scotland,   with
  an important     mineralogical discovery.           One of the earths was found
  on his property from which         it  is named, and as this mineral       was first
  discovered    by a Scotchman, and from the beginning                  has borne    a
  Scottish name,     I may perhaps be allowed to say a few words               on the
  subject in passing.       In 1787        some minerals were brought to        Edin
  burgh by    a dealer from Strontian,           Sir James Riddell's property       in
  Argyleshire.      They    were   examined by        Dr Hope, then the eminent
  Professor    of  Chemistry      in    the    University.    In 1791, Dr Hope
  announced, in     a  paper read to the Society,            that in one of     these
  minerals    he had detected       a new earth, and which he proposed              to
  name Strontites,     from the locality from whence it was received.               It
  soems    previously to have       been      confounded with barytes, and sup

                                           497
posed to be some         modification of that substance.          The paper      was
more fully elaborated, and published in the                "  Society's   Transac
tions" 1793.        The German chemist, Klaproth, had              also examined
the Strontian      mineral, and without          any knowledge of       Dr Hope's
experiment, had also discovered in it the new earth, and called it
"   Strontion."      According     to our present nomenclature,        the earth is
called    Strontia — the     metal which forms the basis of the earth is
Strontium, and         was   separated      and exhibited    by   Sir Humphrey
Davy.        The native mineral          from Strontian which        produced the
earth is called Strontianite, and           is a carbonate   of Strontia.    It   has
 been found also at Braundsdorf in Saxony, and elsewhere.                     There
ai e other native minerals of which Strontia forms the basis, one
called Celestine,     so named    from the beautiful blue tinge of its crystals.
I   have seen lovely specimens of Celestine from the Mountain                Lime
stone quarries near Bristol.           Finer   specimens  are, however, met with
in the sulphur mines of Sicily, and still finer in the Strontian island
in Lake Erie.         When it was known that a new earth had been dis
covered in the        Strontian    district, the proprietor and all concerned
 were full of expectations of benefits which might accrue from the
discovery of a substance of which they were supposed to possess a
 monopoly.        But, alas ! no use has been found for it in the arts or
 manufactures     — none    at least of what may be called particularly        bene
 ficial.   The only application       has been in the form     of nitrate of stron
 tia, and which      is made     use   of to produce that beautiful       red   light
 which is exhibited in fire works, and also in certain pantomimic and
 melodramatic effects in theatrical representations, which delight the
 children    who attend, both young and old.
     Dr James Robertson, was born in 1803, at Ardlaw, in the parish
 of Old Pitsligo.        His father a farmer at Ardlaw, still survives at
 the advanced age of eighty-six.            Dr Robertson completed his educa
 tion at Marischal College,           Aberdeen, and his first appointment in
 life    was  to the parochial school of his native place.            He   was soon
 after appointed head-master of Gordon's Hospital in Aberdeen.                     In
  1832    he was appointed to the        living of Ellon, in the gift of the Earl
 of Aberdeen,      and was long       familiarly known, as a powerful debater
 in the General Assembly, as Robertson of Ellon.                  In 1843 he was
 called to the Chair of Church History in the University of Edin
 burgh, and Secretaryship           of the Bible Board, and which situations

                                              498
he held  till his death, which took place unexpectedly,                   and   after a   very
short illness, 2d December 1860.         Dr Robertson                     was a man          of
acute mind and sound            judgment,        a fluent     speaker, and        of   energy
indomitable.        I have    always considered           Dr Robertson an admirable
specimen of the acute, clear-headed, business-like Scottish character.
His pursuits and labours were all of a useful                 and practical       character.
The conduct of ecclesiastical affairs of the Church, general parochial
management, the study of Church History for his lectures —
everything connected with                the poor and administration            of the    poor-
laws, agricultural improvement of soils, and                      the currency     question,
were       subjects closely    and skilfully         investigated by him.    When
parochial      schoolmaster, he wrote a             pamphlet
                                                               " On the Currency,"
which attracted the attention of Lord Aberdeen, and which, in fact,
led to his appointing him                to the incumbency        of the living of Ellon.
There existed through their lives a friendship and sincere mutual
regard, and these continued to their deaths, which happened within
a few days        of each other.            Dr Robertson died          on 2d December,
Lord Aberdeen died on the 14th, 1860.
     Dr Robertson      was    through life much interested in the currency
question, and read a very elaborate paper on the subject, at Glasgow,
during the meeting            of   the      Association     for    the Advancement           of
Social Science, which was held in that city during last year. Some
time before this        I
                     was much interested in hearing him brought
out upon this question, on the occasion                     of his dining with             me,
when he        met my       dear friend,       the late     Alexander Blair of              the
Bank of Scotland,       a man            of highly cultivated        mind,   and of great
attainments in theology, in classical and general literature                     — the     first
authority in Scotland upon banking, upon the currency, and indeed
upon every        subject     connected        with   finance       and   the    circulating
medium.         It was very amusing to hear the discussion between two
such       men — one all theory, the other bringing every theory to prac
tice  the one arguing from the conclusions of an acute intellect,
       ;
the other, from long and accurate experience of banking, and of
everything belonging to            it,   and who well knew that every opinion                in
money matters, however ingeniously supported, must be brought to
the test of experience in the working of   under all the circum
                                                           it
stances      of the social and monetary          system.
     The memory of Dr Robertson will ever be preserved in Scotland
as   connected with that great scheme of church extension with which

                                          499
  his name is now always associated,            and which owed so much of its
  success to his labours and his wisdom.            The intention of the    scheme
  is to create and endow above sixty new parishes in connection with the
  Established    Church.     He   was mainly instrumental       in raising, by im
  mediate or by deferred payments, for this great object, a sum of nearly
                                                       I
  half a million ; and on this portion of his life am anxious to say a few
  words, and   I do so  not only because it called forth a marked feature of
  his own character, and because it indicated a special power of his own
 mind, but because     I conceive  it affords   a most useful general lesson, and
 supplies an honourable example for all men who are engaged in prac
 tical work, and who have to aid in plans of advancing the interests of
 religion, of charity, or of any improvement in social life.             I refer to
 his labours   as secretary, or convener, in which he practically advanced
 the details of that object of which       I have made    mention.    The  scheme
 was most important, and in every way praiseworthy.                It called upon
 the members of the Established Church to join in a great and well-
 organised scheme for church extension.              I need not dwell upon the
 particular constitution of     the plan, the special object     it placed before
 the community, or the special means it had in view for attaining
 those objects.     What    I  wish now mainly to notice is the manner in
 which our late member worked the machinery of the                  scheme,  — the
diligence he displayed     — the   cool, yet earnest decision with which that
diligence was accompanied.           I  would refer to his clear and powerful
statements of the case he advocated           ;  I would point to his never-fail
ing attendance at meetings throughout the country, his constant
readiness to avail himself of all advantages, to meet all deficiencies,
and to correct all mistakes.        His labours never seemed        to be at rest ;
his sagacity   was never at fault.     It  was such qualities advanced into    full
action that, under the favour of God's approval, brought the scheme
to its present condition of efficiency, and opened its prospect of ulti
mate success.      What    I would   mark out and recommend for approval
and imitation, are those very exertions by which the efficiency of the
scheme was promoted.           Dr Robertson was a man of business, and
such men are wanted amongst us, — wanted because they are scarce,
and wanted because they are valuable.               In  vain will you have men
of learning, eloquence, or        acuteness     upon your committees in great
associations for advancing good purposes : if you have not men of
business, the schemes will fall to the ground, or languish and decay.
Experto crede.       I  have some little experience of such matters my-
    yol. vi.                                                             3 x

                                       500
self.   Committees meet and questions are discussed, and faults              are
found, and measures proposed and adopted, and a great deal of acute-
nessand eloquence are displayed, —sometimes, perhaps, a little temper
and vituperation.       The committee separate, the matter sleeps, and,
except some one      takes it up vigorously to work it out in detail, the
committee, at next meeting, find matters much in the same                  posi
tion as they were when they last parted.         Now, all this intermediate
labour was supplied by       Dr Robertson   ; he set himself to the work, —
he would not permit       the matter to sleep,     —he    pushed forward     the
scheme,  — and    to the last moment of his being able to hold               the
plough, did not look back from his good work.             He determined     that
his countrymen should support his scheme         ;  and the call of the Roman
poet to the Roman people in many ways typified                  the call of  the
Scottish   divine   to the Scottish     landowner,     or wealthy    merchant,
" Delicta  majorum immeritus lues, donee templa re/iceris^'
    Such was Dr Robertson.           A man of the best intellectual         and
active habits, who brought his understanding and his activity to bear
successfully on a great and noble scheme of national              benefit.   He
was cut   off at a comparatively     early age, at least whilst still capable
 of much useful labour      ;  but he was   followed to the grave with the
respect  and honour of all his countrymen, whatever             were their po
litical opinions, whatever were their religious        creed.
    One name only remains on our list of deceased members, that of
Erskine Douglas Sandford,         advocate, and    Sheriff of the Stewartry of
Kirkcudbright     and County of Galloway.        He was born in 1793. He
was eldest son of   Dr Daniel Sandford in the Scottish Episcopal Church,
Bishop of Edinburgh.          Bishop Sandford      was  from an old family of
Shropshire.      But   he   formed    a  Scottish    connection   by marriage.
Erskine Sandford      was born   in Edinburgh. He had       become completely
in feeling and connections a Scotchman, and at one time was in good
practice and high reputation as an advocate, and a writer upon law-
It encroaches, perhaps, too much on the offices of private friendship
for me to say much upon the character of this our late Fellow. But I
may appeal to the general feeling that pervaded the circle of Edin
burgh society when the unexpected intelligence came of his death ;
every testimony was given to his character, as a man and as a Chris
tian, and every sympathy shown to his family in the loss which                by
his death they had sustained.

                                     501
     Gentlemen,  —I   have now accomplished, however imperfectly,         the
objects which     I had  before me in this Address,     — viz.,   1st, To no
tice the influence exercised generally by learned associations upon
the advancement and extension of literature and natural science; and,
2d, To take a brief notice of certain members of the Royal Society
of Edinburgh who have died since the opening of the late Session.
     Nothing more forcibly brings before us the advancement of man
kind in mental improvement and in mechanical refinement than the
power which we possess of realising        the past, and of storing up the
discoveries and the disquisitions which have been made by those who
have preceded us.       Human knowledge seems now to be all recorded
for the benefit of posterity.     There is such a multiplication of books,
and such economy in the production of books, as to make that know
ledge available to all ranks     of society.     There is an arrangement
 and classification of books    according to    the subjects of which they
 treat   which   prevent libraries   becoming a hopeless labyrinth — an
 overwhelming incubus.      The achievements of able and original minds
 are preserved   by those who have possessed kindred spirits with their
 own, and none of their labours need be lost, — nothing that they have
 accomplished need perish.       I  think our scientific  societies  have had
 a great and extensive influence in producing          these  results.   That
 spirit of combination and companionship which has worked such
 numerous and permanent effects in all departments of human life,
 and which is an innate principle       of human nature, has operated in
 combining     men for objects which       may be good or may be bad.
 Whilst    we see with pain and    grief the union of human beings accom
  plished for the express purpose of evil, and for injuring others in
  order to promote the advantage of those who unite, it is delightful
  to think how close, also, combinations may be made for the improve
  ment of the species, for advancing knowledge, either exclusively in
  one of its departments, or generally        in every department.        Men
  combine together in associations for amusement, for recreation, or
  for gaiety.   They combine together for purposes of pecuniary profit,
  to secure political ascendancy, or more refined educational benefits
  for their families.    This spirit of combination has produced also
  many associations like our own      ; around the labours and the opera
  tions of these there has gathered an accumulated history of genius
  and discovery, which must be enduring as the human species itself.
  The highest place in our veneration and        esteem is, no doubt, due to

                                        502
those sacred      associations which are formed under a religious        spirit
of union, either for disseminating         the Word of God in all the lan
guages spoken by the numerous families of human beings through
out the world, or for promoting the spread of Christian knowledge,
whether amongst the neglected outcasts            of our home population, or
amongst the heathen who have never heard a Saviour's name.                 But
next to these we may venerate and esteem               the associations which
unite men for the cause of sound philosophy,             and for advancing all
branches of useful human learning,            which draw men together for
literary   and   scientific  purposes, and which impart to them a com
mon interest in the discovery and extension of truth.              We   cannot
fail to perceive the merit        of associations which thus unite men oi
very different     habits and occupations       in the encouragement of all
those   pursuits which, as long experience has now proved, tend              to
ennoble man's nature, and to elevate his sources of enjoyment.

   The following Communications were read —                         :
    1.    On the Climate of Palestine in Modern compared to
               Ancient Times    By Principal Forbes.
   In    this paper the writer proposes to revise and extend the argu
ment used thirty years ago by the late Professor                         Schouw of Copen
hagen, as to the climate of Palestine,                   founded on the coincident
cultivation     of the Date Palm, and the Vine                 :    the one plant nearly
ceasing to bring its fruit to maturity                  when the other begins to be
productive.         Tropical   heat   is    as necessary    to the         maturity of the
date as   it   is   injurious*to the manufacture of wine.
  In     Schouw's       ingenious     paper     (Edinburgh Journal                    of Science
for 1828), by a strange          oversight, the great range of temperature
of Judoea       and    of Palestine        generally,    due       to    the     mountainous
nature    of the country,        and to the anomalous                    depression       of   the
valley of the Jordan,* was left out of account                  ;       and hence the force
of the argument for the uniformity of ancient and modern climates
               »    The latter fact was in 1828 imperfectly ascertained.
        VOL. IV.
                                                                                     3
                                                                                     z

                                       512
was    materially   weakened.    The present writer     takes    these circum
stances   into account.    He farther     uses the information      with which
modern travellers have furnished us as to the physical and botanical
geography of Palestine, including the data obtained from thermo-
metric registers at Jerusalem and elsewhere ; and he arrives at the
following conclusions    : —
    1.  That judging from the known thermometric conditions of                the
growth and maturity of the date palm, compared with the evidences
in Scripture of its distribution     and culture in Ancient Palestine, the
mean temperature of the site of Jerusalem, when reduced to the
level of the sea, can have then differed but little from 70° Fahren
heit, which     is its present value according      to the best authorities.
We conclude, with still more certainty, that the temperature                could
not, anciently, have been colder than this.
    2. That comparing       the conditions which limit the cultivation of
the vine, we find that as it certainly         was   not anciently      less, but
more general and advantageous than at present, the climate of
Palestine could not have been materially hotter than now belongs
to its geographical     position, taking also into account the modifying
influence of height above the sea.
    3. That this argument is enhanced by the evidence               from hiero
glyphics, and also from Scripture,        that the cultivation of the grape
was anciently more extensive        in Egypt than it now     is.     That   while
 this might seem to point to the conclusion that these            countries   are
 hotter now than formerly, the difference is sufficiently accounted for
 by political circumstances, and the conclusion is itself negatived            by
 the evidence to the contrary derived from the date palm.
    4.  Hence the climate of Palestine, being neither          sensibly hotter
 nor colder than it anciently was, is of course unchanged            ;  and   the
 direct evidence of modern travellers on the distribution            of  the vine
 and palm in that country leads to the same result.
 2.  Biographical Notice of Andrew Dalzel, Professor of Greek
      in the University of Edinburgh. By Professor Innes.
    Professor Dalzel was born         in 1742,   at Gateside     of   Newliston.
His father died while       he  was  still an infant, and he     was educated
partly   by   his uncle, the minister      of Stonykirk, in Galloway, and
after   his death,    by his mother,      at Newliston.    He     attended    the

                                      513
parish school of Kirkliston, and from thence went to college at Edin
burgh.       His companion at both was Robert Liston, afterwards Sir
Robert, the       ambassador.     The boys     began    life together.     Liston
was   just two days younger than his friend, and the intimacy of
school and college lasted through life.           It is chiefly from the cor
respondence kept up between          them from 1766          till 1805 that the
present Memoir has been compiled.
    On leaving college, Dalzel was for        some time tutor in the family
of Lauderdale,     and the friendship so commenced          also remained     firm
and unbroken through life.
    In 1772—73, partly        by  an   arrangement      with    his  predecessor,
partly    through    the influence   of  the   Lauderdales      with the Town
Council, Dalzel became Professor of Greek            in the University.       The
study of that language had fallen much into decay in Scotland, and
Dalzel    set  himself zealously to the task of restoring and promoting
it. He devoted himself to the duties of his class, and was soon
rewarded by its increase in numbers and improvement in study.
Among other means for his object, he              set about      preparing   some
class-books for Greek students which were then unknown.                  His first
publication was a little supplement         to Moor's    Grammar, under the
title of Fragments Qrammatices           Greeae in usum tironum in Uteris
Greeds      in Academia Edinensi.          The   prose    volume of his well-
known Collectanea       Majora was publishtd in 1785, and got almost
at once into favour with the best teachers here and in England.
    In   the immediate duties of his professorship             Dalzel   was inde
                Dr Monro said of him, that         "  he had more to brag of
fatigable.
than any man in the college, for that Greek was going fast down
hill till he revived it." His second volume, the poetical portion of
the Collectanea Majora, cost him great labour, and obtained the
assistance     of many friends      among the best        scholars of England.
Though long promised and urgently called for by the schoolmasters
       " the trade," it was not                                     It was then
and                                   published till 1797.
received      with  as  much    favour   as  its predecessor;       and the two
volumes rapidly came to supersede           all other class-books for Greek
students.      Both volumes     passed   through    many editions,      and per
haps wanted nothing for permanent success and popularity, but that
the valuable information conveyed in the notes should have been
given    in English    instead of Latin, which the practice of the time
seemed     to require.

                                             514
     Dalzel married, in 1786, Anne, daughter of Dr John Drysdale,
the well known clerk of the General Assembly, and one of the
leaders of the Church.   His marriage connected him with the Adams,
Principal Robertson, the Kennedys of Dunure, the Broughams,
Elliots of Minto, and the rest of that remarkable group of Edin
burgh     families.     His professorial position brought him into inti
mate acquaintance with the philosophers and scholars who then made
our University famous.                His labours in publishing books for                        his
class, connected him with             many distinguished           scholars     ;   and a good
deal of his correspondence is preserved and used                          for this Memoir.
It   embraces letters from Heyne,                  Bottigcr, Porson, Parr,              Bishop
Burgess,    Dr    Raine of the Charterhouse, Tate, the excellent master
of Richmond        school, Thomas Young, the scientific philosopher and
universal scholar.
     The Memoir       has   frequent notices of the commencement and pro
gress of the University               buildings,    and other        academic matters;
including       the first Symposium Academicum,                    the death and char
acter of Principal Robertson,               the commencement of the Society of
Antiquaries, and in connection with                 it,   the foundation of the Royal
Society, of which Dalzel was an original and active member.                                      It
notices also some passing events             ;   such as visits of remarkable per
sons to    Edinburgh, the impression             made      by   Burke,    by   Burns,    by   Mrs
Siddons, &c.
     But the chief object of          the   Memoir,       as   of Dalzel's whole         life,    is
the restoration of Greek and classical education in Scotland.                                 The
writer gives his      reasons    for preferring       a    classical discipline to either
a    purely metaphysical or          a   merely physical course of education,                 for
merly and now preferred among us.
     Dalzel's character         was      singularly amiable.             Living in      factious
and contentious times,          in    a society not always peaceful, he courage
ously avoided all quarrels, and gave his whole energy to his duty.
In    society and his family he was equally fortunate and beloved                        ;    and
his life   is   an example of happiness uninterrupted,                    arising from        suc
cessful devotion of talents to a worthy object.                          Dalzel     died on      the
8th December 1806.

   1.   Note on the Phosphorescence of Beroe.                      By Professor
                                        Allman.
   The author       stated,    as the results of some       experiments which      he
had made       on the phosphorescence of a species               of Beroe (Idyui)
which abounded        during     the last summer in the       Firth of Forth,    that
the light is never emitted as long as the animal is exposed to day
light  ;  and that withdrawal           from the daylight       for  some    time is
necessary, in order to impart             to  the Beroe    the property     of phos
phorescence.
   A  glass jar, containing several living specimens of the Beroe in              sea
water, was removed from the daylight                into a dark room, when        not
the slightest indication        of phosphorescence could      be detected, though
the animals were subjected to             precisely the same kind of irritation
as is found to       be always followed        by the emission of light during
the night.       But after tho Beroes          had   remained    for about twenty
minutes in the dark, tho phosphurescence had become as vivid                    as by
night;     the slightest    irritation would call it forth, and the vibration
communicated to the           jar  by a blow on      the table where it lay, was

                                       519
sufficient to cause the emission of a vivid flash of beautiful greenish
light.
    The author    was aware that a source      of fallacy might exist in the
want of sensitiveness     in the  experimenter to faint luminous impres
sions, immediately after exposure of his own eyes to ordinary                day
light ; and accordingly no conclusion was arrived at as to the absence
of luminosity until the eye was rendered sufficiently sensitive by
confinement for some time in the dark room.
    The  absence,   then, of luminosity    in these animals during the day,
is not due alone to the phosphorescence being rendered invisible               by
the stronger daylight,      but to the fact that no light whatever is at
 that time emitted by the animal.
    The author    also stated that tho embryo, while      still included within
the egg, is eminently phosphorescent, and that the emission of the
light is subject to exactly the same conditions as in the adult.               He
was of opinion that the ova and free embryos of the Beroe and other
 Ctenophora, are among the chief sources of the phosphorescence of
the sea in our latitudes — an opinion           which   finds support in the
immense number of ova produced by these monoecious animals, taken
 in connection with the countless multitudes of Ctenophora which at
 certain seasons of the year crowd the seas round our coasts.
 2.  Contributions      to our Knowledge         of the Structure and De
         velopment of the Beroidse.           By Professor Allman.
    In  this communication       the author gave the results of some         care
 ful observations and dissections       he had made     of   a species   of Berile
 (Idyia), obtained in abundance during the last summer in the Firth
 of Forth.
    In  the anatomy of the adult animal, several points were described
 which seem to have        been hitherto   either overlooked or imperfectly
 examined.     In    the digestive    system, the author        noticed the pre
 sence  of two richly ciliated membranous semi-elliptical            flaps, which
just before the stomach terminates in the narrow neck which leads
 into the bifurcating funnel, spring from its walls, and extend, by
 their free extremities, into the neck and commencement of the
 funnel.    The equivalents of these flaps will doubtless be found in
 the two lips noticed by Milne Edwards in a similar position in Beroe
 Forskalii ; and the author is of opinion that they are also the
    vol. iv.                                                          *  A

Edwards,     in the stomach of Lesueuria vitrea.              He   also  described
the peculiar rod-like       cilia noticed by Agassiz, as extending over
the whole of the inner surface of the stomach, but which the author
finds, in the specimens examined by him, to be confined to a broad
band commencing just within the mouth, the remainder of the
stomach walls        being covered with ordinary         cilia, which are very
minute     except on the contracted neck, where they become long and
powerful.      Peculiar enigmatical bodies were described as being pre
sent in the    walls of the ramified caeca which spring from the meri
dional canals.       They are in the form of minute cushion-like               discs,
 which are prominent upon the external surface of the caecal tubes.
 The disc   is depressed in the centre, and from this depression a             little
conical elevation projects into the surrounding tissue of the animal.
 The  caecal tubes are also    partially invested by a peculiar layer which
 extends over irregular spaces of their walls.              This layer has been
 regarded as an extension of the ovary, but the author views it as an
 entirely independent structure.         It is composed      of minute cells, and
 may possibly be an eliminating organ.
     A highly-developed     system of capillary tubes was described in detail,
 as constituting     one of  the most interesting      features in the structure
 of Bertie.     These tubes seem to have been noticed            by  Gegenbaur,*
 who describes a network formed by the anastomosing offsets of cells,
 and which, in very young individuals,         represents a system of repeat
 edly anastomosing tubes.          They  seem to constitute the same struc
 ture   as   that which Agassiz at one timef described as muscular
 fibres in Cydippe— an opinion, however, which he subsequently re
 tracts, preferring, in his latest works,f to regard them as merely the
 optical expression of the walls of very large cells.            The author has
 no hesitation     in maintaining     that   these   are   all delicate   capillary
 tubes, but without true anastomosis.             They are divisible into four
 sets, differing   from one another in their deeper or more superficial
 position, and in the general direction of their course.               He believes
 that they may be conveniently         divided into the following sets       : —

        1. Longitudinal.                             3. Deep circular.
        2. Superficial circular.                     4. Gastro-parietal.
 In the gastro-parietal       set, especially, which        extend from   the walls
 of the stomach towards        the external      surface of the body, he had no
difficulty   in demonstrating a true tubular structure.               Under stimu
lation   they    contract   longitudinally,       and become      thickened   trans
 versely  ;  and then they are plainly seen to be thick-walled                tubes,
whose cavity encloses        a granular       matter.      The tubules composing
the other three sets seem to be also contractile, though this property
 is not so apparent in them as in the gastro-parietal set.                  All the
four sets depolarise light, and present a similar appearance under
 the polariscope.
    To the two oval ciliated       spaces,    situated one at either side of the
ocellus, the author gave the name of tentacular discs.                 The margin
of  each disc is marked by a double line, on whose interval is borne
a series    of short hollow tentacular         processes,   simple in young speci
 mens, but irregularly lobed or ramified in adults, covered over their
 whole surface with fine actively-vibrating           cilia, and containing  nume
rous pigment cells in their walls.            The double line marks the boun
dary of a canal which runs round the disc upon its deep surface, and
into which the bases of the tentacles open, the canal ceasing to be
continuous      at the inner extremity of the major axis               of the disc,
where there is a short space destitute of tentacles.             The author main
tains that the cavity of the tentacles, and their common basal canal,
communicate, through the bifurcations of the funnel, with the general
gastro-vascular     system.
    Eight chord-like organs       have been noticed by observers, and have
been described      in detail   by Agassiz       as extending from beneath       the
ocelliform     body to the extremities          of the eight meridional bands       ;
but the fact has not been hitherto noticed, that where they lie upon
the cushion-like     body which supports the sense capsule, they coalesce
two and two, so as here to be but four in number.                These four chords
are clothed with true vibratile cilia.            The author also described two
additional     chords, which     originate     also  beneath the ocellus, one at
each side, exactly opposite to the tentacular discs, and thence running
outwards      without   dividing,    lose   themselves in the dibcs.         These,
like the former, are clothed with vibratile cilia.              The true origin of
the chords     he believes to be       in  a ganglion-like tubercle which lies
immediately under the sense         capsule, and between it and the cushion

                                            522
like body.         Contrary   to the opinion        of Agassiz, the author             regards
these chords as       truly representing a nervous system.
   The author described four spherical tubercles, situated two upon
each side of the cushion-like  body, and between it and the ten-
t icular discs.       These are the equivalents of exactly similar tubercles
described by Agassiz          in Cydippe,          but not noticed by him in his
di scription    of Idyia.
                                    Development.
     In his account of the development of Beroe, the author described
the ovum, after its escape from the surrounding water, as consisting
of   a spherical      vitellus, surrounded         by an external transparent               and
structureless      shell, which is separated by a wide interval from the
vitellus,   the whole being at this time generally surrounded by an
atmosphere of spermatozoa, which are in the form of very minute
caudate corpuscles.
     No trace of germinal      or spot could
                                  vesicle                             be detected       in the
vitellus, which has the appearance of being                          composed       of minute
cells, and whose peripheral portion                is differentiated          as a somewhat
denser layer.         A   few hours after the escape of the ovum segmenta
tion begins, and this process goes on until the vitellus is broken up
into numerous very distinct and quite free spherules, each of which
is   plainly   a cell filled with    a multitude of similar cells.                    The   seg
menting process, however, has not been going on uniformly in all the
divisions, and these resulting spherules are consequently of unequal
size, and represent different stages in the process.                       Next, successive
segmentations go on with great               activity in some of the spherules,
while others continue unaffected by                it,   or present      it   with much less
energy, and the former become broken up into                         a   multitude of cells,
by which the latter are gradually enveloped                    ;   so that the ovum now
presents two very distinct portions — a central one composed                           of large
spherical cells, and a peripheral one of much smaller cells.
     Simultaneously       with   the completion           of   the    peripheral      layer,   a
large lacuna     is   formed among the cells in the centre of the ovum.                        A
depression — the       future mouth — next takes place upon the surface of
the embryo     ;   and this becomes deeper and deeper, until                   it   reaches the
central lacuna, into which          it   finally   opens.       At    the same time, the
ocelliform body, with its capsule, and the rudiments of the tentacular
discs, become apparent.          The refractile corpuscles of which the ocelli-

                                            523
form body is composed,      may at this time be             plainly     seen to be devel
oped in the   interior of delicate spherical cells. The eight meridional
bands     have also by this time made their appearance, and may be
seen  in four pairs extending from within a short distance of the
ocellus, along the sides of the embryo to about one-fourth of the
whole distance from the ocellus to the mouth.
   The next     stage observed is the differentiation              of   a portion   of the
large-celled    tissue which constitutes the principal                  substance   of the
embryo, into two somewhat piriform                masses,    extending one on either
side of the alimentary      cavity, and which, simultaneously                  with their
formation, become        excavated by an extension             of the large central
lacuna.      They thus form two large              sacs appended          to the central
lacuna, and opening into        it,      and are to become the deep longitudinal
gastro-vascular canals.
   Nearly at     the same time, two other exactly                  similar    masses, and
also containing     an extension of the central             lacuna, are found oppo
site to one another, on the two               remaining sides        of the alimentary
cavity, so that this cavity         is   now surrounded      by    four sacs.
   The two last-formed      sacs now become             divided, each        into two, and
the divisions     thus produced become             more and more widely sepa
rated from one another, and become                 superficial to the first formed
sacs.     We   now find them in contact           with the peripheral layer of the
embryo, where each sac corresponds to the space occupied by a pair
of meridional bands and the interval between                 them.
   Lastly, These four      sacs begin to divide, each into                 two, from the
peripheral     towards the central side, leaving one half adhering by its
peripheral     side to each meridional         band, so that every band has now
a sac to itself, and the subsequent conversion                of    these sacs into    the
eight meridional canals        is   easily understood.
   About the         time the central lacuna has sent off its two
                  same
branches, which are to open by external orifices at each side of the
ocelliform body   ;   but the author had not succeeded in satisfactorily
tracing the formation of these branches.
   Hitherto the embryo          was       confined within the shell, but in the
next stage described, the young Berde was free.                      It   was about one-
eighth of an inch in length         ;     the meridional     bands had extended to
somewhat more than half the distance between                       the ocellus and the
mouth.       The mouth was surrounded              by   the circular canal, and the
two deep     gastro-vascular        canals had     opened     into the latter.        The

                                                 524
circular canal probably originates in lateral branches from the distal
extremity of the deep gastro-vascular canal ; but the author failed
in satisfactorily        tracing its    mode         of development.            Four out of         the
eight super6cial gastro-vascular                 or ctenophoral canals, namely those
which corresponded to the narrow sides of the digestive cavity, had
also opened into the circular canal                   ;   but the other four meridional
canals, though extending               for some distance beyond the oral extre
mities of the meridional               bands, had           not yet opened            into    it,   and
terminated           towards the mouth,              each   in   a   blind     extremity.           The
eight meridional          canals had begun to send out their caecal offsets                           ;
but these were as yet few in number,                         and simple.          Individuals of
about three-fourthsof an inch in length had all the gastro-vascular
canals in communication with the circular canal.    The caeca had
become numerous            and ramified,             and the capillary tubes appeared
fully developed.     The meridional bands, however, had                                      not    yet
attained their full extent, their oral termination being still                          separated
from the mouth           by   a   distance equal to about one-third of the entire
meridional length          of the animal         ;    while the generative organs had
not yet made their appearance, and the processes of the tentacular
discs were nearly simple.

the two families of Firolidae, and Atlantidae                         as unsatisfactory,           and
arranges them in three families, according to the following zoologi

   After describing the several characters of the order                            as regards
external     configuration,      eyes, and       auditory        sacs,   the author       called
attention to the rachidian teeth as being capable of furnishing                            good
generic     characters, for which          they are especially valuable, as they
often outlive the decay of the soft parts.
  To avoid undue extension of his paper, the author selected for
special description the genera Firoloides and Atlanta, which occupy,
according      to his views, the two extremes of the group;                       and he de
scribed in detail, and illustrated by coloured drawings, the anatomy
of a species     of Firoloides which             he had met        with in Bass's Strait,
and the anatomy of Atlanta, with reference to all the species of
the genus, adding to these some observations on the other genera,
and deferring questions of specific determination to a future paper.
4. On the Structure of C'hondracanthus Lophii ; with Obser
  vations on its Larval Form.    By William Turner, M.B.,
  and H. S. Wilson, M.D., Demonstrators of Anatomy.
  The authors, after       a brief historical introduction, proceeded to give
a detailed     account of the anatomy of this parasitic crustacean, the
description comprising           that of the female and male, and, so far as
they had been enabled to trace             it,   of the larva also.
  FeMALE.      — Average         length,   £     inch   ;   breadth,     Jth inch — divided
into cephalic,       thoracic,     and abdominal                portions.      Cephalic    part
presented on each side a lateral process                    ;   at the anterior margin        a

                                           526
 pair of   antennse   ;  and on     the ventral aspect a pair of hook organs
 and three pairs of foot-jaws.             The  antennae      were      segmented, the
 terminal    segments being provided           with hairs.       Each hook       organ
 consisted of a basal segment and a terminal hook                    ;   the former of
 which was supported on a well-marked                triangular frame, on which
 it was   moved     by the action of powerful          muscles.        The foot jaws,
 attached a little on one         side of the mesial line, consisted of three
 pairs.    The first and       second   foot-jaws    consisted each of two seg
 ments.     The terminal        segment in the first       foot-jaw was formed of
 two chitinic    plates, connected by their anterior            margins, but sepa
 rated at their posterior margins, which were armed with teeth.                    The
 corresponding     segment in the second           foot-jaw     consisted of bat a
 single plate, toothed along its posterior            margin.       The third foot-
jaw had three      segments,     the terminal one being destitute of teeth.
    The cephalic     was separated from the thoracic         part by a constricted
 neck.
     The thoracic part       was characterised by its processes,          seven dorsal,
 two ventral,     and   five lateral, the cavities        within   which     communi
cated     with the general cavity of the thorax.                   Its division into
 four segments was indicated by constrictions.                The first and second
 segments bore each a pair of feet on their ventral aspects.
    The abdominal part, very small, was divided into two segments,
 the anterior of which presented a pair of nipple-like projections, to
 one of which the male was attached.              Of these the authors gave a
 minute description.          Two genital orifices opened, one on each side
 of this segment.        From each orifice a long string of ova, spirally
 tw isted, depended.         The ovaries consisted of a branched system of
 tubes, occupying the cavity of the thorax, and extending into the
 processes   and feet.       Each ovary communicated close to               the genital
 orifice with the cement organ.            The alimentary       canal, axially situ
 ated, commenced at the oral aperture, which was situated immedi
 ately in front      of the first     pair   of foot-jaws.       It    reached almost

 Divided into cephalic, thoracic, and abdominal parts — cephalic end
 broadest and largest      ;  furnished with antennae, hook organs, and foot-
jaws.      By its hook organs it was attached            to one   of the nipple-like
projections     on   the body of the female,          on which      it was    parasitic.

female.     Thoracic       part distinctly divided into four segments, the
two anterior bearing each a pair of feet.                  No dorsal, ventral, or
lateral  processes.        Abdominal part divided into two               segments,  in
the proximal       of which the two male genital orifices were situated.
Alimentary canal in the axis of the animal, with                  a mouth situated

formation     of   a  free   larva, were    then described      ;  but the further
stages, up to the      fully   developed   animal, the author         had no oppor
 tunity of tracing.

1.    Investigation of an Expression for the Mean Temperature
    of a Stratum of Soil, in terms of the time of year. By J. D.
    Everett, M.A., Prof, of Mathematics, &c. in King's College,
    Windsor, Nova Scotia.           Communicated by Prof. Tait.
    In vol. xxii. of  the Transactions    of the Society, Prof. W. Thom
son has given (after     Fourier) the general solution of the problem of
underground conduction, and he and Professor Everett have given
methods more or less accurate of determining from observation the
specific constants for any locality.      These are mainly applied to the
results    of Principal Forbes's observations         on the Calton    Hill   and
other places near Edinburgh.         (Trans., vol. xvi.)
    The present paper has for its object the calculation of the mean
temperature of a given stratum of soil at any given time.                If  v be
the temperature at time t, at depth x, v is known by the paper first
referred to, in terms of x and t— and the object of the present paper
is the    easy approximate    calculation   of the value of the quantity
fvdx
 -fj— between any limits of depth x.        The method        is applied   to the
 Calton   Hill observations.
   2.   Notice of the Catadioptric Altitude and Azimuth Circle.
                          By Edward Sang, Esq.
    This little instrument differs from      the     ordinary  theodolite in the
 means    by which the direction     of the object under examination             is
indicated.
    The simplest contrivance for marking the direction of a distant
 object is a straight rod.    This, with the very obvious improvement
 of studs    at the  ends,   was  the only      instrument     available   to the
 ancients for astronomical     observations   ;   it is yet employed in      gun
nery, and even by surveyors in the plain-table            and cross-staff.
    The objection     to  the plain-sight, when it is to be applied             to

                                                  529
 accurate       purposes, is that the eye cannot be adapted                               to distinct
 vision for three different               distances at the same                time.     We cannot
 see the notch, the vis4, and the object aimed at, all distinctly.
     The invention of the               telescope    effected      a complete change in the
 apparatus for the precise measurement of angles.                              By it the arrange
 ment of the plain-sight            was reversed ; the eye-hole was expanded to
 admit the object-glass, and the image was received at the plane of
 the cross-wires.
     These two are the only improvements which have hitherto been
 made    in    the art     of pointing.          Hadley's quadrant, the invention of
 which has almost created nautical                        astronomy, is a contrivance for
indicating      the   difference between             the directions of two objects               ;   it
does not show the direction of either.
   The pointer used in the catadioptric theodolite is thus the third
of its class ; it contains, literally within the compass of a nut-shell,
the means of determining the direction                        of    an    object true to within
half   a minute       of   a degree.
     About the years 1815, 1816, the late Rev. Edward Irving gave
to    his class of young geometers as an exercise, " To construct
graduated squares            with       plummets     attached, by help of which                  the
tangents of angles of elevation may be observed."                                Some of     us used
pasteboard, some            wood    ;    and it happened that, having broken my
school     slate, which was a thick one, the idea came                           into my head to
make my square out of the larger fragment.                                 Armed with          these
little instruments, we attacked and carried most of the surrounding
heights.     The weather-cock on the top of the church steeple was, as
a matter of course, one of our targets.   On bringing the upper edge
of my slate-square to bear upon                     it,   that upper edge having been
ground flat and pretty well smoothed,                     I   saw the          inverted image of
the weather-cock.             It   then occurred to me that,               if  I   could bring the
image to agree with the weather-cock                        itself, the plane of the upper
edge would be accurately pointed.                    At     the same time          it   was obvious
that when the plane passed                     through     the object there could be no
reflection.
     Here, then, was        a   problem
                                               " To obtain      a   reflection         such that the
reflected can be collated with the direct image, and afford a test of
accurate pointing."   The pointer used in the catadioptric theodolite
exhibits   a   complete solution          of   this problem.         It   is
                                                                           a    piece of glass cut
in the form of an isosceles tetrahedron, of which                              two faces form an

                                       530
 edge   of about 90°, the other two an         edge   of about 126°, the one
 pair being   set symmetrically    upon the other.       This pointer has    been
 patented.     On turning it towards any object, and looking into the
glass, we perceive an inverted image of the object, and on bringing
 the eye to look past the edge of the glass, as when using the camera
 lucida,   we see the object also    ;  and  so  can   collate the image with
the object.
    By   means   of the motions in altitude and azimuth           we can cause
the image to agree with        the object, and are then certain that the
line of direction passes through the object.
    I  do   not wish to occupy the time of the Society with a disqui
sition on the theory of the pointer, but rather to indicate the peculiar
facilities which it gives for astronomical and geodetical operations in
which a precision to half a minute is sufficient.            The instrument      is
inapplicable whenever greater nicety than this is requisite.
    When     we point the telescope    of a common surveying theodolite to
a star, we    find that the cross- wires have        disappeared in the dark
ness, and that it is necessary      to render the wires visible      by making
an artificial twilight within the tube.          To hold the lamp for this
purpose is so troublesome, unless         — as  in the case of large instru
ments — a special arrangement           be made, that      very few surveyors
indeed    ever use their theodolites for sidereal observations.
    But, by using the crystal pointer, the star itself is       made the point
of reference, and the illuminating apparatus          is unneeded.
    If  we bring the catadioptric      theodolite into such a position as       to
cause the image      of  a star to agree with     the star seen directly,     and
leave    the instrument      untouched, the two bright points are            seen
slowly    to  separate  ;  while the star     moves    forward   in its diurnal
circuit the image     moves with the same velocity backwards, the rate
of separation is doubled, and the line joining the two points indicates
the direction     of the motion.      In this way it     is easy to determine
whether the star be ascending or descending,          or to judge of its being
at its greatest     or least altitude.      Thus the determination        of  the
latitude from the meridian        altitude of a star is very easy      ; that of
the sidereal time is not less so.
    We    have   to note   the exact instant at which       some   star, not far
from the prime vertical, has a known altitude.            For this purpose     we
turn the pointer a little in advance of the star, and bring the image
to be very nearly above or below the star, according as the observa

                                        531
tion is made on the east or              on    the west side of the meridian.
Then, counting the beats          of the chronometer,        we watch    until the
line joining the two become          horizontal, and thus obtain the instant
at which the star had the elevation shown on the altitude circle.
    It  is better, when making        this observation for time alone, to let
the image pass at a little distance — say two or three minutes — from
the    star, than to attempt to make them coincide, because the eye
can very readily judge        of the horizontality of the line joining the
two luminous points.          But the altitude azimuth and time can all
be obtained at once in the following            way : —
    Having brought about the coincidence,              we watch for one or two
minutes, and estimate carefully the direction of the separation, then,
by help    of the tangent-screws, we cause the image and the star to
exchange places, as it were, keeping the same inclination, and leaving
the instrument       untouched, we count the beats           of the chronometer
until   the coincidence take place.           In this way    we obtain   the time
and the simultaneous readings on the altitude              and azimuth circles    ;
from these the longitude and the direction              of the meridian    can be
computed.
    The direction     of the meridian        is very readily obtained from the
greatest easting or westing of a star which passes between the pole
and the zenith, particularly in low latitudes.              The manner of pro
ceeding    with  the  crystal pointer     is  to make   the  coincidence, to wait
a  little and  observe    the direction of separation      ;  when this direction
is vertical the star is at its greatest azimuth.
    Lastly, the latitude of the place may be corrected by observing
the two transits of a star over the prime vertical near to the zenith ;
the operation is exactly analogous to those already described.
    When the horizontal axis         is made     perpendicular to the meridian
the instrument      can    be used as a transit.       The instant of the sun's
passage     can be found by observing the contact         of the first limb, then
the entire coincidence, and lastly, the contact of the second                limb.
The average of these three may, in general, be depended upon to
within two seconds of time ; while, by observing the moon's meridian
passage, and comparing it with those of two stars, the Greenwich
time may be obtained to within               one  minute from a single set of
observations.
    The lightness     and   portability of the instrument,     and its adaptation
to near or distant      objects,  promise to bring the practice of geode

                                          532
  tical astronomy within the reach           of many who have been hindered
 from    the prosecution of this         branch     of  science   by the bulk and
 expensiveness of the instruments          required.
  3. On the      Nesting Birds of Linlithgowshire and Berwick
       shire.    By the Kev. John Duns, F.R.S.E., Torphichen.
     In April 1860,      I  brought under the notice of the Society a clas
 sified list of the Birds of Linlithgowshire.            The list was accompanied
 with notes,    " On the Structure and Habits of some of the Rarer
 Species."     After the publication of the Society's Proceedings, several
 communications      were addressed to me by well-known                ornithologists,
 chiefly with the view of ascertaining,           if  some    of  the   rarer   species
 named had been        known     to nest   in the district.        This led to the
 revision of the list, and to the exclusion          of such   species as are either
 rare visitors only, or winter birds of passage.              A List     of the Birds
 of Berwickshire,    drawn up on the same plan, is now associated with
 this.
     Were similar lists     to be drawn up by observers in other counties,
 the true native birds of Scotland would be better known                   than   they
 are at present.      In   most works       on   British     Ornithology they       are
classed with stragglers       from almost every clime.
     Several influences are at work, which may soon come to diminish
the numbers of our native           nesting-birds,      and which      have already
 reduced    them in certain districts.        In the Lowlands, there are           now
 large tracts of country, in which game is not protected, and in which
laws of trespass are never enforced.             It is thus easy for any youth
to carry a gun in quarters in which, a few years ago, he would have
been closely watched.         The rarer birds suffer       ; they are intruded       on
 in their favourite haunts, and either scared from them at the breeding
season,    or wantonly     destroyed.      The black grouse, which            used   to
breed regularly     in Linlithgowshire,       is now seldom seen, and the red
grouse is now confined to a heath-clad tract, of a few hundred acres,
which is being fast broken in upon by mining operations.                       In the
course of four or five years, both species will cease to be reckoned                 as
nesting-birds in the county.            The king- fisher,      the   ring-ousel,    the
redstart, the gold-crest wren,         the bullfinch       and goldfinch, have       so
greatly diminished      within    a few years, that       they are now compara
tively rare.

                                        533
    The strict preservation of game has had an influence in another
direction.      War is waged against every bird believed to be hurtful
to the eggs or to the young of the pheasant, partridge,                 and grouse.
The kite     has disappeared from       the    middle    and    south of Scotland.
In Berwickshire,      the hen harrier is now rare       ;  and in Linlithgowshire
it appears at long intervals        as a straggler      only.     The merlin will
soon cease to be met with in both           counties.      The sparrow-hawk        is
fast disappearing;      and even the kestrel — the farmer's friend against
field mice, and several beetles, whose larvse are most hurtful to his
wheat crops — is ignorantly shot down as a plunderer, though entirely
innocent touching game.           In comparatively recent times, the raven
used to nest in   Linlithgowshire.        It  is now never seen.        In Berwick
shire, it is rare.     In Linlithgowshire,        the  jay   is seldom    met with,
and even the magpie is not able to cope in cunning with the game
keeper.
    Agricultural improvements are also beginning to tell unfavour
ably on some of our native birds.                   If the alternative were, —
" You must either        lose the green and corn crops,             or destroy the
birds,"    I suppose   even the most enthusiastic         naturalist would choose
the latter.      But it should   be the chief       aim of the agriculturist      to
keep the birds alongside of his improvements.                   Since by drainage,
he   has banished the wild          duck,    the curlew,       and the snipe, from
localities    in which    they used to abound, he would find it profitable
to set apart a spot specially for them.             And   if  he must have    stone
walls and wire fences, in order to get quit of weeds and to save his
crops from insects which          find shelter during winter          in the hedge
rows, he would never regret having left a bush here and there for
the birds to build in.        If this  be not done, he       will assuredly find in
the turnip-beetles      and saw-flies, in the corn-midges and wire-worms
— the    larvae of weevils and elaters       —"     a great    people and strong,"
enemies, any thousand of which will do more harm to his crops than
all the birds of the air would.
    In the following list the birds of Linlithgowshire are referred
to on the left hand of the column.                  Those of Berwickshire are

    The letter    R  denotes   Regular, or birds which breed constantly
in the districts   ;  H   denotes Historical, or birds which used to breed
in the localities, but which have         for many years ceased to do so             ;
O   denotes    Occasional,   or birds which have been known to breed              at

seen occasionally at the breeding season,                   but whose       nests  have not
been discovered.

     A   pair of the grey shrikes named in the list, frequented some old
 thorn trees, near Torphichen village, during                  the end       of May and
 beginning of      June 1846.
     The red-backed shrikes were observed                 by me    in   July 1859,         at
 Oxendean, near Dunse Castle, Berwickshire.                     This,    I   believe,   was
the first time they have been             seen   in Scotland.          The red-backed
shrike      passes  the winter in Africa,          and visits      England in May.
 " It breeds," says Fleming, " in the southern counties of Eng
land." " It is," says the late Bishop of Norwich, " generally
 speaking,      very rare in    most parts,       conBning       itself   to   Essex,    the
 Sussex Downs, Wiltshire, and Gloucestershire."                     Mr    Selby has not
 traced it farther north than Cumberland.                   M. E. T. Bennet, in          one
 of his    notes to  White's Selborne,       refers to this bird           as   one which
 belongs to the south of England, and is scarcely                   ever met with in
the north.         In  1840,   Mr M'Gillivray          recorded that        " it had not
 hitherto been observed in Scotland."
       4.   Note on Molecular Arrangement                    in Crystals.          By
                                 Professor Tait.
     To illustrate my lectures on Molecular Forces, I sometimes use
piles of marbles of equal size. Each of these is taken to represent
the sphere      of action of  a symmetrical integrant molecule,               in the  sense
that the attractive         and  repulsive     forces      necessary to a theory of
molecules are balanced, when the distance of two molecules is equal
to the diameter of the sphere. If the integrant molecules be not
symmetrical, their spheres of action will be spheroids or ellipsoids.
     In arranging such piles, there are two obvious ways of construct
ing the layers, and two of applying layer               to layer.
     vol. iv.                                                                 4  c

                                           536
    Thus, a horizontal layer          (suppose)     may be arranged in square, or
in  triangular order; and         successive    layers may be simply superposed
or inserted into interstices in the preceding ones.
    By this it would appear, at first sight, that arrangements of four
different densities are producible.              Such, however, is not the case.
The very obvious results which               I   intend now           to give, must     have
occurred long ago to others, but            I  have found no such record              ;  and
their apparent novelty         to  scientific      friends to whom            I  have men
tioned them, must be my excuse for occupying the time of the So
ciety with so trifling a matter.
    The density of a mass, or the number of marbles per cubic mile
(say) is easily seen to be proportional inversely to the product of
the distances of the centres of contiguous ones, taken parallel to any
three rectangular lines.

or, '707    :  816  : 1 : 1, and        may be sought for in various forms of
the same body.
    Hence, the density in arrangements (3) and (4) is the same. It is
worthy of note, that the simplest crystalline form which is derivable
 from (3), is the octahedron of the first system, and that from (4),
is its hemihedral form, the regular tetrahedron.

    By inspecting the piles of marbles for the two             cases,   it is  easy to
see   without analysis, that the densities are equal.            This is best     seen
by removing an edge of the tetrahedral            pile.
    I  have tried to connect these results with allotropic forms of bodies
which crystallize in the first system (and an easy modification allows
us to pass to other systems) — but though diamond and graphite
seem    to agree so far with it — it must be taken at present as a pure
speculation.

1. On the Condition      of the Salmon Fisheries of England and
   Wales in 1861 ; with a Notice of some of the Modes of
   Fishing, especially those practised in the Severn and Wye.
    By Sir William Jardine, Bart., F.R.S., &c.
   The author proposed in this paper to give more detailed obser
vations on the salmon fisheries of England and Wales than could
be done in the compass of an official report, and at the same time
to add notes on the natural history of the migratory species of Sal-
monidse met with in these fisheries.     The first part related to the
Severn and Wye.
    No subject  has been more legislated upon than that     of the regu
lation of the salmon fisheries of Great Britain and Ireland ; and
while this indicates the importance attached to them, it has been at
the same time mainly caused by the want of a correct knowledge of
the facts relating to them, an ignorance of the habits and natural
economy of the species, and by parties looking at one or two insu
lated points only, instead of viewing the subject and the various in
terests connected with it as one.
    Independently   of the want of co-operation by the proprietors of
rivers, and the system of killing fish at all seasons of the year, weirs
put up for the purpose of driving machinery,     and to which fish-traps

were almost always attached, caused great injury and obstruction to
the run of salmon ; and the Severn had been specially injured by
the erection,  within   a few years,   of large weirs for navigation          pur
poses,  which not only prevented salmon running freely,                 but com
pletely prevented access to flounders and all the smaller              migratory
fish which ascended for the purpose of spawning           ;  such as shad, lam
prey, lampern,     &c. &c.     These all yielded a considerable           revenue
and food for the population, and were taken 100 miles above tide
way.     They are all now entirely shut out.
    The Severn and Wye       have been for a long period,           and still con
tinue to be, fished by peculiar        engines, which,       in all probability,
may soon be entirely done away with, or be            much modified in struc
ture  ; a record of these is therefore interesting.           Those used in the
Severn    are putts    and putchers,      or   trumpets,     as   the  latter  are
termed from their shape       ;  and they form in that river by far the
most extensive      salmon-fishery    by means of fixed          engines in any
part of the English or Welsh waters.
    Putchers or trumpets are long, conical, wicker-work              baskets with
a mouth two feet wide, gradually narrowing,           and ending in an open
ing so small   as to prevent a fish      of moderate size passing through.
This, indeed,   is frequently   abused,    and some are made so small            as
to take fish   of two pounds weight.           The stake or framework for
these engines is about thirteen        or fourteen     feet   high, and is fixed
into the shore in two parallel        rows of various       lengths from high-
water mark seaward.         These   are bound together by cross bars, on
 which rest the putchers, placed one above another in rows, with the
 wide mouth up or down stream, as they are intended to catch fish
upon the ebb or flow of the tide.              The greatest number         are  set
 with the mouth up the river, or        to the stream     ;  the salmon falling
down with     the current     enter   the large     mouth,     and are literally
jammed in the narrow end, which admits the head only, and holds
the fish secure.      They are thus often much injured, and              rendered
 unseemly for the market         by the scales      being    rubbed    off in the
 struggles to escape, and no unclean,           unseasonable,     or old fish that
 enters can again escape or be let out alive.          The tide in the Severn
 rises to a great perpendicular       height,    often exceeding twenty feet
 above the top    of the putcher    stages   ;  and it is considered that com
 paratively few salmon are taken during the flow, the fish swimming
 near the surface, and above the mouths of the putchers, as soon as

                                         541
  the tide rises a few feet above them.          Most fish are taken in the
  ebb, or in the putchers with their mouths           set up the river,    proving
  without doubt that a large number of fish           ascend so   far and return
 again without ever entering the fresh-water part of the river.
     The putts or putt-nets, as they are sometimes called, are placed
 on the same kind of stages.           They are also formed of wicker or
 basket work,     but are more complicated,          and the wicker        work is
 closer, and executed with       more care.      The whole machine is about
 twelve feet long, and consists of three parts,          which can be attached
 to each other as occasion         requires  — the   kipe, butt, fore-wheel or
 biddle.    The diameter of the chief part, or kipe,           is about five feet
 at the mouth, and fourteen inches at the lower or narrow end.                 The
 butt is fourteen inches wide at       the   neck and    six at the lower      end.
 These take large fish by having cross-bars placed in the narrow end               ;
 and to this can be affixed at       will the third part, the forewheel          or
 biddle, constructed somewhat like a mouse-trap inside, and                used for
 taking everything small — shrimps, small soles, young cod, flounders,
 eels, lamperns, &c.       In one taken off a few days before, we found
 shrimps, a small eel, and a rock pipit        ; in fact, nothing      that enteis
 the   large,   open,   five-feet-wide     mouth    escapes   when      this fore-
 wheel is kept attached.         The putt-net     is extremely destructive       to
 all young fish, and in spring, when the salmon fry descend, they
 are taken in hundreds.         The fishermen, however, say that they now
remove the fore-wheel          during   the fry season,    and    it is the river
conservator's duty to see that this is attended to.
     The Wye is     a very fine    stream,   and has also had many perse
cutions.      There   are, however,      no  navigation    weirs or other for
midable obstructions       within the first twenty or twenty-five miles of
its course from the sea.        One great abuse in this river is the re
cognised killing of the skirling, which is the young of the salmon,
the   parr of Scotch rivers.         They are killed in thousands, and are
hawked about the country for sale, and purchased by the gentry as well
as by the labouring classes.        Tourists  come to Monmouth         to eat skir
ling.     Monmouth is in fact the Woolwich of the Wye ; skirling its
whitebait.      The history and present position of the parr question is
                                              " Any one who will insist now
given here, and is thus summed up.
that a parr is not a young salmon, must have some warp in his in
tellect, not to be removed by any possible demonstration."
    In  the Wye, coracle nets are much used            ; but the peculiar mode

                                          542
 of fishing in the Wye, Usk, and that               system   of rivers, is   called
 stopping, or stop-net fishing.
     At the commencement of the            ebb or flow of the tide, a large boat
 is moored by anchor, and fixed by long sharpened iron-shod                   poles
 in what is supposed, or rather by experience is known to be, the
 " run of the fish." A large bag net, on a frame of from 25 to 35
 feet beam, capable      of being easily raised by the fishermen employed,
 is let out upon the side        next the ebb or flow, so that the bag is
 carried out by the tide underneath the boat.              The fisherman, with
 one arm, leans on the angle          of the frame ready to act, and has        the
 loop of a cord attached to the bag of the net round a finger of                the
 other hand.      The slightest interference with the net is felt by            the
 looped finger,    and when a salmon strikes the net is quickly raised,
 and the fish secured in the bag.              At  suitable states of the tide,
 numerous boats may be seen going out prepared to                  "  stop,
                                                                            "  and
ply their precarious fishing.           The stations are taken up by turns,
some    being considered more certain than others, to allow the men
an equal chance      ;  for  these  fishings    are generally sublet, the lessee
of the fishery sometimes supplying            boats and nets,   paying the men
according     to the quantity of fish taken, or a certain           agreed upon
proportion     of the price.         It  is  a mode    of fishing, however, far
behind     the present      time   and invention,     and the boats and nets
necessary for      it must require very considerable capital.               It   is,
 moreover, uncertain, and occupies a large portion of time compared
with the quantity of fish taken. There is nothing particularly in
jurious to the fisheries in the use of these engines if fairly employed,
 and any unseasonable or old fish may be easily set at liberty un
injured   ;  at the same time, several boats are sometimes set in line,
 and then they form greater barriers to a clear run ; but as it is
 only for a few hours at the flow of the tide, or after it has partially
 ebbed, that this kind of fishing          can be practised, it can scarcely be
 looked upon as a serious obstruction.
    2.  Cases of Poisoning by Goat's              Milk. By Alexander E.
        Mackay, M.D., Surgeon H.M.S. " Marlborough."
    On   27th     November        1861,    eleven   wardroom    officers  of   the
" Marlborough,"                    the author, were simultaneously attacked
                       including
 with   extreme     faintness,    nausea, bilious vomiting, and diarrhoea;

                                       543
the attacks lasting five or six hours        — in   some of the cases being         of
great severity, and attended with much depression.                 The treatment,
which was successful in every instance, consisted in encouraging free
vomiting, and the administration          of stimulants      and anodynes.         At
the same time a series of similar cases          occurred in H.M.S.          "  Aga
memnon," and five other ships in the harbour.                 The only article of
food which had been taken        by  all   those who were affected was            the
milk   used at breakfast, and to this the poisoning was evidently to be
ascribed.     On inquiry amongst Maltese of all classes the author found
that there is a plant known in Malta by the name of Tenhuta which
is eagerly eaten by the goats, from which animals almost all the milk
used by the shipping is procured, and which communicates to their
milk   nauseous   properties.    This proved       to be  Euphorbia Paralias,
the common sea spurge         ; and its property of rendering            the goat's
milk poisonous is     so well known, that the goats,         from which      milk    is
to be got for supplying families and public institutions             in Malta, are
never allowed to feed at large where they can have access                     to the
Euphorbia.       It  was stated to the author that         the Maltese milkmen
know perfectly well when a goat has eaten                the Tenhuta      from the
appearance of the milk, which,        if  poured into the hollow of the hand
and spread out by the finger, shows yellowish                 streaks through       it.
 A   somewhat puzzling circumstance was, that all the officers who
partook of the milk did not suffer, and one gentleman escaped with
 out any seizure who had        drunk     a whole bottle       of milk.     On the
 other hand, of the patients        in the sick bay only one was seized,
 and this was a     man who had procured some milk for himself from
 shore     and one alarmingly severe case, which occurred in the
                                                                             "
        ;                                                                       Aga
 memnon,"     was   in the person of a gentleman who had breakfasted
 entirely on milk.      The author       suggests,   as an explanation         of the
immunity of some and the severe seizures of others of the con
sumers of the milk, that if the poisonous property reside in the
above     mentioned    yellowish  streaks, which       seem      readily  separable
from the bulk of the milk, the unequal distribution               of the  poisonous
 matter    may account for the violent symptoms in one, the milder
seizures in    a  second,   and the total absence         of all symptoms in          a
third.

3.    Note     on   the   Electricity    developed during Evaporation
      and during Effervescence             from Chemical Action.              By
      Professor     Tait and     J. A. Wanklyn, Esq.
    One     of Professor     W. Thomson's        Divided-Ring Electrometers
having been recently procured for the Natural Philosophy collection
in the University, we have made use of it in repeating and extend
ing the experiments          of Volta, Pouillet, and others,       on  the elec
tricity produced during the evaporation of various bodies. In some
cases our results agree with those already known, but in others we
find effects    differing   totally in kind   or degree from      the accepted
ones   ;  and with some      substances we    find occasionally contradictory
indications among our own results.
    The Electrometer       is in every respect a    far superior instrument to
the gold-leaf electroscope, which (sometimes with the addition of a
condenser) was used by former experimenters, and enables us to give
our results in a form easily reducible to absolute measure.                  The
charge of the instrument          was  such that, when the half rings were
respectively      connected     with the zinc     and   platinum    of a single
Grove's     cell, the deflection     observed amounted to about 5-8 scale
divisions.      This  was found to be the most useful charge for the bulk
of our experiments, but it was easily increased twenty or thirty fold
when we sought to verify any very delicate indications.
    Our apparatus consisted of a platinum dish, placed on an in
sulating     stand,   and connected with        the insulated   half ring.      A
lamp could be placed on the stand so as to heat the dish;             and while
this was going on the indications of the electrometer gave us the
atmospheric charge.          The experiments were all conducted when the
latter was very small, so that although the sputtering             of the  fluids
dropped on the hot plate may have prevented us from observing some
slight effects, the large deflections we observed in many instances can
have nothing       to do with the electric     state  of the air of the   room.
With     a different disposition,    which enabled us to use a Bunsen lamp
to heat the dish, we obtained the atmospheric potential              by burning
 a  little ether or alcohol       on  the dish itself,   when the lamp was
removed.
    We agree generally with previous experimenters, that during the
continuance of the spheroidal state, there is little, if any, perceptible

                                         545
disengagement of electricity.          We also agree with the statement
that the main effect is produced while the fizzing sound that accom
panies the loss of the spheroidal state is heard, and that during the
continuance of the mechanical action to which that sound is due, the
indications of the electrometer in general              steadily increase.       That
the greater part of the electricity produced is due to friction is proved
by the fact that, when fluids are forcibly squirted upon the hot                 dish,
the electrical     indications are very much increased, and that a con
cave surface gives      far  more   powerful deflections than a convex one
at the same temperature.           The sputtering or violent boiling which
succeeds     the fizzing    state, shows little, if any, disengagement of
electricity.     The principal     interest of the results         which we       have
obtained      is in the cases of iodine,           bromine,    and various       other
bodies which do not seem to have been beforo examined.                     We have
 as yet met      with no discordance in our own results            as far as simple
 bodies are concerned.
    In  giving the following numbers, we have not attempted any cor
 rection for the loss of electricity which           is caused by the high tem
 perature of the platinum dish.

   The sulphate of copper solution is by far the most remarkable
that we have tried.           The smallest globule, on leaving the spheroidal
state,   gave    intense effects,         sending        the lamp        image entirely         off
the scale.
   We     have    also   commenced a set of experiments                        with a view to
test the electricity developed during the brisk disengagement of a
gas by chemical action, which was discovered eighty years ago by Volta.
In  some    of  these experiments           it  was observed that when the gases
were disengaged with considerable                    effervescence, and in a mass of
large bubbles foaming over the platinum crucible                           in which the        ex
periment      was conducted, the bursting               of  each bubble was attended by
a simultaneous increase of deflection in the electrometer.                           These ex
periments are, as yet, exceedingly imperfect, but they seem, like the
preceding, to indicate friction as a main cause of the observed results.
The    effects on the electrometer             are    by no means so uniform, either
as to  kind or quantity of electricity,              as those given by evaporation.

1.    On the Pressure Cavities              in Topaz, Beryl, and Diamond,
    and their bearing on Geological Theories.                        By Sir David
    Brewster,        K.H.
     In   this paper the author gave a brief account of the various phe
nomena of fluid and gaseous                cavities which    he   had discovered in
diamond, topaz, beryl, and other minerals.                He described —
     1.   Cavities    with two immiscible fluids, the most expansible of
 which has received the name of Brewstolync, and the most dense
 that of Cryptolyne,        from the American and French mineralogists.
     2.    Cavities containing only one of these fluids.
     3. Cavities containing         the two fluids, and also crystals of various
 primitive forms,        some    of which melt by heat and recrystallise           in
 cooling.
     4. Cavities containing gas and vapour.
     The author stated that the first            class of cavities existed in   thou
 sands, forming strata plane and curved, and intersecting one another
 at various angles, but having no relation to the primitive and second
  ary planes of the crystal.           From these facts he drew the conclusion
 that the minerals which contained them were of igneous origin                  ; and
  he considered this conclusion             as demonstrated      by the existence of
  what he calls pressure cavities, which are never found in crystals
  of aqueous origin.         These microscopic cavities, which are numerous
 in diamond, exist         also  in topaz and beryl.          The    gas which filled

                                       549
  them had compressed      by its elastic force the substance of the mine
  ral around the cavities, as shown by four sectors or quadrants                of
  light which it polarises    ;  and consequently the mineral       must have
  been in a soft or plastic   state by fusion when      it thus yielded   to the
  pressure of the included gas.
  2. On the      Anatomical Relations of the Surfaces of the Ten
      torium to the Cerebrum and Cerebellum in Man and the
      lower Mammals.             By William Turner, M.B. (Lond.),
      Senior Demonstrator of Anatomy in the University of
      Edinburgh.
      Comparative anatomists have       of late directed considerable atten
 tion to the determination of the relations of the cerebrum and cere
 bellum.      This has  been   in great measure due to the publication by
 Professor     Owen of a     system of classification      of the Mammalia
 founded on their cerebral characters.         The statement     made by that
 eminent anatomist, that the posterior, or third, lobe of the cerebrum
 is peculiar    and common to the genus       Homo, and that equally pecu
 liar   are the    "posterior horn of the lateral ventricle" and the
 " hippo-campus minor,"       which characterise the hind lobe, has led to
 much discussion.       Various anatomists have published descriptions
 and drawings of dissections of the brains of many of the Quadru-
 mana, especially of several of the higher apes.           From these dissec
tions, as well      as from    the older observations of Tiedemann            and
 Cuvier, it may now      be considered as    fully proven, that in the Quad-
 rumana the surface of the cerebellum corresponding to the superior
 surface of the human cerebellum is covered by the cerebrum               ;  that
posterior    lobes, posterior   cornua and hippocampi minores, are pos
sessed by these animals.*
     In  the mammalia lower in the scale than the Quadrumana,              it ap
pears to be the general opinion of anatomists that the posterior
cerebral lobes do not exist, and that, from this circumstance, there is
always a greater or less amount of cerebellum projecting behind the

cerebrum, and uncovered by it.             Tiedemann*        has, however, made an
exception        in favour of the seal, in which animal he says posterior
lobes occur, although shorter than in the Simiae.                   Cuvierf also       re
cognises the exceptional          arrangement       in the seal, and places along
with it the otter and the dolphins.                 RetziusJ     states, that   in     the
mammalia         lower than man, posterior           lobes   are found only in the
apes,    and that rudiments         only are met with           in the Cetacea       and
seals.
   In     the course of a series          of observations which         I   have been
making for some time back, on the crania of different                       mammals,
my attention has been especially directed to the relative positions of
the cerebrum and cerebellum.               These observations have led me to
come to the conclusion, that considerable misconception exists                   as to
the relations of the two chief divisions of the encephalon.
   If, relying      on the published drawings, one may give an opinion of
the method of examination            of the brain       which    has     been   mostly
adopted      by anatomists, it would appear that the relation of the con
stituent     parts of the brain     has    been    determined    after its removal
from     the cranial cavity,       and with       its base resting on a flat sur
face, such as a plate.       By     a procedure      of this kind   a very incorrect
estimate is formed, for great displacement of parts ensues, especially in
the lower mammals.       The cerebrum slips forwards, the cerebellum
backwards.          The medulla, instead of being more or              less oblique,    is
placed horizontally, and causes the cerebellum to be tilted upwards.
The arched form of the      base is almost entirely destroyed.          The displace
ment is still greater       if,   at the same       time, the membranes are re
moved^    The observations which    have conducted have been, for
                                            I
the most part, made without removing the brain from the cavity                          of
the skull.        My dissections have been performed chiefly after                     two
methods      :   1st, By making vertical sections through both skull                   and
brain, immediately        on one side of the middle line, so as to preserve
uninjured the falx cerebri, and the whole of one lateral half of the
organ    ;   2d, By carefully removing            with the bone-forceps the pos-

  §   Mr Marshall, in his description of the brain of a young chimpanzee (Nat
Hist. Itev., vol.   p. 298), has pointed out very clearly, in the brain of that
                    i.
animal, the changes which ensued after removal from the skull, and immersion
for a time in spirit.

                                       551
terior part of the skull.      By this latter method, especially, a view
may be obtained of the cerebellum and cerebrum as they lie in situ.
Owing to the transparency of the dura mater in many of the lower
mammals, the relations        of these structures       to each other may be
studied, either with or without the removal of this membrane.
    Comparative anatomists, in describing these relations, are in the
habit of employing       such terms as overlapping, covering, exposure,
denudation, to express their extent.             Such terms are not, however,
sufficiently precise, because they do not convey distinctly which sur
face of the cerebellum      it is which      is thus  overlapped, covered, ex
posed, or denuded.       Indeed, it is seldom that the attempt has been
made, in the lower mammals, to give an accurate definition                of these
surfaces, so as to distinguish     them from each other.          Before   a  close
and accurate comparison        can  be instituted      between   the relations of
the cerebrum to the cerebellum           in man and other mammals, it             is
necessary that such a definition be attempted.              It  has appeared     to
me that the septum        lying between the cerebrum and cerebellum,
commonly termed the tentorium cerebelli, furnishes us with a basis
for arriving at a precise conclusion.
    If we  turn  to the descriptions      of the cerebellum of man, given in
 our standard text-books of human descriptive anatomy, we shall find
 it stated that the cerebellum     consists     of a central median part — the
 vermiform     process, or worm     ;  and of two lateral lobes — the hemi
 spheres.    Of   these, the hemispheres         preponderate greatly in size.
 The cerebellum presents an upper and lower surface, and a circum
ference.     The upper surface corresponds to the tentorium cerebelli                ;
the lower is lodged in the concavity of the inferior              occipital fossae,
to which it is accurately adapted.            The circumference of the cere
bellum corresponds to the line of junction of the upper and lower
 surfaces with     each   other, and along it a deep         fissure, the great
 horizontal   fissure,   extends.     The circumference — called also the
 posterior margin    — corresponds,     therefore, to the line of attachment
 of the tentorium      to the transverse line of the occipital bone, and
 marks with great precision the divergence of the two surfaces of the
 cerebellum from each other.          Of   these surfaces, that which is supe
 rior, and in contact with the tentorium,             which we may therefore
 appropriately    term tentorial,     is the only one related to the cere
 brum, the posterior lobes of which not only cover, but even project be
 yond it.    The inferior surface, in contact with          the   occipital bone,

                                        552
 which may therefore        be   termed occipital, never possesses any rela
 tion whatsoever to the cerebrum.
     An examination of several members of most of the great orders
 of the  class   Mammalia has satisfied me, that it is quite possible to
 arrive in them at as correct a conception of the relations of the
 cerebrum to the cerebellum as in man.         In every animal which       I have
 examined,    I have found the cerebellum to possess two surfaces.           One
 of these  is in contact with the tentorium, and, through the interven
 tion of that membrane, is in relation to the cerebrum.              The other
 is in contact with the wall of the occipital       fossa.    The surfaces    are
 distinguished    from each other       by looking    in different   directions.
 The tentorial, corresponding to the superior in man, looks, as a rule,
 more or less forwards.        The occipital, corresponding to the inferior
 in man, looks, as a rule, more or less backwards.             These surfaces
along their line of junction form an angle, more or less marked                 in
different   animals.      This angle corresponds    to the circumference,      or
posterior margin, of the human cerebellum, and is in contact with
the line of attachment of the tentorium to the occipital           bone.     The
tentorial aspect of the cerebellum, therefore, is that which is in con
stant relation to the cerebrum, and, not only in man, but in all the
mammalia, is covered        by it.
    That this   is the case   with regard  to the Quadrumana,      has been    so
completely     proven    by   the observations of the various       anatomists
already referred to, that it appears almost unnecessary to enter again
into this question.       As   I  have had an opportunity of dissecting in
situ the brain of a young and recently dead Cercopithecus, which
was given me by my friend Dr M'Bain,              I  may mention that in it
the posterior cerebral lobes not merely covered the tentorial surface
of the    cerebellum,     but    projected decidedly beyond      its posterior
margin.     Through the liberality also of Professor          Goodsir,    I have
obtained permission to examine several quadrumanous brains in his
possession.     All   these   had been removed from the cranial          cavity,
and had been lying for some time in spirit.
    In  a Chimpanzee, the tentorial        surface of the cerebellum         was
directed upwards, and was evidently flatter than the corresponding
surface in man.         The occipital surface     was   directed   downwards.
The posterior margin         was clearly marked.      The posterior     lobes of
the cerebrum corresponded to the whole of the tentorial surface, and
extended    as far as the posterior margin       of the cerebellum,      beyond

                                         553
which they might even          be stated    slightly to project.     The inferior
vermiform       process  was   lodged in a slight furrow        between    the two
cerebellar hemispheres.
   In   the brains of several specimens of Cercopitheci,              the tentorial
and occipital surfaces, with the posterior margin of the cerebellum,
were distinctly     marked.      In all, the  posterior cerebral lobes extended
over the tentorial surface as far as the posterior margin.               In  two of
the brains, it might be stated that the cerebral lobes projected back
wards beyond that margin.            The comparatively greater development
of the inferior vermiform process, over the lateral hemispheres of the
cerebellum, was indicated by the absence of that fossa between the
hemispheres in which it lies in the more highly developed human
cerebellum.
    In   a Macacus,     a vertical   section through      the skull and brain of
which animal        I   examined, the cerebrum corresponded to the ten
torial   aspect   of the cerebellum      ; the posterior lobes of the one and
the superior surface of the other extended as far as the margin of
attachment of the tentorium to the transverse line of the occiput.
    In  two specimens of Cynocephali, the same relation of the posterior
lobes of the cerebrum to the tentorial aspect of the cerebellum was
observed.       In   neither   of  these   brains  was the inferior     vermiform
process lodged in a depression between            the hemispheres, but formed
an almost continuous surface with them.*
    In   three brains, from animals of the genus Ateles, the posterior
cerebral lobes extended quite up to the posterior margin, separating
the tentorial from the occipital surface of the cerebellum.                   In all
the lateral hemispheres projected slightly beyond the inferior vermi
form     process,   which   was lodged in a shallow          depression between
them.
    In a lion monkey {Midas leordnus) the occipital surface of the
cerebellum was separated from the tentorial by a very clearly defined
   *  Since this paper was read before the Society, I have dissected in situ the
brain of a young Shacma, and have found that the cerebrum pro jected beyond
the cerebellum, both laterally and posteriorly.       The vermiform process pro
truded slightly beyond the cerebellar hemispheres.       The projection of the cere
bral hemispheres backwards beyond the worm was rather less than V0ths of an
inch, whilst on each side of the worm it extended     to rather more than   Vjths of
an inch behind the cerebellar hemispheres.       The cerebellar and posterior cere
bral  fossa; in the cranium exhibited an arrangement in conformity with this
disposition of the encephalon. (March 27th.)

posterior margin, as far as          which the posterior       cerebral   lobes ex
tended.      The inferior vermiform process projected beyond the               cere
bellar hemispheres, which were comparatively               feebly developed.
   The Cetacea      possess,   not only in their great mass of brain, but in
the number and complexity of the convolutions of their hemispheres,
very decided      evidences    of a high degree of cerebral           organisation.
Professor Goodsir has allowed me to examine the brains of a por
poise,   a bottle- nosed      dolphin   (D. Tursio), and a rorqual (Bala-
noptera), either in his possession, or in the Anatomical Museum.
In all, in accordance with the peculiar antero-posterior compression
of the cranial cavity,         the corresponding      diameter of the cerebral
hemispheres was very much shortened, so that the brain was widened
out, and heightened greatly in its vertical             diameter.       In all,  the
distinction     between   the tentorial and occipital surfaces of the cere
bellum was very clearly marked.             The cerebrum        passed   backwards
as far   as the posterior      margin of the cerebellum.          The cerebellum
in them     was   a cerebellum inferius      ;  for, as far as could be judged
from an inspection of the brains, as they lay out of their cavities,
the    cerebellum     was    not   exposed     when    looked at      from   above.
The     cerebrum      possessed      very  decided     posterior    lobes; for,   on
account of the great extent of the tentorial surface                  of the   cere
bellum,     and the heaping        up of the cerebral        convolutions    in  the
vertical     diameter,    a    large   proportion     of    the   cerebral    hemi
spheres was placed above the cerebellum.*              The brain of the bottle-
nosed dolphin had been         lying for many years in spirit in the Anato
mical Museum.          A  section had been made into the lateral ventricle
on the    right side, from which it appeared as if there were indica
tions of a prolongation of the ventricle in the direction of the pos
terior lobe.      When the dissection       was    extended, so as to obtain a
more complete view of the arrangement, it was seen that the lateral
ventricle     was   continued     backwards and       outwards, sweeping along
the posterior part of the optic thalamus.            It  then changed its direc
tion, and passed downwards and forwards, so as to form the inferior
horn.     At, or about, the spot where this change took             place, a recess,
extending      backwards in the substance of the cerebral mass was met
   * Each hemisphere of Delphinut Turtio, measured 5 inches and ^ths in its
antero-posterior diameter.      The cerebrum extended 2 inches and ^ths behind
the posterior end of the corpus callosum, the inferior surface of which mass of
cerebrum was in relation to the tentorial surface of the cerebellum.

be regarded as a rudimentary                   posterior cornu.                   As the soaking of
a brain in spirit,           for a series of years, has a tendency to render the
examination           of the ventricular            arrangements               more        difficult,      than
would be the case in a recent brain,                            I    hope,     in the course of the
summer, to supplement this observation, by an examination of the
brain of the common porpoise.
     In the brains of those Carnivora which                         I have     been able to examine,
the cerebellum has been seen to possess tentorial and occipital surfaces,
separated by a slight, yet definite, ridge, which corresponded to the
line of attachment of the tentorium to the occipital bone.                                        The cere
bellum is not, however, so decidedly a                     " cerebellum inferius"                  as in the
examples already described.                    The surfaces of the cerebellum                               con
sequently look more or less forwards                        and backwards.                   Thus,        if    we
look from above upon the brain of a dog or cat, we                                see     the cerebellum
projecting slightly behind the cerebrum, or exposed, as it is usually
stated.       From the description which has been given by Tiedemann*
of    these relations, not only in the Carnivora, but in the                                Ruminantia,
Solipeds and Pachydermata,                  it is evident that he considered a por
tion, at least, of this exposed surface belonged to the anterior aspect
of the cerebellum.              But if     we examine                the brain        in situ,      we shall
see    that the posterior end of the cerebrum passes                                       as far         as the
posterior margin of the anterior (tentorial) surface of the cerebellum,
so as to cover it. The exposed surface                           is,
                                             therefore, the occipital, or
that which corresponds to the inferior                              surface of the human cere
bellum.        In    the dog, both the tentorial and occipital surfaces of the
cerebellum          are well developed and about equal in extent.                                              The
amount of cerebral             hemispheres in relation, through the tentorium,
to the corresponding              cerebellar surface,                  is   therefore considerable,
and warrants           us,  I    think,    in regarding them                    as      posterior         lobes.
The lateral ventricles             do not possess               any proper posterior cornua                      ;
but a slight indentation, continuous with the ventricular cavity, in the
substance of each posterior lobe, appears to me to present         rudi                               a
ment of the posterior              horn.        In    the cat, the tentorial                   is     smaller
than      the occipital        surface      of the cerebellum,                   and the extent of
cerebrum           in relation with       it   is   proportionally             smaller        than in the
dog, so that the size of its posterior lobes                         is     smaller   ;   for the area of

the tentorial        surface of the cerebellum            may be taken as a measure
of the amount of the posterior part of the cerebrum by which it is
covered.        Its lateral ventricles       possess no traces        of posterior horns.
     I have already mentioned             that both Tiedemann              and Cuvier have
noted that the seal          possesses more largely developed                cerebral hemi
spheres than the Carnivora             generally     ;  and Cuvier places, along with
the seal, the otter.          I have,  as yet, had no opportunity               of examining
the brains        of  these animals,      but the accompanying casts of the in
terior of their cranial cavities will give some conception of the re
lations of the cerebellum and cerebrum.*
     In  the otter, the cerebrum not merely covered                     the tentorial aspect
of the cerebellum,           but even     projected beyond it in a very striking
 manner.         Thus, when the brain was looked at from above, no part
of the cerebellum was exposed.                   From      the cast, it would       appear    as
 if  the occipital surface of the cerebellum looked almost directly back
 wards.      The cerebral hemispheres                  possessed       considerable      width
 posteriorly.         In the    seal, nearly the same          relations prevailed as in
 the otter    ;  the posterior projection          of the cerebral hemispheres             was
 more    strongly marked laterally than in the middle line.                          This  was
 due partly to the ossification of the tentorium                    and falx cerebri, and
 partly to the posterior cerebral              fossae    not passing quite so far back
 in the middle line as they did somewhat                     further outwards.
      An inspection of the interior of the cavity of a cranium, in                          my
 possession, of a walrus (Trichecus),                  an animal closely allied to          the
 seal, led me to suppose            that,  if a cast     of the cavity       were   taken,   re
 lations of      a similar nature would          be met with.         I,  accordingly, made
 such a cast, and found that the cerebral hemispheres projected back
 wards beyond those of the cerebellum                  ;  this projection, as in the seal,
  and from the same cause, being more strongly marked laterally than
  in the middle line.             The occipital surface of the cerebellum                  was
  almost flat, and directed backwards, with                     but a slight upward in
 clination.        Both     the seal     and the walrus           may      be   considered    to
  possess brains of large size, so that the cerebellar hemispheres were
  concealed      by the cerebral lobes when the brain was looked at from
  above.       In  them as well as in the otter the cerebellum was inferior.
    * Most  anatomists,    I think, will admit that    a  very correct general conception of
  these relations may be obtained in those cases where           it is difficult to procure the
  brains themselves,     by making casts of the cranial cavity.           The accuracy of this
  method is ensured,      even more absolutely, when the tentorium is ossified.

                                           557
If   one might form an opinion, from the casts                 of the cranial cavities
of these animals, of the size of their posterior cerebral lobes, it is
not improbable that they might be found to possess indications of
posterior    horns to the ventricles.             I shall  certainly avail myself of
the first opportunity        which may present itself, to inquire                 into this
point.     Besides,   I find   that Tiedemann           in his    "  Icones," p. 19, in
a description      of the brain of       a   Phoea vitulina,       states,
                                                                              "  praeteraea
cornu posterioris vestigium occurrit."
     Of the Pachydermata and Ruminantia,                I have   examined in situ the
brains of the pig and sheep.               In    both these    animals      the tentorial
and occipital      surfaces of the cerebellum             were clearly indicated by
the line of attachment         of the tentorium          to the occipital      bone.      In
both, the cerebral       hemispheres         extended backwards as far as that
line, so that the tentorial surface of the cerebellar hemispheres was
completely covered         by it.     In   the pig, the tentorial         surface of the
cerebellum      was larger     proportionally        than in the sheep, so that the
extent     of cerebrum       in relation         to  the   cerebellum       was     greater.
When the brain of either animal was examined from                        above, a    partial
projection     of the cerebellum behind              the cerebrum       might      be seen ;
but the exposed         surface was the occipital, and not the tentorial.
From an examination of the brains, preserved in spirit, of the Wart-
hog (Phasco-cheeres) and Peccari (Dycoteles) in the possession of
Professor    Goodsir,     it would appear, that in them, as in the common
pig, the tentorial surface is covered by the cerebrum.
     In the Rodentia, Insectivora, Cheiroptera, and Marsupialia, the
cerebellum       is no longer        placed below        the cerebrum, but behind
it,   so  that    it  becomes      really      a    cerebellum      posterius.         From
the    statements      which    have     been       made   in the works         of several
anatomists of great distinction,             it would appear        to be   their opinion
that the cerebrum has, in             these    orders, so slight       a relation     to the
cerebellum, that the corpora quadrigemina are more or less exposed
 between the two.*           From     an examination        which     I have     conducted
 in situ, of   the brains    of several members of           these important         groups,
 I  think it very doubtful whether such               a general statement is correct.
 Of the Rodentia,     I have examined the rabbit, guinea-pig              (Caviacobaia),
 and rat.      In all  these animals        it was quite possible to distinguish             a
 tentorial   and occipital     surface in the cerebellum.               The area of the

former    was small,     and    possessed   a forward    direction.     The latter
was much larger, and at         first sight appeared     to be the only surface
which the cerebellum         possessed.     It was directed     more or less up
wards and backwards.           The separation    between the two surfaces was
indicated by aslight ridgewhich corresponded to the line of attachment
of the tentorium     to the occipital bone.       As far   as this  line the  cere
brum extended posteriorly.           The anterior surface of the cerebellum
was thus in      relation,   through     the tentorium,     with the cerebrum.
Owing to the limited area of this surface, the amount of cerebrum
in relation to it was necessarily extremely small, and might be con
sidered as little more than the posterior edge of the cerebral hemi
spheres.     Neither in the rabbit nor guinea-pig could the corpora
quadrigemina be seen, until the cerebral hemispheres were drawn on
one side, or the cerebellum pushed back.           In  the rat, the hemispheres
of the cerebrum were in relation to those of the cerebellum               ; but, in
the middle line, owing to their divergence from each other at the
posterior   end   of the great longitudinal fissure, the upper aspect of
the corpora quadrigemina could be seen.                When a bird's-eye view
of the brain was made, a large proportion of cerebellum was exposed
lying behind the cerebrum, but this exposed surface was the occipital.
Tiedemann, in his
                          " Icones,'' has illustrated the anatomy of the
brain of the Rodentia,       by figures of the brains of the agouti (Cavia
agouti),   porcupine,     and beaver.       In every instance he has repre
sented   the cerebrum       lying so far in front of the cerebellum as not
to be in contact with it.         Thus, exposure of the corpora quadrige
mina is occasioned.         From my dissections       I   am satisfied that this
mode of depiction does not give a faithful representation of the re
lation of the structures.           The error     has    evidently    arisen  from
studying the parts after removal from the cavity, and without taking
properly into consideration the relations which they bore to each
other in situ.
   Of the Insectivora,        I  have dissected in situ the brains of the
mole and hedgehog.           Of the Cheiroptera,      I have   dissected but one
species.    In  these animals the surfaces       of the cerebellum had       about
the same relation,      as regards direction and size, as       in the Rodentia.
In  all, the small tentorial surface was in apposition with little more
than the posterior edge         of the cerebrum.        In  none of the animals
examined could the corpora quadrigemina be seen until the cere
bral hemispheres were turned on one side.

                                      559
   Of the Edentata and Monotremata          I have,   as yet, had no oppor
tunity of dissecting any     specimens.
    Of the Marsupialia, through Professor Goodsir's kindness,         I have
been enabled to examine two brains of the kangaroo (Macropus).
Although    these brains     had been for some time in spirit, and had
evidently to some extent lost their original form, yet it was possible
to distinguish    in them the tentorial     and occipital surfaces of the
cerebellum, and to note that the cerebrum had to the former a rela
tion corresponding to that which had         been    noted in the mammals
already described.      In  the kangaroo, therefore, the exposed surface
of the cerebellum      is  the occipital.   The     corpora quadrigemina
could not be seen until the cerebral hemispheres were drawn           to one
side.

drawings.     The drawings were made by Dr Henry S. Wilson, and,
to ensure accuracy     of form, proportion, and relation, their outlines
were taken with the assistance of a camera.)

          1. On a recent        Landslip. By the Rev. John Duns,
                                      Torphichen.
       In  the introduction     to this paper, the author pointed out the pro
 minent physical features of the district in which the landslip occur
 red.       At   the point where the trap-ridge, which stretches in a south
 west direction from Linlithgow to the neighbourhood of Airdrie,
 sends       one   irregular    fork to the north-west, and another to the
 south-west, a broad depression occurs.                In this lies the Auchingray
 moss, the scene of the landslip.                Here the parish of New Monk-
 land, Lanarkshire, meets that of Slamannan,                    Stirlingshire.    The
 following figure is        a rough plan      of the ground between the Slaman
 nan Railway and           Haldane's Moss Road.            The area specially influ
 enced by the landslip         is enclosed by dotted lines.
        The   space   lying between A and CC, represents the landslip pro
  per.       The rest of the ground marked off was that covered by the
  flow.       At   present, heath-clad       ridges appear at   A  and   BB.    These
  l idges    were previously     little,  if  at all, above the level of the moss.

                                  561
The depression is the result of the immense quantity of soil carried
away while the force lasted.     Between BB, the centre of the slip,
the author on sounding some of the water-filled       gaps found them
sixteen feet deep.
     At A,  where the effects of the slip are first seen, the soil has
 fallen in irregular masses to the east.   At the widest part, BB, that
 lying  on the north has  given way to the south, and     that lying on
 the south has fallen to the north.    The  pressure on three sides  has
 been towards the centre, where the depth is greatest.  This, the author
 showed, seemed to indicate, that the force had first become active at
 that point, and to suggest the explanation of the movement.      About
 forty years ago,  the  central part was known in the district as the
 " blind  loch," — water covered with reeds, rushes, &c.
     The movement of the soil began about seven a.m., 12th August
 1861. The author visited the locality a few days later.          Heavy
 rains had fallen for some weeks.        August 11th was one of the
 wettest days of the season, and the wind blew strongly from the west.
 Great quantities of water had got between the peat and the underly
 ing clay, and had floated the lightest central part.    Denser matter
 would then press in from the sides A and BB, and give greater im
 petus to the floating mass.      The slip, having carried away the

                                         562
 breast-work, would naturally take the direction             of least resistance,
 — viz.    the course of the stream which drains the moss.
     The    area set in motion was estimated at about         300   feet broad at
 its widest part,      BB, and 1320 feet long, from A to Ad. The slip
 met with slight elevations at CC; the most formidable of which
 lying   on the north, gave the flow a southerly direction, and led to the
 deposit of the tongue marked D.             Here it spread over portion of a
 corn field, covered part of the highway, Haldane's Moss Road, and
 wasted     part of a field of turnips lying on the south side of tho
 road.
     At   the point where the moving material turned to the south, evi
 dences of great disturbance are to be seen.              In some cases, huge
 masses     of  peat have     been  turned   upside down   ;  and, as they were
 pushed over sunken portions, their faces now rest on what formerly
 formed the surface of the ground.               On the lumps thus inverted,
 many branches and roots of native birch trees (Betula alba) were
 to be met with.          No birches now grow in the immediate neighbour
 hood.      It  was shown that no trees of any sort grew near the moss in
 1809    ;  and the birches, it was concluded, had been laid down long
 anterior to that date.         A  peculiarity  of their roots was pointed out.
 Many of the main stems, instead of being rounded, have a central
 depression on both sides, are flat, recurved, and run quickly to a
 point.      Fragments      of land shells (Zonites)    were picked    up among
 these roots.
    At D,     the floating material turned again to the north, and bending
 N. by E., it      came    in contact with    a plantation of Scotch firs.      A
 few of the trees have been carried           several yards forward, and now
 stand as     if they   had not been moved from their place.        Several have
 been   thrust violently, top downwards, into the underlying clay, and
others have been placed horizontally on the edges of arrested masses
of  peat.      In  its course, much damage was done by the slip to other
two corn-fields.          At F, it filled  a whinstone    quarry   about fifteen
feet deep.        At the bend EE, the       soil in motion must have been at
least twelve feet deep.          The great body of the peat, which had been
set   in motion      on  the 12th of August, took six days before it reached
in bulk the point          I,  a haugh   on   each  side  of Binniehill    Burn,
where it covered a space described as being as wide as the Clyde near
Glasgow.         On the 15th, the movement          was at the rate   of  about a
yard in two minutes.

                                              563
     A little    beyond    the neck      EE, it   met the Limeridge Railway, car
ried away part of          it,   and covered      it   between      E    and G.       It    spread
over the natural basin marked               GG, where         it   left large masses.          One
measured        seven feet by four feet, and was nearly five feet deep.                         At
H    it   entered Binniehill Burn, and covered                 the haugh       I.     The next
point favourable for        it   spreading occurs in the haugh on the south and
east    of Slamannan village.            At            the highway at
                                              this place      it   covered
two points, and left about two feet of peat soil on the surface of the
clay, at that time under cultivation.  Having reached the Avon,
the flow left broad marks on its banks, as far down as Linlithgow
bridge, thirteen miles distant.
  The author, in conclusion, pointed out resemblances between the
Auchingray landslip and that of the Solway in 1771, and referred
to phenomena associated with the Slip now noticed, fitted to shed
light     on several questions bearing on the formation                    of modern strata.
2. On the    Rainfall in the Lake District in 1861. With some
     Observations on the Composition of Rain- Water.  By John
     Davy, M.D., F.R.SS., Lond. and Edin.
   This paper consists of two parts. In the first part an account                                is
given of the rain-fall     the Lake District during the year 1861,
                                  in
chiefly remarkable          for its great amount (exceeding the average by
many inches), and varying                in different    localities from          sixty inches
on the skirts of the district,            for instance, at Kendal and Mirehouse,
the latter four miles northward of Keswick, to 123 and 182 inches                                   ;
the former, the fall             at Grasmere,       where approaching               the higher
mountains,        the latter      at Seathwaite        in Borrowdale,           a spot      in the
midst of them.
     In   the second part an account           is   given of the author's                 observa
tions and experiments               on rain, in     relation to composition, as ex
amined microscopically             and chemically.
     The results of both trials          seem to prove that rain-water                is    rarely,
if   ever pure, and that almost constantly                    it   is   the vehicle of saline
matter, probably derived from the sea, and of other matter as well
as saline, probably         derived from the land, especially from our great
manufacturing         districts,       and that in each and every instance, the
impregnations       it    contains are raised and diffused                by   the winds.
     The diffusion of matter thus affected               is   so strongly marked, that,
in the author's opinion,           it   seems to prove that as there
                                                                                  is
                                                                                  a        circula-
     VOL. IV.                                                                     4   G

tion of water from the sea to the land, and from the land back to
the sea, so there is one of saline matter, tending to prevent the per
 fect exhaustion of the soil, and to favour the growth of herbage on
our downs and fells, and of shrubs and trees, where manure never is.
and never has been employed.
    Whilst in the economy of nature this diffusion is presumed to
act beneficially, on the works of man it seems to act in an opposite
manner, — being rather destructive than preservative,          — rain  promot
 ing the decay of all, or almost all, inanimate objects of a perishable
kind exposed to its influence, and this mainly by its saline contents.
3. Observations on the           Absorbing Power of the Human Skin.
    By Murray Thomson, M.D., F.C.S., Lecturer on Chemistry,
    Edinburgh.         Communicated by Dr Douglas Maclagan.
    For the last sixty years physiological and other authors have been
maintaining two very opposite views in regard to the absorption by
the skin of substances       dissolved in the water of baths.        Some au
thors holding    that such salts as iodide of potassium         readily reach
the blood through the skin, when applied in the form of a bath con
taining that salt   ;  while others hold that absorption, under such cir
cumstances, never takes place.          Among    those who hold the affirma
tive view,  I may  mention Braconnot, Madden, O'Henry (fils), Carpen
ter, Chevallier    et   Petit ;  and among those who hold the opposite
opinion,   Currie, Seguin, Lehmann of Leipzig, Kletzinsky.
    This long lasting difference of opinion sufficiently indicates,            I
think, that the subject is surrounded         by difficulties.  I do not    pre
sume, therefore,      that the observations    I  have made settle the ques
tion, they are only intended as a contribution           to our knowledge     on
the subject.
    My experiments       were   all made on my own person at various in
tervals during the last two years.          Six of them were made         on as
 many successive      nights, so as to try    if frequency of bathing ren
dered   the skin more permeable.         The general method of making the
trials was this : — Into   an   ordinary bath, a measured quantity of warm
water was let, the temperature of which was recorded.             Means were
taken to keep the heat constant during the experiment.                The  tem
peratures ranged usually from 90° to 98°.            The salt to be tried was
then dissolved, and mixed with the water.              The time in the bath

                                           565
was noted    ;   it varied from half an hour to one hour and a quarter.
The whole       body was immersed, excepting the head and neck.                    All
the urine voided in twenty-four             hours after each bath was collected
and concentrated, then tested             for the   substances    experimented     on.
Six baths were taken, in which iodide of potassium was dissolved.
The quantity of the salt varied from 200 to 1300 grains.
   Five baths, in which quantities             of ferrocyanide of potassium, va
rying from 1400 to 5000 grains,               were dissolved.      Four baths were
taken, the water of which was rendered strongly alkaline by soda.
The result of       these   fifteen experiments        was, that   I  could not find
that any of the substances           in the baths passed through the skin into
the blood, so as to be found in the urine            ; the soda baths did not ren
der it alkaline, nor could         I  detect the other salts in it     ;  and it is to
be noted that the tests         for them are extremely delicate.
   To compare absorption from              a mucous     surface with the above,       I
swallowed several different quantities            of iodide and ferrocyanide of
potassium,      when   I  found that the smallest           amount of the former
salt  I  could take internally, and afterwards detect in the urine, was
two grains, and of the latter five grains.
    A   considerable number of trials were              made in which tincture of
iodine, and two in which iodine ointment                 were applied to the skin.
Neither in      these could     I  afterwards find iodine in the urine.
   The general conclusion which my experiments lead me to are, (1.)
 That though not denying that absorption by the skin of aqueous
solution does take place, yet it seems to be the exception and not
the rule.      (2.) That medicated warm baths, whether natural or arti
ficial,  do not appear       to owe any virtue they may have               to the sub
stances dissolved in them reaching the blood through the skin.                      At
the same time, as there are other ways by which one can conceive
such baths to operate on the system, it is not to be concluded that,
because     absorption     may not take place, such baths are useless               as
therapeutic agents.
4. On the Constitution             of Mannite.         By J. A. Wanklyn, Esq.,
                               and Dr Erlenmeyer.
   Chemists are in the habit of assigning                to  mannite     the  formula,
                                         cghuo,;
but the reasons        which      have   hitherto   been    given   for that formula

                                             566
seem    not very conclusive.            By     a process          of fermentation,         alcohol
and a number of other compounds of well established composition
may be obtained from             mannite       ;    but     inasmuch           as   disintegration
takes place in this process,           the formulae of the products afford no
guide to the constitution of the original body.
   Up     to the present time no compound                   of known formula has              been
got from mannite by other than disintegrating                           processes.
   The uncertainty about the real composition of mannite has finally
been illustrated by Berthelot, who in his " Chimie organique fondee
sur la Synthese,"      has proposed the formula,
                                         C3H.03.
   Berthelot     has supported         his view by bringing forward a number
of salts of mannite, and          has    hinted       at the possibility             of preparing
the substance from allyl compounds.
   The reaction       we have to      bring forward in this paper is in contra
diction to Berthelot.  By distilling mannite with a great excess of
strong hydriodic acid, in a stream of carbonic acid gas, it is almost
completely      resolved into         Iodide       of Hexyl.           The change may           be
thus represented       :—
                                  Mannite.
                                 CA(H0),+11HL
                             Iodide of Hexyl.
   This reaction is conclusive against Berthelot's                              formula,    for it
cannot be maintained           that an easy reduction                       with hydriodic acid
would increase the complexity of the carbon molecule.   A parallel
reaction between glycerine and hydriodic acid was observed by one
of us some time ago.*
                                 Glycerine.
                                                                  =
                                 C3H5(HO)3+5HI
                           Iodide of Propyl.
                                         + SB.,0 +          1,.
   We are thus conducted              to the result        :      mannite      is   the hexatomic
alcohol    of   tho   C6   series, or,     as we          prefer       to    write, Mannite     is

Hexyl- hydride, wherein six atoms of hydrogen              have been replaced
by six atoms of peroxide of hydrogen.
    From the recognised connection subsisting          between    mannite and
the sugars, we may expect that the sugars also belong to the            Hexyl-
hydride series.
    Furthermore, just     as glycerine    has   been   got from the Propyl
series, so may we hope to get mannite          from  the    Hexyl   series.   It
is our intention     to attack   this problem.       We propose       to  make
C6HsBr6, and to endeavour by some means to effect a replacement
of the Bromine by peroxide of hydrogen.
    We subjoin a slight sketch of a few hexylic compounds.               Iodide
of hexyl C6H13I. (obtained from mannite), is a colourless liquid,
having a smell very like that of iodide of amyl.             It is very slowly
acted   upon    by  light; sp. gr. = l-439 at         0°    C.   Boiling-point
about 165° C.      It  can be distilled without suffering decomposition.
    Hexyl-alcohol C6H18HO may be obtained by decomposing the
iodide of hexyl by means of oxide of silver and water.                Its smell
does not bear the slightest     resemblance to that of amyl-alcohol.
    Hexylene CeH12 is obtained by digesting iodide of hexyl with
alcoholic solution of caustic potash.        It is a light oil, smelling like
amylene    ; boiling-point about 69° C. Its vapour-density has been
found to   be 2-88 and 2 97.        The formula CSH12 requires 2-9022.
It combines    with great violence with bromine, yielding
                                  CoHuBr.,.
    Hexyl-hydride, C6HU, may be obtained by decomposing the
 iodide with zinc in presence of alcohol. It is a light oil, having a
very fragrant     smell, and not attacked by Bromine           at any rate in
diffused daylight.      In  these two particulars      it differs widely from
hexylene, which has an abominable           smell, and which      hisses   when
Bromine is dropped into it.          In  boiling point    there is very little
difference between hexylene and hexyl-hydride.
    All of these compounds have given satisfactory analyses.
    [We intend to publish     a full account of the Hexyl-compounds.]

1. On the Structure           of Lemeopoda Dalmanni, with Observa
    tions on its Larval Form.           By Wm. Turner, M.B. (Lond.),
    and H. S. Wilson, M.D., Demonstrators of Anatomy.
    This apparently      little known    form of parasitic     crustacean has
been    as yet described only      by Retzius and Kroyer.          It   does not
appear, up to this time, to have been recognised as a British species.
During the present year, many specimens obtained from the nasal
cavity of more than one Rasa batis, caught by the Newhaven fisher
men, have been examined by the authors.
    Female.   — One   of the largest of the Lerneadae, divided into cephalo-
thorax and abdomen by a constricted neck.              Cephalo-thorax       f^ths
of an inch long ; it projected          almost at a right angle from the
anterior end of the abdomen.            On its dorsal surface were      a pair   of
3-jointed    hooked antennae.       In   front  of the    antennae,    and close
to the anterior end of the head, was the buccal apparatus.               Situated
in the middle line was a short, conical, retractile         snout, which      pos
sessed an oral aperture bounded by two fringed lips at its extremity.
The structure of      these lips,  with that of the jaws and palpae con
nected    to them,   was     then fully described.      On each side of the
snout is a short stump-like        process —a    modified foot.     It  was seg
mented, and possessed a bifid, free extremity,           the posterior division
of which     was   armed with a terminal       hook  ;  the anterior     division,
 much larger than the posterior,           was  studded   with  short     bristles.
Connected to the base of each          stump-like   process   was a segmented
palp-like   structure,   set with three or four conical papillae at its free
end.
    Springing from the sides of the cephalo-thorax, immediately in
 front of the neck, was a pair of elongated cylindrical arms.                Each
 arm ended      superiorly    in an expanded clasper.        The two claspers
 were in close contact by flattened, opposed        surfaces, but not united
 together.     In the concave     upper surface of the opposed        claspers a
 cartilaginous-like    bar was placed.      The authors then described the

                                       570
 structure of the arms and the bar, and the mode of connection of the
 parasite through these arrangements to the wall of the nasal chamber
 of the skate.   The structure of two bulb-like protuberances from             the
 sides of the  cephalo-thorax, immediately in front of the roots of            the
 arms, was then described.         These were the eye-like spots of Ret-
 zius and Kroyer.
    Abdomen     iVtbs of an inch long, -fVths broad         ; had an inverted
 heart-shaped    form  ;   imperfectly     defined    segmented      appearance.
 The fourth segment, the largest,         possessed a median slit-like anal
aperture,   two elongated ova strings,         and two posterior        abdominal
appendages.      The arrangement of       the   intestinal  canal, ovaries, and
cement organ was then described.             The authors then pointed out
certain appearances which they considered indicative of the existence
of a nervous system.
    The authors agreed with Milne-Edwards in thinking that                    the
elongated cephalo-thorax       and the posterior       abdominal     appendages
point decidedly to the advisability of separating this animal from the
genus lerneopoda.        None of the specimens they examined had the
male attached,    so that they have not examined it.           They have seen
the Iarvae in various stages of development.            When free, the larva
was aVth    of an inch long     and   ^\th of an inch broad        ;   oval when
viewed from dorsal surface       ;  profile   view showed     a convex dorsal
and almost flat ventral surface.       It   possessed a pair   of antennae and
two pairs of limbs.        Each of the first pair of limbs was bifid, the
two branches bearing long hairs at their extremity.               Each of the
second pair was bifid, the two branches bearing each a spinous hook
at its extremity.     A   remarkable    tail-like prolongation, fringed with
pinnate hairs, was    then described.       The curved intestinal canal, the
eye spots, and the pigment masses         within the visceral chamber,       were
then adverted to.
2.  Memoir of the Life and Writings of Robert Whytt, M.D.,
     Professor of Medicine in the University of Edinburgh,
     from 1747 to 1766.         By William Seller, M.D., F.K.S.E.,
     F.R.C.P.E.
    Biography, the author said, had never done sufficient justice to
Robert Whytt, while it began already to omit his name. Whytt
had commonly been        represented as a follower        of Stahl   ;   and this

                                          571
 idea, which was without         foundation,     had probably        been a principal
 cause why his merits had not always been              duly recognised.
     It   was    mentioned in      the Memoir,       that Whytt         was   born    at
 Edinburgh, September 6, 1714;              he   was   the son of Robert Whytt
 of Bennochy,       a member       of the    Scottish     bar ;  he was a posthu
 mous     child,   born    six months after his        father's      death  ;  he   was
 not   yet seven years old when he lost his mother                 ;  her name was
 Murray ; she       was   the daughter     of Antony        Murray of Woodend,
 in Perthshire.        Whytt     was   sent, when still       very young,       to  the
 University of St Andrews, where at the early age of sixteen he
 took the degree of Master of Arts.               When fourteen years old he
succeeded,     by the death of his elder brother, to the family estate.
He      had   two    sisters,  who    were    married,     and    had    descendants.
 In   1730    he   repaired to Edinburgh to study medicine;                 and there
 is still extant      a manuscript     book of notes taken by him at that
period from the lectures          of George Young.            After    three or four
years devoted to medicine at Edinburgh, he proceeded                      to  London,
where he became           the pupil    of Cheselden     ;  thence to Paris, where
he studied anatomy under Winslow               ;  and thence to Leyden,          where
 Boerhaave       and Albinus were his preceptors.             Finally, in 1736, he
took the degree        of Doctor of Medicine        at Rheims.         On his return
to Scotland the University of St Andrews spontaneously conferred
on him the        same medical honour.           Having     become a fellow of the
Edinburgh College of Physicians, he commenced practice, and                        even
at so early an age he is said to have had much success.                    Soon after
he married Miss Robertson, who is described as the sister of Gene
ral Robertson, Governor of New York.                  By this lady he had two
children, who died in infancy.            Her death followed soon after. In
 1743 he married Louisa Balfour of Pilrig, whose brother afterwards
became Professor         of Moral Philosophy in the University of Edin
 burgh.      By this lady he had fourteen children, six of whom sur
 vived him.       His  second wife died in 1764, two years before himself.
 Whytt suffered severely from ill health for fifteen months before his
death, which took place, April 15, 1766.                A post-mortem examina
tion    showed    extensive    effusion in both cavities of the pleura, some
disease in the mucous membrane of the stomach, and concretions in
the pancreas.
     Whytt's first work,      " On the Virtues      of Lime- Water and Soap in
the cure of Stone,"        was published in the      Edinburgh Medical Essays
    vol. iv.                                                              4 ii

                                         572
for 1743.       It  subsequently went through several editions, and was
translated into French and German.              Though time has rendered a
great part of this work obsolete, it still merits a distinguishing             mark
in the history of science, since        Dr Black   has  left it recorded, that it
was the controversy between           Whytt and Alston respecting the most
solvent kind of lime-water,          which   led him to the examination of
calcareous     earth,   magnesia,     the alkalies, and fixed air, whence he
obtained conclusions that placed chemistry within a short period of
their date on a wholly new and extended footing.
    Whytt's next work, published in 1751,
                                                      " On the Vital and other
Involuntary Motions of Animals," fixed the attention of physiologists
throughout Europe on its author.              His more practical work " On
the Sympathy of Nerves and on Nervous, Hypochondriac,                   or Hysteric
Disorders,"     published in 1764, is a commentary on the former, and
a practical     illustration    of its doctrines.      Whence       in the present
summary both works are considered together, though in the Memoir
itself   each work is separately treated of.
    The first object of     the  Memoir, under this     head, is to show by suf
ficient proofs that Whytt was not a follower of Stahl,               — that   he was
no more an      Animist or Semianimist,        than the major part of physio
 logists  at the present    moment, — that     while  Whytt conceived it        more
conducive to simplicity to represent his sentient principle               as a part
of the soul, he expressly declares it to be superfluous to dispute
 with any one who holds doubts thereon, because                  all his views   are
 independent of that idea, and possess           the same      truth, whether the
 sentient principle be or be not accounted a part of the soul.              Further,
 that this sentient principle        being destitute of reason,       intention and
 consciousness     is really nothing but a physiological         force, united with
the nervous centre, susceptible            of being so far excited by impres
 sions brought       by the afferent      nervous fibrils, as to communicate
 motor force to the efferent nervous fibrils which proceed to con
 tractile   organs.     That    such   is exactly   the   light in which Cullen
places    Whytt's doctrine, referring        to Whytt's     own expression, that
 under the appropriate impressions, the power is as certainly deter
 mined to bring about these motions, " as is           a scale   which, by mecha
 nical laws, turns with the greatest weight."              That notwithstanding
the denial of any consciousness           in the case,   it is true that the term
sentient, and the quality of ungratefulness ascribed to the impressions
concerned, create a confusion of ideas ; but that that difficulty had

 its source        in the want of appropriate words (greater in Whytt 's time
 than now) to express the effect of physical agents on organic tissues.
 That there has always prevailed in physiology a tendency to express
 in a term not merely the property, but the cause of that property,
 which is exemplified in the contrast between the nearly synonymous
 words contractility          and irritability,        — the    former     signifying        nothing
 more than           the susceptibility      of contraction,            while     the    latter,     the
 older word, bears reference to the cause of that susceptibility.                                   That
the idea attached by Whytt to                "   sentient principle," while he denies
that it involves consciousness,             may be gathered               by some        considera
tion of what dwelt in Glisson's mind, when, speaking of the obvious
effect of impressions on the spinal cord in animals after decapitation,
he says the cord perceives              without sensation.
     The Memoir referring              to the contrast between             the effect      of   a drop
of boiling water suddenly falling on the naked foot,                              and the effect
of the sight of a drop of boiling water about to fall on the naked
foot, points out that in the latter case the foot is moved by an intel
ligible force, namely, a volition, but in the former case, by a latent
force, which          is what     Whytt calls his sentient principle.                      Further,
if it   be said, why introduce any force,                sentient or not sentient, where
nothing       is   by    any research discoverable,              that Whytt             felt himself
obliged by the usage of his age to invent an hypothesis, that some
force might seem to intervene between                     the impression on the afferent
nerve and          the   motor power imparted              to    the efferent nerve             ;   and
that    if   he had      felt himself at liberty to omit this hypothesis, his
view would have been in general terms exactly that of the present
day. — namely, that impressions made on the peripheral extremities
of afferent          nerves   are    reflected through           the    nervous centre              into
motor influence, transferable by efferent nerves to contractile organs.
Again, that the modern                view does    not reject the idea of                a force     in
tervening between the impressions and the reflected                          motor influence,
but merely omits all mention of                  it,   because       the connection        between
the impression and the subsequent                 motion        is   not spoken    of in relation
to   cause     and effect, but merely as the observed                       law of an ante
cedent and consequent, whence                that Whytt's mode of thinking does
not in general           terms differ from the modern view, except that he
attempted to solve            a     difficulty which the         modern view declines to
meddle       with.
     The Memoir, however, affords another reason why Whytt felt

                                        574
obliged to interpose an active cause between the impression                 on   the
 afferent nerve and the motor influence in the efferent nerve, inas
 much as no consistent attempt had then been made to assign separate
 offices to particular    parts of the nervous centre        ;   and the idea that
a part    of the tissue of the nerves and brain (such           as the white fibres
 in both), might be merely conducting cords, while another part. such
as the grey substance, might         be the     exclusive origin of force, had
not then arisen, whence, as he himself states, that his view was un
satisfactory to explain why an afferent nerve bringing an impres
sion from an external part to one point of the nervous centre, should
have its effect    reflected into an efferent nerve arising            at a distant
point of the same centre, unless some influence pervading the whole
nervous centre, and therefore the space between the two nerves, were
the exciting    force, such as his sentient principle.
     The Memoir further        shows,   that though Whytt did not attempt
to assign separate offices       to separate parts of the nervous centre,
understood as       including   the encephalon and spinal marrow,               yet,
when explaining the movements in decapitated animals, he suggests
the idea that the spinal cord may be capable of independent action,
as in tortoises, which live months after being deprived              of the brain   ;
while it also affords proof that though Whytt made no pretensions
to improve the anatomy of his age as respects              the nervous system,
he was the authority       referred to for seventy years for the hypothesis
now recognised       as an important      fact, — namely,       that the ultimate
fibrils of the nerves, amidst all their combinations into cords, plex
uses, and the like,      pass  unb ranched    and    isolated from their     origin
to their    termination.      Again, it is maintained that this hypothesis
could not fail by a single step to suggest the division of the nervous
system into conducting         cords and centres of force, and therefore to
lead    to the perception of the probable           analogy between       the gan
glionic system in the invertebral         animals and the nervous centre in
the vertebrata.
     The sum of Whytt's view          is next    exhibited     in the Memoir in
contrast with the matured state of the same doctrine in the present
day, in as far as regards the non-vital involuntary            movements, — viz.,
the closing of the pupil under a strong light ; the shutting of the
eyelid when the eye is threatened ; the adjustment of the mem
branes of the internal ear by the muscles of the tympanum to the
variations of sound ; the act of respiration, and its modifications,

                                                           575
sneezing, cough, hiccup, vomiting, deglutition,                                  the evacuation of the
bowels and bladder, and such acts as the                                  sudden       withdrawal        of the
foot when a drop of boiling                         water falls on it.            It    is further       shown
that in such acts generally, there is a consciousness                                       of the impres
sion and          a consciousness             of the muscular act determined by                          it,   but
that there            is   no consciousness                of the exercise of any intervening
power, or of the effect of what Whytt terms the sentient principle.
It    further stated, that while the discovery of numerous
      is                                                                                                 before
unnoticed relations between the several parts of the nervous                                             system
has       largely      explained          the conformation                of the nervous organism,
there has not been             a        corresponding            advance    in   the knowledge of the
activities therein operative, so that the same                                    forms of expression
are applicable to Whytt's system and to the matured state which his
views have now assumed.
     The Memoir             goes on to state that                 Unzer      was       the first who fol
lowed Whytt                in such a mode of considering                         nervous action          ;   that
while       it   is   acknowledged that Unzer's book                        is   one    of great ability,
it   is   a mistake to        think that his reflex action of nerves                         is   an advance
upon Whytt's,              — that       it   is,   on the contrary,         retrograde, as the reflex
action which he describes                      is   made        dependent on communications of
nerves       in   their course analagous to the explanation                              given      by   Willis
of sympathy.                That Prochaska                 did make        a   considerable advance             ;
that reflex action in his hands has its seat in the common sensorium
or cranio-spinal              axis, or excludes                   the cerebrum           and cerebellum,
while he describes                      as a law written on the medullary                         pulp of the
sensorium, — that              is, it
                                         principle or force, though
                                        he ascribes        it    to no
his expression implies the latent existence of such a principle or
force.  That Marshall Hall      entitled not only to the credit of
                                                      is
having given            a   new impulse to the study of this part of physiology,
but of having made the great advance of showing that each segment
of the spinal cord and medulla oblongata possesses                                      a   separate power
of imparting reflex action to the nervous fibrils which originate
in    it,
     whenever certain impressions are brought to that segment                                                   by
afferent nerves which terminate there.
     In     reference to Whytt's views of sympathy which belong to the
second of the works mentioned before, his sympathetic                                         actions come
under the same               head        as the non-vital                involuntary        motions, or de
pend        on    impressions            reflected into            motions       through      the nervous
centre.           The sympathetic                  sensations      are either the result           of mental

                                           576
.states acting on the        nervous centre, and thence on nerves of sense,
or   sensations     produced through        one set of nerves       reacting on other
nerves     of   the   same    character.     The latter     idea   is  manifestly     the
same as what          in modern times has been termed the radiation                     of
sensation.
    With respect        to  Whytt's controversy with Haller, and the several
papers published thereon, it referred to the dependence or non-
dependence        of irritability, now termed contractility,          on nerves, — the
former opinion          being maintained       by Whytt,      the latter    by Haller.
This subject       was largely experimented         on by   Whytt,      whose   mode of
thinking gained many converts in his own time and in subsequent
years.       It has happened, however, that Haller's views in this
particular     prevail at the present time, with this understanding,             — that
though the contractility          of the organs concerned in the vegetative
functions is not regarded as dependent on nerves, yet the organs of
all such      functions     are  believed   to be very largely         modified   by   an
influence derived from nerves.
    As   the    Memoir itself       is of considerable      length,    and is mainly
devoted     to the elucidation       of the two works above         referred to, what
has   just  been said gives but an imperfect           idea of the entire character
of  these principal        works of Whytt.
    The Memoir concludes with             some    notice of his other papers,        and
in particular       with a short view of his posthumous work on                    acute
hydrocephalus,         on   which, in several particulars,         he is an original
authority.
    3.  On a difficulty          in the     Theory of Rain.             By James
                                  Dalmahoy, Esq.
    The difficulty       which    the paper discusses      is the paradoxical fact
discovered by       Dr Heberden, — namely, that if there            be three exactly
similar rain-gauges, and one of them be placed on the ground, the
second on the roof of a neighbouring house, and the third on a still
higher     edifice,    then, notwithstanding         every variety       in  the   posi
tions of these gauges as respects             surrounding     objects, and notwith
standing the prevalence of the opposite conditions of high wind and
of absolute calm, it is observed that the lowest gauge receives more
rain than the middle one, and                the  middle gaugo more rain than
the upper one.
    The paper endeavours           to show the inadequacy        of the   explanations

                                        577
 which have      hitherto been    given     of this difficulty,     and  quotes, on
this point, the authority of Sir      John Herschel.           It then proceeds to
 prove, both theoretically     and by observation, the existence of a slow
 downward current of air mingled with minute globules of water, the
 current    itself being the effect of the rain, and originating in the
 cloud from which the rain proceeds.                The twofold agency of this
 downward current in producing           the paradoxical        results is then ex
 plained  ;   and the paper concludes with a numerical estimate, the
 object of which is to prove that the quantity of water which it is
 necessary to assume as being contained in a given volume of the
 atmosphere, at a given time, in order to account for even the more
 remarkable results on record, is too small to give rise to the appear
ance of cloud ; and so, by proving this, to obviate what would other
 wise have been a formidable        objection to the proposed explanation
 of the phenomenon.
 4.  On the Structure of the Bark of              Araucaria imbricata, with
    special reference to Paleontology.                   By John Hutton Bal
    four, A.M., M.D , F.R.S., Sec. R.S.E., Professor of Medicine
    and Botany.
    The frost of December 1860          caused serious damage to trees and
shrubs in the Botanic Garden           of Edinburgh.          On the morning of
 24th December,       Fahrenheit's     thermometer        stood at 6° below zero,
according to the Kew standard.             An account of       the  injury inflicted
has been already published in the Transactions               of the Botanical So
ciety   of Edinburgh.        It  has   been     stated   that the great      cold  in
the garden, as compared with other places near Edinburgh, may be
accounted for by its low sheltered situation, and the descent of the
heavy cold atmosphere from the more elevated localities around.
     Among the plants which suffered were               two very fine specimens
of Araucaria imbricata, which had            stood for upwards of      thirty years,
and one of which had        attained     the   height of 24^ feet, with a cir
cumference       of 4 feet at the base        of the stem, and with twenty
whorls of branches.        These    trees, which       were   great ornaments of
the lawn in front of tho range of hothouses,                have been cut down.
An    opportunity     was thus afforded        of examining       the  structure   of
their wood and bark.          The former        is  very hard and heavy, and
promises to be valuable timber.            In    regard to the latter, the scars

                                          578
and    markings,     and    their  relation    to   the leaves,   seem     to   deserve
special notice.        The sharp-pointed          triangular hard       and    spirally
arranged leaves are remarkably           persistent.      None     of the plants in
the garden have ever shed their leaves.               They   become     sometimes of
a brown colour    ;   but even then they continue to adhere to the stem,
and appear as unsightly           appendages.         In  one   of the plants       cut
down the leaves       show a splitting at the base,          apparently      from dis
tension in the parts underneath, similar to what takes place in the
petioles  of many palms before they are detached.                It  is possible that,
in the   Araucaria, the splitting of the basis of the            leaves may some
times be the precursor          of their fall.       From   the lower part       of the
leaves   prolongations      extend along the surface of the bark, and give
rise to peculiar     markings, which are well seen when the leaves are
cut off close to their union with the stem (fig. 1).                The   base of the
                                        Fig.  1.
leaf remaining      in the bark       has    the form of a narrow elongated
ellipse, surrounded by cortical foliar prolongations.                 The markings
on   the bark, viewed externally, have a somewhat oblique quadri
lateral form.     The leaves, when examined              by the microscope, show
stomata   on both surfaces, running         in lines, not unlike the appearance
presented by stomata in Equiseta.
     On removing        the   epiphlceum or outer bark,        and examining its
inner surface,   we    remark a difference         in the appearance presented
at the lower and upper part of the stem.                   In the lower       portions
the markings     have     an  irregular elliptical form, with        a deep depres-

                                      579
sion, and   fissures where the leaves       are   attached (fig. 2).   Higher
up the epiphlcoal markings       assume      rather more of a quadrilateral
                                    Fig. 2.
form, with the depressions less deep, and the fissures for the leaves
giving off prolongations   on    either side.       Farther up the markings
are smaller     in size, obliquely-quadrilateral,        and present circular
dots along the boundary       lines    chiefly   (fig. 3).   Higher   still the
                                     Fig. 3.
quadrilateral    form becomes more apparent, and the dots disappear
(fig.  4).   The epiphloeum thus presents differences in its markings
at different heights on the stem.
    The middle part of the bark, or mesophloeum, is well developed,
and is of a spongy consistence. When examined microscopically it
is seen to be composed     of cells of various       shapes — some elongated

                                                                                 be
variety of forms is very great, and it is possible that this may
partly owing to the effects of frost on the cells.          On the spontaneous
                                      Fig.  4.
                                                                  consist of dis
separation of the bark, the mesophloeum was seen to
tinct plates of a more or less quadrilateral form, with some of the
                                                          centre indicating     the
edges concave and others convex, a part in the
connection with the leaf, along with which it is detached.                In   Fig.
                      5 a leaf is shown with a mesophlceal              plate at
                      tached.
                          The endophlceum, liber or inner bark,             is of a
                      fibrous nature, and consists of elongated              woody
                      tubes.
                          The appearances presented by the outer and
                       middle bark of Araucaria imbricata bear a
                       marked resemblance           to those exhibited     by cer
                       tain fossils    included in the genera Sigillaria and
                       Lepidodendron.           The   sculpturesque     markings
                       on the stems      of   these fossil plants  have induced
                      geologists to look upon them as allied                 to the
                       ferns and lycopods of the present epoch.                 But
                       it is evident, from the         specimens   of Araucaria
                       now laid before the Society, that much caution is
                       required     in making this determination.             Other
                      points     of   structure     must be examined         before
a proper    decision  can    be   formed    ;   when,  for  instance,    the pre
sence   of scalariform     tissue,    or   of punctated      woody    tissue    has
been satisfactorily  shown under the microscope, we are entitled                  to

                                          581
 hazard       an opinion    as to the    affinities  of the fossils.      In  many
 instances, however, external appearances are the only data on which
 to rely for the determination            of fossil genera     and   species  ; and
 rash conclusions have often been drawn by geologists who have not
 been conversant with the structure of plants.
     The Araucaria markings point out the              need  of care in drawing
 conclusions, and their variation at different parts of the bark indi
 cate the danger of a rash decision as to species.               There can be no
 doubt that in vegetable palaeontology the number of species                    has
  been     needlessly    multiplied — any    slight  variation   in form having
  been    reckoned sufficient for specific distinction.         We can conceive
 that the Araucaria bark markings in a fossil state might easily supply
 several species       of Sigillaria, or of Lepidodendron.         The geologist,
 with little knowledge of the present flora of the globe, ventures
 often     to    decide on   an isolated fragment,       which   a  well-informed
 botanist would hesitate to characterise.            Hence    the crude descrip
 tions of fossil vegetable forms, and the confusion in which Palaeophy-
 tology      is involved.      Every geologist who examines fossil plants
 ought to be well acquainted with the minute structure of living
 plants, the forms of their roots, stems, leaves, fronds, and fructifica
 tions  ;   the markings on the outer and inner surfaces of their barks,
 on  their     stems,  and on their rhizomes; the localities in which they
 grow,     and the climates which genera and species             affect in various
 parts of the world.

 2. On the Carboniferous             Volcanic Rocks of the Basin of the
               Forth.      By Archibald Geikie, Esq., F.R S.
     After referring      to a previous      communication       to the Society, in
 which the author had           given   an   outline of the chronology         of  the
 igneous rocks of Scotland, he proceeded             in the present paper to       de
 scribe in detail the character of the volcanic            phenomena in one dis
 trict — that of     the   carboniferous    system of the Forth basin.            The
 igneous rocks of this district consist partly of doleritic               and felspa-
 thic lava-form       masses,   and partly of various kinds of ash or trap-
 tuff.    These materials present a considerable diversity in their modes
 of arrangement.          But the author had found that all the volcanic
 hills of the district might be      reduced     to three types   of structure : — 1.
 A simple cone of ash, round          and    over which the ordinary sedimen
tary accumulation of the carboniferous period had been deposited.                   2.
A    cone of ash with the crater       filled up by a neck or plug of basalt.
 3.    Sheets of different     lavas with intercalated        ash   or sedimentary
matter.
     He described in detail the succession of volcanic phenomena in
the Lothians and in Fife, pointing out how local and limited the
eruptions had been as a whole.              They were confined to the earlier
half of the carboniferous period,         no   interbedded igneous rock having
yet been       found   in   the formations       that  overlie the    carboniferous
limestone.        The whole of this district        appears to have been dotted

                                               583
over with volcanic cones,                 from each of which independent eruptions
took place.           To   such       a   kind of       scenery    the nearest parallel       in
Europe         is probably     the region of Auvergne                   and the Haute Loire,
which the author had recently visited for the purpose of comparison.
The concluding part of the paper was devoted to a sketch of the
subterranean movements of upheaval and depression which can be
shown to have taken place during                       the volcanic period in the basin of
the Forth, and to some remarks on the abundance of life in the im
mediate vicinity of the volcanic orifices.

     ence to the Proportion which Male Life bears relatively
     to Female Life, and the Effects of an Excess of Female
     Life. By W. T. Thomson, Esq.

the excess of females has upon the condition and moral well-being
of   society       in this country.

        Of   these there were born                    —

     " The proportion           between              male and female births is found by ob
servation not to differ at any time materially                                from the results here
quoted for a single year, although the variation in different localities
is peculiar      ;   and there        is,   it   will      be perceived, an unexplainable             dif
ference in the relative proportions among legitimate and illegitimate

males being born than females, that male life preponderated both
in England and Scotland but the state of the entire population, as

ever   may have been the relative                            proportions      at birth, the actual
condition of the country, comparing males with females,                                   is   very dif
ferent in its results."

satisfy the most casual observer that the great design of Providence
in providing         a   larger number of males than females                        has been frus
trated."

    " This     abnormal    state    of society has arisen chiefly from two
causes   :—
        The greater mortality of male life           as compared      with female
           life, more particularly in early years, and
        The emigration of      a larger number      of males than females."
    " I  shall now endeavour to prove that these causes of disorganisa
tion exist."
                    The greater      Mortality of Male Life.
    [Mr    Thomson here exhibited a table showing the population,
deaths,   and    mortality generally in England and Wales from 1838
to 1844, a period during which the mortality was not disturbed by
 epidemics.]
    " It  will   be perceived,"      he proceeded,     " that from birth to five
 years of age, male children died during the seven years at the rate
 of 7'072 per cent., and female children              at the rate of 6-037        per
 cent., the actual numbers dying            having    been   517,897 males and
 446,910 females.         From five to ten years the difference was not so
 great between the sexes, 61,659 males to 59,903 females.                      From
 ten to thirty-five (the principal period of child-bearing) the female
 mortality was somewhat greater.                The male mortality then in
 creased,   and continued greater till the close of life."
    " The feature which first attracts attention in
                                                               considering these
 results is the great mortality in the early years of male life.            70,000
 male children were lost during the first five years of life, that being
 the excess of male deaths as compared with the deaths among females.
 Similar results will     be found to obtain      year by year in other years,
 according to the reports of the registrar,          and such a loss cannot fail
 to have a most prejudicial         effect on the condition of society      ;  it not
 only drains     away the natural        excess  of males provided by God's
 providence,     but, by    the greater mortality of males, an excess of
female life is left prejudicial       to the wellbeing    of females themselves,
and   of  males    also.   It   is impossible that this infringement of the
laws of nature can lead to any but one result — it has led to im
morality and suffering, and will continue to do so              ; for it is not for
one moment to be supposed            that it was the intention of the Deity to
create male children       in excess to be swept away within a few years
after entering      life.    But, indeed, the     excess   of male   deaths   is not
the sole measure of evil, for no doubt female mortality is also greater
than   it should   be ; and, in    like manner, the male       deaths,  were they

                                                 586
   only equal to the female           deaths, would also be greatly in excess of
   what they should be.              It  is a sad state of matters — a national
   calamity, and demands           attention."
       " Again,             thirty-five years of                        of life, the male
                    above                              age to the end
   deaths bear an unfavourable comparison with the females.                      Men sink
   exhausted, worn out, leaving widows and young children to increase
   our difficulties.      The    loss  of infant life     is a great  evil, but the loss
   of man in the prime of life is          a  greater.     No  one can   fill the father's
   place in a poor man's home            ;   his death is frequently an immediate
  fall from     competence      to destitution.         The struggle is for existence,
  and children        are brought       up,    if reared at all, weak in body and
   mind, oftener indeed cut off by disease,              helping to fill up in rotation
  the death-roll of our Juggernaut, which                   year by year demands its
  sacrifice.      If  they survive, the want of means              denies them educa
  tion, and they are often left a legacy to fill our             jails and poor-houses.
  A   few   years added       in the aggregate to male lives would create                a
  great change in all this;            widows would be reduced          in number, and
  many children now thrown helpless on the world would be supported
  and educated        in their earlier       years.     Our unnatural      position   acts
  and reacts to our disadvantage, and the excess of male deaths at the
  periods    shown is an ever fruitful source of sin and misery."
      " If this   is bad in   England, it      is worse in Scotland.       That country
 has many other difficulties also to contend with peculiar to its posi
  tion ; but as I afterwards propose to limit my observations to that
 country,      I shall reserve further remark."
      In order      to prove that       the increased death rate among males
 was    not increased by special or local causes,                 Mr   Thomson     intro
 duced     a   table showing that the           results over the whole of England
 are much the same, exhibiting              a greater mortality     almost universally
 among the male sex.
      Also    a table taken from         the    returns of the Registrar-General,
 exhibiting the per-centage of deaths among males and females during
 twenty years, with the relative proportions which these deaths bear
to each other, proving           at the same time that the greater             mortality
among male lives is constant.
     These tables proved conclusively                the first proposition,     that the
mortality of male life is greater in England than that of female
life.     Mr    Thomson      then proceeded         to show what causes        have pro
duced these results        : —

    " The     diseases    of which    men die      in greater     proportion    than
women, thus appear to be those               which    arise from exposure,       bad
habits, overwork of mind and body, accidents, violent deaths                 ; while
the male infant        seems    to have an unaccountable tendency to fatal
diseases,   which are less destructive in the female child."
    (The author here introduced a table, showing the causes of death
in Scotland at different periods of life, under ten years, from all dis
eases, in 1856.
    This table      showed    an excess    of male deaths at every period of
age, and by every one         of the  diseases specified, viz   : —

the total result being 14,053 male deaths to 12,314 female deaths

    " The principal       diseases   which   occasion death      in children,"   Mr
Thomson       continued,
                            "  are zymotic     diseases, diseases    of respiration
and digestion, tubercular          diseases,  and general debility; but there
seems to be nothing         yet known connected       with the principal causes
of death that can account for              a  greater    mortality     among   male
children than among female.
    " On this part of the subject            I   shall not dwell, the facts are
sufficient for my purpose in this paper.               I have given one table of
 diseases   from English observation, and the other from Scotch obser
vation, to show the identity of result in both countries."

     " There    is no want    of proof under this    head   but   I must endeavour
 to make that proof so conclusive, that there can be no question on the
 point.     I   shall   therefore   take my figures entirely         from Govern
 ment sources, and leave them to speak for themselves."
     (Here Mr Thomson exhibited            a table which proved distinctly       the

                                       589
immense loss to this country of male lite which has taken place in
consequence     of emigration   — the      total  loss   having   been   272,416
 males during the ten years 1848 to 1857 in excess of females, and
upwards of 40,000 in 1858, 1859, and 1860 — men generally,                        if
not invariably, in the prime of life, full of health and strength.
   The total of emigration        from the United Kingdom during these
ten years was stated to be 1,443,382 males and 1,183,430 females,
besides  125,956    whose    sex   was   not distinguished.        Also, that in
1858, 1859, and 1860, the male emigration amounted                    to 202,347
persons, and the female emigration to 159,424 persons.
   Mr   Thomson    illustrated   this point still further by reference to
the population of different colonies.)

   " The   census  of 1857 discloses some remarkable facts respecting
the disparity of sexes in Victoria, which is thus noticed by Sir
Henry Barkly in his despatch transmitting a portion of the tables.
   " It  now appears that, though         considerable    improvement    in this
respect took place between 1854            and 1857, yet that the effective
disproportion   at the latter    period was far more serious than would
be deducible from the fact       of there being 163 males to every 100
females in the entire population.           Since iabling the portion of it
above the age of twenty years there were no less than 217 males to
that number — the proportions          below that age being pretty nearly
equal.
   " The effect of this                       be more clearly deduced      from
                           disparity may
the tables relating    to the conjugal condition         of the people, which
show   that there were 88-355 unmarried              men of twenty years of
age and upwards to but      12'545 unmarried women of corresponding

                                        591
ages    ;  or, to raise the age of marriage for men to twenty-one, and
lower it to fifteen for women, there was still an excess           of 61,859
bachelors, not to add 5112 widowers.
     " Even this comparison, however, fails        to convey a   full sense of
the evil as it affects the gold fields, where it appears that the per
centage       of unmarried     men is to that   to be found in the seaport
 towns as 61 to 39; or, to state the case in another form — where the
 bachelors are to the spinsters in the proportion          of more than 20
 to    1.    There    are, moreover,    8096   married  men, chiefly    in the
 mining districts, whose wives are not in the colony."
     "  It  is no doubt true that this excess     of male life is all above a
 certain      age, according   to the age   of the colony, the deficiency of
 females having arisen from the       greater emigration of males originally ;
 and it is to be admitted,       that as the native growth      of population
 increases, a normal state       of life with reference to the proportion of
 males and females will arise ;          but in the meantime      it occasions
 great social evils, which afflict most severely the mother country."
                                 General Results.
      (Mr Thomson here exhibited an elaborate table showing the
 relative proportions of males and females of twenty years of age and
  upwards in England and Wales taken from the census of 1851; also
  the proportion of births, marriages, and deaths to 100 persons living,
  likewise children born out of wedlock to 100 births throughout each
  county.)
      " There are curious variations in the results shown in different
 counties and districts,       and east, west, north, and   south, yield very
  different     proportions  ; but the grand total for England and Wales
  may be read thus       : —
      For every 100      males there were 108-11 females in England and
          Wales at the census of 1851.
      For every 100 bachelors lOl'l 3 spinsters.
      For every 100 husbands 101-31 wives.
      For every 100 widowers 198-18 widows.
      For every 100 persons living there were (1850 to 1857) 3 399
          births.
      For every 100 inhabitants there were (1857) '824 marriages.
      For every 100 persons living there were (1857) 2-175 deaths.
      And out of every 100 births there were (1857) 6-5 children born
          out  of wedlock.

                                                 592
      " It will     be found, when we afterwards come to consider the results
  in Scotland, that female life is very greatly in excess                     of male life
  proportionally          as    compared       with   England     ;  that  the  unmarried
  females and widows are in much larger proportion                       ; and that illegi
  timacy prevails          to    a wider extent      — the    result of the comparison
  being that there is more illegitimacy                 where there is a greater excess
  of female life      ;  but, although       I draw   this general conclusion,    I cannot,
  in considering the table referred to above, or the table applicable                      to
  Scotland which follows, prove in detail                   that in every county where
  there is an excess of females there is an excess of bastardy.                     I  must
  ask my readers to take the wider view                   of our condition, and deal,      as
 a whole, with the comparative effects, for there are many acting and
 reacting influences in operation in particular localities which produce
  results very different            from    those   we anticipated.        We must     mass
 the results, and the comparison                    of Scotland and England is on           a
 sufficiently large scale to give us               confidence in our conclusions.
      " As an example of the difficulty of
                                                              drawing conclusions from
 limited       or   local    facts,    let us    consider    London.       We find there
  120-53       females for 100 males, 125                  spinsters to 100 bachelors,
 and 296'86 widows for 100 widowers, with                          only 4'2 children born
 out of wedlock to 100 births.                   The hasty conclusion would be, that
 London is more moral than the whole of England, for we find, in
 running        our eye       down      the    bastardy column,        that the return of
 illegitimate        children     is less than       for any county      in England, and
 more than 2 per cent. less than the average                      for the whole kingdom.
 I   am afraid that that conclusion will not stand investigation.                       I do
 not mean to say that the solution                     of the problem is an easy one,
 but    I    do not think the deduction, based                  on   a purer   morality,   is
 correct.        It   is more than          probable    that   the great prevalence of
 prostitution         has    the     effect   of diminishing        child-bearing   among
 unmarried persons            ;  and    I  have no doubt that every large town           will
 show the same          result."
     "  I have      now shown —
     "  1.   That the male births           exceed the females in a certain propor
tion, which,         in the state        of this country, may be called a constant

our wives are deserted               ;     our marriages are deficient                        ;    illegitimacy       is
    rampant; and from all this flow many crimes.
         " After carefully considering                these         sad        figures, and having given
    much attention to the Report of the Registrar-General of Scotland,
    my strong conviction             is,   that the excess                of female life             is   mainly at
    the root of that great evil — illegitimacy.                          I      have no doubt that local
    customs and habits increase                it,   and that race has something more or
    less to do with its extent              in particular counties                 ;     but the root of all
    is   our abnormal position, already explained.                                 It    is       not very easy to
    separate the races which have                     peopled Scotland                  ;   but to those who
    know the appearance of the inhabitants, their customs and manners,
    in different parts of Scotland,                  it     will,   I     think,        appear       a    task which
    at least, probably,         may be performed.                        But without attempting any
    minute         classification,    and     keeping in view what
                                              merely                      already                         is

   the most casual observer, that the north and west give very different

        "Holding, then, illegitimacy                   to be   a    blot on our national character,
   which has been proved, and                    is    admitted, and assuming that                              it

   duced and increased by our abnormal condition and the other causes
        *   The table given by Mr Thomson exhibited the results for each county.

                                             595
above stated,       let us at once proceed to consider what are the means
which may be adopted to cure the evil and its consequences,                       which
are so many and so grievous.                  I  would consider the question from
two points of view         :—
    "  1.  With reference to the existing excess of female life.
    "  2. With reference to the loss of male life.
    "  We have also         to keep   in view the question of local customs, and
the habits        of the people generally, as bearing on morals.                   The
question    of    race,  I   am   afraid,   I   must leave for further inquiry and
discussion      ;  but  I  anticipate we must give the moral crown to the
Celt — our Celtic         race    showing       certainly,   if  we   may judge from
figures, a higher code of morals than the Northman and Saxon.
    " The first      and most obvious call, not upon Scotland, but upon the
Government of the country, is to promote respectable female emi
gration.          I  am awaro that endeavours have been made to do this,
not only       by    the Emigration Commissioners,                but  by the colonies
themselves,        but it has       never been attended to            on a sufficiently
                                                                              '
extended scale.           Both at home and abroad, comfortable                  homes,'
with    adequate      superintendence, should be provided by the Govern
ment, and that superintendence                  should be by means of local com
mittees partly composed              of ladies, in correspondence with similar
committees throughout the whole country.                       Proper matrons should
accompany each ship,             and pains should          be taken    to preserve the
highest moral tone, from the time of leaving home till the final des
 tination of the emigrants is reached.                  I  am aware that great diffi
culties have arisen in carrying out such arrangements already, when
tried   ;  but    I   am convinced, that under a proper system, and with
the assistance of the colonies themselves, the scheme could be more
effectually carried out.            All   ladies should      take an interest in such
a scheme         for the     sake  of their     sex  ; and the money of the nation
and its colonies should be freoly expended to bring about a result,
beneficial alike to the mother country and to the colonies themselves.
    " In   illustration      of the urgent demand for females in Otago, New
Zealand,       I   beg   attention     to the following       memorandum, which         I
have received        from the agent in Edinburgh for emigration                 to that
colony, while writing this paper              : —

 Excess of males,
   "The       population         had increased in             July   1861 to about 15,000,
from excess of births over deaths, but chiefly from emigration                                       from
Great Britain.             I   have no tables to give showing the numbers                                of
males and females comprising                        this number         15,000       ;   but    I    know
that from the greater                 number of males who               have passed            through
this office, the table,          if   I could   give    it,   would show that the evil had
gone on increasing             in an alarming ratio.
   " In July 1861 gold was                      discovered         in Otago, which             immedi
ately caused          a   rush to the province from the neighbouring                                settle
ments.   The gold discoveries have not as yet much affected the
emigration from Britain, but   perceive signs which make me be
                                               I
lieve that   large number will leave in the spring and summer

   Note. — There were, in 1851, 659,084             females alive in Scotland
below 20 years of age, and 854,179 above 20.              Of these, 136,163
below 20, and 365,234 above 20, were engaged industrially;
964,533 were wives, mothers, children, and others domestically
engaged ; and 47,333 were annuitants, dependent persons, and per
sons of no stated occupation.
    " It will   be perceived that a very large number       of females  endea
vour     to support    themselves;   and   I   think it probable    they    have
found the kinds of occupation most congenial to them.                 I am     no
believer in the      industrial  employment      of women, by forcing     them
into employments where the labour           is fully supplied by men.        The
point cannot be forced.         Some instances may be found where men
are in their wrong position, when women should be employed                ;   but
it is  a complete fallacy to suppose     that you can place women, indus
trially, wherever you think right, without the will of the public and
the concurrence of the masters.         These things regulate themselves ;

                                         599
and, with the pressure of female labour in the market, women would
have forced men out         of occupation fitted for them long          ago,   if they
were better suited for such particular occupations than men.                     Many
weak arguments have been used in this good cause, but the whole
question is       more a fundamental        one    than is generally imagined.
Wo must restore the balance of female life,                and put woman, as        far
as possible, in her true place      — as  the helpmate of man, not as a com
petitor for toil and labour.
    " Marriage      is woman's true mission, and it should bo part of our
great scheme of reformation to keep her in that position as much as
possible.
    " But how stands Scotland in                       to  '
                                                             marriage ?'     Lament
                                           respect
able is her case, indeed, as compared with England.                    The tables     I
have given for England and Scotland                illustrate   this fully   ;  and by
reference to them you will find, that while in England the marriages
in 1857 were as -824 to 100 inhabitants,                the proportion in Scotland
in 1859 was only -676 to the same number.                     Again, the marriages
in Scotland      were   later in life, and therefore less favourable to that
moral    condition which early marriage            creates,   fosters, and perpetu
ates.    The following are       the figures   :—

    " No   doubt, where two countries approximate, or rather join each
 other,   speaking the same language, and living under the same

  laws, the richer country will attract the male population to engage
  in trade, &c. ; and this element must be kept in view in comparing
  Scotland and England ; but it does not affect the question             I am now
  putting, except in so far as Scotchmen          wandering to England may
  prefer an English to a Scotch wife.           But  I would deduce    from these
  figures, and from observations made otherwise, the benefits of early
  marriages.
      " But these remedies are all systematic,
                                                      requiring time to    develop
 them    ; meanwhile,      the evil   which    we   find  prevails    amongst    us
  should be promptly        met by remedial      measures.     It  is   a difficult
  matter to suggest remedies for immediate relief, seeing how funda
  mentally our system is deranged ; but, at the risk of being charged
  with over-zeal,   I  shall venture to make a few suggestions.
     " 1st, then, An
                        illegitimate child should      be under the supervision
 of the parochial      authorities,   whether the parents can support it or
 not, and each county should be assessed for these children as far               as
 not supported by the parents by a separate assessment.                   By advo
 cating that illegitimate children should be under the immediate super
 vision of the parochial authorities,      I do  not mean that they should       be
 supported by the parish when the parents can do so, but              I mean   that
 the fate of each child      born out of wedlock in the parish           should  be
 carefully watched, even although it entailed more expense and respon
 sibility than at present.        It  may be argued, that by placing          more
 responsibility  on the parochial authorities       than at present we would
 increase the evil   ;  but even   if such   were at first the tendency,      I am
 firmly convinced that child-murder* would be less common when the
 parochial authorities had cognizance of such children, while the burden
 thrown on the landlords        would rouse them not only to attend more
 to the position of the labouring class around them, but would be an
inducement to them to urge the clergy to be fully alive to the
spread of laxity of morals throughout            their parishes, thereby ulti
 mately securing a     better state of things.
     " 2d, Our clergy ought to be much in the houses of their pa
rishioners ; not as mere formal visitors, but as the best and nearest
    * By a return made to the House of Commons in 1861, it appeared that
from 31st December 1855 to 31st December 1860, the number of coroners'
inquests held upon the bodies of infants within the Metropolitan District
(London) alone were 3901, — namely, on males, 2082; females,             1816; sex
unknown, 3.

friends of the family  — the   physicians   of their souls.    Unless the
minister is the kind and affectionate father of his parishioners,      fol
lowing his avocation day by day, making         his religion a daily work,
one great   source of aid in putting down such evils as are prevalent
in Scotland must be awanting.
    " 3d,  To the landed proprietor      — to   the manufacturer  — to  all
masters and mistresses, we must appeal for aid.
    " To the landed proprietor   we would say, instead of bothies for
males and females, let all single men         and   women be boarded,     if
possible, with the married couples, giving sufficient room to keep all
pure  ; or let there be separate houses for men and women, where
they may mess and live together under some superintendence.
    " We
          might also, under this    head, appeal to the heavy charge for
poor-rate   as an argument    for exertion on the part of all who are
taxed.

giving an account of the number of paupers in 646 unions and
parishes at the end of the first half year of 1860.

 under 16, and 1737 vagrants      ;  the men thus forming 20 per cent.,
 the women     44-1, the children    35 7.    Of   these  338,497 are  de
 scribed as able-bodied  (including    the children of the able-bodied) ;
 and concerning 303,797 of these, information is supplied by 629
 unions of the causes which brought them on the poor-rates.

    " 4th, To mistresses,        and    the female sex in general, whether of
high    or low degree,       we      must look for great aid              in this work of
reform.
    " We must now return              to our second         head, — namely, the loss of
male life.
    "I    havo   already shown you the diseases                     of which men       die in
greater proportion        than      women.          These are — congenital         diseases,
atrophy, debility, kidney disease, delirium tremens, apoplexy, para
lysis, convulsions, and diseases of the brain, bronchitis, pleurisy,
pneumonia, asthma, accident, suicide, and a long list of others, iuom
of them arising from a depraved constitution and exposure, aggra
vated    in many instances by bad habits, and transmitted,                          through
the effects of such       habits, by the male to his male children, whose
conformation      render them,         I    understand        from medical men, more
susceptible of disease        in infancy.            If  man would reflect that his
diseases, and    I  may add        his habits and their            constitutional    effects,
may    be transmitted       through         many generations,            he   would surely

                                       603
 pause   in his career, for such constitutional       effects are   greatly the
 causes   of the great mortality in early life. This mortality in Great
  Britain, and in all countries where it obtains, is a national sin, and
 to it the attention of philanthropists,     and all men anxious to benefit
 their race, should be directed.
     " I  have not touched on sanitary defects,      as they    apply   to both
 male and female, but to that point also attention            is urgently re
 quired.
    "  The drain upon the country by foreign wars is not to             be  for
 gotten     among other causes which consume our male population.
 War,    I   am afraid, we must acknowledge as a necessity, but if that
 were the only drain       upon our resources, we could, by the natural
 law of birth, meet it   ; and may it not be said that the greater num
 ber   of male children      born than female is to meet       the decrement
 arising from accident and war.
     " But to revert to the
                                      original  statements     with   which    I
 started  : —
     " In Scotland, at last   census,  there were
                                1,614,269 females
                           and  1,446,982 males
                                  167,287    excess  of females.
 An army of male lives has thus disappeared, without taking into
account the difference of 5 per cent, with which the males originally
started.
    "  In England     and Wales, at last census, there were
                              10,302,873 females
                           and 9,758,852 males
                                  551,021    excess of females.
Upwards       of half  a million males lost, without taking into account
the original 5    per cent in favour of male life.
    " These two differences show what        we have thrown     away by pre
mature      death among males, and what we have lost by emigration,
allowing 5 per cent. to stand for casualties to which men are ex
posed by war and otherwise.            A lamentable conclusion, and parti
cularly    so as regards Scotland.

a deflection      of the plummet, having its maximum about the 240th
part of      a   second, and proportional to the size of twice the sun's
zenith distance      ;   the deflection is at its maximum when the sun                          is
45" above        or below the horizon,            and occurs in the vertical plane
passing through the attracting body.
      The deflection      due to the moon has its maximum about                        the 60th
part of a second, and follows the same law                    ;    it   is toward   or from    the
attracting       body according       as     the zenith           distance is less or more
than 90°.
      Upon the cross-level of a transit instrument, the joint effect is                         to
cause a semi-diurnal           oscillation    small at the quarters and rising                  to
the    24th part of      a second at new and            full moon       ;   while the influence
upon meridian observations is sufficient to cause a disagreement be
tween     the greatest inclination           of   the    moon's orbit, as observed              at
St Petersburg and Madras, amounting to the 50th of a second.
  The general conclusion drawn was, that we cannot determine                                   the
positions of the heavenly bodies true to the 100th part of a second
without having made allowance for this source of disturbance.
     6. Note on     Gravity and Cohesion.                     By Professor William
                                       Thomson.
     The view, founded         on Boscovich's theory, commonly taken                    of   cohe
sion, whether of solids or of liquids,   that           is,
                                                 results from  forceit                   a
of attraction between the particles of matter, which increases much
more rapidly than according to the inverse square of the distance,
when the distance         is   diminished below some very small limit.                       This
view might, indeed, seem inevitable, unless the idea of "attraction"
is   to be discarded altogether       ;    because the law of attraction                 at sen
sible   distances — the        Newtonian     law — demonstrated               by   its discoverer
for distances not incomparably smaller than the earth's dimensions,
and verified       by Maskelyne        and Cavendish               in   a   manner rendering
it   impossible for any naturalist to reasonably doubt its applicability

                                            G05
to the mutual action between             particles a few hundred yards or a few
inches   asunder, seems to give only very small,                scarcely appreciable,
forces between      bodies of such masses as those we experiment                     on in
our laboratories,        everywhere       placed as close        as   possible     to one
another, — that      is to say,   in contact,      and   does   not seem      to provide
for any considerable increase of attraction when the area of contact
is increased, whether by pressing the bodies                together, or by shaping
them to fit over a large area.
    But   if  we   take    into   account the heterogeneous distribution                 of
density essential to any molecular theory of matter, we readily see
that it alone is sufficient         to intensify      the force of gravitation be
tween two bodies placed extremely close to one another, or between
two parts of one body, and therefore that cohesion may be accounted
 for without    assuming any other force than that of gravitation,                       or
 any other law than the Newtonian.                  To prove this, let two homo
geneous cubes       be placed      with     one   side of each in perfect contact
 with one side of the other        ;   and let one-third      of the matter of each
 cube be condensed        into a very great number,           i, of square bars per
 pendicular to the common face of the two                  ;  and let the other two-
 thirds of the matter be removed for the present.                    The   mass     of each
 bar will be        of the whole mass originally given in each cube.
     Let  us farther suppose       that the two groups of bars are placed so
 that each bar of one group has an end in complete contact with an
 end of a bar of the other.            The attraction       between     each    two such
 conterminous       bars,    however small         their  masses     are,   may be in
 creased without        limit,  by   diminishing the area of its section, and
 keeping its mass         constant.       But the whole mutual attraction be
 tween the two groups          exceeds      i times the attraction between each
 of the conterminous pairs, and             may therefore      be   ma ie to have any
 value, however great, merely by condensing each                     bar in its trans
 verse section, and keeping their number and the mass                      of  each con
 stant.
     We may now        suppose another        third of the whole       mass to be con
 densed    into bars parallel        to another side of the cube, and the re
 maining     third into bars parallel          to the remaining        side.     If,  then,
 either   of  these    cubes   be placed       with any    side in contact with any
 side  of the other,     and allowed       to take the relative position to which
 it will obviously     tend — that      in which the bars perpendicular              to tho

                                        606                                      -
common side of the two cubes come together end to end, there will
be produced, by pure gravitation,         a force of attraction     between them
which   may be of any amount, however great, and which                       will    be
greater, the greater the ratio of the whole space unoccupied within
tho boundary of either cube, to the space occupied by the matter of
the bars.
   This illustration    has been chosen merely for the sake of definite-
ness and    simplicity   ; but it is clear that any arrangement,            however
complex, of woven fibrous structure,          provided only the ratio         of    the
unoccupied to the occupied space is sufficiently great, will lead to the
same general conclusion.         Farther, it is clear that the same result
would be produced by any sufficiently            intense heterogeneousness of
structure    whatever, provided      only    some   appreciable     proportion       of
the whole mass is so condensed in a continuous space in the interior
that it is possible, from any point of this space as centre, to describe
a spherical surface which shall contain a very much greater amount
of matter than the proportion            of the whole matter          of the body
which would correspond to its volume.                Except in imposing            this
condition,    the theory    now suggested interferes          with no molecular
hypothesis hitherto propounded, continuous or atomic, finite                 atoms,
or centres of force, static or kinetic.
   Physical    science abounds with evidence        that there is an ultimate
very intense heterogeneousness in the constitution of matter.                      All
that is valid      of the unfortunately       so-called " atomic" theory of
chemistry seems to be an assumption            of such heterogeneousness in
explaining     the combination      of  substances.      This alone, it is true,
does  not explain      the law    of definite combining         proportions    ;   but
neither   does    the hypothesis     of infinitely      strong   finite   pieces     of
matter  ;  and whatever is assumed to be the structural character of
a chemical compound, a dynamical            law of affinity between the two
substances,    according to the proportions         of them lying or moving
beside one another,       must be added to do what some writers seem to
suppose   done by    their  " atomic   theory."
   It is satisfactory to find that, so far as cohesion is concerned, no
other force than that of gravitation         need be assumed.

1.   Experimental Inquiry into the Laws of the Conduction of
    Heat in Bars, and into the Conducting Power of Wrought
    Iron. By Principal Forbes.
    The experiments        described in this paper were all made in 1850
and 1851, upon a plan which          was   fully explained by the author in
letters  to   Mr    Airy and Professor Kelland in the former year.
Some notice of them appeared in the British Association               Reports
for 1851     and 1852,      and the apparatus was supplied by a grant
from the Association.
    In previous inquiries into the thermal condition of           a long con
ducting bar heated at one end, two assumptions have always been
made : First, that the flux of heat across any transverse section of
the bar is proportional      throughout to the rapidity of the decrement
                                                                    dv
of temperature      reckoned along the axis of the bar (or to — , where
v represents the temperature, above that of surrounding space, of any

                                                  608
point of the axis of the bar at a distance x from the origin).                                        Se
condly, That the loss of heat by radiation                          and convection from the
surface of the bar is at every point proportional                              to the     same       tem
perature v.          By assuming            these    principles     (the last of which is
certainly        more or less           inexact),     the     well-known solution of the
problem of the heated bar is, that the temperatures (or excesses of
temperature) diminish in a geometrical progression from the origin,
and     finally, of course,            become    insensible.         Previous          experimenters
have confined themselves to finding the constants of the logarithmic
curve for different substances,                 and thence their relative (not absolute)
conducting powers.
    In the experiments now described, neither of the above-men
tioned principles             is assumed.          The external           loss     of heat is di
rectly ascertained            by experiment,        and the admissibility               or otherwise
of the former principle is also directly tested.                          That principle             may
be thus symbolised              :   F   =   — k         ,   where    F    is     the    flux of      heat
across     unit of section, k the conducting                        power for the substance
employed, and            v   and x have the same signification as before.
    I. In       the first instance, a bar of iron 8 feet long and I                        j inch      in
diameter,          was   heated by means             of a crucible             at one      end,      con
taining        melted        solder.     Thermometers           were      inserted        at   various
points of its length.               The results,     v in terms        of x, were projected            in
a curve         (approximately           a logarithmic),       and the values of                     were
                                                                                               -r^
found      by   projection or calculation, or both.

                                                                                                        '
                                                                     is
Cent, in       a   bath of fusible metal, and allowed to cool in free space,
a   thermometer              being inserted at the            centre of its length.                  This
gives     us the rate          at which such         a bar      is    parting with its               heat
from all        causes       whatever,      in terms of the temperature shown                          by
a   thermometer in its axis.
    III.       Theof heat in unit of time (one minute) last found
                     losses
may be taken as representing the amount of heat dissipated from
each  point of the long bar in the statical experiment (I.), being
given in terms of the temperature proper to each point of such                                         a
bar.       A    curve may thus be constructed, having for its line of ab

                                          609
scissffl the axis of the long bar,          and for ordinates, the rate of dissi
pation of heat from each portion of its surface due to both radia
tion and convection.
    IV.    If  we can by mechanical          quadrature, or otherwise, find the
whole amount of heat dissipated between any point of the long bar
and its coolest extremity, we have, in truth, the flux of heat passing
from the hotter extremity of the body across the particular section
in question    ; for the condition of permanence of the temperature                      of
the bar arises from the equality of the heat supplied and dissipated.
But the whole heat dissipated in unit of time                 is the integral       of the
partial dissipations       represented by vertical          ordinates      of the last-
named curve, taken between any assumed point x and the farthest
or cool end of the bar.        This quantity, then, is          F    or the flux across
unit of section at the point x.
    V. We are now able to resolve the question whether or not the
flux of heat is in the given bar everywhere proportional to the ra
pidity    with which      the temperature           decreases     as   x increases,      or
whether the equation holds,        F=        — k         the conducting         power     k
being supposed      to be constant.
     The following table (the result of          an approximate         reduction made
 in 1852) shows that the constancy of k in the case of iron cannot
 be assumed ; on the contrary, that the conductivity diminishes as
 the temperature       increases.      The first column         is the observed      tem
 perature of given points of the bars             ;  the second and third columns
give the values       of k from the preceding equation — (l.)as                   deduced
 from experiments on the iron bar with a polished surface                    ;

 the surface was covered with thin paper.               The general coincidence of
 the two is satisfactory,     since the external          cooling was considerably
 different in the two cases.

    It  is to be     observed that     thermometric     readings have not yet
been    finally corrected, so that these numbers may receive some
slight modification.        The author hopes to complete the verification
of the calculations, so far as wrought iron is concerned, in the course
of the present summer. The state of his health has been the cause,
not only of the suspension of the experiments, but of the long delay
which has taken place in publishing          the results so far as obtained.

                             William Thomson.
    The fact that the temperature of           the   earth    increases with the
depth below the surface, implies a continual              loss of heat from the
interior by conduction outwards, through or into the upper crust
Since     the upper crust does not become          hotter    from    year to year,
there must therefore be a secular loss of heat from the whole earth.
It  is possible    that no cooling may result from this loss of heat, but

only exhaustion of potential energy, which in this case could scarcely
be other than chemical         affinity between substances           forming   part of
the earth's mass.         But it   is certain that either      the earth is becom
ing, on the whole, cooler from age to age, or that the heat conducted
out is generated in the interior by temporary dynamical                  action (such
as chemical      combination).        To suppose, as       Lyell     has done,* that
the substances combining together, according                to the chemical hypo
thesis  of terrestrial heat, may        be again separated electrolytically         by
thermo-electric      currents due to the heat generated by their combin
ation, and thus the chemical action and its heat continued in an end
less cycle, violates the      first principles of natural         philosophy in ex
actly the same        manner and to the same degree, as to believe that
 a clock constructed with a self-winding           movement may fulfil the ex
 pectations of its ingenious inventor by going for ever.
     Adopting    as the more      probable, the simpler          hypothesis that the
 earth is merely a heated         body cooling, and not, on the whole, influ
 enced to any sensible        degree by interior chemical action, the author
 applies Fourier's theory of the conduction of heat to trace the
 earth's thermal history backwards.             From data regarding the spe
 cific heat  and    thermal    conductivity of the earth's          substance, he in
 vestigates the time        that   must    elapse   from an epoch of any given
 uniform high temperature           throughout the interior, until the present
 condition    of underground        temperature      could be reached.         Taking
 into  account the very uncertain            character of the data when high
 temperatures are concerned, he infers that most probably either the
 whole   earth     must    have     been   incandescent       at   some    time  from
 50,000,000      to  500,000,000 years         ago, or that at some less ancient
 date, but still anterior to the earliest human history, there must have
 been   up   to the surface a temperature             above    the boiling-point of
 water.     Either     alternative —or      indeed    any theory       whatever   con
 sistent with the principles of natural           philosophy regarding        previous
 conditions of the       earth — is    as decisive   against the views of those
 naturalists   who acknowledge no creation of life on the earth within
 fathomable     periods of time, as the plainest             elements of dynamics
 are against    those who maintain that we have no evidence in nature
 of  an end.

5.   Notice of the Ravages of the Limnoria Terebrans on Creo-
       soted Timber.           By David Stevenson, Esq., F.R.S.E.,
       M.I.C.E.,     &c.
    The author    stated that   it would  be  difficult  to estimate the value of
any chemical or mechanical          process   whereby timber might be ren
dered permanently        impervious to the ravages of the Limnoria              tere
brans, that small but sure destroyer           of timber     structures     exposed
to the action of the sea.
    The   ravages  of that crustacean were         first observed in 1810 by
Mr Robert      Stevenson, the engineer of the Bell Rock Lighthouse,
in the timber supports of the temporary             beacon used by him        in  the
erection of that work.        Having forwarded specimens of the insect,
and   of the timber it    had   destroyed, to Dr Leach, the eminent Na
turalist of the British Museum, Dr Leach, in 1811, announced it                  as a
"  new and    highly interesting species which had been sent to him                by
his friend Robert Stevenson, civil engineer," and assigned to it                  the
name    of Limnoria terebrans (Linnean Trans., vol. xi.              p.   370,   and
Edinburgh Encyclopaedia, vol. vii. p. 433).
    The Teredo navalis, which         was a larger and even        more destruc
tive enemy, was happily not so prevalent                in northern    seas as    the
Limnoria.
    Experiments      made at the     Bell Rock by        Mr Robert       Stevenson,
 extending over a period of nearly thirty years, the detailed account
 of which    was given in    Mr    Thomas    Stevenson's article     on   Harbours
in the  " Encyclopaedia     Britannica,'' had clearly proved that teak, Afri
 can oak, English and American oak, mahogany, beech, ash, elm,
 and the different varieties of pine, were found sooner or later to
 become a prey to the       Limnoria.     Greenheart oak was alone found            to
 withstand their attacks      ; and even this timber was said in some              in
 stances to have failed.
     Mr  Stevenson's experiments also included the testing of the arti
 ficial processes of Kyan and Payne, the former being an injection of
 corrosive sublimate, and the latter of proto-sulphate            of iron.      Tim
 ber prepared by Kyan's process was attacked in two years and four
 months, and in four years and seven             months     was  quite    destroyed.
 Timber prepared by Payne's process was attacked in                   ten months,
 and destroyed in one year and ten months.

                                         613
     The justly approved    creosote  process, patented by       Mr Bethel],     had
been largely employed in railway           works, with      universally   admitted
success, and, in common with many            of his professional brethren, the
author adopted it in several       marine works, in the expectation that it
would prove an antidote to the Limnoria           ;  but having now ascertained
beyond all doubt that creosote        was    not    a universal    or permanent
preservative of timber used in marine            works, the author        proposed,
in the present notice, to state briefly the facts on which this opinion
was grounded.
     Before doing so, however, he wished it to be distinctly understood
that he did not undervalue        Mr Bethell's highly important invention
as a preservative    of timber against all ordinary decay incident to
 railway sleepers, timber viaducts, and, indeed, all timber structures
not     exposed  to sea-water     infested with       the  Limnoria terebrans.
His remarks referred exclusively to its application for marine works
below half-tide level.      For all other classes of works, he believed it
to be a most valuable preservative.
     In 1859, in   a discussion which followed          a paper   on the     " Per
manent Way of the Madras            Railway,"     at the Institution       of Civil
Engineers, the author first stated that there were distinct evidences
of the attack of the Limnoria terebrans on creosoted timber used at
Scrabster Harbour in Caithness         ;  while  MrBethell, tho patentee,       and
others, expressed their conviction that creosoted            timber could not be
perforated by any worm or insect.
    Subsequent experience and observation have satisfied the author
that the statement which he then made was correct, the fact, as now
ascertained,    being that thoroughly         creosoted    timber   is, in certain
situations, readily perforated by the Limnoria Terebrans.
    The first instance   to which he referred was the pier at         Leith, which
was executed about      1850,    by the late   Mr    Rendel.    The whole of the
timber employed was creosoted on the spot in the most careful manner.
As    the piers at Leith   were washed by a constant admixture             of fresh
water from the water of Leith,         the   author     expected   that   the pro
gress of devastation at that place would be so slow as to be hardly
appreciable on creosoted timber.          But having carefully examined          the
West Pier,     he corroborated the evidence given by           Mr A. M.     Rendel
in 1860, before the Select Committee on Leith Docks'              Bill, that, not
withstanding the most careful application of creosote, the timber work
has been attacked by the insect to a great extent.

                                                 614
   The      second    case    to which         he    referred      was    Invergordon.             Two
steamboat jetties were constructed at that place from designs                                       by
Messrs Stevenson.              It    was    generally          represented that there were
little or   no tracesof marine insects in the Cromarty Frith, and it
was    resolved that it was a situation peculiarly suitable for employing
timber pile-work protected by creosote.                           The timber         used     in    the
work was carefully selected at Leith, and dressed                             to    the necessary
scantlings and lengths, so as to avoid all cutting after it had under
gone the process of creosoting.                     It   was then creosoted          by an agent
sent by Mr Bethell for the purpose, at the sight of a careful inspec
tor employed by the engineers.  Every piece of timber was weighed
before being put into the tank, and                        the process       of creosoting         was
continued until each piece                 had   received, as nearly as possible,                   the
specified quantity of 10 lbs. of oil per cubic                           foot.      Some experi
mental pieces were from time to time cut longitudinally,                              when it was
found that the creosote had entered                      the ends of the logs 18 inches
to 2 feet, and that          it had saturated the timber                    some    two or more
inches all round.            No greater precautions could possibly                     be used to
insure perfection in carrying out the process, which involved an ad
ditional cost of about L.450.    The jetties were erected in 1858,
and now the Superintendent's                     report was,
                                                                   " that the blackened              or
creosoted                                          and perforated.
              portion of the timber is very much eaten
The timber perforated is just as it came from the creosoting tank,
never having been cut.                 There is          1^-   inch wasted       on some      of    the
piles that have been perforated.''
      The third      case to which he referred was Scrabster, which was also
constructed under Messrs Stevenson's directions.                          Thetimberemployed
in this instance            was     selected     Memel of first-rate               quality;   it    was
carefully      creosoted at Glasgow.                 On cutting up           a     timber that had
been attacked          by    the Limnoria,          it   was found that the creosote                had
fully entered at the ends, and saturated the sides, and yet                                   it    was
discovered       to    have been attacked after                  it   had only been         exposed
thirteen       months, — the          insect        perforating       the    blackened        timber.
 The whole of the           creosoted portion of the timber work was now more
or less worm-eaten and destroyed.                         Mr Leslie      had also directed the
author's attention           to     similar results at Granton and Stranraer,                           at
 both   of which      places      the creosoted          timber had been perforated.
      The author held that             these        instances were enough to prove that
the failure was not peculiar                 to one spot or one isolated case.                     If   it

                                              615
was said that the timber used at these places                 had not been     properly
creosoted,     it might fairly        be concluded, that if the process, even when
conducted      in   the   patentee's own works, to the satisfaction of careful
inspectors, was          so  difficult    and   uncertain in its results, its general
applicability      would be greatly injured.            All  newly creosoted     timber,
 whether it was well or           ill  done,   presented the same      appearance ex
ternally   ;   and     it was only by weight          that the completeness of the
saturation      could be judged of ; and             if careful    weighing before and
after the timber had been creosoted was not to be held as an ample
and    satisfactory test that the process             had been properly conducted,
 it  seemed hopeless to expect that                perfect satisfaction could be at
tained.       But it     was so  far fortunate for      Mr Bethell's    system, that it
was not needful in the cases to which allusion had been made to call
in question the extent of saturation which his process secured when
properly executed.            The timber at Scrabster           and Invergordon,      and
 he believed at the         other places named,         was  undoubtedly thoroughly
 and properly         saturated,      and the author said that the explanation
 of the failure was to be found in the fact, that the Limnoria                       per
forated      timber which had             been   thoroughly    creosoted and black
 ened  —a     fact     which    at once      disproved     the assumption,       hitherto
 so generally       made, that the poisonous nature              of the  creosote   would
 prevent     tho    insect from attacking          it.   As the Pholas perforated
 stone to     procure shelter, the Limnoria might                  excavate timber     for
 the same        purpose, and obtain its food             from    the minute     animal-
 culae with     which      the water of the ocean           was charged.       Dr Cold
 stream, in his elaborate paper on the Limnoria in the                     " Edinburgh
 New PhilosophicalJournal" for April 1834, had concluded that the
 Limnoria fed on the timber, and not on animal substances ; but even if
 this were so, there seemed no reason to conclude that creosoted                     tim
 ber could not be eaten by insects, on account of the poisonous nature
 of the preparation employed.                 The author     stated, that   it had   been
 ascertained       that there were insects that lived and fattened on food
 that was to man a deadly poison.               In the " British Medical Journal"
 for April 1862, there was an interesting notice on the subject. Mr
 Attfield had there shown that substances which are intensely poison
 ous to the higher animals              do  not affect   Acari, which he found not
 only readily ate, but actually fattened on, strychnine,                 morphine, and
 other deadly poisons.             But the author        stated    that the specimens
 which    he     laid before       the Society proved conclusively         that creosote

                                        616
 does not act as a poison       in preserving     the timber, because it could
be   seen    that  the Limnoria       were embedded         in wood still   highly
charged with creosote.
    After carefully considering the subject, the author had no doubt
that the process      of creosoting preserved timber from the attack of
 marine insects    only so long as the oil existed as a film or coating on
the outside of the timber.           Whenever      the attrition caused by the
motion of the sea removed           this outer film or coating, and exposed
 the fibrous surface of the timber, the insect would then attack and
perforate it, whether it were creosoted or not, its search being for a
fibrous substance in which to burrow.              The time that might elapse
before    the timber became       assailable to these       insects depended on
the   situation.     Wherever there       was   little abrading     action of the
sea, the    exterior film of     creosote   might     be longer preserved ; and
where there was a considerable            admixture      of fresh water   to check
the growth,     or at least the avidity of the insect, the effect of their
ravages might be more gradual, or, in some situations, almost inap
preciable.     But the result of the author's observation and experi
ence   led him     irresistibly  to the    conclusion,    that on the northern
shores of the country, where works are exposed to the open sea, creo
soted timber was readily perforated by the Limnoria, and could not
be safely employed        in any important part of         a marine structure at
or below half-tide       level,  a  fact of great       importance   to the civil
engineer.
6.   On some Thermic Properties               of Water and Steam.              By
                  Professor     W.  J.  Macquorn Rankine.
    The author refers to the general equation of the mechanical             action
of heat which Professor Clausius and he arrived at independently by
different   methods in 1849,        and points out that the form of that
equation, which was laid before the Society by him in a paper read
on the 4th of     February 1850, comprehends, as a particular case,             the
law which connects the volume of a given weight of steam with                    its
temperature,      pressure, and latent heat.          He describes the      use of
that law, with proper numerical data, to compute, in the absence of
direct experiment,       tables of the density and volume of saturated
steam, more accurate than those founded on the assumption of the
perfectly gaseous condition, as exemplified in tables which ho pub

                                       617
lished in 1855      and subsequently.         Referring next       to   the direct
experiments of Messrs Fairbairn and Tate on the density of steam,
published    in the Philosophical Transactions for I860, he gives a
tabular comparison of the volumes of one pound of steam as de
termined by these      experiments, and as computed theoretically             from
M. Regnault's     experiments on the latent heat of steam, with the
aid of Joule's    mechanical    equivalent    of heat   ;  and from that com
parison he draws conclusions which may be summed up as follows:                  —
     1. At   temperatures    below 212°,       the differences      between the
 results of theory and experiment are inappreciable.
     2. At temperatures      above    212°,   the differences,      although    too
 small to be of any consequence          in practical   calculations     connected
 with steam-engines, are appreciable, the volume of a pound of steam
 by theory being slightly greater than by experiment.
     3. Small as those differences are, there exist no known sources
 of error either in the data of the theoretical calculation or in the
 method of experimenting       sufficient to account for them.
     4. They are therefore most probably caused               by some unknown
 difference in the molecular condition of the steam in             M. Regnault's
 experiments    on   latent heat,    and in Messrs        Fairbairn and Tate's
 experiments on density.
     5. That difference     of condition is probably         connected    with the
 fact, that   in M. Regnault's experiments the              steam   was    in rapid
  motion from a boiler towards a condenser         ;  whereas in the experi
  ments of Messrs Fairbairn and Tate the steam was at rest.
     6. Further experimental researches are desirable.

     Although most of the results deduced in this Note have been
  long known,   I  venture to offer it to the Society on account of the
  extreme simplicity     of the analysis employed, and the consequent
  insight it affords    us into  the connection       of various     formulae.     I
  intend   on a future     occasion to give large         further   developments
  especially bearing on physics.        I employ  the calculus of quaternions
  throughout, but where some unusual expressions occur,               I have given
  them in their common Cartesian form, as well as in the quaternion
  one.

proportional          to the         normal distance                     between         two       consecutive sur
faces.          In
           fact (2) shows that <U+25BA> is perpendicular to dg, which is
any tangent vector, thus proving the first assertion. Also, since
in passing to a proximate surface we may write

     This       proves the latter assertion.
     It   is evident from the above that                             if (1)      be an equipotential, or an

     From this it follows that     of the vector operation <j upon

   II.                                upon a group of points which

   After displacement                       g      becomes          g    + a-, and by         (7)   g   +    co     becomes

encloses the group of points (drawn from the extremity                                                  of   g   +       a-),    is

     IV. In       this latter case we see at once that                                    V.    <   er-     =   0,   and   it
is   easy to      show that            in general,                if     the small       displacement               of   each
point    of   a   medium          is   in      the direction                of, and proportional                     to, the

                                           622
attraction    exerted at that point by any system                   of   masses,  the dis
placement is effected without rotation.                 For if Fg = C be the poten
tial surface, we have Sa-ofg a complete differential — i.e., in Cartesian
co-ordinates %dx +      q-1y +   Qlz is a differential of three independent
 variables.    Hence    the   vector axis of rotation             i       —  ~\     + Sec,
                                                                    \dy      dz)
 vanishes by the vanishing of each of its constituents, or                   V. <i  o~ — 0.
     Conversely,   if there   be   no   rotation      the displacements         are in the
 direction of, and proportional to, the normal vectors to a series                       of
 surfaces.
     For
                 0=V.c?jV.       <  o~ = (Sdg< )a-—              < Scrdg.
     Now, of the two terms on the right,              the    first is   a complete differ
 ential, since it may be written —                                     and therefore
                                            Ddfa-     (see     (7) ),                   the
 remaining term must        be so.
     Thus, in  a distorted system, there is no compression                   if
                                     S.   <  a-  = 0,
 and no rotation    if V.   < 0-  = 0    ;  and     evidently       merely    transference
 if  o-> = a = a constant vector, which             is one      case   of  < a-  =  0.
     In   the important case of      <r* =   e  < Fj    there is evidently no rota
 tion, since   < o~=    e< 2Fg is evidently a scalar.                 In this   case, then,
 there are only translation and compression, and the latter is at each
 point proportional     to the density       of   a   distribution of matter, which
 would give the potential Fj.              For if r be such density, we have
 at once < '2Fg = iirr (seo (3)1 ).              This suggests a host of physical
 analogies which we cannot enter upon at present.
      V. Keeping still    to the meaning of            <r> as    the vector of displace
 ment, as we have seen that < a- = s +                   /,  where s is the condensa
  tion of the particles near the extremity of               g, and / the   doubled vector
 axis of rotation of the     group — we         may apply the vector operation a
 second time.      Thus,
                                   2
                                <1   a- —     < s +     <   /.
     Now, our former results enable               us to assign meanings to these
 expressions.       < * is   the normal-vector              to any of the surfaces of
 equal condensation.         The scalar and vector parts of                  < /  represent

                                            623
the compression, and the doubled-axis                 of the rotation, consequent
on the displacement of each point through a space represented                   by   i.
Also it is   easy to see that         o 2o-is   a pure vector.    Hence
                                  S. <V<l^=0.
   If therefore      there be two       similar media, and     the particles  of  one
be  slightly displaced in        a continuous      manner — the    particles of   the
other being displaced          through vectors proportional         to the rotations
at  each  point in     the  first  mass — this displacement takes place with
out condensation.
   And,    as  V.    <   <J s = 0,     we   have   the other result,     that if   the
particles of    the second medium be displaced             through vectors repre
senting the direction and rate of most rapid change of compression
in the first, such displacement will take place without rotation.
But this     is merely another way            of stating the first proposition in
