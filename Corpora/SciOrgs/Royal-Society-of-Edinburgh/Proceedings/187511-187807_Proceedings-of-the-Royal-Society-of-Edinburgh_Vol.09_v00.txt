    DAVID MILNE HOME,                      Esq., of Wedderbum,          LED.,
                 Senior Vice-President, in the Chair.
    The Chairman delivered the following opening Address:                        —
    Gentlemen,       Fellows of tnr Royal Society of Edinburgh, — In
compliance with          a  request  of the Council,     I  have   the honour     to
come before you this evening to give an address, on this the                   first
night of our Winter Session, in pursuance of the custom prevalent
in this and most other Societies.
    I need not say how much          1 regret,  for your sakes as well      as  my
own, that this duty        is not to be discharged by our eminent Presi
dent.
    The first point which I will submit to your notice, is the nature
and amount of the work we as a Society are doing, and our means
of doing it.
   The    second      and   concluding     part   of my Address        will   have
reference   to the present      aspect   and   prospects   of science   generally
in the country.
   With    regard      to the  work we are carrying        on,  it may   be   suffi
cient to refer to the proceedings of our last winter's session.                Our
Secretary tells me that it was the longest session he remembers                  —
it having been prolonged beyond mid-summer.
   You are aware that our Society was intended                by its founders to
embrace    literature as well     as science ; and   that in regard to science,
we encourage       investigations in any of nature's various fields.           The
following abstract,       under different heads, of the papers read during
last   session,     indicates   the   range    and   variety of     the  Society's
operations —  :
   In Applied Mathematics or Physics, we had 11 papers read; in
Pure Mathematics, 9; Notes from Professor Tait's Physical Labo
ratory were read at five meetings        ; of Geological papers,     4 were read ;
of Chemical       papers,    3; of Physiological      papers,   3; of Anatomi
cal papers, 3   ;    of Meteorological     papers,  2 ;  of Literary papers,     2 ;
separate Biographical         Memoirs    of eleven    deceased    Members were

                         of Edinburgh,              Session       1S75-76.                                  3
read.     Many interesting experiments                          were shown      at    our meetings;
and     in particular,        our President, at one of our meetings, exhibited
and explained         his wonderful tide-calculating                     machine, by means of
which there can be obtained in                  a   few seconds, results which hitherto
have required         minute and laborious calculations.
    The three Prizes which                   the       Society has at its disposal, were
awarded     as follows        :   —
     The Keith Prize was              awarded       to Professor         Tait, for his        paper on
    " First                 Thermo-Electric Diagram."
                                        to a
a           Approximation
   The Makdougall Brisbane Prize was awarded to Professor Lister,
for his paper "On the Germ Theory of Putrefaction and Fermenta
tion."
   The Neill Prize            was awarded           to   Mr Charles William Peach,                        for
his " Contributions               to Scotch Geology and Zoology."
    Gentlemen, an important                    part of our work as a Society is to
publish     in a volume of Transactions                         the    most     deserving of the
papers read at our meetings.                       A copy of these Transactions                     is,   as
you know,        obtained gratis by every member.                             Copies also, to the

foreign    universities, and foreign societies.                         Many of         these    papers
are necessarily          not of       so    popular       a   character as to pay, by the
sale   of them, the cost of printing.                         But these papers, though not
interesting        to the         general    community,            may     be      of   the     highest
importance         for the          advancement            of science.          Fortunately           our
Society     is   sufficiently wealthy to be able                       to defray the expense,
not only      of printing, but of                  a     large gratuitous          circulation.       I
believe     that    it   is   a    knowledge of this fact which obtains for our
Society so large         a    membership, and              so   satisfactory     a    revenue.
    With     regard      to our membership, we have                        now 358            Ordinary
Fellows.    I      observe from the address which                      I   had       the    honour of
giving five years ago, that the number then was 326, so that there
has been     in the interval an increase of 32 members.

   I  propose to give an obituary notice               of  several   in this list, with
regard to whom        I  have succeeded in obtaining information, chiefly
through the good offices of our Secretary, Professor Balfour.
   Charles,      Comte       de    Remusat,      a    distinguished        French        poli
tician, philosopher,        and     man of letters, was born                at    Paris     on
the    14th    of   March        1797.      His      father    held      various       public
offices    under    the    first    Empire.       His mother        was       an   intimate
friend of the Empress Josephine.                   The young Remusat, after                   a
brilliant    course     at  the    Lycee Napoleon,          betook      himself     at    first
to the study      of law, but        he soon    turned to literature,            and wrote
as a    journalist in      newspapers       and reviews from 1818                till   1830.
In company with Guizot, Cousin,                    and    Jouffroy,     he     was on      the
staff of the      " Globe, "     a  periodical      founded by Dubois             in 1824i
which struggled against the growing absolutism of the Restoration,
lie continued afterwards, in concert with Guizot,                        to support doc
trinaire constitutionalism,          and   in philosophy he was on the whole
of the school of Cousin.            His  name appears in the          list of journalists
who protested        against the        ordinances which          brought about the
Revolution of      July.      In   1830, he was chosen          deputy by Toulouse,
and    soon   followed the leadership of Thiers in the Chamber.                             In
1838, he was       for a short time Under-Secretary                    of State in the
ministry of Count Mole, and in 1840 he was Minister of the
Interior, under Thiers. After the Revolution of 1848, he continued
a member      of the Constituent Assembly, and supported the party of
order.     During the whole         period of the second Empire, he withdrew

                     of Edinburgh,      Session 1875-76.                          5
from political life,    and devoted    himself to literary and philosophical
labours,    sceptical    of the possibility of an Imperial government
restoring liberal institutions.        The Revolution of 1870 brought the
Count de Remusat back to public life, as Minister of Foreign Affairs
under M. Thiers, with whom           he   fell in May    1873, and with whom
he agreed in regarding the Republic as,             if  not the political    ideal,
at least the best practical solution of the difficulties of France.             He
died at Paris     on the 6th of    June    1875.
    The Count     de Remusat was a copious,         solid, and eloquent writer.
 Besides his large contributions          to the periodical press, especially
 the "Revue des Deux Mondes,"           he was the author of many valuable
 works.     One of his earliest essays was connected with his legal
 studies, and appeared in 1820       (" Sur la procedure      en Matiere Crimi-
 nelle "), followed by other tracts on the responsibility of ministers of
 State, the liberty of the press, and the law of elections.              His most
 brilliant and productive period as a writer

     As may     be inferred    from the subjects of his studies, M. de
  Remusat was deeply interested in England.               Probably no eminent
  Frenchman      of his time       understood      English     institutions    and
  national character so well.       The practical philosophers and          states
  men of this country, and their readiness to accept the teaching of
  experience    and to recognise the tendencies of the age, in a spirit
  of wise compromise,      were all in harmony with         his temper;     which
  always   inclined    to moderation,       and was      averse   to  fanaticism,
  whether political or speculative, religious            or anti-religious.      In
  philosophy, he belonged to the school opposed to Materialism.
     In M.  de Remusat      we have lost one      of  the most eminent of the

                      Proceedings of      the  ltoyal Society
French politicians and thoughtful           men of letters of the nineteenth
century, and     the philosophy        of mind    has    lost one of its ablest
expositors, though he may not have            ranked among its discoverers
and leaders.
   Charles    Lykll    was born    at   Kinnordy,    in    Forfarshire,    on  14th
November 1797, and died in London 22d February                     1875.    He was
on  our list of British Honorary Fellows.            His early education        was
obtained at Midhurst, in Sussex.          He went thereafter to Oxford, and
there   obtained his A.M. degree in 1821.            Whilst     at Oxford he had
the advantage      of attending Dr Buckland's lectures, then Professor
of Geology.      On leaving the university, he studied for the English
bar;  but finding this line of life not likely to             be  congenial, and
having the means        of living without       the aid of a profession, he
betook himself to geology.          The seed sown         by Dr Buckland        had
been dropped      into soil fitted to its germination and rapid develop
ment.
                                                                          " Recent
   Probably     Lyell's first     paper   was    an  account of a
Formation     of Freshwater       Limestone     in Forfarshire,"       his   native
county.      This   was   very soon      followed    by many other          papers,
written   at  places   visited by him in Hampshire and Dorsetshire.
These were read before the Geological Society of London, of which
he had become        member.      In   the year    182  1   he had   shown such
knowledge of geology, that he was elected                 one of the     Honorary
Secretaries   of the Society.
   In  1827    he contributed      to the "Quarterly"           a  review of    Mr
Poulett Scrope's     " Geology of Central France."
   Shortly afterwards, he published           his '' Principles     of Geology,"
the work in which he first showed            his distrust      of old geological
maxims, and started his own original conceptions.                 Most geologists
before his day had attempted          to explain    many things by assuming
that the natural agencies of bygone times had been much more
powerful than now.        On the other hand,       Lyell maintained that the
natural agencies      now    on  our planet were        capable of producing
all the effects observed,       if  only sufficient time was allowed for
their operation.
   These new views attracted         great attention.       The demaud for the
book   in   which they were explained            was    so   great, that it   went

                          of Edinburgh,           Session       1875-76.                              7
through five editions in a very short time                          — each      edition contain-
in!! a large amount              of    new matter.        The work, by these numerous
additions, became              so changed in character, that he reconstructed
it,   and brought            out   a    new    work called " Elements               of Geology,"
and     greatly altered his " Principles                   "
                                                               as    regards       arrangements.
In the latter,          he presented           explanations of the various forces at
work in the earth and in the universe likely to affect the earth.
In the former,          he described          the observed effects.             Subsequently he
brought        out     the     "Student's Manual of Geology,"                       in which      he
brought together most of the facts mentioned in the two previous
works.
      No geologist       before       Lyell's time      had devoted           himself so exclu
sively and so laboriously to the science.                           He not only kept himself
acquainted with the discoveries made                           by   others, but he travelled
over       large portions of the earth's surface, with the view of verify
ing alleged facts, and making di coveries himself.
      He went       to Norway,          Sweden,       Belgium,       Switzerland,        Germany,
Spain, Catalonia, and the Danish islands of Seeland and Monen.
He was twice in America.                      On the first occasion, in 1841, he went,
in compliance with an invitation,                     to deliver     a   course of lectures at
Boston.        He then remained in                the New       World       a     whole year, his
explorations extending                  from Canada through                 the    States to the
mouths of the Mississippi.                      On returning          to    England,       he   pub
lished his "Travels in North America," in which, whilst geological
information            chiefly     is   given, some useful views occur on other
subjects       also.      In     1845    he paid      a   second      visit   to America,       and
examined more                particularly       the    Southern       States and the coasts
bordering the            Gulf of Mexico.
                                  On his return to England, he
published his "Second Visit to the United States," — companion                       a
to    his former work.
      The    most recent of           Lyell's important works              was his    "Antiquity
of Man," which went through four editions, the first having come
out in 1863, the last in 1873. But beside these elaborate works,
hepublished numerous memoirs, most of which had been read at
meetings of the Geological Society and British Association for the
Advancement of Science.
      In    1836,    and also in 1850,             he was President               of the   London
Geological Society.                The Royal Society's Copley Medal was awarded

8                    Proceedings   of the Royal Society
to him in 1858, and the Geological Society's Wollaston            Medal was
awarded      to him in  I860.
    In the year       1864    he presided   at the Bath     Meeting    of the
British Association        for the Advancement       of Science.     He   was
Patron     of the Scotch Geological       Society.   In the year    1848   he
was knighted,       and in the year 1864 he received a baronetcy in
recognition of his services to science.
   Sir Charles Lyell was married in 1832 to Mary Elizabeth, eldest
daughter of the late Leonard Horner, himself a distinguished
geologist.      Lady Lyell    was a devoted   wife, and sympathised with
her husband in his pursuits, accompanying him in all his travels,
and assisting him in literary work.
    During the last five or six    years,  Sir Charles Lyell lost his    eye
sight to such an extent that he could neither read nor recognise
his friends.      The last time that    I was in his house,  Harley Street,
London, Lady Lyell had to lead him, and make known to him the
presence of several      friends who came in.
    Lady Lyell's death in the year 1874 was a severe shock to her
husband. After that event, Sir Charles's health rapidly failed. His
death was caused by a severe        fall on the staircase  of his house,   he
having, owing to his blindness, missed the uppermost step.
    Probably few men were ever so devoted to any special object,            as
Sir Charles Lyell      was to geology, through his whole life.        He was
inspired      by a genuine love of truth,       and  for its sake    did  not
hesitate to retract opinions when he found he was mistaken.                In
the three first editions of his " Antiquity of Man " he had expressed
 his concurrence in the opinion of some Scotch geologists, that the
land near the Firth of Forth had risen 25 feet since the Roman
occupation.        In  the   last edition  of  the  work, he revoked that
concurrence. In       the account given by him of the Glen Roy terraces,
 he published his belief, that they were         due  to fresh water lakes.
In    a letter which    I  received from him shortly before       his death,
adverting to some facts recently discovered, he allows, that perhaps
 after all, Darwin's theory of the terrace having been made by the
 sea,  might prove to be correct.       Sir Charles Lyell in this     respect
 showed     an example to all men of science,      in caring more for the
interests of truth, than for mere consistency.

                    of Edinburgh, Session 1875-7(i.
    William Edmokd Logan, another Honorary Fellow of the Society,
was born at Montreal, Canada, in the year 1798, and died on 22d
June 1875.
    His lather  was  originally a landed proprietor in Stirlingshire, and
emigrated to Canada. He sent his son from Canada, when very
young, to Scotland, to be educated          in the High School, and after
wards in the University of Edinburgh.
    When young Logan       was   in Edinburgh, geological investigations
and speculations were      exciting much interest, in consequence of
the discussion between the Huttonians and Wernerians.              Mr Logan
then acquired a taste for geology; and having             occasion to go to
 South Wales, he began to study the rocks in the coal-fields there,
 at this time, beginning    to be more      extensively   worked.     Having
 procured an Ordnance Survey map on a large scale,            he was at the
 trouble to trace out and lay down upon it the outcrop of all the
 coal seams worked through extensive tracts of country.                 Seeing
 where the outcrops ceased to be continuous,            lie ascertained the
 amount and direction of the dykes and slips by which the strata
 had been dislocated.      He  descended      into the mines, and studied
 for himself the structure of the coal, and examined particularly          the
 fossils  found in the coal.       He   was   then struck by the fact, that
 every coal seam lay upon a bed of blue-coloured             clay, in which
 apparently    the plants    had grown,       now  found petrified in coal.
 In  several instances he discovered that some of the fossil trees
 which had their trunks         in the coal-bed      had   their   roots  still
 stretching into the underlying       bed of clay.
    About this time Sir Henry        de la Beche, who was directing        the
 Geological Survey of England        and Wales,    happened    to come into
 South Wales.      Having heard of Mr Logan,         he became    acquainted
 with him; and having seen the work he had been carrying on, he
 at once put him on the staff      of the survey.
    Mr Logan having permanently           adopted   geology  as a  profession,
 became a Member of the Geological Society of London.             Frequently
 joining in the discussions there, he made the acquaintance of Sir
 Charles Lyell, Sir Roderick Murchison, and other leading geologists.
    Having obtained leave of absence to visit his father in Canada,
 he went there in 1841, and spent much of bis time in exploring
 the great coal-fields of Nova Scotia and Pennsylvania.

      In the spring of         1842    he returned to England,             and   in   the
  Geological Society gave an interesting account of his survey in these
   American coal-fields.       He   had been particularly       anxious to obtain a
  confirmation of his discovery, that coal seams everywhere rested
  on fire-clay;     and he was able to afford         these   proofs   from what be
   had seen in Nova Scotia.
      He   had made     another discovery in these            coal-fields.     He bad
  discovered     the footprints of a reptile;        and   he brought       to London
  with him the sandstone         slab   which contained these prints.               This
  slab was      submitted     to   Professor      Owen, who expressed           a clear
 opinion, that the impressions had been made by an animal which
 had four claws on the two fore            feet, and    three claws on the hind
  feet.    The interest attaching        to this discovery was, that no reptile
 had    been discovered in rocks        so old,   it being at the     bottom     of the
 Carboniferous formation; — whereas,                previously,   no    reptiles     had
 been found below the Permian              rocks.
     I  mention this discovery of Logan's, because            I see that my friend
                                                   " Book on Acadian
 Principal     Dawson    of Montreal,     in  his                            Geology,"
 mentions that discoveries of similar reptiles, made in the year 1844
 in Sweden       and the United       States,    had   been   asserted     to be prior
 to others    of  the same kind.
     Logan's reputation as a geologist was now established.                      It  led
to his being entrusted with the charge               of the Canadian Geological
Survey, on the recommendation                of Sir Roderick        Murchison       and
Sir Henry       de la Beche.        The Canadian Legislature              had   wisely
resolved     to have the mineral riches of the             country ascertained        by
competent surveyers.         For nearly thirty       years  Sir William     conducted
the Canadian Survey, and drew most important conclusions regard
ing the whole series of rocks in that part of the world — conclu
sions universally accepted by geologists as correct.
    At   the  Paris International     Exhibition of       1855, he showed a large
collection of specimens,          besides    magnificent maps and diagrams,
which attained much attention, and received great commendation.
It  was on this occasion, that the           British Government,         in recogni
tion of his eminence        as a  geologist, and of his services          in Canada,
bestowed on him the honour            of knighthood.
    Sir William did not publish           anything beyond the official reports
of his survey.        He was not ambitious of fame, either             as an   author

or otherwise.         He stuck closely       to the   work he had undertaken         ,
and continued at        it till the year    1869, when     failing health led him
to   resign.
    He, however, continued          to take an interest in geological pursuits,
and gave, from his private funds,               a   donation of L.5000, for the
endowment of         a chair of geology in the        M'Gill College, Montreal.
    Charles Wueatstone            was born at Gloucester in 1802, and died
in    Paris 19th October         1875.      He  was on    the   list of our British
Honorary Fellows.
    The rudiments of education             were  obtained by him at a private
school.       Whether     he afterwards       went to a university,      I have  not
discovered.
     His youth and early manhood             were devoted      to the construction
of musical instruments,           and   to experiments      with the view of dis
covering      more exactly the laws of sound.          He paid special attention
 to the instruments        depending on vibrating          springs.    The present
 improved      Concertina is due to his invention.
     His first scientific memoir        was in the year 1823, when          he pub
 lished    in the "Philosophical Annals"             an account of some " New
 Experiments        on Sound."       It excited considerable attention among
 physicists,     and was translated into several foreign periodicals.             In
  1827, in the "Quarterly Journal of Science," he published farther
    Experiments       on  Audition," accompanied by          a   description of the
  Kaleidophone,      an instrument to illustrate both acoustical and optical
 phenomena.
     During     the next eleven years, he continued to produce papers und
  to invent instruments        for illustrating the properties of sound.
     In  1838 he seems to have entered           on a different subject    of inves
  tigation    altogether, viz., light.        He   had discovered relations      be
  tween waves of sound and waves of light.                  He communicated        to
  the Royal Society of London,             and  also to the   British Association
  an   account of some hitherto           unobserved    phenomena of binocular
  vision,   illustrating them by means of the instrument which                    he
  invented, called the
                              " Stereoscope."       To Wheatstone is due         the
  discovery, that the conception of solidity is due entirely                 to the
  mental union of two dissimilar perspectives.
      In 1852     he invented      an instrument      called the " Pseudoscope,"

  12                 Proceedings      of the ltoyal Society
  which still farther illustrated      the mental action     in certain optical
 phenomena. An article in the "Edinburgh Review" of October
  1858, describes thus the effect of the Pseudoscope : — "When an
 observer    looks with it at the interior of      a  cup or basin, he not un-
 frequently sees it at first in the real form, but by prolonging               his
 gaze, he    will perceive    the conversion within a few minutes;         and   it
 is curious, that while this seems         to take place quite suddenly with
 some individuals,      as  if  the basin were flexible and were suddenly
 turned inside out, it occurs more gradually with others, the con
 cavity slowly giving place to flatness,          and the flatness gradually
 rising into convexity."*
     Wheatst'one was exceedingly interested in this discovery of the
 interference of mental action with optical phenomena, and invented
 several   instruments with the view of ascertaining the principles on
 which it depended.          The subject led him to study the subject of
 nervous organisation; but it is believed, that he effected no special
 discoveries in that field.
     In 1834 the science      of Electricity began to occupy Wheatstone's
 attention.     He endeavoured to ascertain the velocity of the elec
 trical current.      He invented many       most   ingenious   machines with
 that view.      He   seems    to have made only an approximation          to the
 truth, viz., that the current travelled through a mile of wire in less
than the 360th part of a minute.
     It now occurred      to him    that electricity   might be employed in
 conveying     intelligence     along great distances by moving       a  magnet.
 By this time an idea of the same kind had occurred in Germany.
 Mr Cooke,     when    there, had become informed of the investigations
 by   Schilling,  and    having come to London,         made   these known      to
 Wheatstone.       A proposal for      a partnership between      the   two, was
 suggested,    and    was carried    out.    Messrs Cooke and Wheatstone
    * A curious circumstance, analogous to the phenomena here described,
was, without the help of any instrument, observed by me and other friends
lately, in watching the revolutions of a cup anemometer on the top of Alnwick
Castle. On looking at the instrument, it was seen revolving in a direction
consisting with the truth ; but on continuing to look at it, in about half a
minute the anemometer suddenly appeared to change the direction of its
rotation, and to continue so to rotate.    We remained for some time looking at
the instrument to repeat the experiment.       The same result on every occasion
followed, and to every one of the party, eight or nine in number.

 soon  thereafter were employed to establish electric telegraphs on
 most  of the great English railways.
   In 1837 the five-needle telegraph was invented; in 1840, the
alphabet dial telegraph; in 1841, the type-printing telegraph; and
the automatic       telegraph between     1858   and 1867.       By this last
machine     it  was   found possible to transmit words at the rate of
from 100 to 160 words per minute.
   In  1840 Wheatstone conceived the idea of a submarine telegraph
cable,   and    pointed   out both   the   difficulties  and   the means     of
obviating    them.
   His last work       was to contrive   a new recording      instrument    for
submarine cables, formed by a globule of mercury moving to and
fro in a capillary tube containing        acid, or by a drop of acid in a
tube   containing mercury,      and which was found to be 58 times more
sensitive than any recorder previously employed.             He  had gone to
Paris to exhibit this invention      to his colleagues    of the Academy     of
 Science, when he was       attacked by the fatal illness — bronchitis —
 which terminated in his death.
    This brief notice of Wheatstone's discoveries in the science of
sound, optics, and electricity gives but a poor idea of the immense
 amount of brain        work which he went through          in the long life
 accorded    to him.     The  papers  which he contributed        to Societies
 both  in Great Britain      and on the Continent       are  very numerous.
 They were always characterised by great lucidity of style and by
 copious and telling illustrations,    which made them both attractive
 and instructive.
    Wheatstone     was elected   a Fellow of the London Royal Society
 in 1836, a    Chevalier of the Legion of Honour in 1855, a Foreign
 Member of the French Institute in 1873.              In  1868   the Govern
 ment   of Lord Derby conferred on him a knighthood.
    In  private life Sir Charles Wheatstone had the reputation of
 being   reticent and unsociable.       The fact probably was, that his
 mind was constantly absorbed with the problems which were con
 stantly presented to it.        He  was   so nervous and       bashful,  that
 though always ready and pleased         to describe his discoveries to any
 single individual, he entirely broke down           when   he attempted to
 address an audience.       Hence, his Professorship of Natural Philo

14                    Proceedings of                the   Royal Society
sophy in King's College, London, was little better than a title                             ;   for
he never had a class.
     There was no physicist of his time so universally respected.                               His
remains were brought from Paris for interment in the family burial

number of carriages, including many of the nobility; and even the
shops     in the streets       along which the funeral cortege                     passed   were
shut, whenever it was known whose it was.
  David Aitken, D.D., who had been seven years an Ordinary Fellow
of this Society, was born about the beginning of this century.                                  He
died on the 27th March last, in his own house in Charlotte Square,
Edinburgh.          He   was educated           at the      High School      and    University
of Edinburgh,         and became         a    licentiate of the Church of Scotland.
     I   believe that he had been tutor in the family of the Earl of
Minto, by whom, or through                     whose       influence, lie was in the year
1829,      presented     to    the     parish of Minto.              There     he     remained
minister for thirty-seven years                 ;    and on resigning his charge, pur
chased a house          in Edinburgh, where he lived                 till his death.
     Being    fond of        travel,    he     visited Norway,         Italy, Egypt,            and
Syria.   As he suffered extremely during the winter season from
delicacy of chest, he often spent the winter abroad. Possessing an
independent         fortune,     he     was         able to obtain the services of an
assistant during his absence.
     He   was a person        of literary tastes, was well acquainted with the
German        language, and was                a     friend   and    correspondent of the
German        philosopher        Hegel.             In the year       1827    he     wrote an
article      in the    "Edinburgh             Review"         on German literature.             He
also drew up the Statistical                 Accounts of Minto Parish, embodying
an excellent account           of its geology, botany,              and zoology.
     His knowledge of Church                   history was so considerable that he
was offered the Chair           of Church History in the University of Edin
burgh.        On his declining           it,    the late       Dr Welsh was appointed.
His      sermons      were    in composition              marked by great elegance              and
clearness     ;   but owing to delicacy of chest, his voice was weak, and
his manner in the pulpit had not the earnestness                               necessary         to
create interest.
     He was exceedingly                fond    of natural        history, and       took    great

   Jons Hughes Bennett         was born    in London 31st August 1812,
and died at Norwich 25th Sept. 1875.           He had joined our Society
in 1842.
   He was educated at      the Grammar School, Exeter.           It  is stated,
however, that he was indebted for the early part of his education
to his mother,    a lady  of brilliant intellectual   attainments.       Being
a great admirer of Shakespeare,       she caused    her son to read aloud
to her many of his plays, and as he did so, taught him the art of
emphasis     and rhetorical   action.    Probably    to this tuition     of his
mother, Dr Bennett was indebted for the elegance of his composi
tion, and for the impressiveness of his delivery when he lectured
or spoke in public.
   He commenced the study of medicine at Maidstone, in the year
1829, under the guidance of a practitioner            there.    It  was   there
that he acquired the art of dispensing, and even obtained a certain
amount of medical practice.           He assisted also in post-mortem
examinations.
   To acquire better medical instruction        and   training, he removed
to Edinburgh in the year 1833, — unacquainted with any one in
that city or in Scotland. By his talents and assiduity he soon
attracted the notice of his professors, and obtained the esteem
of numerous fellow-students.          His attention    was devoted chiefly
to   anatomy,    physiology,    and   pathology.      Having joined         the
Royal Medical       Society, and shown his abilities         and   knowledge
at its meetings, he ultimately became President             of the     Society.
 Whilst still  a student, in the year 1836, he published           two papers
which obtained for him considerable credit.
   In   the year 1837,     he  received   the degree     of M.D. with       the
highest honours, obtaining at the same time a gold medal for his
thesis.
   After    obtaining   all the knowledge       which     Edinburgh      could
supply, Dr Bennett       repaired to Paris, where he studied for two
years.   Being   able to speak and write the French language fluently,
he wrote in the French       medical journals,    and ultimately became
President of the Parisian Medical Society.

10                  Proceedings of       the  Royal Society
   He also went to Germany, spending some time in the principal
University cities,     and endeavouring        to acquire knowledge beyond
what he had already obtained.               One of his acquisitions          on the
Continent was ability to use the microscope in practical                   medicine.
Nor  was his pen idle, for whilst abroad, he contributed no less than
seventeen     articles to Tweedie's " Library of Medicine."
   In  1841    he returned to     Edinburgh, and commenced               a course   of
lectures on histology.         He there    took   the opportunity of showing
to what an      extent the microscope might and should be used.                     It
was at this time that        Dr Bennett published        a treatise on the use      of
cod-liver oil as a therapeutic agent in certain forms of gout, rheu
matism,      and    scrofula, —dedicating        the   treatise    to   Sir Robert
Christison.     In Germany       he had seen the good effects          of using this
medicine in these cases.
   From     1842    to  1848    he continued      to give lectures on various
medical subjects.         In the last     named      year he was appointed to
the  Chair of Institutes of Medicine, vacant by the transference of
Dr Allen Thomson to Glasgow.
   For   several    years    Dr Bennett     was proprietor       and editor of the
"Edinburgh        Monthly Journal         of  Medical       Science,"     in which,
besides    editorial   articles and reviews, he inserted multitudes                 of
separate memoirs.
   In  the  "British Medical Journal," where              a  detailed account of
Bennett's life and labours is given, and from which                  I  have   culled
the foregoing notices,       I see a list of no less than 105 memoirs on
various anatomical and pathological subjects.
   In July 1848 Dr Bennett          was unanimously          elected   to the Chair
of Institutes of Medicine.
   Whilst teaching in the University              and   in the Infirmary, Pro
fessor   Bennett     found time for literary         work, and published           his
highly appreciated "Clinical Lectures                 on    the Principles        and
Practice of Medicine."          This book passed through           five editions in
this country, and six in the United States, besides being translated
into French, Russian, and Hindoo.
   The    following     additional   works     flowed     from     his ready pen.
Their titles              " Pulmonary                            " Cancerous

    Professor Bennett had conferred upon him numerous honours and
 distinctions.    He was President for two years of the Medico-Chirur-
gical Society of Edinburgh; Hon. Secretary and emeritus President
of the Royal Medical Society of Edinburgh ; and Fellow of numerous
medical societies on the Continent.           He had    sent to him, about a
year before     his  death, a special licence from the French        Govern
ment     entitling him     to practise medicine   in France.     This honour
was    probably suggested       by the fact of his having, two or three
years before his death, resided in the south              of France   for the
benefit   of his health.
    The enormous amount of work, both mental and physical, which
Professor Bennett         undertook, probably shortened his life.      About
1865 his first      illness appeared    in the form of a throat affection.
Having recovered by a sojourn in the south of France, and returned
to Edinburgh,       he was again prostrated in 1869.        After an interval
he recovered,     but in the winter of 1871-2 he was obliged to return
to Mentone.        During the following summer, he resumed work in
Edinburgh,       and gave some clinical lectures.            The winters of
1872-3 and of 1873-4 again forced him into a warmer climate,
but each time with less benefit.          In the year 1874, he resigned the
Chair of the Institutes of Medicine.          Last winter   he spent in Nice.
His   last illness was owing to disease of the bladder.            In August
last he    returned to Norwich, the place of his birth,             where an
operation     was performed, and a stone was extracted.          The debility
caused by this         operation, combined with     previous exhaustion of
constitution, brought on death.
    Undoubtedly, Professor        Bennett was in the medical profession
a person    of great eminence.       He introduced many very important
changes in medical practice, and made known many new principles.
His devotion to study and investigation probably led to his having
the character       of being somewhat unsociable and austere.             But
those    who had the privilege of intimacy with him, know that he
was    truthful, honest, honourable, and earnest         in every relation of
life.
   The Rev. Dr Thomas Jackson Crawford                joined our Society in
    VOL. IX.                                                         C

18                   Proceedings     of the Royal Society
1871.       He was born in 1812, and died 11th October 1875, at Genoa,
at which place, when he died, he was sojourning                        for the benefit of
his health.
  His father was Professor of Moral Philosophy in the United
College of St Andrews.
  His son Thomas received the earlier part of his education at the
Edinburgh       High School.         To St Andrews               he went back for his
more advanced        studies.    Intending   to be a clergyman of the Scotch
Church, he took his degree in 1831, and in 1834 was licensed as                            a
preacher of the gospel by the Presbytery of St Andrews.                             Whilst
at college he attracted the special notice                 of the      professors   by the
superiority of his talents, his assiduity to learn, and the excellence
of the essays which he produced.             The patronage of the parish of
Cults being in the gift of the Principal and Masters of the United
College, he was presented to that parish.
     When    the Royal Commission on Church Patronage in Scotland
sat,   it inquired into     the way in which the          University of St Andrews
exercised     its ecclesiastical rights.
     On that occasion     the Rev. Dr George Cook, one of the Professors
of St Andrews, explained to the Commissioners                       the circumstances
attending      Mr Crawford's       presentation      ;    adding, that though his
own     son was then desirous of obtaining                 it,   and though there was
a   party in Cults parish wishing his appointment, he did not hesitate
to prefer young Crawford to his own son.
     Whilst minister of Cults,       he wrote    a       Statistical    Account of the
parish, which, besides other information,                 contains several      interest
ing anecdotes        regarding    the youthful    career of         Sir David Wilkie,
the painter, whose father had been minister at Cults.
     From Cults, Mr Crawford was translated to Glamis, and six years
later he was promoted to Edinburgh,              to be minister of St Andrew's
Church, jointly with the late Rev. Dr Thomas Clark.
     About this time he received from his alma mater University,                       the
degree of     D.D.     He   also, shortly thereafter, was made Convener                 of
the General Assembly's Committee             on Psalmody, an appointment
for which he was well fitted, on account of his knowledge of and
fondness for music.
    Having     preached     a   sermon   in 1847 on Jewish Missions, which
was afterwards published, that circumstance led to his being selected

                       of Edinburgh,     Session 1875-76.                       1!J
  to take  the oversight       of the  General Assembly's       Scheme for the
  Conversion     of the Jews.
    In  1853      he entered the arena of controversy by publishing          first
                            "
 a pamphlet, entitled         Presbyterianism Defended against the Exclu
sive Claims of Prelacy," and thereafter another pamphlet, entitled
 "Presbyterianism or Prelacy; which is the more conformable to
the pattern of the Apostolic Churches."               His views on these sub
jects   were     reiterated    by Dr Crawford in the        Address which he
delivered     from the Chair of the General Assembly, as Moderator, in
the year 1867.           This public   advocacy   of Presbyterianism,     to the
prejudice of Prelacy, drew forth some            letters from Bishop Words
 worth,   which      were published in the    " Scotsman "    newspaper.
    "The Fatherhood           of God"    was  Dr Crawford's first important
contribution to purely doctrinal subjects. Dr Candlish, some of
 whose views were controverted, replied to this publication.
    At this time Dr Crawford         was Professor of   Divinity in Edinburgh
 University,       having   succeeded   the Rev. Principal Lee in the year
 1859.
     He published       also a volume on the      " Atonement,"     in the year
 1871.
     In the year 1874         he was appointed the Baird        Lecturer.    His
 lectures,    first delivered in Glasgow,        were afterwards,     by special
 request, re-delivered      in Edinburgh,    and were published in a volume
 under the      title of " Mysteries of Christianity."
     The immense amount of study which these lectures entailed,                  I
 have heard, weakened          Dr Crawford's health, and      prepared  his con
 stitution for the illness to which he ultimately succumbed.
     In the winter following the publication of          these lectures, he was
 obliged    to reside    in the milder climate of the south of England.
  He suffered from great delicacy of lungs.               But   he returned     to
 Edinburgh        last spring, whilst the sharp east winds were still pre
  vailing, and moreover betook himself again to College work, against
  the advice of his medical friends.
     During the summer of 1875 he went to Germany, sojourned a
  while in Switzerland, and then went to Italy.                There he so far
  recovered     his strength, that he could walk considerable distances,
  and even     up steep hills, without suffering inconvenience.         But   the
  weather    in the north of Italy      is often dangerous to persons       with

  20                    Proceedings      of tfie Royal Society
  weak     lungs, especially when      the wind is from the north.         After   a
  short illness of ten         days, caused   by inflammation       of the lungs,
  he died.
     Dr Crawford,      besides being a man of great eminence,           and most
 highly      respected   in his own      profession,   was   a person    of varied
 attainments.        Besides having a knowledge of music, he often took
 his part at amateur vocal concerts, with others — some of whom are
 probably now present among us to-night             — and    who,  I am sure   will
 bear     me out     when    I  say,  and   I   say it from     a  long   personal
 acquaintance with him, that            Dr Crawford       was a person    of most
 amiable disposition,        and   most   conciliatory in all the relations of
 life.    Though he entered into controversy he ever avoided personal
 aspersions     ; and those with     whom he fought, were always ready to
 admit the fairness with which he wielded his weapons.
     I learn from Dr Crawford's son, what           I  had   not been aware     of,
 that Dr Crawford kept up to the last, his knowledge of mathematics;
 and    that frequently, when he was in want of recreation, nothing
 pleased     him more than taking a problem and working it out.
     SrR   William Jardine, Bart, of Applegarth,              in the county of
 Dumfries       was born    in February     1800,    and   died 21st November
 1874,       He had been fifty years a member of this Society.
     He was the son of the sixth baronet, by a daughter of Thomas
 Maule, the representative of the Earls of Panmure.
     Born in Edinburgh,         he was educated      partly at home, partly at
 York.       With   a  view to the medical profession, he attended the
 medical classes in Edinburgh.              But   he did not carry out these
 professional views.         Having     succeeded    his father when      he  was
scarcely      twenty-one years of age, he took           up his residence   at his
family dwelling-place, Jardine Hall.              By this time he had evinced
a strong taste       for scientific pursuits, especially natural history in
all its   branches.
    He was a good botanist, a good geologist, and a good ornitho
logist.      He was also a keen sportsman, both with the gun and the
rod.     Very many specimens in the large and                 valuable   museum
which he formed at Jardine Hall, were collected by himself.
    In   the year 1825 he commenced, in conjunction                with the late
Mr Selby of Twizell, in Northumberland,                 the  publication   of the

                     of Edinburgh, Session 1875-76.                        21
 "Illustrations of Ornithology."           In 1833 he undertook a still
more important work,        "  The Naturalists' Library," forty volumes of
which appeared        in the course of the next ten years— a work for
which he obtained contributions from the best scientific natural          Utt>
in the kingdom ; — but of this work, no less than fourteen volumes
are made up of contributions by        Sir William exclusively.       He also
published a      new edition of Alexander Wilson's "American Orni
thology;" started       and carried    on   for some time a magazine of
zoology and botany;        and was also for some years a joint editor of
the
      " Edinburgh Philosophical Journal."
    Here is a list of other works which flowed from his pen : — New
edition   of "White's Selborne," "British Salmonidae," "Ichthyo
logy of Annandale."
    A still more important work by Sir William Jardine was en
titled " Contributions to Ornithology," in three volumes, extend
ing from the year 1848 to 1852.            This work contains descriptions
and coloured figures of many species of birds previously unknown.
Another publication was         " Memoirs of the late Hugh Edwin Strick
land," in the year 1858.           Mr Strickland had married a daughter
of Sir William.        He was a good geologist. He unfortunately was
killed in    a railway tunnel, the rocks      of which   he was examining
when    a  train came on him unexpectedly.
    Jardine's frequent visits to Northumberland, to co-operate with
his friend Mr Selby of Twizell, brought him into acquaintance with
Dr Johnston of Berwick-on-Tweed, who was well versed in botany
and marine zoology.         Dr Johnston having about this time founded
the    Berwickshire Naturalists' Club, Sir William Jardine joined it
in September 1832, and in that year contributed              papers of some
value    on the    "Parr"    and   the "Silver White," small      fish of the
salmon      species,   which frequented the Tweed          and  many other
rivers.     At that time, the true nature of      these fish was not known,
though it has since been well ascertained             that the parr are the
young of the true salmon in their first year's growth.
    Sir William Jardine       was President of the Berwickshire       Natura
lists' Club in the year 1836, and frequently attended its meetings
in subsequent years.
     In the year      1880    he was   one   of  the' Royal   Commissioners
appointed to investigate          the Salmon Fisheries      of England    and

22                    Proceedings of the Royal Society
Wales.       The evidence collected by                      these     Commissioners       is of
great value.        Legislation       followed on their report.
   Shortly before his death, Sir William                       occupied himself in pre
paring a catalogue of the various objects of interest in his museum.
This catalogue was in proof, and awaiting revisal when he died.
The list of birds contains no less than 6000 species, and probably
not less than 12,000 specimens.     Sir William was most obliging
in lending        specimens to friends.                 I   remember on one occasion
obtaining from him on loan the skull of                       a   fossil bear found in this
country, on the occasion of                a   popular lecture which             I was   giving
in Berwickshire.
   Sir William Jardine               wasduring the last ten years of his life
constantly resident at           Jardine Hall, enjoying the sports of country
life, discharging          the duties of a proprietor, and taking                    his share
of county and parochial business.
   William Macdonald                 was born in the year 1798,                  and died on
1st   January      1875.      He was the oldest member of our Society, in
the class of Ordinary          Fellows, having joined the Society in the year
1820.      There     is,   however, one older member,                   my venerable friend
Sir Richard         Griffiths,    who       is    an    Extraordinary Fellow of the
Society.        He was ninety-one              years    of age last September, and           is
still in excellent health, residing                    near Kelso.      I      believe that Sir
Richard      would have been               here    to-night,      had    the weather been
less stormy.
  Dr Macdonald             at an early age inherited              a   good estate inArgyll
shire.     He applied himself               to the execution            of extensive works
in that county, for the improvement                         of his property, and of the
district    where    it    was situated.           Unfortunately          he    involved him
self in financial difficulties, and was obliged to sell his estate.
   He      then    studied     medicine,          passed     with      honours,     but never
practised.
   In    1820     he joined      a   number of Societies.                He was the oldest
member not only of our Society, but also of the Royal College of
Physicians        and of the Linnean             Society.
   Dr Macdonald frequently                 read papers to us on various subjects.
He held peculiar views on some points of anatomy, which were

                      of Edinburgh,     Session   1875-76.
entirely     at variance with those generally held     ;  but he never would
concede that he was in error.
     He    was very partial     to natural  history, and wrote upon
                                                                            " The
Structure of Fishes," " The Unity of Organisation, as exhibited in
the Skeleton of Animals," and " On the Vertebral Homologies, as
applicable      to Zoology."
     In   the year 1849 he accepted an appointment to that somewhat
                                                                         "
anomalous professorship of " Civil and Natural History                      in St
Andrews, but I am not sure whether he ever had any students.
     He had formed a large and interesting collection of specimens
 in natural history and anatomy.
      Principal Shairp informs me that,        a few years   before his death,
 Dr Macdonald         made over this collection to the University       Museum.
      Donald Mackenzie         became   a  Fellow of this Society in 1870.
 He    was born      19th June    1818,  and died 17th May 1875, at Nor
 wood, near London, where he had gone on account of                ill health.
      Though born in Edinburgh, his father was from Sutherlandshire,
 and a Captain in the Royal          North British Fusiliers.        His mother
 was Robina         Jamieson,    one of the seventeen       children    of   John
  Jamieson,       D.D., who wrote the well-known           Dictionary      of  the
  Scottish language.
      Donald was the eldest of seven children, all of whom he survived,
  though he, too, died at the comparatively early age of fifty-seven.
      At first    he  studied for medicine, and received the degree              of
  M.D. from      the University of Edinburgh in 1838.            He was also a
  Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons.
      But he abandoned that profession, and came to the Scottish bar,
  influenced, it is believed, by the expectation           that   as   his uncle,
  Robert Jamieson, advocate, had a large amount of practice in the
  Courts, he would be able to give him a lift.            Robert Jamieson         I
  remember well in the Parliament              House, being the most con
  spicuous figure there for height and breadth, and a lawyer of great
  acuteness.       His sister, Donald's mother, lived    to the age of eighty-
  four.
      Donald, to whom this notice refers, did not inherit the Jamieson
   constitution.      He  was narrow-chested      and slim, but walked with
   elastic step.

  24                  Proceedings      of the Royal Society
    Having    come       to the bar in 1842, he soon got              into considerable
 practice, and was popular among his brethren in the Parliament
 House.     He    was      appointed Advocate-Depute               in 1854,        an office
 which he held       till  1858, when he lost       it   on a change of Govern
 ment.     He   was reinstated in 1858, and              was appointed Sheriff             of
 Fife in   1861.       In the discharge of this           office, he is said to have
 given great satisfaction, both to the practitioners                      in the Sheriff-
 Court and to the resident gentry.
    Mr Mackenzie          was raised    to the    Bench in 1870, and was not
 only most conscientious in his attention to the judicial duties, but
 was   successful in        pronouncing      judgments          which       were    seldom
 reversed.    It   is related that on        two occasions, when they were
 reversed in the     Inner House, they         were, by an appeal           to the House
of Lords, adhered to.
    Lord Mackenzie was exceedingly fond of all country sports.                            A
serious illness was contracted, about two years before his death, in
consequence      of his continuing         to fish   in wet clothes,          till he got a
severe   chill.     In November         1874    he became        so    ill, that    he was
obliged to ask leave of absence for the winter.                     During the       subse
quent Christmas holidays, he attempted to return to his work in
the   Bill Chamber, but           he was obliged       to give      it  up, and confine
himself to bed.         Disease    of the heart, aggravated by rheumatism,
had set in.      He continued more or less an invalid for                   a  whole year
before his death, seldom discharging any                judicial work.
   Lord Mackenzie was universally respected                   for his close attention
to duty,    his sound         knowledge and judgment               as    a   lawyer,    his
freedom    from      guile, and his conciliatory           disposition         toward    all
with whom he was brought in contact.                  His life      was shortened by
a determination         to perform any duty incumbent                  on him, though
probably conscious that he was thereby weakening                            his constitu
tion.
   John Sinclair         was born 20th August            1797, and died 22d May
1875.     He  was the third son of the           Right Hon. Sir John Sinclair,
Bart,   of Ulbster,        in   the county      of Caithness, author of that
valuable    repertory,       the   Statistical   Account        of     Scotland.       His
mother was Diana,            daughter of Alexander,            the   first Lord Mac-
donald.

                    of Edinburgh,     Session 1875-76.                           25
    His education      commenced     in Edinburgh        University; but         he
 went afterwards to Pembroke College, Oxford.
   In the last     book which he published, entitled
                                                             " Old Times      and
 Distant Places,"     he mentions that, when at Edinburgh            University,
 he was the chief means     of forming what     was called the
                                                                    " Rhetorical
Society," among the members of which were the present Earl of
Wemyss, the late Adam Anderson (afterwards Lord Anderson), and
David Robertson, who, whilst on his death-bed, was created Lord
Marjoribanks.
   When     he went to Oxford,       he proposed     a similar     society;   but
"the Dons" (he says)          " frowned            him, and prevented          it."
                                           upon
The project was renewed        some years after.       The " Oxford Union
Club"   was then formed, embracing among its members                 the present
Archbishop     of Canterbury, Mr Gladstone,          Mr Lowe, and others
who afterwards became men of distinction.
   Having    gone    through the necessary      forms for taking orders          in
the Episcopal      Church, he was ordained by the Bishop of               Lincoln
in 1820.     He  was shortly thereafter appointed to St Paul's Episco
pal Chapel, Carrubbers Close, where he remained                till  he became
assistant to the Rev. Mr Alison, the officiating            clergyman of the
then new and handsome         chapel of St Paul's, in York Place.
   It was in the year 1820 that       Mr Sinclair joined our Society.             I
see from his   little  book, that he took a considerable interest in our
proceedings,    as  he mentions our      Dinner Club, of which         he was a
member, and specifies        several   duties which      he   undertook as a
member of Council.
   Thus  he was selected      by the Council to endeavour to induce             Dr
Williams, rector of the English Academy, to shorten the length
of a paper he was to read on Greek particles, a subject on which
he had read several long papers         before, much to the ennui          of the
majority    of members.      Dr Williams, it      seems, was not a person
who could be easily diverted from his purpose          ;  Mr Sinclair under
took to try his hand upon the inflexible Welshman.                He explains,
in an amusing way, how he succeeded.
   Another     more    important work with        which     Mr Sinclair       was
entrusted by our Council, was the arrangement of the unpublished
MSS. of Hume, the historian.            These MSS. had been left             as   a
legacy to the      Society by the late Baron         Hume, the historian's
   VOL. XI.                                                             i,

26                Proceedings        of the Royal Society
nephew.      In this duty        he was     conjoined       with   the late     Lord
Meadowbank and Dr Abercrombie;                 but the chief part of the work
fell  on  Mr Sinclair.
    He   mentions that       it  was in the year         1828 that      he  became
acquainted with Dr Thomas Chalmers, when the latter resigned
his professorship of Moral          Philosophy     at St Andrews,        to become
Professor of Divinity in Edinburgh University.                    Having    a great
admiration for the doctor's        character and writings, he attended his
first course   of lectures,     and    describes    the    intense interest with
which he and the other students listened to the professor's                   exposi
tions.    The salary of the professors           being then very small — only
£200 — the idea of offering         a   testimonial    to    Dr Chalmers, at the
end    of his first  course,    occurred     to  Mr Sinclair.       Accordingly      a
sum of £200 was raised from the voluntary students,                  and presented
to the new professor.
   In   the year 1839      Mr Sinclair       went to London,         apparently to
consult    Mr Wardrop, the        celebrated     occulist, about his eyes.        He
had    to submit to     a  painful     operation     and    to  severe   discipline,
which confined him to        a room     in London for some weeks.
    Whilst   he was there, a vacancy occurred in the office of Secre
tary to the   National Society — a great Society, established, among
other things, for the encouragement and support of schools con
nected    with the Church        of England.        Mr Sinclair was asked to
fill the vacant office.      At first    he   refused, as it would oblige him
to leave Edinburgh      altogether, and he could not           be certain of being
so well received     in London        as he had      been in his own       country.
But finding that      the   two   London       Archbishops      and other persons
of influence were anxious that he should accept,                    he consented.
He was at the same time appointed to be examining chaplain to the
Bishop of London.
    Immediately after entering on this new office, he found himself
involved in a great public controversy, which called for the utmost
exertion, with great tact on his part. The controversy had reference
to the   schools  of the National Society receiving aid from Govern
ment.      After   the    administration       of the Education         Grant    was
transferred from the Lords of the Treasury to the Privy Council
Committee,     a system      of inspection,     to see    that the schools were
properly conducted as regards teaching, was resolved                      on.    The

                         of Edinburgh,          Session 1875-76.                       27
Church of England did not object to inspectors                    ;   but inasmuch as
the religious       instruction      in the schools was to be reported on by
Government          inspectors, the Church desired to have some security
as    to the     qualifications      of the inspectors         to judge     of that in
struction.
     The National Society, at the suggestion of                 Mr Sinclair,     resolved
to intimate to Government that they would recommend the
managers of all Church of England schools to refuse the Govern
ment     grants, unless some arrangement satisfactory to the Church
was made on that point.     The Government having at first refused to
make any concession, notice was sent to the                Privy Council from         the
managers of about              200   schools,    that they would not in future
receive the grant.          Mr Sinclair, in support of       the National Society's
views, appealed to the Universities                of Oxford    and Cambridge, and
secured      their help.        He preached         on   the subject    ;   he   induced
several    of   the leading London         newspapers to advocate           the views of
the    Church;      he obtained the assistance           of Lord Ashley and other
influential      public men.         At length     the   Privy Council Committee
yielded, — agreeing         that no inspector should be allowed to examine
any    Church of England School whose name had not first been sub
mitted to the Archbishops     of Canterbury and York for their
sanction.        This privilege      was extended also to the schools in Scot
land connected with the Church.
     The grants to the Church of England                 Schools were paid to the
Treasurer of the National Society, and were by him distributed                         to
the schools.        When       the above    arrangement had           been completed,
the office      of treasurer   was held by a       Mr Watson, who       was so averse
to the proceedings of the            Privy Council, that       to avoid touching the
unclean     thing, he refused to receive the Government grant, or grant
a    receipt for   it,   and sent    in his resignation.         Mr Sinclair     on this
occasion      was appointed to be treasurer,             so that he was installed
into the two most important and laborious offices of the Society.
     In the year     1843      Mr Sinclair, in addition         to these    duties, was
called    on to undertake         important pastoral work.            In that year     he
was appointed            Vicar of Kensington,        and   in    the following      year
Archdeacon of Middlesex.
  The population of that new part of London had immensely out
grown the means of public worship, so he set himself to work on

28                Proceedings      of the Royal Society
behalf of Church Extension.            He remained Vicar and Archdeacon
for the last thirty years of his life.          When      he came into the dis
trict there  were three parishes         ; before   the close of his career, he
had been the means        of forming in it twenty-three parishes.
   Whenever Mr Sinclair found it necessary to carry any important
measure in later years, he seems to have acted on a hint given to
him by the late Dr Chalmers, on the last occasion, as he says, that
he saw this great and good man.             This    was in the year 1843.       He
had been    telling  the Doctor of what he was doing for the support
and extension of the Church             of England       National    Schools, and
in particular,    how he had          received     promises      of support from
hundreds of influential people, including members of the Cabinet
and of both Houses of Parliament.              Dr Chalmers, he              " heard
                                                                     says,
me patiently for some time, and then replied,
                                                             '
                                                               Mr Sinclair,  I per
ceive  you   are an enthusiast      ;  your National        Society must, under
God, depend     upon the nation for support, and not on Cabinets or
Parliaments.'
                "
   After this conversation, very little          is said by    Mr Sinclair in his
autobiography about applications by him to influential individuals;
whilst a good      deal   is said about the public            meetings which he
resorted to when he wanted         to raise money, or to influence public
opinion.    He never spoke from the platform himself; for after leav
ing the University, he lost the fluency of speech, which he says, he
had acquired there      ; but he had great tact in arranging meetings
and providing speakers who were likely to               be  listened to.
    Several amusing stories       of this kind are told in his little book.
One may be mentioned.              Mr Thackeray had recently come                 to
reside in Kensington,       and   Mr Sinclair thought his name would              be
a powerful    attraction.     Mr Sinclair called upon him.              Thackeray
was unwell, and     in his bedroom.         Mr Sinclair having        sent   up his
card, Thackeray      came down stairs, when          Mr Sinclair explained his
object.    Thackeray at once declined, saying he had never in his
life made a speech in public, and that he only wrote for the public;
and besides    he was too      ill to   leave   the  house.      Mr Sinclair said
that he would not insist on        a speech,      but that it was very difficult
to get up a meeting in Kensington,           and that    if Mr Thackeray would
only allow his name to        be  printed in the handbills, he would not
insist on his saying much, and would have the speaking done by

                     of Edinburgh,     Session 1875-76.                      2U
others.      Mr Thackeray    was amused, and said,     " Well, if   I am  alive,
I   will   come to your meeting."        The handbills     were    accordingly
issued with Thackeray's name in them.            A   great crowd assembled.
Mr      Thackeray appeared     on the platform.       He found when there
he could not avoid saying something. His words                  were few but
telling, and they were received with enthusiasm.                   Mr Sinclair
 adds, that this was the only time that the rhetorical powers of the
 great novelist were proved at      a public meeting.
     It   was  not merely in London         that Mr Sinclair      was of use.
 During general periods of great distress in the manufacturing and
 mining districts of Wales and Lancashire, the bishops of these
 dioceses obtained his services       to enable   them    to raise   funds and
 devise measures       of relief; his services     in these    respects   being
 thought of, on account of his well-known business habits, and also
 his sympathy with the working         classes.
     In   the year 1853 he was sent out to the United         States as one of
 a deputation from the Church of England to the General Conven
 tion of the Protestant Episcopal Church in New York. When
 there, he made acquaintance with Mr Washington, the nephew of
  the great man who had founded the American              Republic, and with
  whom his father, Sir John Sinclair, had corresponded.
      I  have  had sent to me a long list        of pamphlets, books,        and
  sermons,    published by the Archdeacon.         The largest work is one
  in two volumes, published in 1837, on the Life and Times of his
  father.
      From what    I have  said, it will be perceived    that Mr Sinclair, by
  the energy with which he threw himself into every work he under
  took, justified    Dr Chalmers' opinion, that       he was an enthusiast.
  But his enthusiasm      was — which is rarely the case — tempered         with
  great good     sense and sound judgment.        His untiring industry, his
   practical usefulness,   and his benevolence     of character, showed that
   he was no unworthy son of a most excellent and patriotic Scotchman.
      Having concluded all that it          has  occurred to me        to  state
   regarding ourselves   — I mean regarding the work we          are doing, and
   our means    of doing it — I proceed to submit to you         a few  remarks
   regarding the present state of science generally in our own country.
      It  appears to me that a great educational movement,           amounting

30                 Proceedings of          the  Royal Society
almost to a revolution, is at present taking place in our land,                      and
especially in that branch of public                education which relates             to
 science.   I will not   say that old institutions         are being subverted           ;
but undoubtedly new institutions are rising up very different from
 the old, and the old are undergoing considerable changes.                   I believe
 that the seed from which all these changes               have     sprung, and are
springing, was planted by one man               — the late Prince Consort.              I
know of no other person of weight and influence who                    so  constantly
took    every opportunity of urging on the people of this country
the introduction      into     our universities      and    schools of scientific
instruction.
    This opinion is      shared      by others     more    entitled than me to
speak on this subject      ;   to whom     I  will now shortly     refer.
    Three weeks ago, at Oxford, His Royal Highness Prince Leopold
agreed to perform      the duty of distributing        prizes to students of the
School of Science       and     Art established in that town.             The prince
was introduced on that occasion by the Duke of Marlborough, lord-
lieutenant of the county, and who, some years ago, was President
 of the Government Department on Education.                    His Grace, on in
                                            " it was not surprising that His
troducing the prince, said that
Royal Highness      should take a warm interest in every thing that
belonged to Science and Art, when they remembered                       that he trod
in the steps of the illustrious           prince    to whom      the development
of Science and Art           in this    country was mainly           if not wholly
attributable."
    Prince Leopold responded          to this sentiment.       "  I do   not forget,"
said   His Royal Highness, " that           there is devolved upon me, as well
as upon   other members          of my family, a sacred trust, to foster, in
such    manner   as  we are able,        the general study throughout               the
kingdom of Science and Art.            From the passage      I am about to read,"
                          " you will      perceive that only      a few years ago,
he continued to say,
and even in our university,          Science   and  Art studies     received     little,
if any, support.    I will     quote from an address by my revered father
on the occasion of his laying the first stone of the Birmingham                     and
Midland    Institute,    almost exactly twenty-four years ago."                    The
passage quoted by      Prince      Leopold, was a remarkable one.             Its first
sentence   was as follows:        — " The study of      the laws by which the
Almighty     governs    the universe is our bounden duty."                     Prince

                     of Edinburgh,       Session 1875-76.                     31
Albert, in the passage so read by his son on this occasion,             went on
to show that, besides        being our duty      as  human beings, it was for
our interest   as  citizens to attend on these studies.         "I advise  you,"
said the prince, "      to follow, in undivided attention, the sciences        of
mechanics, physics, and chemistry, and the fine arts of painting,
sculpture,    and     architecture.    You will thus confer upon your
country an inestimable boon, and in a short time have the satis
faction of witnessing the beneficial results upon our national powers
of production.       Other parts of the country will emulate your ex
ample, and     I live in hope that all these institutions will some day
find a central point of union, and thus complete                   the  national
organisation."
     Weighty   as these words      of Prince Albert were, and coming from
 an authority     so much      respected,   I am not sure that they would
 have been universally listened to, had it not been for the great
 international exhibition of works of industry held in London in the
 year 1851 — itself     a measure due      to the sagacity of that excellent
 prince.    There the people of this country first saw, with their own
 eyes, what were the fruits of the superior schools            for scientific in
 struction existing in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, and France.
     Shortly afterwards, royal commissions were issued to ascertain to
 what extent any of the sciences             specified   by the Prince Consort
 were taught in our schools.
     The result of    these inquiries was sufficiently remarkable.
     In the year    1864 the    Public Schools' Commission, after special
 inquiry, reported that from all the first class schools in England,
 the teaching of science was practically excluded.
     This official   exposure     had some effect      ; for in the year 1868
 another Government           commission, the Endowed Schools' Commis
 sion, reported,    that   a  majority of the endowed schools in England
  had intimated      their willingness      and their intention to introduce
 science teaching.
     To how very small an extent this promise was fulfilled, may be
 judged of by the revelations of the Oxford and Cambridge school
 examinations made throughout             England     during the last three or
 four years.     Even in this very year of 1875 what has been ascer
  tained?    Out of 461 candidates for certificates of good scholarship
  from 40 first-class English schools, there were only 28 scholars in

 32                 Proceedings     of the Royal          Society
 chemistry, 21 scholars in mechanics, 15 in physical geography, and
 6  in botany; whilst for Greek there were 433 scholars, for Latin
 438, and for elementary mathematics 458.
    The small amount of scientific instruction given in the English
endowed     schools was ascertained, still more precisely, by the Royal
Commission, which has only recently framed its report.                        I mean
the commission       over   which    the Duke          of Devonshire        presided.
From that report it appears          that    a  circular was sent out by this
commission two years ago to about 250 endowed schools, requesting
them     to fill up a schedule showing what amount of scientific
instruction,    if any,  was given in them.
   Only 128 answers were received.            That fact     alone was significant.
But when these answers came to be examined, it was found that out
of the   128 answers, only 87 gave any definite information.                 Of these
87, 65 confessed      to  giving   no science        teaching whatever;        of the
remaining     22, the utmost time allotted to any kind                   of scientific
instruction, was four hours per week, in eighteen of the schools.
   But though it was right to ascertain the truth in this matter
through the authentic inquiries of royal commissions, the people of
this country, knowing well enough, from their own experience and
observation how the matter stood, would not wait for these official
inquiries.     They  took the matter into their own hands, and set to
work at once to supply what was required.                     I  do not know any
stronger proofs of public patriotism in our country, than what this
educational movement affords.           In all    the great centres of industry,
arrangements were made           for having         institutions     established    in
which not only science       in its various branches should be taught,
but the arts and literature also.
   At Manchester, John Owens           bequeathed         about  L. 100,000 for the
endowment of a new college.             No part of that           money,    however,
being allowed to       be   expended on buildings,             his fellow-citizens
supplied what was needed.         A   sum of    L. 250,000      was raised; and in
the year 1870 the foundation stone of            a magnificent edifice was laid
for a Science and     Art College,    the Duke of Devonshire presiding.
   In   the year 1871, a physical        science      college was established in
Newcastle, for which       L. 35, 000    was    raised; and       as  it  was to be
affiliated with Durham       University,      that university agreed         to give
L.1000    a year out of its revenue for the institution.

    In  the year 1873,    Josiah Mason,        who had made       a large fortune
as a manufacturer        at Binning! am         and   Kidderminster,    gave   the
princely     sum   of L.250,000 for the erection           and endowment of a
College of Practical Science in Birmingham.
    In January     1874, an association       was formed for the promotion of
scientific     industry in Lancaster, at which the Earl of Derby pre
sided — an association formed chiefly at the instance of Lancaster
manufacturers and artizans, who, having visited the Vienna Inter
national     Exhibition held in the autumn of             1873, had    seen there
the rapid     and alarming progress of Continental            nations in many of
the arts.
    In the    same year, the Yorkshire College of Science           was begun    in
Leeds, of which college Lord Frederick                 Cavendish is president,
there being L.100,000 subscribed for it.
    In   the course    of last summer, steps were taken to establish in
Bristol    a College of Science, to be affiliated to Oxford University,
for which L. 26,000        has been       already subscribed.       Nottingham,
Sheffield, and other towns, not        so   wealthy   as to  found colleges, are,
however, stirring for the establishment of schools and societies for
the teaching of classes.      ,
    In Scotland, Dundee       is stirring, wishing to have a college which
is to be affiliated with St Andrews University,               and for which it is
proposed     to raise as much as     L. 200,000.
    Nor    are   our old, time-honoured          national   universities,   in the
 midst of this great educational movement,                asleep.   Asleep or in
 different     they could scarcely remain, for very obvious               reasons.
 Both at Cambridge and at Oxford, science lectures and fellowships
 have been at length introduced         ;  and the Chancellor of Cambridge,
 the noble Duke of Devonshire, has, from his own funds, presented
 that university with a splendid chemical and physical laboratory,
 having    a most complete      apparatus,    at a cost of L.10,000.
    Our own University of Edinburgh              has during the last five years
 had three new chairs created and endowed for engineering, geology,
 and political     economy; and farther measures              of extension, on     a
 large scale, are being adopted, for which above L.85,000 have been
 already subscribed.

 out of old pat lis, or even for moving in them, except at a slow pace,

34                  Proceedings of      the  Royal Society
are showing       signs of progress.      The Royal English Agricultural
Society last year set apart L.500 to be given yearly in scholarships
to encourage      instruction in the sciences bearing on agriculture.
   The Highland and Agricultural Society has this year set apart
L.250 for a similar purpose.
   But   I  must here offer a word of apology for the managers of the
English      endowed    schools, which, in their programmes of studies,
made no provision whatever for science.              I remember    when my son
was at one       of these   schools, that   I went    to the head master and
ventured to hint the disappointment            I felt at the want of such pro
vision.     His answer was — " We        are obliged to suit our teaching to
university     requirements.        Only certain subjects       are     taught  at
Oxford and Cambridge          ;  and we endeavour to prepare our scholars
in the subjects taught in these universities."
   I  thought the excuse satisfactory        ;  but now that the old univer
sities have introduced science teaching, and now that new colleges
are being established all over the land with               the same view, and
bursaries     are given by societies,     corporations, and associations, in
almost every large town, these secondary endowed schools will have
no longer an excuse for not           giving science instruction      ;  they will
be even under a necessity to         give it for their own sakes.
    Here again, however,        I have to observe that the country refused
to wait this slow progress of school amelioration.            The Government,
with the entire approval of Parliament,                by means    of    a special
department at Kensington,           encouraged    the establishment through
out England and Scotland of schools and classes for the teaching of
science     and art.    This encouragement         was and is now given by
prizes to scholars, remuneration to teachers, and loans of apparatus
to the schools.       The result    has been marvellous.       The scheme has
been in operation for only nine years.            At first it  was little known
and    not well understood;         but now these schools are           extending
rapidly   ;  for whilst in the year 1869, that is three years after the
scheme      was started,   there were in Great       Britain only   523 schools
with 24,865 scholars, there were in 1874 (since which date                  I have
seen no reports), 1336 schools and 53,050 scholars.
    It is also proper to mention that the national elementary schools
which are recognised by the Education               Act for England        and for
Scotland, are encouraged          to include various sciences in their pro

                    of Edinburgh, Session         1875-76.
gramme of lessons      ; there being capitation grants of money to the
managers of these schools for scholars who, at the annual inspec
tions, pass satisfactory examinations             in various branches of
science.
   I  have thus at some length explained what has been done during
the last ten, and more      particularly during the last five years, for
increasing     the means of scientific instruction          in our universities,
colleges, and even in elementary schools, because                of the import
ant bearing of these measures         in promoting such objects as this
Society aims at.       When vast multitudes of our population            become
conversant with science, who knew nothing of science before, who
can doubt that investigation     will  be stimulated, and that discoveries
and inventions will be made with a speed hitherto unprecedented                  ?
   But there is another       measure    of even       greater importance       to
 science, which is about to be taken in this country.               Our schools,
colleges, and universities are institutions         for teaching truths, and
explaining facts already known.          It   is now proposed        to establish
colleges of research,     as they have    heen     called, for aiding in the
discovery of truths, facts, and principles not yet known.
    In  the year 1868, the British Association           for the advancement
of   science    appointed a committee of some of its most eminent
members      to report on the two following      questions    : —
    " Does there exist in the United Kingdom of Great Britain                 and
Ireland, sufficient provision for   the vigorous prosecution of physical
research?"
    " If  not, what farther provision is needed, and what measures
should be taken to secure it"
    In the following year that committee           gave in a report, answer
ing these questions thus : —
    " The provision now existing in the United Kingdom is far               from
sufficient for the vigorous prosecution of physical research.
    "Whilst      greatly  increased   facilities     for   extending    physical
research are required, your committee do not consider it expedient
to define how these facilities should be provided."              The committee
                " as the whole question of the relation of the State to
added, that
 Science is at present in a very unsatisfactory position, they urge
that a Royal Commission alone is competent to deal with the
 subject."

36                    Proceediuys        of the Royal Society
    That report having           been approved          of by    the   Association,   an
influential     deputation       waited on Her Majesty's              Government,      to
suggest    the appointment of a Commission                ;   and accordingly in   May
1870 such a Commission was appointed.
    This Commission          has been most       diligent in its investigation and
discussion of the several            points remitted to it.           They have exa
mined several          hundred witnesses,         and    have    issued no less than
eight reports.
    Besides ascertaining         the condition of our universities, colleges,
a nd  endowed first-class schools,          as regards      their teaching power, and
suggesting in many cases that assistance should be given to them
 by   the   State,     the   Commissioners        took     up the other important
question, to which            the British Association specially             had called
attention   —   viz. this, whether the State ought not to aid                researches
for discovering new scientific facts and truths.
    As  the report of the Commissioners               on this question is of great
interest    alike to men         of science      and    to scientific   bodies   in this
 country,     1   quote     a few    sentences     to show the opinion of these
 Royal Commissioners, and the advice they give to Her Majesty's
 Government        : —
    " The great       advances    in physical science which have been made
 in this country, and within            this century, by such men           as  Dalton,
 Davy, and Faraday, without aid               from     the   State; the existence of
 numerous learned societies             ;  and    the devotion      of  some   few  rich
 individuals to the current work of science, at first sight appear to
 reduce the     limits within which State            aid   to research   is required   in
 this country.
    " But    whilst      we  have    reason    to be proud       of the contributions
 of  some      great Englishmen           to    our knowledge          of the laws of
 nature, it must be admitted                that at the        present day     scientific
 investigation is carried on abroad              to an extent, and        with a com
 pleteness of organisation to which this country can offer no parallel.
 The work done in this country by private individuals, although of
 great value, is small when compared with that which is needed                          in
 the   interests of science        ;  and   the efforts of the       learned societies,
 not excepting        the Royal      Society, are directed merely to the dis
 cussion and publication of the scientific facts brought under their

                      of Edinburgh,         Session 1875-70.                         37
notice. These societies do not consider it any part of their corporate
functions     to undertake or conduct research
     "But whatever may          be the disposition of individuals          to conduct
researches at their own cost, the advancement of modern science
requires     investigations      and observations extending over areas so
large, and periods so long, that the means and lives of nations are
alone commensurate with them.
     '•
        Hence   the progress        of scientific    research     must in a great
measure depend upon            the aid of Governments.              As   a nation, we
ought to take our share of the current scientific work of the world.
 Much of this work            has always been voluntarily            undertaken by
 individuals,    and  it is not desirable that Government should super
 sede such efforts     ; but it is bound to assume that large portion of
 the national duty, which individuals do not attempt to perform, or
 cannot satisfactorily accomplish."
     The   sentences    which    I   have  now read are the preamble           and the
 basis of the conclusions to which the Commissioners unanimously
 came.      These conclusions are as follows          : —
     1.  "The    assistance     given by the State in this country for the
 promotion      of scientific      research   is inadequate;      and     it  does not
 appear that the concession           or refusal of assistance     takes place upon
 sufficiently well-defined principles."
     2.  " More complete         means    are urgently       required for scientific
 investigations, in connection with certain Government departments.
  Physical    as well as other laboratories an           1  apparatus    for such in
  vestigations ought to be provided."
     3.
         " Important    classes of phenomena relating to physical meteor
  ology, and to terrestrial and astronomical physics, require observa
  tions of such   a  character, that they cannot         be  advantageously     carried
  on otherwise than under the direction          of the   Government."
     4.   "Whilst national collections of natural history               are accessible
  to private    investigators,     it is desirable that they should           be made
  still  more useful for purposes        of research    than they are at present.
  We would now        express      the opinion    that corresponding aid ought
  to be afforded to persons engaged in important physical and chemi
  cal investigations     ;   and that,     whenever practicable, such persons
  should be allowed        access,  under proper limitations,         to such   labora
  tories as may    be established or aided by the State."

38                  Proceedings of       the  Royal Society
   5.
       " It  has been the practice to restrict grants         of money    made to
private investigators for purposes           of research,    to the expenditure
actually incurred by them.           We think that       such grants might      be
considerably increased.         We   are also of opinion, that the restriction
to which we have         referred,   however desirable as a general rule,
should not     be  maintained in all cases, but that, under certain cir
cumstances      and   with    proper safeguards,      investigators should      be
                                                 "
remunerated      for their time and labour.
    6. " The grant of L.1000 administered by the Royal Society, has
contributed greatly to the promotion of research, and the amount
of this grant may with advantage           be considerably increased.''
    "In    the case of researches which involve, and are of sufficient
importance to deserve,         exceptional expenditure,         direct grants, in
addition to the annual grant made to the Royal Society, should be
made     in aid of the investigations.-'
    7.  " The proper allocation of funds for           research   ; the establish
ment and extension of laboratories and observatories              ; and generally,
the advancement        of science, and the promotion of scientific instruc
tion as an     essential part of public education, would be most effec
tually dealt with, by       a  Ministry of     Science and Education, and we
 consider    the creation  of  such a ministry     of primary importance."
    8.
        " The various departments of         the Government have from time
to time referred scientific questions to the Council of the Royal
 Society for its advice.        We believe that the work of          a Minister of
 Science, even     if aided by a well-organised         scientific staff, and also
the work of the other departments, would be materially assisted,                  if
 they were able to obtain, in        all cases of exceptional       importance or
 difficulty, the advice of a Council representing the scientific know
 ledge of the nation."
    9.
        " This Council should       represent    the chief scientific bodies     in
the United Kingdom.             With this view, its composition          need  not
differ very greatly from that of the present Government                     Grant
 Committee of the Royal            Society.     It  might     consist of men     of
science selected      by the Council of the Royal Society, together with
representatives of other important scientific societies,             and a certain
number of persons nominated by the Govenment."
    Such, gentlemen, are the conclusions and recommendations of
 these Royal Commissioners on a subject deeply interesting not only

                   of Edinburgh, Session 1875-76.                        39
to all scientific bodies, and men of science     in this country, but to
the nation     at  large.   The    Commissioners     are men     eminently
qualified by social position, by enlightened knowledge, and by a
thorough investigation of the subject, to pronounce an opinion,
and I feel very confident that when their report comes before
Parliament, their conclusions will       be accepted,   the organisation
recommended       by them     agreed  to, and   the   necessary    supplies
ungrudgingly voted.
    I have, before concluding, only one other point to mention.          No
great measure, whether political     or educational, can be adopted in
this country by the Government, or even by Parliament, which has
not obtained previously the general assent of the community.
Now it is     a  gratifying circumstance, that during the last few
months, many distinguished men, good judges of public opinion,
and who also themselves influence public opinion, have recently
taken occasion    to advert to the question of scientific      instruction.
 I have already mentioned the names      of His Royal Highness Prince
Leopold and his Grace the Duke of Marlborough.            It so happens
                               "
 that the same page of the Times" newspaper, of the 12th Nov.,
 which reports what they said, gives speeches in the same direction
 by Sir Alexander     Cockburn, Lord Chief-Justice of England,          and
 by Mr Gladstone, the ex-Premier.          Going   back  a few    weeks,   I
 find speeches by the Duke of Devonshire, the Marquis of Harting-
 ton, the Earl of Derby, the Marquis     of Ripon, Lord Winmanleigh,
 Lord Frederick Cavendish, Sir Stafford Northcote,       the  Right Hon.
 Lyon Playfair, and Mr Bell, M.P. for Hartlepool,        one of our most
extensive and intelligent    iron-masters.
    These names    I  mention to show that the great landowners of
 the country, and also many distinguished statesmen, are responding
 heartily to the appeal made to them by our manufacturers and
 merchants, who feel that their own interests, and         the continued
 prosperity of the country in trade and commerce,        require institu
 tions which will give to their sons, and also to the working classes,
 a more technical education than they have hitherto received.         With
 such combined action, who can doubt that an immense impetus
 will be given both to scientific  teaching and to scientific research      ?
 Wonderful indeed     have been the discoveries during       the last   half
 century, even with the scanty appliances which men of science

40                  Proceedings       of the Royal Society
have     hitherto   had   at   their   command.           These     discoveries,     the
Lord Chief-Justice Cockburn said, " perfectly overwhelmed him
with astonishment," and as the Royal Commissioners said, may
justly invoke national pride, that so many of them should be due
to the unaided efforts of individuals.               What, then, may we look
forward to in the next half century, with the additional appliances
which these Commissioners recommend?
    But, perhaps, here a word of caution, even from so humble an
adviser as myself, may be allowed. Lord Chief-Justice Cockburn,
on the occasion to which       I have referred,       says —
                                                               " No     one bows    with
a   more     profound and reverent worship at the shrine of science
than    I do.    No  one values more        than    I   do classical       attainments.
 Nevertheless, allow me to say, that           I know      of no study more valu
able to an Englishman        than the study of English.              Nothing     is more
valuable than the power of English              composition, English oratory,
and    English elocution;     and greatly as       I  value classical knowledge,
 and   the knowledge of foreign            languages,        I  still    say,  that the
 English     language and    English     composition are of the first impor
 tance    to   Englishmen."         These     remarks        he    followed      up   by
announcing       his wish to give      a  prize of twenty guineas annually
 for a piece of English composition.
    Much to the same purpose, our distinguished colleague Mr Lyon
 Playfair, when assisting        the other day to inaugurate the Science
 College at Leeds, expressed           a hope      that the       institution      would
 not be confined to science,           but would embrace              letters and the
 arts.
    These views suggest one danger to be avoided by those who are
 anxious to establish colleges and schools for scientific teaching.
 The country, willing        as   it undoubtedly         is to supply deficiencies
 in this   respect, will certainly    not agree that a knowledge of science
 shall be all that a well-educated Englishman                  or Scotchman ought
 to possess.
    But   there is another danger,        and    one more       serious.      Mr Glad
 stone, when distributing the prizes of the science and art classes at
 Greenwich,      three weeks ago, made these                impressive remarks: —
 " Whatever      I may think of      the pursuits        of industry and scienoe,
 and   of the triumphs      and glories of art,        I  do not mention any one
 of these things as the great specific           for alleviating        the sorrows of

                             of Edinburgh,         Session     1875-76.                     41
 human life,           and meeting the evils which deface                  the world.            I
believe firmly in science and art, for their                       own purposes.         I be
lieve     in their reality, their              efficacy,     and their value   ;    I   believe
they      are efficacious and valuable                     for the purposes        for which
they are ordained, but not for purposes for which they were not
ordained.            If I      am      asked   what is the remedy for the deeper
sorrows of the human heart — what                          a man should chiefly look to
in his progress through life, with which to sustain him under trials
 nd affliction —         I must        point to something very different, to some
thing     which         in     a     well-known     hymn       is called   'the     old, old
story.'     It       is this    '
                                    old, old story,    told in a good old book, with
the teaching to be found there, which is the greatest and best gift
ever given to mankind, a gift carrying with it and imposing upon
all alike, the most solemn trusts and responsibility, because arousing
the fullest recollections of the past and the brightest hopes of the
future.        I venture        upon this observation for myself, lest, in speak
ing of the immense value which is to be attached to the subjects
with which we are dealing to-night, it should be supposed I was
setting them up as having some exclusive right to allegiance upon
your minds and               hearts,    or, at any rate, a     right paramount to       every
other."
   I   much fear that this warning of the ex-Premier                       is needed.        I
fear it may be said,                 not merely of men of science, but of others
also, that they often allow their hearts and minds to be so occupied
— so    engrossed        with pursuits and studies, as to leave no room for
other things which should find a place there also.
  Men of         science        have sometimes        been charged, not merely with
allowing       their minds to be too much engrossed                     in this    way, but
with conceit and arrogance, engendered by the                           consciousness       of
possessing wisdom above the great bulk of their countrymen.                               The
true    man of science, is fairly amenable to no such                         charge.       So
far from possessing that "pride, and arrogance, and froward mouth,"
which is condemned in the good old book referred to by Mr Glad
stone, he   and at all events should be, the reverse of all this
               is,                                               for                    ;
whatever        amount of knowledge he acquires, whatever the dis
coveries he achieves, no one sees so clearly the immensity of what
still remains to         be discovered.           Even in our own planet, how little
do we yet know of the composition                          of the earth's interior,      hoir
  vol.    n.                                                                       r

42                   Proceedings     of the Royal      Society
little of its    deep oceans, how     little of    ne great atmosphere         which
surrounds us!        And   even  if we knew and understood all and every
 part of our own habitation, what is that, when we think what a
tiny atom that habitation is in the great system of the universe,
seen and unseen        !
    The true man of science, knowing             all this,  is humble-minded,
not arrogant or supercilious;        diffident, not presumptuous;           forbear
ing, not intolerant.
    If  these    are   the qualities which men of science              possess    and
show,     whilst    prosecuting their      studies and researches,        they    will
secure favour for themselves and            for their noble pursuits.          They
will   be accepted     and respected   as  the expounders of the grand and
beautiful laws by which God governs the universe — laws, a know
ledge and a right application of which will assuredly conduce,
alike to the prosperity of nations and               to the    happiness of the
human      race.

                       of Edinburgh, Session 1875-76.                                      45
  The accompanying                maps, prepared       for my forthcoming volume,
(" Ultima Thule "), mark       the four paroxysmal eruptions which
took place upon the same area during 1867, 1869, 1870 (to 1872,
at which last date all activity had subsided), and about Christmas
1874. Number five, the latest phenomenon, broke out on March
29, 1875.
  These movements                may or may not be connected with the five
days' eruption of Skaptar Jiikull (January 9, 1873), recorded by
all the journals of Europe; but they certainly occupy the heart
and the southern outskirts of the OdaSa Hraun, the great lava field
subtending        the north of the Vatna              Jokull,   and extending        to the
N.N.E., almost             as    far as the      Lake Region — My-vatn             and     its
oasis.       The name           is variously translated "Terrible wilderness"
(Henderson),                    " Desert of the Evil Deed "
                     and                                       (Baring Gould),
whilst the      area       is differently    calculated at 1160 to 1500 square
miles; in      fact, one        half of   the Vatna        Jokull.   Viewed from the
nearest heights — Blafjall, for instance — it is a grim and ghastly
picture, a region of ruin and desolation, a fitting miae                        en scene   for
the Last Man           :   my companions remarked that such a spectacle
would soon give them the horrors.                      I   see no difficulty      beyond a
certain expense in crossing and exploring this waste                       :   at the same
time,    I   doubt that the feat would yield any results               ;       and explora
tion     purely      for exploring          appears    to me     like "climbing            for
climb."
  This " great and terrible wilderness," so small and mean in com
parison with the Sahras of Africa, Asia, and South America, and
yet so grisly in its brown-black                 desolation, is supposed         by Baring
 Gould to be the gift of the Triilladyngjur and of HerSubreiS, while
 Mr W. L. Watts would derive it solely from SkjaldbreiS. 1 find it
 to be the produce of a multitude of craters which opened in and
 south of      it,     the days when Oraefi and other lofty peaks,
                     before
 attracting rain and snow, built up the mighty neve, which mono
 polises the south-eastern corner of Iceland. The peculiarity of the
 latest outhreaks (1867-1875)    the distance, not to say isolation,
                                            is
 of the vents from any large body of water, suggesting the un
 pleasant fact that we must modify received opinion.  For instance,
 the eruption of Christmas 1874 upon the south-eastern flank of the
 distorted horseshoe             Askja (oval-shaped         wooden   casket) or Dyng

 jufjoll (Cubilia or "Chamber Hills"),                   are   at   least thirty-eight
 direct geographical miles from My-vatn (midge-water), and forty-
 five   from the      nearest     seashore.      Nos. 1,   2,  and   3 vents are    more
 distant    from    the    lake,    and    but little nearer the           coast      The
 non-maritime Andine volcanoes                are popularly supposed to be con
 nected by fissures and strata-faults             with the Pacific.          Here, how
 ever,   the   foci are separated         from the Atlantic eastward              by the
 valley of the broad and deep Jokulsa i Axarfir5i, the longest, if
 not the largest, river in Iceland.             To the west they are guarded by
 the Skjalfandi       Fljttt,   and south by the         huge    Vatnajokull, whilst
 palagonite is not       a   rock which maintains permanent fissures like
 porphyry.       I  can only suggest that              the    eternal snows       of   the
 mighty    nevé   take the place of lake and sea water.
     Our approach      to Iceland      was heralded by volcanic phenomena.
 On    Friday,    July    8, as my shipmates           were    recovering from the
sufferings which         began     in Pentland       Firth,    we found the        milky
 blue sea patched and streaked             with what many supposed to be rye
— the     cargo    of some       wrecked vessel     — but which         proved     to   be
pumice,     the largest piece hardly equalling a bean.                 On the return
voyage (August         9) we passed       through    a  similar discharge, and we
heard     of dense and choking             ash-showers.        Landing (July       10) at
Husavik, the old export harbour of the great Northern Brimstone
Mines, we found burned stone                 thrown     up in tons      on   the beach
north-east and south-west of the factory.                  A few of      the   bits were
equal to a man's fist        :  some were      slightly vitreous,     and others had
a  fibrous texture like asbestos        ;  they much resembled           those brought
from the     Askja    by   Mr W. L. Watts.           Lastly, when we approached
the focus of eruption we picked up common specimens                         of an inter
mediate size, where certainly none existed in 1872.                    Our maximum
distance then was 70 or 80 miles, and the line of our direction was
from south-west and west to north-east and east.                     As will presently
appear, a single morning (March              19) is supposed      to have discharged
3840 tons in four hours.            All authorities      are agreed that the ashes
fell   in  Norway       within     twenty-four      hours — a rapid but not an
unusual rate of progress.               In the Hekla eruption of              1693    the
scoriae were      also   carried by the winds in one day to the Foeroe
Islands; the       same     was    the case with        the Skaptar outhreak of
1783; and in 1845             the goodwives of        Shetland,      when bleaching

Hekla.       But instances of this nature        need not be multiplied.
    On    July    17, while collecting      specimens    of brimstone from the
great My-vatn mines, a select company of the expedition rode over
the    Namaskarfi         (" Fountain-scaur "), the        gap   in   the   Montes
Phlegroei, east of My-vatn, and thence we took the highroad, or
rather     the bridle-path,      leading eastwards      over the    My-vatnsoroefi
(Desert of the Midge-water) to the greatest of the three Jokulsars.
After some three hours of sharp canter, which covered more than
half-way,      we    sighted to the south of the road and north-east of
Biirfell,    a low black-blue mound with white patches.               It was  about
a   mile long and a solitary
                  ;                   puff, escaping every quarter of an hour,
told us that it was burning           low.    Nothing could      be  meaner    than
this outhreak, which I will call the My-vatn eruption : it looked
by the side of older formations as if Vulcan had struck work, and
 the underground furnace of Iceland were being " drawn."                    Shortly
 after    our departure, however,         Mr W. L. Watts        here    observed     a
 huge Gja, and an active eruption, which he briefly noticed in the
 "Times"        newspaper,     and which    I hope   he   will presently   describe
 at greater length, accompanying his description with               a  ground-plan
 and elevation.
      This No.      5 is connected      by  a band  of old lava with Nt,.       0,   a
 mound      to the north of the road.         It  was first seen (Feb. 18) from
 the GrimstSair farm, erupting to the west of the Sveinagja, in what
  is called    the  Austurfjoll    or  My-vatnsfjoll.      The great smoky fire
  (jaroeld)     springing    from 14 or 10 mound craters          (gosborg) lying
  on a meridian, formed,           say the natives, a molten river           300    to
   400 fathoms broad          and one    vegarleid (  =  3  English miles) long,
   throwing     up lava,    pumice (vikur) and stones, often the size of a
   man, which        fell down upon the crater lips.           Some of the hot
   material melted the snow.           The lava soon set, but the ground was
   too hot for walking, and the stone flood glowed white beneath               2 to 4
   feet of the upper black stratum which had cooled in a few minutes.
   The plain around         was split   with hideous Gjar (fissures); the fre
   quent hornitos, blisters, and hillocks            on the run       probably the
   effects  of  steam, were hollow, with a capacity of 2 to 4 hogsheads,
   and the smoke (vapour?) hung upoh the horizon like a cloud.                     On
   March 10 the eruption lasted all night, and the most violent effort

48                     Proceedings of                      the    Royal Society
was on      April    13.        By that time                the area of the foci (eldgigar)                    was
about       40 square fathoms;                     and where the ground before was level,
rose    a lava      hill   30 to 60 feet high.                      The greatest flow was to the
north, and southwards                    a   fire stream (eldgos), one mile long and 500
fathoms broad, was covered with high and rough blisters                                            ;   and was
overhung with whitey-blue fumes.                                  The view was confined by the
fine dust to 300 feet                :       during daylight it wore the semblance of a
mirage (Landjoldu or TiSbra), and at night it became a pillar of fire.
      Our disappointment was tempered                               by meeting          a    party of three
Icelanders         driving          two ponies, whose imitation                         Icelandic coffers
bespoke       the English owner.                          The head guide introduced himself

they reached           GrlmstaSir,                     whither     their    horses          had been          sent
round        via    the         Eastern                path.       This        is,   indeed,       a     unique

agreed       that No.          4    was       still active,         and     they placed the site on
the    south-eastern                bend          of the        Askja     or southern          Dyngjufjoll

dust showers prevented the Jokulsdaelingar               (people of Jokulsdal)
reading by day, and many of them left their farms and drove their
cattle to grass on the VopnafjortSr.           This outhreak is     supposed    to
have come not solely from the Dyngjufjoll,               which, since April 5,
emitted    only heavy smoke,         but from several other places         in the
northern,     the north-eastern, and the north-western             faces   of the
Vatnajokull.       In   addition to this movement, which may            be  called
the  " Dyngjufjoll       eruption,"    and which is frequently referred to
in the local and in our| home papers, Dr Jnlius places another
vent, hitherto unnumbered, about seven miles to the S.S.W.
of HeroubreiS, the " broad-shouldered " and perpendicular-sided
mountain of palagonite, which           I  had attempted to ascend in 1872.
I  am happy to say that        Mr W. L. Watts        also noted the projecting
buttress from the south-west, which, descried too late, appeared to
me the only place for successful climbing.              Here was the outhreak
of May 29, 1875,       and hence, according to my informant, the greater
part of the ashes      and pumice had been carried to the north-east.
On the other hand,         Mr W. L. Watts        saw no crater south-west of
HertSubrerS,    and would derive the pumice and ashes from Askja.
The Medico placed         a suplementary crater in the old lava-field on a
meridian between HerSubrei3arfell and the ReykjahlfS-Jokulsa road.
 Thus   we have five several vents: — A and B, north and south of the
 road (March 29); C, continuing           the line southwards;      D (May    29-),
 near HerfcubreiS    ;  and E, the Askja or      southern Dyngjufjoll
    On  July   29 the expedition received,       at Husavik, a visit from      Mr
 W. L. Watts, who        was fresh from the conquest       of the Vatnajokull,
 and he gave us the first intelligent account of the movement.                 He
 had found fresh ashes, but no pumice, on the snows of the Vatna
jokull, about the middle        or  in N. lat. 64° 25'.    Kistufell  was quiet;
 smoke or vapour issued          intermittently    from Kverkfjoll, which         I
 saw in 1872 vomiting a glacier, and about SkjaldbreiS              rose a large
 mound of old lava, but no new signs of action appeared.              He walked
 over layers of pumice, extending a score of miles, from the Svarta

about    a    quarter of           a   mile     in       circumference discharges volumes of

 stearu and fatty fetid loam, which          falls in granules.      At    the base
is  another pit-crater,     opening in high         and  broken ground;          it is
also covered with pumice and offensive loam, which                    the depths
continue to vomit.        The explorer distinctly       saw a pit of hot water
spouted from the         western   side   of the    inner triangle    :   he   could
trace,    through    the volumes of steam, its shaft or column, and
he heard the rain fall upon the rocks, bringing down with it an
avalanche     of stone.    The Askja is not a Jokull, and only a few
streaks of snow lay upon the flanks.                 This, therefore, may be
considered a crucial instance of water erupted from a fire vent.
    Meanwhile there are no reports of any outhreak at HerSubreiS,
nor in the Trolladyngur, the inadequate features from which
Baring Gould would derive           the Odaoa      Hrnun.    I  have taken the
liberty in my map of counter- marching the             "Troll's Bowers," from
a meridian to a diagonal, beginning south of Blafjall and abutting
almost upon HerSubreiS.         In local history     we read dreadful accounts
of Trolladyngjur's seven eruptions; of a.d. 1150 (the earliest);
of 1180; of 1340, when the "Broad-shouldered" is said to have
vomited for the first time      ; of   1359  ;  of 1475  ; of 1510 (when the
second outhreak of HerSubreiS is reported);               and, finally, of 1862,
when     there was an eruption of ashes, concerning which we have
few and uncertain details.         Thus the ratio of outhreaks          from    Trol-
ladyngjur     was 7 to 26 Heklas,        13 Katlas,     11  submarines, and         5
Oraefas.
    The local      papers,   especially    the    " NorSanfari   "
                                                                     of    Akreyri
 (February 19, March 3, April          9 and 17, and     May   13 and 19      ;   and
 the " Isafold," of March         27),   give ample accounts of the late
 movements.       The My-vatn eruptions have been visited by many
parties    of farmers, but only        one   has yet reached       the Oskjugja
 (Askja or Dyngjufjoll Gja). The relations are chiefly from the                   pen
 of Jon SigurSsson, of Gautland near My-vatn, Knight of                           the
 Dannebrog, and AlthingismaSur            (M.P.),    whom   some    Englishmen
 have lately confounded with another           "White John,"      the celebrated
 agitator who lives at Copenhagen.           Much of the matter           has been
 translated and published by our home press, but there are interest
ing details which      have not been noticed.         Generally   — allow    me to
remark — the accounts, though utterly unscientific,              bear an aspect
 of sobriety   and truthfulness    wholly wanting in the older Icelandic

52                    Proceedings of         the  Royal Society
descriptions recorded by Mackenzie and Henderson, and th.ey8b.ow
that the spirit         of enterprise has not wholly died out of Iceland.
It   must, however,        be borne in mind          that both features are mere
crevasses     opened by the tension            of gases, and that due allowance
must      be    made      for   "hills and hillocks," for "cliffs .and preci
pices."
     The " Isafold,"       a new    paper published twice or thrice a month by
Hra Bjorn Jonsson, and printed by Einar Thoroarson of Reykjavik,
gives (No. 2, of March 27) a letter from My-vatn, which well de
scribes the outhreak nearest             the lake.      It  owes its chief interest to
the fact that      it  is the only one which corroborates the testimony of
Mr      Watts,    in mentioning          torrents of hot water that cannot be
melted snow.              At    11   a.m.,    on    February       16,  an expedition
ascended       and    crossed     in half-ap-hour        the eastern      flank     of the
volcano, which           in that direction sends            out a long spit.         After
 mounting a low          hill with    a steep    cliff to the    south, the explorers
 reached a narrow crevasse            lying   on a parallel of latitude, and form
ing    a  " vinkil,"     apex, or angle to the south.             Here they found          a
deep flat recess about          half  a  (Danish) mile in diameter, surrounded
 by heights with perpendicular scaurs                 to the east and south ; west
 and north-west the land was lower and flatter.                     Snow covered        the
 whole country.           Hard by       to the south-east and on plain ground
 rose the crater which vomited the densest                   smoke,  but there was no
 new lava except upon the lips.             The stone-rain, and hot ground burn
 ing their      shoes,     prevented them approaching it nearer than 70
 fathoms, but they computed the diameter at 40 to 50 fathoms, and
 the cone sides were so steep that the breadth above and below was
 about the same.             The crater jetted in paroxysms.                  The thick
 smoke made        the ejected matter appear like torn fragments of coat
 lining —evidently melted              stone   or burnt mud, most         of which fell
 back into, or on the          edges    of the bowl.         The smaller rapilli were
  thrown to     a minimum height of 100 fathoms.                   No  fire appeared      in
  the crater.     Some 80 to 90 fathoms to the west was a                  cliff probably
  formed by the eruption           ; it  measured     a tenfold area (8000 to 9000
  square fathoms)-           The rocky edge, except to the north-west where
  it  was lowest, stood some          6  fathoms high.         Below and south of the
  cliff  rose   a second       and    a somewhat         smaller    crater.      It  jetted
  steadily, but not so high as the other                   :  discharging     a lava-rain

                      of Edinburgh,      Session 1875-76.                     53
to the south-west       ;  and a rivulet  of almost   transparent   water flowed
to the north-west,     where it formed a little basin under the rocks.
    The expedition did not attempt             the  cliff because   they had no
ropes, and both rocks and snow were cracked and crevassed.                      A
little   further      west rose the third crater, which vomited only
smoke.       Its Vinkil " or apex was a horseshoe, with the two
                   "
heels to the north and the toe facing                 south.
It   is perhaps a little higher than the level of                      s
the     My-vatnssveit       (the adjoining      midge-lake     *
country).       If   much more lava flow, it must be              ,
filled up,    and then the fiery torrent     will run   over
and along the cliff to the sandy waste on the left
 bank of the Jokulsa.          East of the new mountain and the recess was
 an old Hraun or lava stream, which seemed to have discharged east
 wards    ; the bed showed no signs of craters nor volcanic vents, but
 the snow will prevent           till next summer any examination of          the
 Steintegundir       (minerals).
     Ash showers have         been blown to the north-east of the Austur-
 fjoll and, falling       on the grass, which was bare of snow, they          will
 probably injure the pastures.            It is reported that stone-rain ex
 tended to Kelduhver east of the ReykjarheiSi.                About New Year's
 day, an earthquake opened              great crevasses    where    formerly the
  ground     was smooth.        These movements       were   numerous    near the
  volcano.       The expedition built a snow-house under the ravine-
  cliff, but the falling stones compelled them to abandon it.
      The "Noroanfari" of February 19, relates that during the winter
  of 1874-5, a strong earthquake, proceeding from the southern or outer
  Dyngjufjoll (hin fremri), shook the farms of ViSidal, GrimstaSir, and
  MoSrudal aFjollum, in the latter levelling some buildings. From No.
  13 of March 3, we learn that four men of My-vatn (My-vatningar)              set
  out on Feb. 15, directly southwards, and after walking                24 hours,
  hearing frightful subterranean thunders (dunur) like cataracts from
  a mountain, and smelling sulphur fumes (eldlykt), they reached the
  Askja, which       has been incorrectly laid down on the map.           The jets
  of stone and lava, thrown many feet high, prevented them approach
  ing nearer than         60 to 70 fathoms.        The vents consisted of      one
  large focus and of many small parasites, a single one discharging
  lava.     In early February        smoke appeared every day, and presently

  54                       Proceedings of         the   Royal Society
  came a slight earthquake.                   In April     9th,  Jakob Halfdanarson,          the
  farmer of GrimstaSir               on the My-vatn,         reports   his visit to the My-
  vatnsfjoll,         where, on March           10th,    the   eruption lasted all night;
 and next day the smoke,                     hanging for a full eiktarlengd              (three
  hours) upon           the horizon, was dispersed              by a storm.        He walked
  northwards over the lava hill (Hraunmalarkamb),                               and   saw     the
 molten stone in the crevasses as                  if  a fire had been      built with     wood
 and charcoal.             East of the Kamb (coombe),                he inspected two big
 crevasses         erupting large stones, which fell back into them.                        The
 lava had flowed for two days, and small fragments lay 300 fathoms
 distant from the fire stream                 : 160 fathoms to the west smaller bits
 were       found;      but the greatest         quantity was heaped up within               ten
 fathoms of the vent (eldsupptok).                      An anonymous account of the
 same eruption, supposed                  to be by old Peter Jousson of ReykjahliS,
 father-in-law          to  Jakob Halfdanarson, is given in the " NorSanfari"
 of April 17, 1875.               He reports that sundry Laxardalers rode some
 six hours from RcykjahlicS to explore the new volcano, via Hvann-
 fell, where they heard loud thunderings.                         A  storm     raging at the
 time in          the    north-west         made   them mistake the cause:                these
 rumblings became fiercer                 as they approached       the focus.      The earth-
fire springing out of three places in                   a  meridianal line, formed high
lava     1i  ills npon the level ground.               The greatest altitudes were to
 the north         :   50 to 80 fathoms west of the northernmost, upon a
 tract which had              sunk more         than three mannahaeSir            (stature of
                               "      "
 man), lay a great               gil      or crevasse.      About the three foci, which
owned          from 20 to 30 parasites,            the lava had run mostly             to    the
south-east, but now he saw it flowing from the southernmost to
the     S.S.W.            The     northern      was    an    elongated      rise, and from
its crater,          about   300 fathoms         in length,       hot lava jetted 200 to
300 feet aloft, and fell in small cold drops                         upon    a scanty      area
No    fire appeared          during       the day, only white mist (gufa), growing
whiter        as  it  rose in the     air; it   was so thick that         it towered many
fathoms high, and the direction was perpendicular, although a strong
wind was blowing.                  In    the darkness of the night            conflagrations
became visible.            No    ashes fell at My-vatn, though they were              thickly
spread         by a strong north            wind, and     were    strewed     together with
pumice over the eastern                 regions, especially at       Jokulsdal, Fljotsdal,
and Seyfiisfjbr'8.            In   the first-mentioned         place   candles   were   lit for

five,   in the second for three, and in the third for four hours.                                 The
layerof pumice         and ashes measured                    some     4J inches    deep      in the
Jokulsdal, and        1£ in the SeySisfjorS.                 This   was the sixth explosion
since the outhreak, and about every tenth or twelfth day the violence
increased.       The line extended through the OdaSahraun to                                 a   little
north of ReykjahliS-GrimstaSir road.
   About Easter-day a thick smoke was seen at MoSrudal a Fjollum ;
it rose south of HerSubreiS, and many erroneously thought that it
came from MoSruoalsland.     Others supposed it to rise from the
Dyngjufjoll, but it was certainly from Vatnajokull, or from the
Tungu (Doab or Mesopotamia), formed by the westermost forks of
the Jokulsa. The discharge of pumice (Danice " Pimpsteen ") was
so   abundant that for days the ferry boats could not cross the stream.
     The   " NorSanfari        "
                                       of May 13 contains an unsigned article,
bringing     up the account            of our My-vatn eruption to May                  5.        Loud
thunderings        with thick smoke were noticed on the                       last " Tuesday

four men took horse to visit the volcano.                           From Kollottafjall they
saw a fiery crevasse,              made      like    a   mountain " fjargya,"          or sheep
fissure where the animals take refuge during bad weather                                     ;    and
on the borders        of the Sveinagja,              where    a   fine grassy plain formerly
extended, they found             a     high hill of lava pierced with three                  craters
lying on     a     meridian.           These vents roared               loudly, and threw up
rocks, which returned to the earth after 45 seconds.                                The smaller
rapilli rising like        smoke disappeared                 in the air, and       presently fell
like snow.         From the largest focus, which lay south                          of the road,
a    fiery flood    ran westward         had been reported three (Danish)

during     the winter.       There was           a   great eruption close to the OdaSa
hraun on March 18 and 19, and the concussion of the air drove
the farm peeple         from their beds.                 On March 23 fire was reported
to have proceeded            from forty places                lying     close to the       Ilolsfjoll

                                                                          "
                                                                            of April
24, appeared       in the " Times " of July 1,       1875.       It is dated March
29, 1875,     and headed " Fall of Pumice             and Ashes in       Mulasyla."
The author,       I  may remark, has more than once visited the              Vatna-
jokull.      The following interesting details may be added to the
abstract :— During the Yule of 1873, and in early 1874, an earth
                "
quake      shook the eastern       regions, after which         the people of the
Fjoll country         saw   two tall pillars      of thick      smoke apparently
proceeding from the Askja or Dyngjufjoll                   ;    and    viewed from
HallormstaSarhals         they rose    at a considerable distance from each
other.      Early in   the year there was no fire in the My-vatnsoroefi, and
the earthquake became less violent towards the end of the                   winter."
    After noticing the thunderings            and the ash and       pumice rain of
 March 29 (Easter Monday) reported in the " Times," my reverend
 friend continues : — " The movement appears to have taken place
 in the southern part of the Dyngjufjoll, westward                   of HerSubreiS,
 and a short way north of the winter Gja.                  The direction of the
 ashes was on both sides          of a line to Modrudal          and Fossvellir, as
 far as the Unaos in HjaltarstaSarthinga                and    the   Vatnsdalsfjall.
 Another shower, travelling          from west to east, and extending           four
 (Danish) miles, fell       at Bru, and a mile and a         half   east  of ASalbol
 (Rrafnkelsdal),       Kleif (Fljotsdal), SkriSdal,      and as far as FaskruSs-
 fjoriS   to the south-east.       The amount which fell east of that line
 in BrerSdal and StoSvarfjorS was trifling.             If we     draw one straight
 line from the focus of the eruption eastward             between      FaskruSs and
 StoSvarfjorS, and a second from Vatnsdalsfjall               near NjarSvik, also
 to the east, the area upon which the ashes                   and    pumice rained
 would hardly         be less  than 100       square   miles.       Also assuming
 the average       depth of the layer at     3  inches, we must assign to the
 discharge of March 19 a weight of 3840 tons."
     " It is
             reported that the ash showers have ruined twenty farms in
 the    Jokulsdal     (between    the Lagarfljot and the eastern            Jokulsa)
 and in the northern Mula Sysla, where the owners are preparing to
  abandon their property.         The position of    the Fljotsdalsherad,      where
  the scoriaceous rains fell thickest, are the Jokulsdal, Fell, Fljostdal,
  Skogar, SkriSdal,       Vellir,   and  EySathingba.         Heavy and terrible
  showers     also   desolated    NorSfjorfi,    TieySarfjorS,      MyvafjorS,   and

                        of Edinburgh, Session 1875-76.                         57
LoBmundarfjortS.           Where the land has abundance of water,           as  in
parts of SkriSdal, Vellir, and Eyftathingha, the farmers hope that
the ashes will disappear during the spring, and that they will be
dissolved       by the rains."        This interesting letter concludes with
an exhortation         " not   to abandon    the holdings for good," and with
excellent advice about the measures to be taken. Yet it owns that
" from this fearful visitation all husbandry in the east country
must come to utter ruin," and the less Icelanders               are advised not
to emigrate the better for the island.
    The writer of "An Appeal for Iceland"                   ("Times,"    July    1,
1875), compares          this mild and harmless eruption, which has not
destroyed a single life, with the terrible convulsions of 1783, which
killed    some 14,000 human beings.             He  also calculates the destruc
tion of     pastures to the extent of 2500         to 3000 square miles, while
popular computations             make 4000    square miles the habitable area
of Iceland.
    According       to  Pall   Pals^on   only four farms on the west of the
Jokulsa       have    suffered   severely.    These are, going from south to
north, Bru, EyrikstaSir,            HakonarstaSir,    and  ArnérstaSir.    llerra
ThorSur Gudj6nsson, factor              at Husavik,    never even heard of the
eruption till       I  showed     him the nepawspers.       Finally, the brown
shadings in my chart, marking the eastern and north-eastern limits
of the     ash    showers,   and    copied from an Iceland      map   obligingly
 lent   to me by my friend,        Mr Robert Mackay Smith,      may be allowed
 to prove that the damage extends over a small area.
     Mr Jon A. Hjaltalin, of the Advocate's Library, Edinburgh,
 received      (June 26) trustworthy accounts of the ash and pumice
  rain.    "  It extended over several parts of NorSur Mulasysla and
 SuSur Mulasysla, depositing a layer about 1 J inches thick. In some
 places the winds have             carried it off, but sundry parishes will be
 unable to keep         their live stock at home this summer.           Next hot
  season, however, it is expected that the pastures will be all right."
     Mr W. L. Watt, who has just ridden over the ground, found the
  pumice and ashes beginning about the middle course of the Svarta
  (N. lat.   64° 50'), and extending northwards to HerSubreiS (65° 10'),
  or a total depth of 20 to 25 miles, bounded eastward by the
  Jokulsa, where the country is             not, and   never has been, habited
  by man.

  The following Communications             were read   : —
          1. Vortex Statics.     By Sir William Thomson.
                               (Abstract.)
  The subject of this    paper is steady motion of vortices.
   1. Extended   definition of "steady motion."      The motion of any
system of solid or fluid or solid and fluid matter is said to be steady
when its configuration remains equal and similar, and the velocities
of homologous particles equal, however the configuration may
move in space, and however distant individual material particles
may at one time be from the points homologous to their positions
at another time.
   2. Examples   of steady   and not steady motion :—
   (1.) A rigid body symmetrical round an axis, set to rotate round
any axis through its centre of gravity, and left free, performs
steady motion.     Not    so a body having     three unequal principal
moments of inertia.
   (2.) A rigid body of any shape, in an infinite homogeneous liquid,
rotating uniformly round any, always the same, fixed line, and
moving uniformly parallel to this line, is a case of steady motion.
   (3.) A perforated rigid body in    an infinite liquid moving in the
   VOL. IX.                                                    I

60                        Proceedings      of the Royal Society
manner of example (2.), and having cyclic irrotational                                    motion of
the liquid through               its perforations, is a case of steady motion.
To this        case belongs the irrotational           motion of liquid in the neigh
bourhood of any rotationally moving                      portion of fluid of the same
shape as the solid, provided the distribution                        of the rotational              mo
tion is such that the shape of the portion endowed with it remains
unchanged.               The object of the         present         paper is to investigate
general conditions for the fulfilment of this proviso                              ;   and to inves
tigate, farther, the conditions                of stability of distribution of vortex
motion satisfying the condition of steadiness.
     3.    General synthetical       condition     for   steadiness       of vortex motion. —
The change of the fluid's molecular rotation at any point fixed in
space must be the same               as   if    for the rotationally moving portion
of the fluid were substituted a solid, with the amount and direction
of axis of the fluid's actual molecular rotation inscribed or marked
at every point of       and the whole solid, carrying these inscrip
                             it,
tions with         it,   were compelled to move             in some manner answering
to the description of example (2).                     If    at any instant the distribu
tion of molecular rotation           *
                                          through        the fluid, and corresponding
distribution          of fluid velocity, are such           as to    fulfil this condition,          it
will      be   fulfilled through all time.
     4. General analytical          condition      for      steadiness        ofvortex motion. —
If, with              24, below)   vorticity     and     " impulse," given, the kinetic
               is
energy         a (§   maximum or     a    minimum,       it   is   obvious that the motion
is   not only          steady, but stable.             If, with       same         conditions,      the
energy
               is
               a       maximum-minimum,            the motion            is   clearly steady, but
it   may be either unstable or stable.
     5.    The simple circular Helmholtz ring                   is   a   case of stable steady
motion, with energy maximum-minimum                                 for given vorticity and
given impulse.             A   circular vortex ring, with an inner irrotational
annular core, surrounded by                a     rotationally        moving annular              shell
(or endless tube), with irrotational circulation outside all,   case                       is   a
of motion  which     steady,is   the outer and inner contours of the
                                          if
     Oue of the Helmholtz's now well-known fundamental theorems shows
     *
that,/rom (he molecular rotation at every point of an infinite fluid the velocity at
every point     determinate, being expressed synthetically by the same formula?

                          " magnetic resultant force" of a
                                                               pure electro-magnet.
— Thomson's Reprint of Papers on Electrostatics and Magnetism

                        of Edinburgh, Session 1875-70.                         ei
section      of the rotational shell       are properly shaped,    but certainly
unstable      if  the shell be too thin.       In this   case also the energy is
maximum-minimum for given vorticity                   and given impulse.
     6.  In these examples       of steady motion, the " resultant impulse"
(V. M.* § 8) is a simple          impulsive    force, without   couple;  the cor
responding rigid body of example 3 is a circular toroid, and its
motion is purely translational and parallel to the axis of the toroid.
     5.  We    have also exceedingly       interesting cases of steady motion
in which the impulse is such that, if applied to a rigid body, it
would be reducible, according to Poinsot's method, to an impulsive
force in a determinate line, and a couple with this line for axis.
To this category belong certain distributions of vorticity giving
longitudinal vibrations, with thickenings and thinnings of the core
travelling       as waves in one direction         or the other round a vortex
ring, which will        be investigated in a future communication          to the
Ro3-al Society.         In all such cases, the corresponding rigid body of
 §  2   example (2)     has  both rotational and translational motion.
     7.  To find illustrations,    suppose, first, the vorticity (defined below,
 § 24) and the force resultant of the impulse to be (according to the
 conditions explained below, § 29) such that the cross section is
 small in comparison with the aperture.                  Take a ring of flexible
 wire (a piece of very stout lead wire with its ends soldered together
 answers well), bend it into an oval form,
 and then give it a right-handed              twist
 round the long axis of the oval, so that
 the curve comes to be not in one plane
 (fig.    1).     A properly-shaped        twisted
  ellipse of this kind [a        shape   perfectly
 determinate        when     the   vorticity,    the
  force resultant of the impulse, and the rotational              moment of the
 impulse (V. M. § 6), are all given] is the figure of the core in what
  we may call the first       f  steady mode of single and simple toroidal

 Royal Society of Edinburgh," will be thus referred to henceforth.

 undulatory motion in an endless uniform canal, or in an endless chain of
 mutually repulsive links.

vortex motion with rotational              moment.       To illustrate the second
steady mode, commence with a circular ring of flexible wire, and
pull it out at three points, 120° from one another, so as to make it
into as it were an equilateral triangle with rounded corners.                      Give
now    a  right-handed       twist, round the radius to each corner, to the
plane of the curve at and near the corner                 ;  and, keeping the cha
racter of the twist thus given to the wire, bend it into a certain
determinate shape proper for the data of the vortex motion.                         This
is the shape of the vortex core in the second steady mode of single
and simple toroidal vortex             motion with rotational          moment.       The
third is     to be     similarly arrived      at,  by twisting       the corners of      a
square having rounded corners;               the fourth, by twisting the corners
of a regular pentagon having rounded corners                  ;  the fifth, by twisting
the corners of a hexagon, and so on.
    In   each of the annexed diagrams of toroidal                  helixes a circle is
introduced        to   guide the judgment          as   to the      relief   above    and
 depression      below     the   plane of the diagram which the curve repre
sented in each case must be imagined                   to have.       The circle may
be imagined          in each case to     be the   circular axis of a toroidal core
 on which the        helix may     be supposed     to be wound.
    To avoid circumlocution, I have                  said,    "give    a  right-handed
        "
twist       in each case.        The result in      each    case, as in fig. 1,    illus
trates a vortex           motion    for which     the corresponding          rigid body
 describes     left-handed helixes, by all its particles, round the central
 axis of the motion.            If now,   instead of right- handed twists to the
 plane of the oval, or the corners of the triangle, square, pentagon,
 &c., we give        left-handed      twists, as in figs.       2, 3, 4, the result    in
 each    case    will   be a vortex motion         for which the corresponding
 rigid body describes         right-handed      helixes.      It  depends,    of course,
on the relation         between     the directions of the force resultant             and
 couple resultant of the impulse, with no ambiguity in any case,
 whether the twists in the forms, and in the lines of motion of the
 corresponding rigid body, will            be  right-handed or left-handed.
    8.   In  each    of  these modes of motion the energy is a maximum-
 minimum forgiven force resultant and given couple resultant                            of
 impulse.       The     modes successively described above               are successive
solutions of the maximum-minimum                   problem of      § 4;   a determinate
 problem with the multiple             solutions indicated above, but no other

solution,    when the vorticity is given in a single simple ring of the
liquid.
    9.  The problem of steady motion, for the case of a vortex line
with    infinitely thin      core, bears  a close analogy      to the  following
purely geometrical problem —          :
    Find the curve whose length shall             be a minimum       with given
resultant projectional          area, and given resultant areal moment (§ 27
 below).      This would be identical with the vortex problem if the
 energy of an infinitely thin vortex ring of given volume and given
 cyclic constant were a function simply of its apertural circum
 ference.      The geometrical problem clearly has multiple solutions
 answering precisely to the solutions of the vortex problem.
     10.   The very high          modes  of solution   are clearly   very nearly
 identical     for the two problems (infinitely high modes             identical),
  and are found thus       : —
      Take the solution derived in the manner explained above, from
  a  regular polygon of        N  sides, when  N  is a very great number.        It
  is obvious that either problem          must lead to a form of curve like
  that   of a long regular spiral spring      of the ordinary kind bent round
  till its two ends     meet, and then having        its ends properly cut and
  joined so as to give a continuous           endless helix with axis a circle
  (instead of the ordinary straight line-axis), and               N turns of the
  spiral round its circular axis.         This curve    I  call  a toroidal helix,
  because    it lies on a toroid * just     as the common regular        helix lies
     * I call a circular toroid a simple ring generated by the revolution of any
  singly-circumferential      closed plane curve round any axis in its plane not
  cutting it. A " tore," following French usage, is a ring generated by the
  revolution of a circle round any line in its plane not cutting it. Any simple

number      of turns round the toroidal core. The two threads, each
endless,    will be two helically tortuous rings linked together, and
will constitute the     core of what      will now    be a double vortex       ring.
The formulae just now obtained for a single thread would be appli
cable to each thread,     if k denoted     the cyclic constant for the circuit
round the two threads, or twice the cyclic constant for either, and
N the number of turns of either alone round the toroidal core.
But it is more convenient to take N for the number of turns of
both threads (so that the number of turns of one thread alone is
iN), and k the cyclic constant for either thread alone, and thus for
very high steady modes of the double vortex ring

     Lower and lower steady modes will correspond to smaller and
 smaller values of N, but in this case, as in the case of the single
 vortex core, the form will be a curve of some ultratranscendent
 character, except for very great values of N, or for values of                6  in
 finitely nearly equal to a right angle (this latter limitation leading
 to the case of infinitely small transverse vibrations).
     12. The gravest steady mode of the double vortex ring corre
 sponds to     N  = 2.   This with     the single vortex core gives the case
 of the twisted ellipse     (§ 7).    With the double        core it gives    a sys
 tem      which  is most easily understood by
 taking two plane circular rings of stiff
  metal linked together.        First, place them
  as nearly coincident     as their being linked
  together permits (fig. 5).        Then      separate
  them a little, and incline        their     planes a
  little,  as shown    in the diagram.           Then               Fig. 5.

  case.

  this :—

     Let    thread make one turn and a half, or any odd num
            each
ber of half turns, round the toroidal core : thus each thread will
have an end coincident with an end of the other.        Let these
coincident          ends   be united.      Thus there will                 be but one endless
thread making an odd number N of turns round the toroidal core.
The cases of N = 3 and N = 9 are represented in the annexed
diagrams (fig. 9).*
   Imagine now a three-threaded toroidal helix, and let N denote
the whole number of turns round the toroidal core, we have

vanic circuit, or galvanic circuits, of the same shape as the core or
cores.     The setting forth of this analogy          to people      familiar, as
modern naturalists are, with the distribution          of magnetic force in
the neighbourhood        of  an electric circuit, does much to promote a
clear understanding         of the still somewhat strange fluid motions
with   which we are at present occupied.
    15. To understand the motion of the liquid in the rotational
core  itself, take  a piece of Indian-rubber    gas-pipe stiffened internally
with wire in the usual manner, and with it construct any of the
forms    with which     we have    been   occupied, for instance the sym
metrical trefoil knot (fig. 8, § 13), unit
ing the two ends of the tube carefully
by   tying them firmly by an inch or two
of straight cylindrical plug, then turn
the     tube   round    and round, round      its
sinuous axis.       The rotational motion of
 the fluid vortex core is thus represented.
 But   it  must be remembered, that the
 outer form of the core has a motion per-
                                                   Fig  9   ..Nine.lcaved Knot."
 pendicular to the plane of       the diagram,
 and a rotation round an axis through           the centre of the diagram,
 and perpendicular to the plane in each of the cases represented by
 the preceding diagrams.         The whole motion of the fluid, rotational
 and irrotational,    is so related in its different parts to one another,
 and to the translational and rotational motion of the shape of the
  core, as to be everywhere slipless.
     16.  Look to the preceding diagrams, and, thinking of what they
  represent, it is easy to see that there must be a determinate parti
  cular shape for each of them which will give steady motion, and                I
  think   we may confidently judge       that the motion is stable in each,
  provided only the core is sufficiently        thin.     It  is more easy to
  judge of the     cases   in which    there are multiple      sinuosities by    a
  synthetic   view of them (§ 3) than by consideration of the maxi-
  mam-minimum problem of § 8.
     17.  It  seems    probable   that   the two- or      three- or multiple-
  threaded toroidal      helix motions cannot     be stable, or even steady,
  unless   I, /i, and   N   are such as to make       the shortest distances
  between different positions of the core or cores considerable in

simplest case (§ 12, fig. 5) of two simple rings linked together.
   18 Go hack now to the simple circular Helmholtz ring.         It is
clear that there must be a shape of absolute maximum energy for
given vorticity and given impulse,                         if   we introduce     the restriction
that the           figure is to     be   a figure          of revolution,       that is to say,
symmetrical round a straight axis.                          If   the given vorticity be given
in this determinate shape the motion will be steady, and there is
no other figure of revolution for which                          it would   be steady            (it being
understood that the impulse has                       a    single force resultant                 without
couple).           If the   given impulse, divided by the cyclic constant, be
very great in comparison with the two-thirds power of the volume
of liquid in which the vorticity is given, the figure of steadiness is an
exceedingly thin circular ring of large aperture and of approximately
circular cross section.             This     is the case to which chiefly attention                     is
directed by Helmholtz.                If,   on the other hand, the impulse divided
by the cyclic constant be very small compared with the two-thirds
power of the volume, the figure becomes                               like a long oval, bored
through along its axis of revolution and with the ends of the bore
rounded off for trumpeted) symmetrically, so as to give a figure
something like the handle of a child's skipping-rope, but sym
metrical       on     the two sides            of     the        plane   through           its    middle
perpendicular            to its length.          It       is certain     that, however small
the impulse,             with    given      vorticity       the    figure of steadiness thus
indicated is possible,              however long in the direction                      of the axis
and small in diameter perpendicular                             to the axis and in aperture
it may       be.     I   cannot, however,             say at present that             it is certain
that this possible steady                   motion is stable,            for there are figures
not of revolution,              deviating      infinitely little from                it,    in     which,
with the same vorticity, there                  is    the same impulse and the same
energy, and consideration of the general character of the motion
is   not reassuring on the point of stability when rigorous demon
stration     is    wanting.
     19.    Hitherto     I   have not indeed           succeeded         in rigorously demon
strating the stability             of the Helmholtz ring in any case.                               With
given vorticity, imagine the ring to be thicker                           in one place than in
another.       Imagine          the given vorticity,             instead of being distributed
in   a     symmetrical          circular ring, to be distributed                in   a      ring still,

with a circular axis, but thinner in one part than in the rest.                                         It
is clear that with the same vorticity, and the same impulse, the
energy  with  such a distribution is greater that when the ring is
symmetrical. But, now let the figure of the cross section of the
ring, instead of being approximately circular, be made considerably
oval.       This will diminish the energy with the         same vorticity and
the same impulse.                Thus, from the figure of steadiness we may
pass    continuously to others with                  same vorticity,        same impulse, and
same       energy.        Thus,       we see that the figure             of    steadiness         is,   as
stated       above,   a    figure of maximum-minimum,                        and not of abso
lute maximum, nor of absolute minimum                               energy.           Hence,      from
the        maximum-minimum                   problem      we     cannot       derive        proof       of
stability.
   20. The known phenomena of                            steam     rings and smoke                rings
show us enough of, as                 it   were, the natural           history of the subject
to convince          us    beforehand          that the steady configuration,                     with
ordinary proportions of diameters of core                          to diameter         of aperture,
is    stable, and considerations                   connected with           what      is   rigorously

in     a    later   communication             to    the Royal       Society) may lead              to   a
rigorous       demonstration              of stability for     a   simple Helmholtz ring
if   of thin enough         core in proportion            to diameter of aperture.                  But
at present neither natural history nor mathematics gives us perfect
assurance of stability when the cross section                               is   considerable in
proportion to the area of aperture.
     21.   I   conclude with a brief statement of general propositions,
definitions,        and principles used in the preceding abstract, of which
some appeared in my series of papers on vortex                                        motion      com
municated to the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1867-68 and 69,
and published             in the Transactions for              1869.        The rest will form
part of the subject of                a   continuation     of that paper, which             I     hope
to     communicate          to    the Royal           Society      before     the end          of the
present session.
     Any portion of a liquid having vortex motion                                is   called vortex
core, or, for brevity, simply
                              " core." Any finite portion of liquid
which       all vortex core, and has contiguous with
             is                                           over its                     it
whole boundary irrotationally                   moving liquid,         is   called a vortex.            A
vortex thus defined              is   essentially    a   ring of matter.              That   it   must

70                   Proceedings of the Royal Society
be so was      first discovered and          published    by Helmboltz.       Some
times the word vortex is extended to include irrotationally                  moving
liquid circulating round          or moving in the neighbourhood          of vortex
core   ;  but as different portions           of liquid   may successively come
into the neighbourhood              of the core, and pass away again,          while
the core always remains essentially of the same substance,                     it is
more      proper to limit the substantive term a vortex                  as  in the
definition    I  have given.
     22. Definition     I. — The     circulation    of  a vortex is the circulation
[V.M.     § 60 (a)] in any endless         circuit  once round its core.      What
 ever varied configurations a vortex may take, whether on account
 of its own unsteadiness (§ 1 above), or on account of disturbances
 by other vortices, or by solids immersed in the liquid, or by the
 solid boundary of the liquid (if the liquid is not infinite), its
 " circulation " remains unchanged
                                                  [V. M. § 59, Prop. (1)]. The
 circulation of a vortex is sometimes called its cyclic constant.
     Definition II.
                      — An axial line through a fluid moving rotation-
 ally, is a line (straight or curved) whose direction at every point
 coincides with the axis of molecular rotation through that point
 [V. M. § 59 (2)].
     Every axial line in        a vortex    is essentially a closed curve, being
 of course wholly without           a vortex.
     23. Definition     III. — A closed       section of a vortex is any section
 of its core cutting        normally the axial line through every point of
 it.     Divide any     closed section of a vortex into smaller areas          ;  the
 axial lines      through      the borders of these         areas  form    what   are
 called     vortex    tubes.       I  shall    call  (after Helmholtz)      a vortex
  filament any portion          of   a vortex     bounded   by a vortex tube (not
 necessarily infinitesimal).             Of course, a complete vortex may be
 called therefore a vortex filament             ;  but it is generally convenient
  to apply this term         only to    a part of a vortex as just now defined.
  The boundary of          a  complete vortex satisfies the definition           of a
 vortex tube.
      A complete vortex tube is essentially endless.                   In   a vortex
  filament infinitely small in all diameters of cross sections                " rota

tion " varies [V. M. § 60 (e)] from point to point of the length
of the filament, and from time to time inversely as the area
of the cross section. The product of the area of the cross section
into the rotation is equal to the circulation or cyclic constant of
the filament.
     24. Vorticity will be used to designate in a general way the
distribution of molecular rotation in the matter of a vortex. Thus,
if we imagine a vortex divided into a number of infinitely thin
 vortex filaments, the vorticity will         be completely given when the
 volume of    each filament     and   its circulation, or cyclic constant, are
 given ; but the shapes and positions of the filaments must also be
 given in order that, not only the vorticity, but its distribution, can
 be regarded as given.
     25. The vortex density at any point of a vortex is the circula
 tion of an infinitesimal filament through this point divided by the
 volume of the complete filament.                The vortex density remains
 always unchanged for the same portion of fluid. By definition it
  is the same all along any one vortex filament.
     26. Divide a vortex into infinitesimal         filaments inversely as their
  densities so that their circulations        are equal     ; and let the circula
  tion of  each be —     of unity.    Take     the projection of all the fila
  ments on one plane.       —  of the  sum    of the   areas of these projections
                            n
  is  (V. M. §§  6, 62) equal to the component            impulse of the vortex
   perpendicular to that plane.        Take the projections of the filaments
   on three planes at    right angles    to one another, and find the centre
   of gravity of the   areas of these three sets          of projections.      Find,
   according   to Poinsot's     method,      the   resultant      axis, force,   and
   couple of the three forces equal respectively to — of the sums                  of

   perpendicular to the three planes.         This will    be the resultant axis    ;
   the force resultant of the impulse, and the couple resultant of the
  vortex.
      The last of  these, that is to say, the couple           is also called the
  rotational moment of the vortex (V. M. § 6).

    27. Definition       IV. — The    moment of     a plane area round any         axis
 is the product of the area multiplied into the distance from                     that
 axis of      the perpendicular         to  its  plane     through    its   centre   of
 gravity.
    Definition V.
                      — The area of the projection of a closed curve on
 the plane for which the area of projection is a maximum will be
 called the area of the curve, or simply the area of the curve.                   The
 area of the projection on         any plane perpendicular to the plane of
 the resultant area is of course zero.
                       —
    Definition VI. The resultant axis of a closed curve is a line
through the centre of gravity, and perpendicular to the plane of
 its resultant area.         The resultant areal moment of a closed curve
is the moment round the             resultant    axis of the areas        of its pro
jections on two planes at right            angles to one another, and         parallel
 to this axis.       It   is understood,    of  course,    that the areas      of the
 projections     on    these two planes are          not evanescent generally,
except for the case of a plane curve, and that their zero values are
generally the sums of equal positive and negative portions.                      Thus
their moments are not in general zero.
    Thus, according to these definitions, the resultant impulse of a
vortex     filament       of infinitely small      cross    section    and    of unit
circulation      is equal to       the    resultant   area    of its curve.       The
resultant axis of        a  vortex is the same as the resultant          axis of the
curve,    and the rotational       moment is equal to the resultant              areal
moment of the curve.
    28. Consider        for   a  moment a vortex         filament    in an infinite
liquid with no disturbing           influence of other vortices, or of solids,
immersed in the liquid.            We now       see from the constancy         of the
impulse (proved generally in V. M.               § 19)  that the resultant       area,
and the resultant             areal moment of the curve             formed by the
filament,      remain constant, however           its curve may become            con
torted  ;  and     its resultant axis remains the same line                 in  space.
Hence, whatever motions and contortions the vortex filament may
experience,      if it  has any motion      of translation through         space this
motion must be on the average along the resultant axis.

                      of Edinburgh,       Sessio?i 1875-76.                      73
    29. Consider      now the actual        vortex    made   up of an infinite
number of infinitely small vortex filaments. If these be of
volumes inversely proportional to their vortex densities (§ 25), so
that their circulations are equal, we now see from the constancy
of the impulse that the sum of the resultant                  areas   of all the
vortex filaments remains constant ; and so does               the   sum    of their
rotational moments:           and    the resultant    areal  axis of them all
regarded      as one system is a fixed line       in space.     Hence, as in the
case    of a vortex filament, the translation,         if any, through space is
on the average along its resultant axis.              All this, of course, is on
the supposition         that   there   is  no   other   vortex,   and    no    solid
immersed       in the liquid, and no bounding surface of the liquid near
enough      to produce any sensible influence on the given vortex.
 2. Experiments illustrating Rigidity produced by Centrifugal
                        Force.      By John Aitken, Esq.
     If an  endless   chain is hung over a pulley and the pulley driven
 at a great velocity, it is well known that the motion so communi
 cated to the chain has almost no tendency to change the form of
 the curve in which the chain hangs, and that the principal                  effect
 of the motion is        to confer on     the chain     a  quasi-rigidity    which
 enables   it  to resist any force tending to alter its curvature.
     This is only true in     a general sense, and possibly may be true of
 some ideal form of chain         ;  but in all chains we can experiment on
 there are forces in action in the moving chain which tend to cause
 the chain to depart from the form which it has while at rest.
     I shall  refer to these disturbing forces later on.         As  the disturb
 ing forces in    most chains are very small,         we shall    neglect them,
 and for the present suppose the centrifugal force just balances the
 tension at all points.        The following experiments          were    made    to
 illustrate the balance of these forces,        to show that into whatever
 curves we may bend the chain when in motion, the centrifugal force
 has no tendency to alter these curves: that all forms are forms of
 stability,   as far as the centrifugal     force is concerned.
     The first experiments       were to show the effect     of destroying      the
 balance between       the tension and the centrifugal         force.    In   these
 experiments      the links on the descending side of the loop were

 74                 Proceedings         of the Royal Society
allowed to fall on       a  platform, so that part of the chain lay loose on
the platform, thus destroyed the tension produced by the centrifugal
force at the lower part of the chain.             The chain     was made to       take
the same       velocity as the driving pulley,           by being pressed         into
contact with it by means of an elastic wheel.
    I. When the chain          was pressed at the point where          it leaves   the
pulley there was no alteration            in the path of the chain,           because
the chain after      it leaves the pulley is moving in a straight line,            and
as there is no deviating            force, there is no centrifugal         force,  and
therefore, removing the tension in the ohain has no effect on the
direction of the motion of the links.
    II.   When    the ohain was pressed         at a point a     little higher      up
the pulley, then the centrifugal             force of the curved part of the
chain resting on the pulley            at the descending side, being            unba
lanced by the tension, rises from the pulley, and is shot in a direc
tion away to one side of the pulley.              Of  course the curved part         of
the chain on the other side of the pulley has also a tendency                        to
rise, but is kept in its place         by the    tension produced by putting
the chain in motion after being stopped by the platform.
    III.   When the chain is pressed            on the ascending side          of the
pulley, then the chain rises up off the pulley and forms itself into
a  somewhat irregular curve resting on the platform, and touching
the pulley at only one point.             When the velocity        is   sufficient  to
raise   it to a certain     height, the     conditions    become      altered.    The
chain in rising takes up all the slack chain lying on the platform,
and a tension is produced in the chain by the centrifugal force, and
unless we keep         increasing the speed of the chain, it can no longer
keep     in its elevated     position, because the centrifugal force is now
balanced by the          tension, and as the force of gravitation              is now
unbalanced, it gradually            flattens the curve     till the chain again
comes to rest      on the top of the pulley and          spreads    itself out in   an
irregular curve on the platform.
    IV. At    the beginning of the previous experiment the centrifugal
force being unbalanced by the tension,              it  overcomes       the force of
gravitation and causes the chain to rise into the air.                  After all the
slack chain has been taken up, and a tension is produced in the chain
by the centrifugal        force, then the centrifugal       force is balanced by
the tension and is no longer capable of opposing gravitation, and

                     of Edinburgh,      Session 1875-76.                        75
the chain begins to fall; but at this point its fall may be stopped,
or the chain may be made to rise again by destroying the tension
at the lower part of the chain.           If we   cause   the  chain, instead of
meeting the platform at an acute angle, to strike it as near as pos
sible at right angles, then the motion of the chain where it strikes
the platform is partly destroyed, and the chain again rises and may
be   kept balanced for     a long time resting on the platform, and only
touching the driving wheel at one point.             The reason for this being,
that if we partially stop the motion of            the  links by causing them
to strike the platform, or       if we alter the direction of their motion
by causing them to strike the platform, then there will be less
tension in the lower part of the chain than in the upper, as the
tension in the lower part will be only that due to partially changing
the direction of the motion of the links. The centrifugal force of the
upper part of the chain will be therefore unbalanced, and will cause
the chain to rise and keep its elevated position against the force of
gravitation. If a quick upward motion is given to the platform,
 the chain may be thrown up in the air, and again dropped on the
 platform like a solid body.
     The next experiments are to show that centrifugal                 force  may
 produce sufficient rigidity to cause a chain to run along             a platform
 like   a wheel.     A  short endless chain was put over a pulley            which
 was driven at a great velocity;         the chain was then dropped on the
 platform, along which it ran for some distance.              It is not necessary
  that the chains form circular loops to do this. The loop may be
  tall and narrow, and will, while running along, keep the longer
  axis of the curve in its original upright position.              Nor   need   the
  chain be heavy.       A watch-guard     was hung over a pulley about eight
  inches diameter;      it then formed      a loop about eight      inches broad
  by about two feet high.           When thrown off the pulley it glided
  along    the   platform    for some distance.          The chains were also
  dropped on an inclined        polished surface, on which they remained
  standing    in rapid motion for some time.
     All  these experiments      only illustrate the balance of the centri
  fugal force, and the tension when the motion is all in one plane.
  The next experiment is to illustrate this balance when the motion
  takes place in different planes.        This  is easily illustrated by means
  of  a circular disc   of paper, or any other flexible material.            If  we
     VOL.  III.                                                           L

7(3               Proceedings of the Royal Society
bend the disc while it is rotating, we find that the bent part                       does
not rotate with the disc, and that the disc only slowly regains                its
original flat form.        If   we load      the outside of the disc with a row
of flattened pellets of shot, we              increase the resistance or rigidity
of the disc while in motion, and if the weight is such that it just
balances the elasticity of the paper, then the bend will remain in
the same place     for     a    very long time while             the disc is     rotating
rapidly.    The disc may even be bent                till   the circumference    touches
the centre, and while the bend keeps its place the chain of shot                          is
passing through       many planes, and                the tension at the different
points just balances the centrifugal force.
      Before proceeding to experiment                 with the horizontal        chain,   I
must refer to the disturbing               forces in action causing the chain             to
change its form while in motion.                    When looking      at these     endless
chains in motion, the most marked effect of this motion is to cause
a curious reverse curve         just after the chain          has turned at the lowest
point of its path and has begun to ascend.                     This   reverse curve was
supposed to be produced by friction from the great tension produced
by the centrifugal         force;         but that it is not really
                                                           easily         so, is
proved by taking two precisely similar chains and oiling one and
passing the other through a flame to remove all grease. The only
difference between the two chains now is that the friction in the one
is greater than in the other.               If we   hang these two chains over two
pulleys of the same diameter on the same shaft so as to drive both
chains at the same velocity, we find that the oiled chain has the
reverse curve well        marked, while the friction              in the other chain
causes the loop to open out and take up a curve approaching a                       circle
and shows no reverse curve, and when both chains are compelled to
have the same curvature at bottom, the reverse curve is much                           the
least where the friction is greatest.                The reverse curve seems to be
due     to the change of motion which takes place in the                    links when
moving in a path of varying                 curvature.       For instance, when the
links   are descending along the flat part              of the curve, their motion is
almost simply one of translation, whereas when passing round the
curves they have      a   motion of rotation as well as a motion of transla
tion, the result of which           is,   that the links resist this rotation at the
entrance of the curve, and thus flatten out the curve on that side,
and after the rotation has been communicated to them, they tend to

                   of Edinburgh,     Session 1875-76.                      77
keep   this rotation, and thus continue the curve at the lower end
of the chain much farther round than if the chain was not in
motion.    And, for very evident reasons, the quickest part of the curve
is not at the bottom, but a short distance up the ascending side; and
farther, the rotation of the link at the bottom is quicker than that
corresponding to the curvature.       These points may all be illustrated
by a chain in which the links        are short and the chain as thick as
possible, so that the moment of inertia of the links round an axis
perpendicular    to the plane  of the motion   of  the links  is as great as
possible.    Such a chain when properly made gives         a series  of large
and well-marked      waves all the way up the one side      of the  loop and
down the other.      The length of the links    also tends to change the
form of the curve.      If we have    two chains of the same         material
and same size every way, except in the length of the link, then the
larger the link the more the chain tends to open out the curves
and take the circular form, and the smaller the links the nearer
it approaches the form it has while at rest, and the more marked
the reverse curve becomes.
    An elastic band in rapid motion will also tend           to  take up a
 circular form,  because the strain    at the quick part of the curves
 will tend  to open them out, in the     same manner as when the band
 was at rest.    An elastic chain while in motion      does not show the
 reverse curve like a chain, probably because           the strain    on  the
 material prevents it doing so.
    In  the previous experiments gravitation acted on the chains, so
 that whatever form we might impress on them, gravitation                con
 stantly tended to change that form and bring it back nearly to the
 form it would have if gravitation alone acted on it. An attempt
 was therefore made to get quit of the disturbing effect of gravita
 tion. Different ways were tried of effecting this, but none of
 them were thoroughly successful.        The next experiment shows the
 most successful method tried, namely, suspension. The chain is
 hung by means of a number of fine cords to a circular disc, capable
 of rotating about a vertical axis placed as far above the chain as
 possible.   The chain is driven by means of a rapidly revolving
 horizontal pulley running on a vertical axis, and to give sufficient
 friction the chain is pressed to the pulley by means of an elastic
  wheel.   The centre of suspension is so arranged that it can be

retains for        a   considerable time whatever form we please to give                              it.
It   may be moulded into                   a   most complicated series of curves, and
though        it   resists any effort made                 to     alter these       curves,    it    has
itself but little tendency to do so.                      If   we observe the chain           closely,
we   will however find that the disturbing                               forces,    which    I      have
already referred to, are acting                    on the chain, tending                to change    its
curvature.  For instance,   we keep the point of suspension over
                                            if
the centre of gravity of the chain, we will find after some time
that the chain will take up circular form. Thisa    caused by the                  is
friction in the chain, and other causes.  Again, the effect of the
varying rate of rotation of the link on its own axis     also well                      is
marked, but            is   quite different from what we get when the chain is
hung over the driving pulley.                       When the chain            is    hung over the
pulley, there           is   a   tension due to the weight of the chain.                            This
tension gives rise to the wave form which certain chains take up
when in motion.                   The tension      due to the centrifugal               force has no
such effect.            When, therefore, the chain                 is   suspended       and   gravita
tion removed, there                 is   no tension preventing            the chain from con
tinuing       to curve always in the same                       direction;     and      if   we use   a
chain specially              prepared to show              this    effect,   such       as    the    one
already referred to, the chain goes on bending further and further
round     till     it   comes           against the part of the chain coming in the
opposite       direction           and stops the motion, even though the chain
at that point            is      also    bending out of the way on account of the
resistance offered by the links to rotation on their axis.

     Sir WILLIAM            THOMSON, President, in the Chair.
   The following        Communications          were read   : —
1. On the Electrical Conductivity of Stretched Silver Wires.
    By J.     G.   MacGregor,        M.A., B.Sc.       Communicated         by
    Professor Tait.
    The apparatus which       I used in a few experiments on silver wires
was as follows :— To a        beam,    supported in stonework,      a  plate of
copper    was fastened,   upon which      a smaller  plate could be tightly
screwed.     Between the two plates a very thick copper wire was
secured, vertically.      Its lower   end was provided with a small plate
 of  copper, fastened   by screws.      This plate  served to make fast one
 end of the silver wire under investigation.             The other end     was
joined in the same way to a second thick copper wire; this                 was
 provided with a horizontal round brass plate, through the centre of
 which it   passed, and    which acted as weight-carrier.        A length of
 about 8 mm. at the end of the part of the copper wire which projected
 below    the weight-carrier     was amalgamated,       and,   while hanging
 quite free, dipped into a glass cup containing          mercury, which, by
 means of a long screw, could be elevated or depressed by any desired
 amount.     When measurements of resistance were made it was
 always placed in such a position that the amalgamated part of the
 copper wire was just beneath the surface of the mercury.                  The
 glass cup served      also to support       the weight-carrier    during the
 adjustment     of the weights, that the silver wires might be sub
 jected to no jerks.      After putting on weights the cup was lowered
 very slowly and steadily until the weights hung free.                A copper
 wire (4 7 mm. thick       and   30  cm.   long), dipping in the mercury,
 joined up    the  silver  wire   as one   of the arms of a Wheatstone's
  bridge.   At the upper end of the copper wire, which           was fastened
 to the beam,     two other copper wires were fastened by binding
 screws.    One of them went to the galvanometer;          the other was the
 standard wire, with whose resistance that of the silver wires was

80                 Proceedings      of the Royal Society
compared.       For all the observations on a single wire,       it had, in all
cases, as nearly as possible the same temperature.             That it might
not  be affected   by warm or cold currents of air it was defended by
a coating of gutta percha, and made to pass through a tube             of water
whose temperature could readily be noted.         By dipping into    a mercury
pool it was joined up as a second arm of the Wheatstone's bridge.
A length of about 5 mm. of the end which dipped in the mercury was
well amalgamated.         Above that the wire was varnished by a non
conductor,    so that contact began always at the same point of the wire.
The other two arms of the bridge consisted of the segments of a Ger
man-silver wire, — KirchhofTs form of the Wheatstone bridge being
used exactly as described by Wiedemann             in his "Galvanismus."*
The galvanometer        used was Wiedemann's          minor galvanometer,f
the deflections of the mirror being observed         by means of a telescope.
The current employed        was that of a Bunsen's cell of great       internal
resistance. The length of the wire was determined by           a  very delicate
cathetometer, which could measure             accurately to   *02   mm.     The
lower end of the copper wire which was fastened to the beam, was
smooth     and flat,  and cut at right angles to its vertical axis.         The
edge   of  the small plate was correspondingly        cut, so that the exact
point at which the silver wire was seized            and compressed      by the
copper plate could be seen through the telescope              of the catheto
meter.      The clamp which seized the lower end of the silver wire
was arranged in the same way.              The wires, of    whose    resistance
measurements were made, were of pure silver, and were carefully
drawn by M. E. Stohrer, philosophical instrument maker of Leipzig.
They    were always raised      to a red heat     before  being subjected to
tension, care being taken that fusion did not occur in any part.             In
order to determine the effect of tension on the conductivity of the
wires, it was necessary to know the relation of their diameter before
to their diameter after being stretched.           This  was estimated by a
careful measurement       of lengths and specific gravities.    For the latter
purpose a chemical balance was employed, which could weigh accu
rately to 0001 grm.         As the wires had to be rolled up to prevent
their touching the sides of the vessel containing the distilled water
in which they were weighed, the measured specific gravity was pro-

bably not exactly that of the wire of measured               resistance.    The
error, however, must have been very slight.
    The course of procedure       was as follows:    — The wire     was heated
red hot in an alcohol flame.         After cooling, its specific gravity    was
determined.       It  was  then fastened by the copper plates to the
thick copper wires,     and a slight weight was attached just sufficient
to straighten the wire, that its length might be accurately ascer
tained (it was straightened as much as possible by being drawn
between     the fingers before being fastened in the apparatus).          When
straight enough for the determination of its length, its resistance
was also measured by the method of double observation, as de
scribed in the " Galvanismus "         (see above).*    After the determina
tion of resistance, weights       were carefully     piled upon     the carrier,
which during the operation        was held fast from below.          They  were
then allowed to stretch the wire gradually until it hung quite free,
 and its elongation had ceased.           Then the length, the resistance,
 and finally the length     a second    time, were determined, the second
 measurement of length being made in order to be certain that there
 had been no further      elongation.      The weights were now carefully
 taken   off, the carrier  being again supported from below, and the
 specific gravity of the wire was measured as before, the compressed
 ends, however, having been cut off.        A large number of experiments
 were rendered useless by the fact that too great weights were attached.
 Either the wires broke, or they        were found    on inspection     to have
 too variable a diameter to be regarded          as  uniform.     In  the result
 given below such small weights were used that almost no difference
 of diameter throughout the whole length of the wire could be noticed
 by means of a magnifying instrument.               Thus the wire could be
 treated as uniform, and       the specific gravity      method assumed       to
 give its diameter.
    The results of the examination of three wires             are given in the
 following table: —
   * Instead of the formula given in  "  Galvanismus," the following was used:—
 The length of the German-silver wire as found by this formula was 1108 795
 mm.    As measured by the cathetometer its length was 1108-8 mm.

    These results agree, as might                      be expected,           with     those     which
Moussonf       has published on               steel,    iron, and copper wires, in the
fact that the resistance increases very much faster than the length.
This must        be the case unless there be a diminution                             of resistance,
due to tension, sufficient to neutralise the increase of resistance                                  due
to decrease       of the cross section of the wire.                         It   is interesting to
ask,  then— Does         the decrease          in the diameter of the wire account
for that part of the increase of its resistance which is not due to
the increase of its length?                 The following table answers this ques
tion.    The column           headed         " calculated resistance " contains the
resistance as it ought to have been                   if its increase        had been due           only
to  change of dimensions: —

specific gravity       produced by the rolling up of the wires, their
extension      by weight     between the first determination           of specific
gravity and the first determination of resistance, the irregularity in
their cross section produced by stretching, and the slight contrac
tion of the wires after the removal of the weights and before the
second determination of specific gravity, — all of which, however,
must have been exceedingly slight.             It seems to warrant the state
ment that      if tension  has any effect upon silver wires at      all the effect
is exceedingly small.         This differs from Mousson's conclusion as
to steel, iron, and copper wires. He found that the increase in
their resistance produced by stretching was not fully accounted for
by the change of their dimensions.
     In  the course of the experiments       I found that by raising        a silver
wire, which       had   been stretched, to    a red heat, its resistance was
very slightly diminished.          A wire of   about    the dimensions of No.
 III.,   which, after having been stretched by 6985 grins, had a re
 sistance of.l-8135,      had, after being heated      red hot, a resistance       of
 1-8103.      This is again different from what Mousson has found to
 be true    of steel, iron, and copper wires, but it agrees with a deter
 mination made by Becquerel on silver wires.*
     The following tables contain       series of observations made for the
 purpose of finding the relation between the stretching weight and
 the total increase in the resistance of the silver wires used.                   In
 these determinations, the constant resistance with which the resist
 ances of the stretched wires were compared was that of a silver
 wire.     Both wires were surrounded by a coating of steam.                    The
 stretched wire, in order that, by its being kept at a high tempera
  ture, greater elongations might be produced by the same weights                    ;
  the constant wire in order that thermo-electric              effects   might be
  eliminated.      The   steam coating was formed by enclosing the wires
  in glass tubes, and these tubes in a much larger tube, and conduct
  ing   steam   between them.        In  other respects      the apparatus and
  mode of procedure were quite the same as before.                 The     observa
  tions were made when the appended weights had ceased to produce
  any appreciable elongation, and with the steam                coating half-an-
  hour was generally found to be a sufficient length of time for the
 production of the total stretching effect.

    It  will  be seen that the relation between        appended     weights and
thereby increased resistances is not that of simple proportion.                In
this respect silver wires appear again to differ from copper wires.
Some experiments made by Messrs Meik and Murray * having
shown that the changes of resistance of copper wires, when
stretched by weights,        are directly proportional    to the weights.
    I  am deeply indebted to Professor Wiedemann                  of Leipzig, in
whose laboratory        these experiments were      performed, for the excel
lent apparatus which         he  kindly  placed at my disposal, and for the
advice and      assistance   with which he favoured me.

     Faraday's    discovery of the magnetic         rotatory     polarisation   of
 light   may be expressed      in the following manner      : — Let two electro
 magnets, in the form of iron tubes, surrounded by helices of wire, be
 placed end to end, so that in the space between them the lines of
 force are very intense.         Let a rod of dense glass be placed in this
 space, so that a ray       of light may pass through         the two tubes and
  the rod of glass.       Let such a ray on entrance       be plane-polarised,
  so that the direction of vibration      is in a vertical direction.      If the
  electro-magnet       be now     magnetised,    the emergent       ray will   be
  polarised, so that its vibrations are inclined to the vertical at a
  small angle. The direction in which the line of vibration has been
  rotated is the same as the direction of the positive current in the
  helices.
     The   same effect might        be produced without        the aid of mag
  netism    if the rod were rotated round the axis of the ray of light
  with   great velocity.        The rotation of the plane of polarisation

would be the angle rotated whilst the light traverses the glass rod.
This    is on the assumption that the ether       within the rod is likewise
rotated.       In  the magnetic    experiment      it is  easy   to produce      a
rotation of 1° in a piece of glass three inches long.              Light takes
T.Tnnr.wff.Tnnr    of a second  to traverse this distance.           Hence,    to
produce     an effect equal to the magnetic effect, the glass rod         would
require to be rotated 10,000,000 times in a second.                 We cannot
determine with great precision the plane of polarisation of a ray              of
light,   hence we cannot measure      any rotation of the plane of polari
sation which might be thus produced.
    In the    same manner,   if we suppose      the molecules of glass and
the accompanying ether to be rotated round the lines of               magnetic
force,    and in the direction of the positive current producing the
given magnetic field, then the phenomena observed                  by Faraday
would be explained       ; and   we   should be able       to  determine the
number of rotations per second         induced in any specimen         of glass
with    a given intensity of magnetic field.
    So soon as the electro-magnet       is demagnetised, the rotation          of
the molecules ceases.        It  seems,     then, that there is      a  friction
among the molecules tending           to   stop  the   rotation.     Hence    we
should be led to conclude that the energy of the magnet is gradu
ally   used up by the presence     of the piece of glass.
    Assuming,     then, that there is a friction       among the molecules
of glass, it follows that when     the electro-magnet is magnetised the
rod of    glass has a tendency to turn bodily round an axis through
its centre of gravity parallel to the lines of force         ; and   if the rod
of glass were free it would turn round this axis.
    In the winters 1872-3         and    1873-4,     I   made    a  number     of
experiments to put this hypothesis to the test.             The general idea
of   the experiments was this.       A rod of glass      was suspended      by a
fine skein of silk fibres between         two poles of an electro-magnet,
 one pole above, the other below.        A small mirror      was fixed on    the
rod, and a lamp and scale arrangement was mounted for measuring
rotations.      Headings were taken when there was no current, and
 also in the two positions of the commutator.
    The result of these experiments seems to be that there is an
effect of the kind anticipated.        Sometimes, it is true, a deflection
 was produced by a diamagnetic             repulsion, owing to a want of

uLsolute symmetry in the arrangements. This rotated the glass
rod slightly, and produced a little confusion.                  But beyond this
there was an undoubted effect, for the nature of the deflection was
found to depend upon the polarity of the two poles, the effect being
different according        as the upper pole was a north or a south one.
I   was sometimes able, simply by timing the reversals of the com
mutator, to get up          a very large rotation-swing,       and by the same
means       I was able to stop    the rotation swinging.
     I  delayed     the publication    of  these   experiments with the view
of establishing        more certain results.      But much time      has elapsed,
and     I  have still  been unable to find time for this.          Hence,     I  am
unwilling any longer to withhold their publication.                    I will   now
give the experiments in detail,          and   will conclude   by collecting the
 general results.
                           Description  of  the Apparatus.
      A  rod of glass was suspended        by a strand of   silk fibres attached
 to one end.         This  was supported on a stone imbedded          in the wall
 of the laboratory.          The rest of the apparatus       was on    a separate
  stand.      A  horse-shoe electro-magnet was placed          so that the poles
 were     vertically over each other, and as nearly above and below              the
  axis of the glass rod as possible. Thus the axis of the glass                  rod
  lay along the lines of magnetic force.              The electro-magnet         was
  connected through         a commutator       with a battery of Grove cells.
  Upon the glass rod was attached a small piece of silvered glass, by
   means    of which the light reflected from a paraffin lamp fell upon
  a scale    divided to millimetres.      The distance of the scale from the
  glass rod was about seven decimetres.            The apparatus was arranged
   so  that the glass rod was     suspended within a glass jar or bottle, to
   get rid   of currents of air.
      During      the   session   1872-73      thick  flint   glass tubes       were
   employed      for suspension, and an electro-magnet weighing               about
   6 lbg.    After that a rod of Faraday's heavy glass was used, and an
   electro-magnet weighing about 50 lbs.

                              Details    of Experiments.
    The   first      experiments     were     made    in   1873,    March     28,   and
they were continued regularly until April                   16.    The rod of flint-
glass was suspended          in air, water, and oil.         A rotation    was nearly
always communicated to the rod when contact was made with the
electro-magnet.          When the magnetism of the electro-magnet                   was
reversed    I  sometimes got a rotation in the opposite direction, and
sometimes a rotation            in the same        direction,    but to a different
extent.     The apparatus          was    repeatedly dismounted           and   set up
again with       all the parts changed.              The   effects   were   generally
unaltered.          In noting the experiments, I used the terms " no
contact," "right contact," and "left contact," as being least liable
to lead to error.
                         " No contact      "
                                             means that the circuit was broken.
" Right contact        "
                         means that the lower pole of the electro-magnet
would,   if  free, point to the north.
                                                 " Left contact "    means that the
lower pole of the magnet would,              if free, point to the south.        'When
the readings of the scale are increasing the glass is rotating                   in the
direction of the hands of a watch with the face upwards.                           The
glass  was sometimes put into water or oil, and in this case                       also
rotation was generally observed.
   The rotation oscillations           in air were so great as to necessitate
reading the scale at the end of each half oscillation, and taking                     a
mean.     In    the    following    table each reading is a mean of many
observations : —

123 divisions.                On reversing this action for                        6    swings the range
was reduced           to 12 divisions

      The general result of the experiments                                   of the      winter             is,  that
when a pole lending to point to the north                           is     above the glass rod,                  and a
pole tending to point to the south                       is   below, the rod turns            in   the opposite
direction       to the hands         of    a watch with the face upwards.
      On      placing     the magnet with                  the poles in           a    horizontal              plane,
rotations were sometimes observed.                               This      is   in direct contradiction
to     the theory that               led to           these    experiments.            I       can          offer no
explanation, but merely record the fact.
      In   the session          1873-74 similar experiments were made with                                           a

piece of Faraday's heavy glass. But in this case the glass was
inserted in a hole in a cork, to which also the mirror was attached.
On examining the cork it was found to be magnetic.                         This
accounted for all the phenomena observed.
    But in      the previous    session  this  would not      account   for the
phenomena.           There was no cork employed ; and experiments
made to test this by altering the position of the magnet showed
that there      was no magnetism in the arrangement.
     It  was the doubt that hung over the last winter's            experiments
 that made       me wish to delay publishing      any results until    I should
 have finally settled the matter.           I  have been unable to do         so
 hitherto, and offer the original experiments in the meantime.
                         Note on the preceding       paper.
     [The first statement     is that a rotation    of the plane of polarised
  light might      be produced by rotating    a transparent body about       the
  ray as an axis.
      It is  improbable that no such effect would be produced, but that
  the question is by      no means a simple one may be seen by looking at
   Sir W. Thomson's paper        on this subject   (Proc. R.   S. Lond., 1856).
      I have also tried a great many hypotheses besides those which             I
   have published,      and  have   been astonished      at the way   in which
   conditions     likely to produce rotation     are   exactly neutralised    by
   others not seen at first.
      There can be no doubt, however, that a rotation of some kind is
   going on in a diamagnetic medium under magnetic force, and this
   may be of the molecules of the glass             of  the ether or what not,
   and this probably goes on in all media whether transparent or not.
       This rotation,    as Prof. George Forbes says, stops as soon as the
   magnetic     force is removed.       He supposes that it is stopped by
   friction, and therefore, that energy is being dissipated               at  all
   times as long as magnetic force acts on a medium.
       But   we know that a magnet      will retain its magnetism for     a long
   time, and it has never been shown that a magnet must necessarily
   lose   its magnetism.      Hence     we must admit       that the molecular
   rotation is not accompanied with friction, but that it is set up by

92                    Proceedings           of the Royal Society
 electro-motive         force,   and exerts electro-motive             force when     it is
 stopped,     like  a  rotating body having inertia.
     (a)  If   the friction      supposed      by  Prof. Forbes exists, it would act
 as an accelerating force on the glass, so that                  if free it would rotate
 faster and faster up to           a certain great velocity, and         if suspended by
 a fibre,   it would     rotate    till the moment of friction          was balanced by
 the moment of tortion of the fibre.
     (/3) If   there is no friction the only effects possible would be those
 due, not to the maintenance, but to the starting                        and stopping of
 the molecular rotation.
     To investigate (a) experimentally              we must observe the elongations
 of the oscillation        as  follows    : —

observations.
    To investigate        (j3) experimentally        we must make and break when
the mirror is passing the point of equilibrium.
    In Prof. Forbes's experiments there                  is a disturbing     effect due to
the ordinary diamagnetic action of the electro-magnet on the tube,
which, if the tube is not perfectly symmetrised about the axis of the
 fibre,   will   tend    to produce rotation.            This    force, however, is    the
same whether the current be + or                      ,  provided the position      of the
tube is the same.          Hence,     if the + and      -   currents are exactly equal,
it may be possible           to distinguish       this effect from the effect sought
by Prof. Forbes.

    4.  On the Linear Differential Equation of the Second
                      Order.      By Professor Tait
                                  (Abstract.')
   This paper contains     the substance    of investigations      made for the
most part many years ago, but recalled to me during last summer
by a question started by     Sir W. Thomson, connected with Laplace's
theory of the tides.
   A   comparison is instituted      between    the results of various pro
cesses employed to reduce       the general linear differential equation
of the   second   order to a non-linear        equation of the first order.
The relation     between    these    equations seems      to be most     easily
shown    by the following      obvious process, which       I   lit upon while
seeking to integrate the reduced equation by finding                   how   the
arbitrary constant ought to be involved in its integral.

    The next subject treated         is the effect of the alteration           of sign
of  P  or Q in (2).     This is illustrated by the equation
                                  y"±2^'±y=0,
which is integrable or at least reducible to quadratures for any                      of
 the four combinations of sign.
    The always integrable        case where
                                    P = (C-*)Q
 is next examined.
    Another portion of the investigation deals with certain infinite but
 convergent series, whose sums can always be expressed                     in terms   of
 the integral   of a  linear differential equation of the second order.

Eliminating Pn       between    (5) and (6), we obtain

   This equation        is thus true for  all positive integral values of n,
and its form    at once      shows that it is true for negative integral
values also.     It   is very singular that such a series of equations of
all  orders should have a common solution.                 But it depends upon
the   fact, which   I   do not recollect having seen in print, that

companion     formula

we should find the same equation (7) for         Q0 as     for P0.   In fact, as
is easily seen,
                                     Q„=P„.

        On the Origin of Language — Max -Miiller, Whitney.
                            By Professor Blackie.
    Professor Blackie stated that though the origin of language might
 be considered by some more a metaphysical than a philological ques
 tion, it was yet   so  closely connected      with philology, that whatever
 opinions   a philologer held on this question could not fail to exer
 cise a  strong secret influence on his philological procedure.           The
 primary elements out of which language grew were admitted by all
 lo be three, viz., cries or interjectional exclamation, mimetic re
 production of audible sounds, technically but stupidly called onoma-
 topoein, and gesture.       But while agreeing on this threefold basis
 the most distinguished writers on this subject, such as          Max-Muller,
  Wedgwood,     Whitney, Bleek, Schleicher, and Steinthal, disagreed
  fundamentally,     or at least seemed     to be at daggers    drawing, with
  regard to the course which language pursued in its further develop

  ment.     Ou the one hand, Miiller, who had hud          a  great influence in
  guiding public opinion in this region, stoutly asserted that out of
  the three primal elements, as from a root, no further growth of
  what    we called    human language, for reasonable          social purposes,
 could take place      ; while,  on the other hand, Wedgwood           — who in
 this whole matter       had, in his opinion,     received scant recognition
 from the scholars of his own country — as stoutly maintained               that
 from these three elements, as their natural root, the whole organism
 of the beautiful growth of language, stem, leaf, and fruit, could be
 satisfactorily explained.       After carefully studying the arguments
 of the learned Oxford Professor, he was of opinion that Wedgwood
 was   in the main right.       To this conclusion     he came from a course
 of independent investigation         some  years   ago, and when, curiously
 enough,     he had    only used Wedgwood's         dictionary   for occasional
 consultation, without having read and pondered the discourse prefixed
 to the last edition of that work.        The grounds of his opposition to
 Miiller   were stated to be      simply these :— While in perfect agree
 ment with him that roots significant        of ideas are the ultimate facts
 in the analysis of languages as we now have them, and believing
also that such conceptional roots are the natural and necessary ex
pression of reason in a reasoning animal, and explicable only on the
supposition      of  an  indwelling plastic     reason  in  man,   I am at the
same time unable to see why this plastic reason              in the formative
process of language-making          should not have used the materials         so
amply supplied by the interjectional          and mimetic elements       of  the
simplest germs of speech.          The interjectional     element,   I call the
principle of significant vocal      response  ;  and theonomatopoelic prin
ciple,   I call the mimetic, dramatic, or pictorial element in language;
and   I  am prepared to show that, even under the many defacements
and obliterations      which spoken words, like old sixpences or wave-
worn pebbles, suffer from the tear and wear of time, they yet show
in hundreds of cases on their face the manifest superscription of
their mimetic origin.        For  we must take note, first, that not only
pigs and cuckoos, cats, curs, and crows, but all nature, is full of
sounds, and that there is no absolute silence anywhere but in death             ;
and, further, that not only an immense variety of sounds can                  be
approximately       expressed by imitation      in articulated vocal breath,
but that by an easy transference the impressions of the other senses
can be analogically expressed in the flexible material of significant

100                  Proceedings        of the Royal Society
sound.      It is also not only an easy but            a   natural and necessary pro
cess of the human mind in the formation                    of general concepts to use
the material       presented     by mere        sensuous impressions; and thus,
while we expressly deny the perverse doctrine of the sensationists
that mind can be explained               from sense, or the imperial unity of
thought be generated from             a  multiplicity of external impressions,
we can see no difficulty        in deriving such general concepts as                    char
acter   and    type, for instance, from the roots                  xapdercra>   and tvtttui,
which originally       were mere        mimetic reproductions of               an external
sound, as in our word scratch.              Language, therefore, was formed by
the gradual extension of words             originally expressing sensations               and
feelings to intellectual       purposes      ;  and   there is nothing          ignoble     in
this, for the mind uses the materials supplied by sense just as the
architect uses the stones dug by the quarryman or the lime carried
by the hodman.          Neither     can    one at    all    see the logical       justice of
Max-Miiller when          he exposes       the historical        falsehood of some of
Wedgwood's onouiatopoetic etymologies                    ;  for the erroneous applica
tion of   a  principle    does not in the least imply                 that the principle
itself is erroneous     ;  and, besides,       the oldest roots         to which      certain
very recent forms of Romanesque words may be traced back in
Sanscrit can      be  shown in not a few cases to have been the product
of that very mimetic process which Midler so persistently ignores.
But while Miiller seems actuated                 by some strange prejudice in his
stout determination to make no use of the onomatopoetic element                             so
 thickly strewn in language, Professor Whitney has introduced no
little confusion into this matter by talking of language as an insti
tution,   and reviving the doctrine of the old Greek Sophists, that
 language is Oicra, not       tf>vcrti.    Every simile limps           ;  but  if we must
have    similes, it is far nearer the truth                 to talk    of language       as a
growth and       a  living organism than            to call     it  an    institution.     In
some sense language is certainly a growth                    ; in  no sense is     it  an in
stitution.      Institutions like the Sabbath, for instance, are then
creatures    of positive law ; but language is a direct efflux of plastic
reason, and no more an institution                than the song of the nightingale
or a sonata    of Beethoven. As           to the connection between Darwinism
and the origin of language, while the Darwinian                        philologers,      with
Schleicher at their head, will no doubt find a special delight in
tracing the splendid roll of a Platonic period from the grumph of

the primeval pig, and the mew of tlie pre-Adamitie kitten, those
who with me look on Darwinism as a mere pleasant conceit of men
besotted in the one-sided study of physical                   science, can, so far as
philological conclusions are concerned, leave the conceit to shift for
itself, being firmly convinced that whenever                  reason does show itself
whether on the original appearance            of man or            at   some after-stage
of his development, it     appears as a force altogether                  different from,
 and in some of its functions, as Professor Ferrier wisely maintained,
 essentially   contradictory    of, and    antagonistic to, every kind and
 degree  of mere sensation      ;  and  in   this character brings forth lan
 guage as    the natural manifestation and organised body of itself.

2.   A  Further Contribution          to the Placentation of the Cetacea
           (Moiwdon Monoccros).            By Professor Turner.
    In the year 1871,     I  read before      this Society a memoir on the
                                                     I
Gravid Uterus of Orca gladiator, in which discussed the placenta
tion of the Cetacea. This memoir was published in the Transac
tions for that year. On the present occasion             I purpose describing
the placenta in a Cetacean genus in which it has not hitherto been
examined.
    In the month of December 1875 I received, through the inter
mediation     of my friend Mr C. W. Peach, from Mr John
Maclauchlan,     the chief Librarian and Curator to the Free Library,
Dundee, a cask containing the gravid uterus of a Narwhal (Monodon
Monoceros), which had been procured by the captain of the Dundee
whaling steamer "Erik."           The uterus had      been preserved in strong
brine, and was in good condition for anatomical examination.
    The uterus  was two-horned, and contained a foetus 5 feet 5 inches
long in the left cornu.       The gravid horn measured         7 feet 4  inches
along its great curvature     ;  the non-gravid, 4 feet.      The girth of the
gravid horn, at its thickest part, was 4 feet          4 inches.   The length
of the corpus uteri was 1 foot ; that of the vagina, 1 foot           8 inches.
 The os was occluded by an extremely viscid mucus.
    The uterine cornua       were opened      into by a longitudinal incision
along the greater curvatures.           The uterine wall    was comparatively
thin, and the chorion       was closely      adherent to its mucous lining.
 By an incision through the chorion, along the greater curvature of
 the gravid horn, the sac of the amnion was opened into and the foetus
 exposed.    The   foetus lay with its back        in relation to the greater
 curvature of the cornu, its belly to the lesser           curvature, its head
 close to the corpus uteri;      whilst its caudal     end was directed to the
 narrow end of the horn, but did not reach to within two feet of the
 Fallopian tube. The tail was curved forwards under the hinder
 part of the ventral surface of the foetus.          The pectoral flipper was
 directed backwards parallel         to the    long axis of the body.       The
 umbilical   cord was    3  feet   long, spirally    twisted, and bifurcating
 where it reached the sac of the allantois.            The amnion formed     an
 immense bag, which reached to           5  inches from the free end of the
 gravid horn of the chorion, but it did not extend into that part of

  104                    Proceedings       of the Royal Society
 the    chorion       which occupied the non-gravid              horn.    The amnion
 was    closely      adherent to the greater part of the chorion in the
gravid cornu       ;   but that portion of the chorion which was attached
to the mucosa          lining    the lesser curvature      of the cornu, and which
 lay opposite        the    abdominal aspect of the foetus, was in relation
to the wall of the sac of the                 allantois.    The allantois formed       a
 large   funnel-shaped bag at the place of bifurcation                    of the cord.
It   was prolonged along the concavity                 of the chorion to within 2
inches of its free end in the gravid horn, and to within                    9  inches of
the free end of the prolongation of the chorion into the non-gravid
horn.      The length of the sac of the allantois was therefore much
greater than        that of the amnion, though its capacity was much
less.     The allantois was prolonged               as   a slender tubular urachus
into the umbilical cord, which also contained two large arteries and
two veins.        The amnion investing the cord had numerous brownish
corpuscles,      resembling those           I  have   described in Orca gladiator,
projecting from it          ;  and similar corpuscles were scattered          over that
part of the amnion which was in apposition with the wall of the
sac of the allantois, and a few were seen on the amnion beyond the
border     of the allantois.            In addition    to these    brown corpuscles,
numerous other bodies                of a dull white appearance           were    found.
Sometimes these were slender rods, from f^th to ^th inch long,
arranged end to end like the links of a chain, at other times they
were globular, like            minute shot.       The    rods were    most    numerous
on the abdominal half of the cord, whilst                   the globules were       most
numerous       at and near its bifurcation.             The surface     of the amnion
adjacent to the cord had              a few   of these globules scattered over it.
These white bodies were covered by the smooth amnion, which with
a  little  care could be stripped off as a distinct pellucid membrane.
They consisted of crowds               of squamous      epithelial   cells, so that in
structure       they       resembled       the    whitish    bodies    which     are  so
abundantly developed               in connection      with the amnion of the cow.
Between       3 and       4   inches of the abdominal           end   of the cord was
covered     with cuticle, which had the                purplish-grey     colour of the
cuticular     investment of the adjacent surface                  of the wall of the
belly.
    The two uterine cornua became                    continuous     with    each   other
through      the      corpus uteri,       and    were   partially   separated     by an

imperfect septum, which projected from the inferior wall. Owing
to the great distension of the left cornu, this septum was pushed to
the right, so that the os uteri opened directly into only the gravid
horn.      The chorion extended from        the end of the gravid       to that of
the non-gravid cornu.            As it passed   through    the    corpus uteri  it
was somewhat constricted by the projecting septum.                   In the whole
length of the non-gravid horn, and            at the free end       of the gravid
horn, the chorion        was raised into strong     longitudinal folds, which
corresponded       in  reverse order with a    similar series of folds of the
uterine mucosa radiating           from the orifices of the Fallopian tube.
At    the os uteri the mucosa was raised into strong folds, which radi
ated into the gravid chorion for a considerable distance, and in some
parts of their extent projected as much as 3 inches from the general
plane of the mucosa, though at the os they had not more than one
 half that projection.        The chorion    in apposition with this part of
 the mucosa       was also folded.       In the gravid horn opposite the
 foetus,   where the expansion both of chorion and uterus was the
 greatest, the folds were not present.          Except in    a few localities, to
 be immediately       specified, the whole of the extensive surface of the
 chorion was     so covered     with vascular  villi that, to the naked eye at
 least, no non-villous       intervals  could be recognised.         The chorion
 was adherent to the uterine mucosa, so that gentle traction was
 needed to draw them asunder; and, as the one was peeled                       off
 the other, the     villi of   the  chorion were seen to be drawn out of
 multitudes of crypts opening on the free surface of the mucosa.
      The chorion, which lay opposite the os uteri and the immediately
 surrounding mucous membrane,              was for the most part not villous,
  but presented a smooth, feebly vascular appearance,                 which  con
  trasted strongly      with the adjacent villous      chorion.      This smooth
  spot was irregular       in form, measured 6 inches by 4 inches, and
  from it narrow bands of smooth chorion radiated outwards for
  from   2  to 3 inches between the villous covered folds of the chorion.
  It  was  similar   to, but much larger, than the corresponding spot in
  Orca and the Mare.          Small isolated patches of     villi  were scattered
  irregularly over the surface of this smooth spot. The inner surface
  of the chorion at the bare patch was lined by the amnion and not
  by the allantois.       Three inches from this large spot a bare patch,
  1  inch by    inch, was completely surrounded            by villous chorion.

  The uterine mucosa opposite          these smooth     portions of the chorion
  was smooth and free from crypts, except where the isolated patches
  of  villi  were  in apposition      with it.    Radiating for about           1  inch
  from the pole of the chorion in the gravid horn were narrow non-
  villous bands     of the chorion        separated    by intermediate          villous
  surfaces.     These bands corresponded to folds of the mucosa free
  from   crypts, which     radiated from the          orifice    of the Fallopian
  tube,   and   were continuous with the longitudinal               folds of mucosa
 in that tube.       In the non-gravid        horn the chorion was devoid of
  villi for about 5 inches from its free end, and for even a greater
  distance the villi were irregularly scattered so that well-defined
 smooth patches could be traced as far as 10 or 12 inches from the
 pole.      On some parts of the chorion         pedunculated hydatid dilata
 tions of the villi, about the size of small peas,                 were   irregularly
 scattered.
     When examined          microscopically,      the   villi    were    seen    to be
 arranged in tufts, which varied in size and in the number of villi.
 Some tufts had not more than two or three               villi, but more usually
 numbers were collected together, though occasionally short single
 villi arosefrom the chorion in the intervals between the tufts. The
 villi had    as a rule a club-shaped       form, but some divided           into fili
 form branches.        They   were   highly vascular, and        a beautiful    extra-
 villous layer of capillaries was distibuted, as in Orca, beneath the
 free surface of the chorion.
     The free surface of the uterine mucosa had, as in Orca, a delicate
 reticulated appearance,      and was pitted       with   multitudes of recesses
 and furrows, which again were subdivided into innumerable crypts.
 In   the polar regions    of the cornua        and   in   the   corpus uteri       the
 mucosa was more spongy            and succulent than in the greatly dis
 tended part     of the gravid horn, in which        the mucosa was obviously
more stretched, so that the pits and furrows were almost obliterated,
and the crypts opened         on the general        plane of the mucosa.             In
their general arrangement, and in the vascularity of their walls, the
crypts in the Narwhal            resembled     so closely      the    corresponding
structures in Orca, that       I  need not give a special description.             The
layer of cells which        lined    them     was   a well-defined        cylindrical
epithelium, many of the cells of which, however, were so swollen
that the breadth almost equalled the length.

                     of Edinburgh, Session 1875-76.                          107
    Scattered over the surface of the mucosa in the more distended
part of the cornu        were   numerous smooth, depressed,          circular  or
ovoid spots, the largest of which        was not more than -^th inch           in
diameter, though as      a rule they were less than    ^th inch     ;  so that to
the naked    eye they were apt to escape observation.           Each spot was
surrounded     by a minute fold of the mucosa, sub-divided into crypts.
On    an average from twenty-five to     thirty of these spots were found in
each square inch.       They resembled the smooth        depressed     spots de
scribed by myself* and some other anatomists in the uterine mucosa
of the gravid pig.     On the surface of the chorion adapted to this part
of   the mucosa, occasional smooth patches from -i\jth to j^-th inch in
diameter     were   seen   surrounded by villous      tufts   which     were   in
apposition    with the smooth depressed         spots   on   the mucosa, but
they had not the definite stellate form which one sees on the
chorion of the pig. The extra-villous layer of capillaries ramified
beneath these non-villous spots of the chorion.             In the succulent
parts of the mucosa the smooth depressed            spots could not      be seen
with the naked       eye, but only   after  a careful search    with a pocket
lens were they found at the bottom of some of the trenches or pits
in the membrane.
    From the general resemblance between these spots and those
met with in the uterine mucosa of the pig, one was naturally
inclined to think that they would have a relation to the mouths of
the utricular glands.        I proceeded,   therefore, to examine the glan
dular layer of    the mucosa.      The glands were very numerous, and
branched repeatedly.         Many of the branches formed short diver
 ticula, others were much longer       ; sometimes they were tortuous, at
 others a considerable length of straight gland tube could be seen.
 In the   deeper part   of the mucosa     the glands lay almost parallel to
 the surface; but as they approached the crypts, they were directed
 more obliquely, so as to be frequently divided in vertical             sections.
 The glands    were subjacent not only to the crypts, but to the smooth
 depressed   spots, numerous examples       of which   I carefully    examined.
 In one instance,     I saw   a tube lined by epithelium       lying obliquely
 beneath the membrane of         a spot, and opening near the middle by a
 distinct orifice bounded by a crescentic fold of the membrane.                In

 108                 Proceedings of        tlhe Royal Society
 a second instance, the end of a gland passed                  from under cover of
 the surrounding crypts, and then seemed to open by an obliquely
 directed mouth near the free edge of the spot.               But upwards of thirty
 other spots examined with equal care gave                me no evidence of gland
 mouths opening on them.             Hence it would appear that these smooth
 surfaces on the mucosa are by no means necessarily associated with
 the mouths of the utricular glands, and one is disposed                  to conclude
 that the gland orifices are usually concealed              amongst the crypt-like
 foldings of the mucosa.         The very much greater number of the crypts
 than of the stems of the glands, negatives the idea of the crypts
 being merely dilatations of the mouths of the glands, so that in the
 Narwhal,     as in    Orca,   the Pig, and Mare, the crypts are to be
 regarded as interglandular         in position and produced by        a hypertrophy
 and folding    of  the mucosa.
    Through the kindness of my friend Dr Allen Thomson,                        I  have
 had the opportunity       of examining         a  portion of the gravid        uterus
 and chorion    of   a  Narwhal,      the foetus    in which      measured    only Z\
inches long.       The   free surface of the mucosa was gently            undulating
 and traversed by       shallow furrows, but no definite crypts could be
 seen.    The gland-tubes were remarkably numerous, tortuous, and
branching.      I made a comparative measurement of their size, with
that of the glands in my much more developed specimen, and found
them to have only one-half the transverse diameter. The gland-
stems inclined obliquely          to the   surface of the         mucosa    on which
their orifices could occasionally           be seen.     The     free surface  of the
chorion was not villous, but traversed            by faint ridges, which without
doubt fitted into the shallow furrows of the mucosa.                      Patches   of
epithelium-cells      could be seen covering the surface of the chorion.
It  is clear therefore that        in the Narwhal, as        I  have elsewhere de
scribed in the pig, the      villi  do not form on the surface of the chorion,
nor the crypts on the surface of the mucosa, until the embryo has
reached a stage of development in which its body, though small,
has    assumed    a   form which enables           its ordinal     characters to be
recognised.
   When     I  published my memoir on the placentation of Orca,                      I
was under the impression that the crypts were lined by a pavement
epithelium,     and    was   not disposed to          regard the crypts       in the
mucosa    of that   cetacean    as secreting organs       ; but a re-examination

                        of Edinburgh, Session 1875-76.                                    109
of    the epithelium-cells          lining its crypts       has     convinced me, that
they      are    not    a    pavement      epithelium,      in the       sense     of being
squamous         cells,    but have an        intermediate       or transitional        form
between       the columnar epithelium              and   the tesselated         epithelium.
In     the   Narwhal, again, the cells            are cylindrical,       as in     so many
mammals, so that             I believe the Cetacea        to offer no        exception       to
the view that          these    cells are a secreting          epithelium,        and    they
doubtless       elaborate a secretion for the nourishment                   of   the  foetus.
From        the fact      that the utricular glands            had     a much greater
calibre in my        specimen      than in the one belonging to Dr Thomson,
one may infer that even after the crypts                     are   fully developed         the
glands still play a part in foetal nutrition.
     The   foetus in my specimen had an almost uniformly                    purplish-grey
colour, but with a patch of yellowish-white                    on    the belly near the
 anus.      The snout       was rounded;       the fissure of the mouth 1£ inch
 long; eye-slit 4J          inches behind the snout, and surrounded by                        a
 faint circle; ear orifice very minute, 3 inches behind                       the  eye-slit;
 blow holes above and a little anterior to eye slit.                            Length of
 flipper   7   inches,     its anterior     edge    12  inches behind           the   snout.
 Funis      was   attached       to   the   belly    about midway            between      the
 anterior and posterior end of the foetus.                A low, but distinct dorsal
ridge, the rudiment of a dorsal fin, commenced a little in front of
a point midway            between      tip of snout and        end     of tail, and ex
tended backwards for between                10 and 11 inches along the middle
line of back.         It   had a lighter greyish tint than the surrounding
skin.      Breadth of tail was 15         J  inches.     In   a profile      view of the
foetus a     slight depression in the contour of the top of the                         head
was    seen in the region of the blow-holes.                      The foetus in        utero
differed therefore very materially              in colour from such a half-grown
specimen as Dr Fleming described*                    in which        the   upper part of
the body was a dusky black, the belly white, and numerous oblong
spots extended           horizontally     along     the sides     ;  still   more    did     it
differ from old specimens, which have                  a whitish       marbled colour.
The presence of         a dorsal ridge is also of interest, as the Narwhal
is described as without a dorsal fin.
    I availed myself of the opportunity of examining                        the dentition
of the foetus.       On May 20th, 1872,            I described      to the Society the
                           * Memoirs Wernerian Socy.,        1811.

dentition of a foetal Narwhal                7J inches long, in which           I found        two
dental papillae         developed in the gum, on each side of the upper
jaw, but the early stage                of development of the foetus                  did not
permit me to say whether the anterior or posterior denticle would
have been the one to become the                   maxillary tusk, though          I   thought
it probable that the more anterior would become the tusk.
   In this much larger            foetus the       superior       maxilla      was 8£ inches
long. At the anterior             end of each         of these bones were             two well
marked sockets, one opening immediately behind the other.                                  The
anterior socket contained               a    cylindriform rudimentary tusk.                The
posterior socket contained an aborted                   tooth      J    inch long, and          -^j
inch in its widest diameter.                 The hinder half of the aborted tooth
was attenuated, and had several short irregular processes                         projecting
from    it
         ;    the anterior       half       was smooth and rounded.               This tooth
was inclosed in         a   distinct sac,     formed of fibrous tissue, which, like
the sac of the rudimentary tusk, was firmly united to the fibrous
tissue of the gum.             There can be no doubt, therefore, that                  I       was
right in my conjecture that the                       more    anterior       dental    papilla
becomes the tusk of the Narwhal.

                        Communicated by Professor Tait.
     While    engaged        in cable work in the West Indies,              I    had, during
the winter and early spring                  of 1875,   a   number of very favourable
opportunities of examining the zodiacal light
     Before leaving this country              I   had, under the advice          of Professor
Tait,   and with        a   note of recommendation from Professor                      Jenkin,
applied to the Royal Society for the loan                    of   a   spectroscope,    to make
observations with during                the    voyage   ;    but      unfortunately   I    was
unable to obtain one, and so had to content myself with                               a   small
pocket-spectroscope.             On the outward voyage             I     did not notice the
light   at   all till   we got well to the south, near Cayenne, on the 8th
of January      ;   and, owing to the very bad weather we had about that
time,  I     was not able to make any satisfactory observations                         till   we

                           of Edinburgh, Session 1875-76.                                    Ill
however, to mention one feature with which                              I   was much struck,
and which         I    have never seen              remarked on — namely, that,                 on
watching the western sky from sunset onwards, it is impossible to
tell when the diffused sunlight ends and the zodiacal light begins
till it becomes so dark that the form of the latter can be traced to
a considerable altitude, when it is seen to be longer and narrower,
and inclined to the vertical at a considerable angle.                           I am     strongly
inclined    to believe that near the sun               it is very much wider than at
some distance from             it,   for
                                       I     have    very good reason to think that
what by     people generally would be taken                    as   simply the last of the
sunset     glow       is   really    due    to the    zodiacal light.           This part, of
course, can only be seen in places where the twilight                           is   very short.
The best time for making observations       found to be aboutI                                two
hours after sunset, when all traces of twilight had certainly                                dis
appeared, and consequently all risk of confusion with                           it   was gone.
    On January 31st, in lat. 8°N., long. 56° 'W., the light was very
bright,   and I       made some spectroscopic observations.                     At    two hours
after sunset the light was visible for 90° from the horizon, and                                so
bright    was   it    towards the horizon that           I    was able to get        a   distinct
spectrum.       I     first opened          the slit very wide, when          I      observed    a
broad strip of light, nebulous at the extremities, with                              a   distinct
reddish tinge at the one end                 ;   then, by gradually closing the slit,
I   obtained    a     narrower but tolerably pure continuous spectrum, in
which   I   could distinctly          see   reddish, orange, and greenish-blue, and
on making comparison with the spectrum                         of   a   lamp (placed at the
far end of the ship           so as    not to dazzle my eyes),              I estimated that
the spectrum extended from the red to past the position occupied
by the    F   line in the solar spectrum.                A    large number of observa
tions     taken on other nights, whenever                       the circumstances            were
favourable, entirely confirmed these first observations.                             On several
nights, and especially on February 27th, when off Ponce, in the
Island of Puerto Rico,          I     observed       the spectrum from          a    short time
after sunset          till long after the last           traces     of twilight          had dis
appeared,       but no change was noticeable after the spectrum had
become      so faint        that the Fraunhofer              lines could        not be distin
guished, except in the brightness of the spectrum, as         was still           I
able to see colour distinctly, but no traces of any bright lines.
    On February 26th and 27th                I    took   a   number of sextant measure

 112                Proceedings        of the Eoyal Society
merits  of the zodiacal light.           These are, of course, only approxi
mate, as the light has no definite boundary-lines,                       but gradually
fades   off at the borders.          The measurements             were made by the
help of stars, as it was quite impossible to measure the light itself.
On the 26th sunset           was    at about     six o'clock,     the   light   was very
bright    for 30° from the horizon, having at the horizon                    a breadth
of about 25°, and at an altitude of 30°              a breadth of about 20°.           At
9 p.m.  the  light    could be traced quite round to the eastern                horizon,
a phenomenon which             I  observed     on several other occasions.             At
10 p.m. the    light   was scarcely,     if at   all, visible.      That this     sudden
disappearance was not caused by any change in the atmospheric
conditions was clearly shown by the undiminished brightness of
the stars.     On February 27th the breadth at the horizon was                        30°,
while at an altitude of 30° it was only about 20°.                       The centre of
the band passed a       little  to the south    of the Pleiades.       I endeavoured,
by means of the sextant, to measure the inclination                     of the band      to
the   vertical.     For this      purpose   I  chose    two bright stars near the
centre of the      band — one     at a considerable altitude, the other close
to the horizon       ; I   then measured       the angle between         these and the
angle between       the upper one and          the horizon      ;  these   angles were
respectively 55° 30' and 51°, giving the value of 31° 30' for the
 inclination    of the centre of the         band     to the vertical.        I  had un
 fortunately     no access to star-charts, else            I  could have fixed the
direction more accurately;            but even these rough observations con
 firm the ordinary statement that the direction is slightly inclined
 to the ecliptic.
    The spectroscope         used   was one      of  Mr Ladd's admirable small
direct-vision      spectroscopes,      with    five    prisms and a single           lens.
 Behind the slit is      a  small round hole, through which the light may
be made to enter by opening the              slit very wide,       and which      is very
 convenient      for examining         monochromatic         light.     With this in
 strument it is easy to        see a   number of the Fraunhofer             lines on       a
 tolerably clear moonlight night.              And such      an instrument, though
 in some respects       inferior    to a simple large prism and slit,              will,   I
 believe, be found very suitable              for work such as that described
above, especially when it has              to be carried on on board               a ship
 much given to rolling.

4. Note on the Volcanoes of the Hawaiian Islands.                      By   J. W.
      Nichol, F.R.A.S.          Communicated         by Professor      Tait
    The late Transit of Venus Expedition gave the writer some
opportunities of visiting several islands of the Hawaiian Archi
pelago, some details of which may prove interesting.
    They form      a group of islands about       10.1  hours west longitude
from Greenwich, and about 20° to 22° north of the equator, and
differ in size from 10 miles long by 6 or 7 broad, to 90 miles by 60,
which are about the dimensions of the most easterly and largest,
viz., Hawaii (the Owyhee of Cook). The general lie of the islands
is from north-west to south-east, those in the east displaying the
most recent traces of volcanic activity.           In    the  older or western
portion the main mountain ranges run in the same direction as the
islands, rising in many places to        a height of 3000 to 4000 feet, and
having lateral ridges branching off at right angles, with an occa
sional crater of oval shape thrown up at a distance from them, and
evidently of more recent origin.
   The putting up of a meridian mark             on one    of  these   ridges in
the island of Oahu was attended with             some difficulty,    the narrow
space along which one had to ride, sometimes not more than                 a  yard
or two      wide,   with  precipitous    descents   of   500  to   1000   feet on
either   side,    not rendering     it comfortable     to  any one with weak
nerves.
   The    two most     easterly islands, viz., Maui and Hawaii, although
having their greatest length            in  the north-east      and   south-west
directions, are composed        only of mountains        standing    singly, and
present no appearance         of ranges.     Maui, indeed,     is nothing more
than   a couple of mountains joined         by a very low neck of land, on
the top of the eastermost       of which (Mount Haleakala), at a height
of 11,000 feet, is found one of the largest and most perfect extinct
craters in the world, being some 10 miles in diameter, which unfor
tunately     time would not admit          of our visiting.       The   sides   of
Haleakala are not precipitous, and the general view from the sea is
that of   a  huge hog- backed mountain.          Traces of flows of lava        so
recent as to be quite black, and not covered              with vegetation, are
also seen coming down from what had been openings in its sides a
short distance above the sea-level.
   VOL.  IX.                                                            Q

114               Proceedings of        the   Royal Society
    The island of Hawaii, or the most recent and easterly, is composed
of four mountains — the Mauna Kea, 14,500; Mauna Loa, 13,800,
Huallalei,   8000, and Kohala,       about 5000 feet      in height, with large
valleys of    2000, 3000, to 6000        feet above     the   sea-level between.
The slope of the mountains is usually gentle, and numerous small
craters of 100 to 300 feet in height are found distributed on their
sides, and also in the intermediate valleys.             On the west side pre
cipitous rocks face the sea, with        a  height of 3000 feet, which have
valleys opening seawards that are almost inaccessible from the land
side, owing to the     precipitous character of their sides.              It is on
this island that the most recent displays of volcanic activity are
seen, the country having been overrun in many places by lava
flows,   which have left large tracks quite useless              for agricultural
purposes.      Earthquakes     are common, and           the summit crater of
Mauna Loa, 13,800 feet up, is frequently, and that of              Killauea (on     a
level plateau on the side of Mauna Loa, about 3000 feet above the
sea)   is almost   always in     a    state    of   activity.     The crater       of
Killauea   is on the north-east       of Hawaii,    about    32 miles from        the
bay of   Hilo, which is the most convenient starting-point                for those
wishing to visit the volcano.            In the ride of 32 miles           one   has
an ascent of some 3000 feet, but the ups and downs are so numerous
that one can hardly detect        it.    During     some    portion of the way
one    passes  through   very dense         tropical   vegetation, palms, tree
ferns,   &c, with  creepers   and ferns clustering          around, but for      the
most part the path lies over lava flows, so recent as to                be   almost
devoid of vegetation, which render it so rugged as to compel one
to walk his horse the greater part of the way.               When approaching
the volcano the visitor is at first struck by the sight of hundreds                of
steam jets rushing up in all directions, some of which are                  utilised
as  vapour baths, by putting       a wooden       box over them with a hole
in the top large enough to admit the neck of the bather.                 On   going
some hundred yards further, an immense pit appears, at the                  further
end    of which during     the   day are seen large volumes of smoke,
while at night a red flare is visible in the sky, with an occasional
piece of white hot lava getting tossed up high                enough to be seen
above the edge of the inner crater.             This large pit or outer crater
 is of oval shape, and   some 3 miles long by           \\  to 1\ mile     broad in
 the widest part.     The sides are precipitous, and from 600 to 700

                            of Edinburgh, Session 1875-76.                                  115
feet in height, being in many places                   divided          into close parallel
ridges, showing              the height   to which the lava had               reached before
breaking out at a lower level.               There were two large sulphur beds
at the side of the outer crater, about 2 miles distant from each
other, and pieces of native sulphur could be picked up, each with
a hole in its centre, showing that the vapour had                             solidified round
the hole from which it had emerged.                    The floor of           the outer crater
was composed               of black lava, several    acres    of which were covered
over one night by the lava breaking out at a side of the lowermost
edge of the outer crater, quite distant from the inner one.
      Our first descent was made at night by means                            of some rustic
staircases cut in the sides of the ridges,                 and assisted          by whatever
brushwood        might be growing            on    the sides.           At last our party
were landed          on a floor     of black lava, all       seamed       with cracks and
contorted into curious shapes, sometimes like a mass of cable ropes
mingled together, at others showing large pudding-like excrescences,
which are dangerous to walk upon, since they are simply large
bubbles with a thin covering, to guard against which each visitor
carries a thick stick wherewith to test the ground before him.
      After walking           for about   half   an hour on this black              lava,   and
crossing innumerable cracks of from three inches to a foot in width,
some of which showed a white line of fire about 6 feet beneath, the
gradual      ascent to the inner crater was reached.                          Its position in
regard to the general form of the outer crater may                            be said to be   in
one of its foci, and its size, by estimation, about                     a £    mile long by   \
Lroad.       The increasing glare            and    smoke     now       warned     us   of our
proximity       to the more        active parts,    while here and there on the
outer side of the inner crater were some bright red streaks, which,
on our closer approach, turned out to be red hot lava flowing through
holes in the outer side of the inner crater on to the general surface
of the outer         one.
      The   ascent     of    some 70 feet to the     top     of   the    inner crater is      a
gradual one, and considerable detours had to be taken to get round
the parts which were being overflowed.                      The lava of its sides was
twisted about and broken up in                a most   ugly manner, besides being
so rotten as to break away in flakes                whenever       a foot was       put upon
it.     The greatest caution              was needed       to test      the    ground before
treading on          it,   and frequent play had to be made with our thick

116                 Proceedings of         the Royal Society
sticks.    Tumbles         were   frequent, from    which   the writer escaped
unharmed by having            a  thick pair of dogskin gloves on his hands.
One   of our party, however, a professor from Indiana, managed to
fall into  a  crack up to his middle, and got his hands severely cut
and burnt.
   The    view from the           top,  however,   amply   repaid the trouble.
Four lakes of molten           lava, the  largest some 200 yards in length,
and of kidney shape, and             the others of smaller size, were seen in
full activity.     In     the largest lake seven to eight fountains     of white
hot lava were playing           up at once to a height    of 30 to 40 feet, one
sometimes stopping and another commencing at a different part of
the side   of  the lake.
   The lava in this lake was about 50 feet below the inner edge of
the crater, and appeared           to be slowly advancing toward the tunnels
from which we had seen it issuing on the road up.                The lakes were
not at the same level, and you might              see one brimful    and another
60 to 70 yaids off at a level          of  some  30 or 40 feet below     it.  On
another of the lakes, about 50 yards wide,              was a   single fountain,
bursting     from     a   cavern in its side, and throwing        lava half-way
across its surface, while from the roof and sides of the cavern hung
down    lava stalactites.
   After looking       at this for some      time, the claims of our injured
friend became      so    strong, as to oblige us to take      him back to the
crater house, resolved next day to have a more deliberate inspec
tion.
   The next day proved wet, but the writer explored his way through
the  driving mist        formed     by the rain coming in contact with       the
heated    lava, the       only disagreeable incident     being his getting to
the leeward     of  a   blow-hole, and having to run to get clear of the
suffocating sulphur vapours.             This blow-hole  was about the size    of
a   man's body, and as you went forward to it you heard a               gurgling
sound beneath.          Smoke was coming out in considerable volumes,
and on looking in, the sides were seen to enlarge beneath and be
at a white heat.
   Having      at length       got seated    comfortably   upon    an  upheaved
block of lava about 20 feet above the larger lake, and             8 to 10 yards
from its side, a new fountain sprung up suddenly from the side of
the lake quite close at hand, which immediately forced a retreat to

                      of Edinburgh,        Session 1875-76.                      117
a  more respectful distance.          About    the  same     number of fountains
continued     to play     up as on the preceding evening, and looked red
by day.      Daylight, however, drowned out the redness of the lakes
as seen    by night, and     made them appear quite black.
    After watching for       a considerable time, a red hot crack was seen
to start suddenly       from one side of the lake to the other, then other
cracks    in different directions, and first one-half of              the  lake and
then the other was covered with            a fresh coating of red hot lava, the
former tumbling        out of sight as it got shrunk and cracked in cooling.
    A curiosity called Pele's* hair          is found round the sides        of these
lakes.      This  is composed       of fine fibres of lava cooled,        broken off
from the molten liquid while being spouted up in the fountains,
curried away by the wind, and lodged in the cracks around.
     The summit crater of Mauna Loa,             some 15 miles off, and 10,000
 feet above Killauea, was in activity about            a   month previous to our
 visit to the island, but limited time prevented our seeing it.                 Some
 points of curiosity may be noted before ending.
     1.  The lakes    are not at the     same level, although        quite close to
 each other.
     2.  The summit crater           of Mauna      Loa is 10,000 feet above
  Killauea, and frequently       in  violent eruption, while Killauea is com

     3.  The outer crater of Killauea         appeared    to act    as a receptacle
  for the lava, which, as soon        as it arrived at   a  sufficient height, and
  got   the  assistance of an        earthquake, broke through below and
  covered the country, sometimes running in               a broad    stream    for 25
  miles, and leaving an indication of the level which it had reached
  in form of   a new     ridge within the lip of the outer crater.
     4.  The necessity of      an earthquake to enable it to break through
  is shown by the great difference of heights of the lava even within
  short distances.

    (a) On a Possible Influence of Magnetism on the Absorption
                  of Light, and some correlated subjects.
    Professor G. Forbes' paper, read at           a late meeting of the Society,
and some remarks made upon it by Professor                    Clerk-Maxwell, have
once more recalled to me an experiment which                   I  tried for the first
time rather more than twenty years ago, in Queen's College, Belfast.
I  have  since that time tried it again and again, whenever                     I suc
ceeded    in getting      improved diamagnetics, a more               powerful    field
of magnetic force, or a more powerful spectroscope.                      Hitherto it
has led to no result, but        it cannot yet      be said to have      been   fairly
tried.    I mention it now because            I  may thus possibly be enabled
to get a medium thoroughly             suitable for   a   proper trial.
   The idea is     briefly this, — The explanation of Faraday's rotation
of the plane of polarization of light by a transparent diamagnetic
requires,   as  shown by Thomson, molecular rotation of the lumini-
ferous   medium.        The plane polarized ray            is broken up, while       in
the medium, into its circularly-polarized             components, one of which
rotates with the ether so as to have its period accelerated,                the other
against it in    a retarded    period.     Now, suppose        the   medium to ab
sorb one definite wave-length only, then — if the absorption                   is not
interfered with by the magnetic action — the portion absorbed                        in
one ray    will  be of a shorter, in the other of a longer, period than               if
there had been no magnetic force            ;   and thus, what was       originally    a
single dark absorption line might become                  a  double line, the com
ponents being less dark than the single one.
    Other allied forms of experiment connected with                     this subject
were discussed.
(b) On a Mechanism           for Integrating the General Linear Differen
                      tial Equation of the Second Order.
   I am   anxious to explain to the Society             a   kinematical    device for
the   solution    of  the   General Linear         Differential Equation of the
Second Order before        I  become acquainted with the principle of the
integrating     machine which,       I  understand, was described        last Thurs
day by our President to the Royal Society.

   My arrangement consists of a combination of two equal modifica
tions of Ammsler's Planimeter, ABC, ABC, the wheels of which
are attached at the joints B, B'. C slides along AC, and the length
of AC can be altered by turning either of the heads 1), D', of coaxal
screws of equal pitch.    Now, if we suppose D connected with the
wheel at B, and D' with that at B', by means of universal flexure
joints (Thomson & Tait's "Natural Philosophy," § 109), it is obvious
that the length of AC will depend upon its angular position, and
upon the motion of           C   along AC.
     Let AB=AB=a, BC                  B'C'=6, AC = r, AC' = r1, £ ABC --=t/,,

an angle dO, the motion of B perpendicular                           to   CB       is the   same as
if it    had rotated about 0, where                 / AOB is a right angle.                  Hence,

    (c) The    Electric Conductivity of Nickel.        By C. Michie Smith
                         and  J. Gordon MacGregor.
    Pure nickel foil, obtained in Paris by Dr Andrews, was cut into
a  spiral about 20 inches long, and it was on this spiral that all the
following experiments were made.          During    the month of November
 1875   a  large number of experiments were made as to its thermo
electric properties, and these were found to be almost identical with
that of the specimen from observations on which the line was laid
down on the " thermo-electric diagram."            (Trans. R.S.E., 1872-3.)
 This line, it will be remembered, is a peculiar one, and is very similar
 to that  of iron, with this difference, that    the peculiar changes take
place at much lower temperatures in nickel            than in iron.     Having
thus finally determined the position of the line in the thermo-electric
diagram, we were anxious to discover whether, like iron, it exhibited
other peculiarities about the same temperature, and for this end we
made the following      experiments on the electric conductivity         at  dif
ferent temperatures.       The method of observation was as follows           : —
    To  the   two ends    of the nickel   spiral stout copper wires were
soldered,    and the whole was carefully fastened        together in such         a
way that no two coils of the spiral could touch each              other.    Side
by side with this nickel      spiral was placed     a  similar spiral of soft
platinum wire of approximately equal resistance.                This platinum
was part of a wire the electric conductivity of which had been
formerly carefully tested, and had been found           to obey   very strictly
the law of being proportional       to the absolute temperature.         These
spirals were then placed      in a large pot of oil, care being taken that
they hung quite free from the sides of the pot, and the ends of the
thick copper wires were led to the pools of a mercury commutator,
so  arranged that either the nickel or platinum could             be  made      to
form one of the arms of     a Wheatstone's bridge, in connection with            a
very    delicate   Thomson's     dead-beat    mirror     galvanometer.        In
making the observations the oil was heated            by  a   powerful Bunsen
burner, and constantly stirred.        By this  means       it was found    per
fectly practicable to keep the oil sensibly at the same temperature
during the time necessary to find the resistance of the two wires

                      of Edinburgh,         Session 187o 76.                     121
by the ordinary balance method.                 That   no errors were caused       by
thermo-electric        effects   was proved      repeatedly during the experi
ments by completing the circuit without the galvanic cell, when no
current was shown          on the galvanometer.         The results obtained for
the    nickel entirely     agreed with what had been anticipated from the
thermo-electric properties. For, when the conductivity is plotted
in terms of the temperature, the curve shows a sudden change in
direction at a temperature of about 149° C. (300° F.), indicating
that there is at that point a sudden change in the rate of alteration
of the conductivity with change of temperature. The curve ob
 tained for nickel      can be very well represented by two straight lines
 inclined to each other         at an angle     of about 9°, while the curve got
 for the platinum wire         is strictly   a straight line.
      That   no part of the effect was due to the conductivity                of  the
 oil was amply proved by           the  following experiment : —
      Two   pieces  of platinum foil,      each having    a surface of 2'5 sijuare
  inches, fastened       to the ends        of  copper wires,     were plunged      in
  the oil when it       was at a temperature of 550°           F., and were kept
  a quarter    of an inch apart;       the  resistance of the oil between them
  was then measured,         and was found to exceed            9  megohms, while
  the resistance on causing them to touch fell to             a   small fraction of
   an ohm.
      After   a series   of experiments        had  been   made with the     nickel,
   the whole spiral was heated to a white heat in the flame of               a Bun-
   sen burner, and allowed to cool in the air            ;  another series of ex
   periments was then made on the conductivity, but no change was
   observed.
      The following      tables   contain the observations fur two of the
   experiments, side by side with the values of the conductivity, calcu
   lated on the supposition that the curves are best represented
   by straight lines — the platinum being represented by a single
   straight line, while the nickel is represented by a broken line.
   The calculated and observed values, it will be seen, agree very
   closely with each other, except where a divergence is to be ex
   pected, namely, at the intersection of the two lines (nickel).                The
   equations were taken from the lines obtained by plotting the con
   ductivity in terms of the temperature.                R is the resistance in
  thousandths of an ohm, t the temperature in degrees F. :—

 1. On the Structure        of the Body-wall in the Spionidae.               By
                             W. C. M'Intosh.
     In regard  to external form, Nerine foliosa, Sars, is generally taken
 as the type of the family,        and therefore it may be selected           for
 structural examination     in the first instance.     Anteriorly   the pointed
 snout    is completed by the intricate       interlacing   of the muscular
 fibres beneath specially thickened cuticular and hypodermic layers.
 As   soon as the body-wall assumes a rounded form, a layer          of circular
 and oblique muscular        fibres occurs beneath the        hypoderm, the
 majority having the latter (i.e., the oblique) direction.               In the
 centre of the area the oesophagus is suspended by strong muscular
 bundles (the most conspicuous of which are vertical) passing from
 the hypodermic basement-layer in the middle line superiorly to be
 attached to the oesophagal wall.        A  second series,   as  they descend
 to their insertion at the ventral surface, give lateral support to the
 tube; while a third group interlace in       a complex manner, and, with
 the blood-vessels, fill up the space between the oesophagus and the
 wall of the body.
    Toward    the posterior part of the head is found — on the dorsal
 surface — a slight hypodermic prominence, which                indicates the
 position of the central ganglia of the nervous system             ;  the latter

124                   Proceedings of the Royal Society
being quite external to all the muscular layers, and covered                                          only
by the cuticle and hypoderm.                         In     a    line with the first bristles,         the
layers have      assumed            a    more       definite appearance.                   Beneath     the
hypoderm is      a    circular muscular coat, which, however, is somewhat
irregular     in its arrangement                ;    for,       toward the dorsal region,              the
layer spreads out at each side, and the fibres mix with the oblique
muscles of that part, while only a very thin layer stretches across
the middle line of the dorsum.                         Within the former                   is a more    or
less developed       longitudinal layer — best marked                            at theventral aspect.
A long oblique muscle extends                         from        the lateral dorsal          region on
each side to the middle of the body-wall                               ;   and an important feature
is the situation of the nerve-cord in close proximity                                    to the inferior
attachment       of this muscle                 to    the hypodermic                    basement-layer.
Various       muscular fasciculi,                        attach the oesophagus to
                                                as before,
the    body-wall,       and       the    bristle-muscles and those of the lateral
appendages      have made their appearance.
  A little behind             the       foregoing           it    is       noticed that the circular
muscular layer is less continuous (though                                    strong inferiorly),      and
that the longitudinal               has been grouped by the other fibres                              into
certain definite bands, the most conspicuous being a double dorsal
and    two lateral.           The former             fibres,           indeed,    have    now assumed
considerable bulk,            a   thin circular             layer only intervening between
them    and    the hypoderm.                   The formation                  of the lateral longitu
dinal muscles, again, is interesting on account of their homological
bearings.      From         the inferior bristle-tuft,                      and from     the region on
each side of      it,   a   strong series of muscular fibres converges                            toward
the side of the oesophagus, and then splits into two bands.                                           The
outer bundle            the more powerful, and at the infero-lateral                              region
                it is
of the body           bends       somewhat sharply outward to be attached to
the wall.      The fibres thus arch over                         a     chamber on each side for
the lodgment of the ventral                         longitudinal              muscle.      In ordinary
transverse sections they are much stronger than the other, and,
moreover,      have     the nerve-cords at their insertion.                                The    second
series slants downward and inward, and                             is      chiefly composed of fibres
passing from         the     dorsal arch by the side                          of the     oesophagus     to
mingle with the circular fibres at the ventral surface.                                   A   thin layer
of longitudinal         fibres      also occurs on                 the internal          aspect   of the
ventral transverse band                 (a   part of the circular coat).

                       of Edinburgh,     Session 1875-76.                       125
    As we proceed backward, the lateral longitudinal muscles gradu
ally increase in breadth, while the great oblique bands nearly meet
in the central line inferiorly. The dorsal longitudinal fibres are
grouped in two symmetrical masses, and a strong band passes
between the       edges  of the ventral longitudinal muscles, — the median
longitudinal fibres formerly indicated lying immediately within
this layer.         The nerve-cords have now descended quite to the
ventral surface, and        have a pale intermediate area.
     As  soon as the body assumes a transversely-elongated               form, the
dorsal longitudinal         muscles   become much extended, and            are, be
 sides, intersected by the powerful vertical bands, which sweep from
 the dorsal basement-layer to the ventral           surface,  through the lateral
 longitudinal muscles (now for the most part ventral in position).
 The oblique muscle on each side is more horizontal, passing from
 the inferior bristle-bundle to the median line at the ventral surface,
  and going right through the vertical bands before insertion. The
  nerve-cords lie close together below the transverse muscle, and a
  small neural canal exists at the inner             and  upper border of each.
  There are still a few longitudinal fibres        between     the ventral attach
  ments of the oblique muscles.         The alimentary canal        shows internal
  circular    and external longitudinal     fibres.
      It   is very soon     apparent,   in proceeding        backward,     that the
  vertical muscles descending from          the dorsal to the ventral        surface
  do not interdigitate with the great longitudinal              muscles   through
   out their whole extent.        They   leave, as observed       by the lamented
   M. Claparede,      at the external border    of  each   dorsal muscle a con
   siderable mass, which bends downward, and presents in transverse
   section a distinctly pennate appearance.             A similar arrangement
   occurs at the outer and inner extremities of the ventral longitu
   dinal muscles.       Finally, the nerve-cords now          have   a  single and
   very large intermediate        neural canal.        The foregoing      condition
   continues with little modification to the tip of the          tail; though    the
   dorsal pennate process disappears,       the muscle itself being separated
   from its fellow, and considerably          diminished      in bulk, while the
   transverse fibres between        it and the hypoderm          have   greatly in
   creased.*

     In  Scolecolepis vulgaris,     Johnst., the body-wall is similarly          con
 structed.       Anteriorly   the central ganglia of the nervous system lie
 outside the muscles on the dorsum, and the cords                      rapidly   pass
 downward to the inferior attachments of the oblique muscles.                      In
 this region there is also a dense mass of longitudinal               muscles.     As
 soon as the oral aperture is completed posteriorly                  by the frilled
 hypoderm, the following arrangement occurs                : — Within the hypo-
 derm is an irregular circular coat, the most conspicuous part being
 a broad belt,      which bounds the mouth at the ventral border, and
 stretches between        the great    longitudinal   muscular masses on each
 side.     Superiorly    a  short but distinct band also appears under the
 central hypodermic elevation.              A fasciculated longitudinal      muscle
 (dorsal) lies below the latter on each side, its inferior surface being
 attached to a chitinous sinuous band, which forms a space by
 its upward curve from           a raphe.      A  somewhat     triangular interval
 occurs,     moreover,   between     the muscles in the median line.             The
 form of this chitinous          arch    is  maintained by strong transverse
 fibres, which      curve from raphe        to raphe.    At the latter, on each
 side, there is almost a rosette of muscular fibres, the chief fasciculi
 being directed downward and outward in transverse                  section.    Out
 side the foregoing dorsally          are various oblique bands, the superior
 stretching from the dorsum            downward and outward to the lateral
 hypoderm, while the lateral             pass   downward and        inward.      The
 chitinous arch gradually disappears             as the dorsal muscle becomes
 fully   developed.        Behind the preceding region the arrangement
 consists, as in    N.foliosa, of    a  double dorsal and two lateral longitu
 dinal muscles, with the vertical and oblique bands, the latter passing
 through the former near the ventral attachment                    There is also    a
 very strong transverse ventral muscle, with a series of longitudinal
 fibres   internally.      Each nerve-cord in transverse section presents
 a   distinct    though small neural canal.            The    hypoderm, as well
 as   the muscles,     seems to be more largely          developed than in N.
foliosa,    a   feature corresponding         with  the  increased     size of the
 nerves.
    After    the dorsal    muscles    have expanded into a broad          layer, the
same interlacing        with the vertical bands        occurs,    but  the pennate
 muscles    and  the arrangement of the nerve-cords     of this form, but the fore
 going observations    do not interfere with his remarks.

                      of Edinburgh, Session 1875-76.                             127
arrangement       formerly noticed does not appear in this form.                 The
two neural canals        soon increase in size, and approach           each other in
the middle line.         With    the exception of the great development of
the ventral longitudinal          muscles posteriorly,      little further change
takes place in the structure of the body-wall.
     The situation of the central ganglia in          Scolecolepis cirrata, Sars.,
corresponds       with    the preceding, and the nerve-cords follow                the
progress of the oblique muscles toward the ventral surface, each
trunk having        a  small neural canal.       When     the body wall is com
pletely formed (for instance about            \ in. from the snout), the great
size of the longitudinal muscles is conspicuous. The dorsal form a
thick superior arch, and proceed a considerable distance down the
lateral wall; while        the ventral muscles constitute two great curved
 masses in transverse         section, the inner border of each              being so
 carried upward that         a deep  ventral sulcus is formed for the nerve-
 trunks and their hypodermic external investment.                     For   the same
 reason the strong oblique muscles            are rendered nearly horizontal.
 The rounded firm nature of the alimentary canal gives little scope
 for the development of vertical fibres.
      The structure of the body-wall in Spio, and the position of the
 ganglia and nerve-trunks correspond with              the foregoing in general
 features.      The same may be said of the rarer Prionospio,                   which
 has two neural canals inferiorly.
      In Polydora ciliata, Johnst., the body-wall anteriorly               is charac
 terised by the great development and bifid nature of the median
  ridge, which is flanked on each side by a prominent process of the
  hypoderm.        In transverse section, the snout            a  little behind    the
  tip   presents,  on   each   side  of the dorsal process, a large rounded
  lobe, which       projects    downward to the oral            aperture.      Exter
  nally, the lobe is composed of a thick layer of hypoderm, having
  internally   a series   of circular fibres, which come from the transverse
  dorsal arch in the form of a loop on each side.                    The  fibres  pass
  downward within the hypoderm, curve inward ventrally, and then
  proceed upward over the oesophagus to the point               of commencement.
   A well-marked      series  of longitudinal    fibres lines the outer division
   of the loop, and afterwards merges into the ventral longitudinal
   muscle of the side. The dorsal arch of transverse fibres cuts off
   the hypodermic process,         containing   the nerve-ganglia,        and in the

 128               Proceedings        of the Royal      Society
 cavity which forms therein is superiorly a small group of longitu
 dinal fibres.
    Behind the foregoing a transverse dorsal              layer is found beneath
the central and now solid hypodermic process, next the dorsal lon
 gitudinal   muscles (the fasciculi of which, in the middle line, are
 directed downward and outward, while the outer are directed down
 ward and    inward);      then   a kind of X shaped         process occurs    in  the
 centre,  the legs of the X being prolonged horizontally,               so that the
 whole resembles     a   figure of 00, the two spaces containing muscular
 fasciculi.    The lateral and oblique muscles are largely developed,
 the latter    having     the nerve-cord on each          side below its ventral
 attachment.
    The most interesting point in this form, perhaps, is the structure
of the fifth      body-segment,        which     bears   the remarkable        hooks
characteristic of the genus,           besides    peculiar bristles with       spear-
shaped     heads,   and     a minute      fascicle of the ordinary        structure.
 Immediately     in front of the hooks,         the body in transverse section
shows externally       a  circular   coat, which is thin at some parts, but
greatly developed at others.              Dorsally    a very powerful       series of
fibres spread outward from the middle line on each side — some                     be
coming continuous with the circular coat, others passing obliquely
outward and downward to the superior bristle-bundle.                      Inferiorly
a  strong transverse band lies over the nerve-trunks, and forms an
external    investment       to the    ventral    longitudinal     muscles.      The
oblique muscle comes from the lower bristle-bundle, and joins the
former over the nerve-trunk, after piercing the vertical bands.
The superior longitudinal         muscle forms a great mass on each side,
and it interdigitates        with the fibres of the vertical muscle.             The
latter is greatly developed,         especially at its inner border,        next the
oesophagus.      The     same (vertical)     fibres pierce the ventral      longitu
dinal muscle in the compartment formed for it by the circular and
oblique bands.        The size of the ventral is less than that of the
dorsal longitudinal       muscles.     A somewhat strong group of longitu
dinal fibres lies within       the ventral transverse band.          Finally, each
fascicle of the ordinary           bristles has     a v shaped     series   of fibres
extending from the base of the tuft to the lateral wall, and inter-
digitating with     those from the transverse and other muscles                of the
region.

                     of Edinburgh, Session 1875-76.                            129
   As soon     as the powerful       hooks of the fifth segment appear, the
entire area — from the alimentary canal to the body wall — is occu
pied by their muscular apparatus.             This consists of a dense series
of fibres,    which slant from the         matrix of the bristles superiorly
upward     and outward to decussate with the fibres at the upper and
outer angle of the body-wall.           A still stronger series of fibres occur
in the inferior division ; the inner are nearly vertical, the rest
incline downward and outward. It would appear, therefore, that
this powerful muscular mass chiefly acts on the hooks, so as to
bring their curved points against the wall of the tube or tunnel.
The strong inferior fibres likewise gain additional purchase by
passing through       the    ventral longitudinal       layer to be attached to
the basement-tissue of the hypoderm.                In this region the nerve-
cords form two almond-shaped bodies              in transverse section in the
 ventral hypoderm,        and they are separated      by   a distinct interval.
    Posteriorly the nerve-cords still remain separate, and a large
 neural canal lies between them. A well-marked pennate process of
 the ventral    longitudinal     muscle occurs     at its inner (median) edge.
     The foregoing       forms,   in conclusion,      were   compared    with the
 structure    of Mcea     mirabilis, Johnst., an aberrant member of the
 Spionidae.
         2. Note on       Circular Crystals.         By E. W. Dallas.
    At long intervals notices of circular crystals          have appeared    before
 this Society.     In  1853     Sir David Brewster         read  a paper    on the
 subject, which followed one by          Mr Fox Talbot in       1836, and which
 again had been preceded by one from Sir David Brewster about twenty
 years before.     It   is not easy to account         for these long intervals,
 unless they may be attributed             to  difficulty    and uncertainty      in
 manipulation, for except in very few instances the crystals observed
 by Sir David Brewster are of       m icroscopic size, and, he remarks, require
 the perfection of optical appliances for their observation,            and natu
 rally so when crystals of the 200th of an inch in diameter             are looked
 upon as of respectable       size.
    Some time ago, being occupied with the subject,               I found   that by
 impeding crystallisation        by means     of gum arabic, circular crystals
 were formed of a greater size.*           This took place with certain       salts,
         * Perfect crystals were exhibited up to two inches in diameter.

   130              Proceedings      of the lioi/al      Society
  but not with all that were tried.          Among the successful instances
  may   be  mentioned sulphate of copper, binacetate of lead, muriate
  of morphia, and other similar salts, which afford beautiful crystals,
  and   are   very easily manipulated.         The method of proceeding           is
  similar   in all;  for instance, to a solution of sulphate of copper,
  let gum arabic or common dextrine be slowly added until it pours
  oily, then tried, and more gum or more salt added until the result
  is satisfactory.   No   precise  general rule can be given, as each salt
  will  be  found different in     the    quantity      of  gum   required.     The
 solution is then to be spread thinly over a plate of glass, and dried
 rapidly before a clear fire, or,     if the plate     is small, it may be dried
 over a gas-burner.       Upon cooling, the plate,         if left to itself,  soon
 shows numerous small specks, which             will gradually    develope   them
 selves into circular crystals.       The process is hastened         and a better
 result obtained by breathing on the plate, when, after             a  short time,
 they may     be observed   to start out very beautifully.         These crystals
 while growing are extremely sensitive, any variation in the moisture
 applied for their formation resulting in the production of rings.
     The growth of the crystals once              begun is extremely regular.
 When the centre is of inappreciable size they are circular, and they
 proceed onwards in that form            until   stopped     by other crystals, or
 until   the whole vacant space         is occupied      by them.     Should    the
 origin have a definite shape, then that is carried on by the crystals
 arranging themselves always perpendicularly               to the outline  of that
 origin,   while, should it be      a   straight    line, they form beautiful
 fringes perpendicular to the line, and terminate at each extremity
 in semicircles.
     The centres round which the crystals arrange themselves maybe
 either some foreign      body in the      film, or be determined by some
molecular arrangement of the salt at            a  particular point in the film.
They seem to originate spontaneously, and subject to no apparent
rule, for foreign particles, and even minute crystals, will not always
determine centres     ; in fact a film may be full of little crystals of the
salt, and to very few of them can the circular arrangement be traced.
    The crystals present themselves under two aspects                  in all the
salts that     I have   examined,— a true and an abnormal form.                   I
designate the true form      as that in which the crystallisation        proceeds
by the formation      of spicular crystals radiating from           a  centre and

                       o/ Edinburgh, Session 1875-76.                                131
in optical contact, while in the other many different forms may be
observed, in which the component crystals are more or less of a
laminate structure, often presenting                most   beautiful       appearances.
I    have made this distinction,        having observed        that in some cases
at least    the true crystals are permanent, while the laminate are not
sounder like conditions, but change into the true form by time, or
may become altogether disintegrated in                 a damp atmosphere into            a
confused       mass, having      few optical properties.          The crystals       also
possess distinctive       optical properties.
      The production of either of         these    classes   of crystals appears to
 depend on two conditions, namely, on the thickness of the film, and
 on the amount of moisture applied in their production,                         — a thin
 film and      a moderate      supply of watery vapour inducing                 the true
  form, while a thick film and an increased quantity so alter the
 structure that        at last, although      the    crystallisation       may proceed
 from a centre, the circular character is entirely lost.
      Spherical crystallisation,     to which the circular is to be referred,           is
  very frequent in mineral substances.            It may   be seen also      in the well-
  known experiment of          the  rapid crystallisation        of  a  supersaturated
  solution of acetate of        soda, by the introduction         of    a  centre round
  which    the salt forms a spherical       mass,     and   the surface, when the
  action has ended, presents all the appearance               of  a  circular crystal.
      However difficult it may       be to   account for the origin of crystals,
  their growth in a circular form, when once the centre                   is determined
  in a film, is very obvious in those cases where they                    are produced.
   In  the preparation      of the film, not only is the superfluous solvent
   rapidly   evaporated     by heat, but a considerable part           of   the water of
   crystallisation    is also driven off, and there is left on the glass plate
   a film    of an amorphous substance,              which,    either by attracting
   moisture spontaneously from the atmosphere, or by having it added,
   allows the salt, whatever it may be, to resume its crystalline form.
   That this    is the case may be seen from the fact that the crystallisa
   tion will take place, and that in        a  circular form,     if   the drying    of   a
   plate is stopped just at that point when there is sufficient water
   left to enable the crystals        to form when the plate is cooled.                In
   this case their formation is       a repetition of the acetate            of soda ex
   periment already alluded to.          A plate may sometimes              also be dried
    and crystallised,    and on being again exposed             to heat the crystals

132                   Proceedings     of the Itoyal Society
will   disappear,    and the plate may be re-crystallised, but not so              well
as at first, and      not from the same centres.            This   is the case     with
the binacetate of lead.
     There is one remarkable form of these crystals which is of fre
quent occurrence, and which Sir D. Brewster seems to have observed
only in mannite.            The form looks very extraordinary,              a  properly
prepared       plate   presenting the appearance          of being covered         with
paraboloids.         These are simply circular crystals which have been
 formed     in the film while the general crystallisation            has proceeded
 from one side, and is caused by the crystals overtaking one another
 in their onward progress in one direction.                Taking this case in its
 simplest     form   by supposing equal     rates  of crystallisation proceeding
 from the edge of a plate and from a centre near the edge, their line
 of contact will necessarily be           a   parabola,     for it is evident the
 edge is a directrix         and the centre the focus        of such    a   figure, but
 this will very seldom occur, since the growths are not only generally
 unequal, but also vary in themselves.
     The question        may be put whether gum arabic is the substance
 best suited      for these experiments.          I  have    not tried many, and
 with those that        I have   experimented upon         the results were not so
 satisfactory.       That    other agents     may be employed,          according to
  the salts or other substances       to be treated,     is certain   ; for example,
  collodion,    as may be seen     in  a coated     photographic plate that has
  been allowed to dry after excitation in the nitrate of silver bath,
  when circular crystals of iodo-nitrate            of silver are often produced.
  This    salt, be it observed, although         produced     through the agency
  of water, being at once decomposed             by that element.
      Having confined        my observations mainly to        a very small number
  of salts, it would     be  premature to offer any general conclusion            on the
  structure of their circular crystals or on their optical properties; be
  sides, from the great interest Professor         Tait  has shown in the subject,
  I am   in great hopes that he may        be  induced to make some investiga
  tion in it.     I  shall only mention one point that          I   have observed in
  the effect     of some crystals on the black cross, something in their
  structure producing         a more  or less spiral arrangement of the arms
   in a horizontal direction, while on one occasion              a  vertical arrange
   ment was observed, in which the arms                seemed      to be raised      one
   above the other like four quadrant steps.              This  effect    I   have only

seen once in a crystal              of sulphate of magnesia, and have not                  been
able to reproduce anything of the kind, but the crystallisation                              of
that salt     is so varied and irregular                     that many things        may pass
unobserved.
     The only other point             I shall   lay before the Society        is,   that
                                                                                       I   have
succeeded in producing               a   crystallisation      very similar to that     of frost-
pictures      on   a   window pane, and              I    hope to be able to make the
imitation      more perfect.              For this        purpose   I   have employed the
sulphate of copper and               magnesia, — salt that crystallises under
                                                         a                                  the
rhombohedral system, the                  same with that of ice.          This salt crystal
lises in the films from             centres     in   a   most remarkable manner in four
different     modes, viz., the true circular, the laminate,                   a   branched or
dendritic form,         and        another that      I    hardly know how to designate,
unless   it   may      be   called the ostrich plume form.              All   these different
forms may be observed on the plates, either simply or in combina
tion, and produce most varied and singularly beautiful effects.

1.  The Annual Periods of Thunder (with Lightning), Light
   ning (only), Hail, and Snow, at Oxford. By Mr Buchan.
   During the twenty-one years ending 1873, the maximum period
of thunder with or without lightning, at Oxford, extended from
about 9th April to the end of October,       the middle of the period
being the first week       of July  ; the three highest       days taken
consecutively    being   those immediately     preceding    the summer
solstice.   During the   five months from November to March,         only
thirteen cases had occurred during the period.        Lightning,   on the
other hand, had its maximum        period from May to November, —
particularly during    August, September, and October. The maxi
mum period of hail was during the first six months of the year           ;
whereas,    during  the second    half of  the   year,  very few    cases
occurred.    The snow period extended from the middle of October
to the middle    of May, — most falling from December        to March, —
the absolutely highest month being March.
   Thus, thunder with lightning, at Oxford, closely follows the sun,
the middle of the period being only about ten days after the

summer solstice; lightning (only) has its maximum period during
that time of the year when the humidity of the air is at its
maximum;         hail is most frequent during that period              of the year
when the temperature           is rising, or when the vertical layers         of the
atmosphere       is in most unstable equilibrium;           and snow    during   the
coldest     months of the year, with this striking peculiarity,                 that
the maximum period is not in the depth of winter, but in March,
in the end of winter; immediately after which the curve abruptly
falls.
   The intimate connection of the                thunderstorm       with    summer
rainfall, and the important bearing of the whole four curves on
climatology, was referred to.
  2.   Note on the Origin of Thunderstorms.                      By Prof. Tait.
    This Note       does not refer so much to those great thunderstorms
 which extend over hundreds of miles in each direction, as to those
 small local storms          which are often      seen  of from two to five or
 six miles only in diameter.
    It  refers particularly       to those which are seen, in summer and
 autumn, to pass down             the   Tay valley.     They almost       invariably
 come     from    the    westward,    and   I  am told each is almost always
 accompanied        by a storm of similar       dimensions passing eastwards
 down     the valley of the         Forth.    So far as    I  can ascertain, they
 seem both to commence             almost abruptly somewhere in the district
 about Ben      Ledi    and Ben Lomond.
     Seen from St Andrews, which they frequently pass at a lew miles
 distance     to the northward, they usually appear to be in a state of
 rotation about a vertical axis.           It is not very easy to judge       of  the
 relative distances of the various clouds, so           as   to ascertain   the sense
 of the rotation      ;   but,  in one case which      I  observed carefully last
 autumn, the rotation appeared to be in the positive direction, — i.e.,
 opposite to that of the hands of a watch whose face is turned
 upwards.
     If  this be generally the case, and         if it should    be found that the
 direction of rotation of the companion storm in the Forth valley
 is negative,      it would      seem    that their    common       origin   may   be
  explained on the following very simple hypothesis, which has                    the

                      of Edinburgh, Session 1875-76.                           137
additional recommendation of easily accounting for certain other
singular phenomena.
    It  is known from balloon          ascents   that, in general, the atmo
sphere     is arranged in horizontal         strata of considerable depth or
thickness, alternately moist and dry, — temperature diminishing
steadily with increase of height in the moist, and remaining
nearly constant throughout the dry, strata.                These strata have
usually      horizontal    velocities, differing    (sometimes considerably)
both   in magnitude and direction.            Thus near the common bound
ary of two such strata, fluid friction will in general tend to produce
vortex motion, — the vortex columns being at first nearly horizon
tal, with their ends at the boundary, which is a surface of discon
tinuity.
     A complete investigation of the possible circumstances would
 show    four quite different cases :—
                                                                           o
     Vortex    formed   in   f        \ air,  with its ends turning    |      "1
     The half vortex-ring         thus formed tends, so far        as  it can,  to
 become semicircular.          It may thus extend downwards to the earth
  or upwards into the higher regions of the atmosphere.
     If it extend downwards nearly         to the earth, the lower portion     will
  soon be destroyed     by friction, and we shall have      a couple of vertical
  vortex columns, with their ends respectively in the surface of dis
  continuity,     and on the ground.          They will of     course   rotate  in
  opposite directions about the vertical, and their mutual influence
  will tend   to cause   them to progress        in directions   parallel to one
  another, the motion of           each  being in the      same     direction   as
  that of the rotatory motion of the side which it at the moment
  turns to the other.       This is exactly the presumed case of the little
  storms in the Tay and Forth valleys above referred to ; the south
  side of the Tay column (that turned towards the Forth), moving
  eastward about the axis, while the axis itself moves to the east.
     This theory is evidently       capable    of  at once  explaining the ap
  parently sudden occurrence         of such storms (of which waterspouts
  must be looked upon as           small    but quickly rotating examples),
  when the lower       atmosphere      has   for hours been in    a   dead calm.

  138                Proceedings of tlie Royal Society
  The disturbance has, in fact, its origin       above  the lower stratum,
  and works its way downwards into it.
     It  is also competent to explain the production of similar rotat
 ing storms in the higher regions of the atmosphere           — many miles
 above     the earth's surface — and thus to account for that by no
 means      small number of cases of so-called "summer-lightning,''
 which obviously cannot be explained by the occurrence           of an ordi
 nary thunderstorm at such a distance as to be below the specta
 tor's horizon.
    I  have already explained to the Society that a possible source       of
 at least a large part     of the electric charge of a thunder-cloud is
 the    contact-electricity of water-vapour and air. Thus while the
 precipitation of the vapour develops       heat, the water particles pre
cipitated are strongly electrified.       And the aggregation into one
of a number of equal little drops all charged to the same potential
may      increase   the potential   in any ratio whatever.        Thus the
charge on each drop in a large cloud may become so great that the
electricity     is driven entirely to the particles at its surface.    This
is supplementary to, and does not interfere with,        Sir W. Thomson's
explanation of the      process by which the vapour is condensed.
    It  is possible  that taking place   in greatly larger spaces of air,
but to a much smaller extent in each cubic foot, this sudden           pro
duction, and as sudden        scattering in all directions, of considerable
quantities of electricity, may account for some of the main pheno
mena of the Aurora.

   The objections to the       use of sealed tubes       are known to every
practical   chemist, and are a serious          drawback to their employ
ment.     The chief of these are the time expended in the manu
facture of the tubes, the amount of skill in glass-blowing re
quired, the danger experienced in opening them, and above all,
the fact that only a small quantity           of material    can be heated at
one operation.     Moreover, the same tube can seldom be used for
more than three or four experiments, as each time               it is sealed up
its neck must be drawn out, and              its length thus considerably
decreased.     These disadvantages were especially felt by me whilst
preparing    bromacetic acid,     which     was    required   in   considerable
quantities, and where      as  many    as   half  a dozen tubes of bromine
and acetic acid had to be heated before 100 grammes of the acid
could be obtained.        To obviate      these   objections   I  have   had    an
apparatus constructed, which consists of a cylinder of glass,                  the
walls of which are about half an inch thick.             Its length    is fifteen
inches, its external diameter three inches, and its capacity                about
600 cubic centimetres.         At one end it is drawn out to a               tube,
whose    aperture is only about one-sixth           of an inch     in diameter,
though its walls are    as  thick  as  the rest of the apparatus.        Origin
ally this tube was provided with      a stopcock,    but at Professor Brown's
suggestion,    I have  substituted    a glass    plate, which is ground fiat,
and accurately adapted to the top of the tube.
    In order  to keep the glass     plate pressing on the tube the whole
apparatus is placed      in a frame,       consisting   of three    brass   wires
arranged symmetrically around the cylinder, and attached by means
 of nuts, below,  to a brass ring, and above, to a brass plate, through
 which latter a screw passes, which, when turned, presses on              a brass
 plate placed on the glass cap.
     As any experiments with       such    an apparatus    would be attended

140                            Proceedings        of the Royal Society
with danger, were                   it necessary to           be in     its neighbourhood,        it
occurred to me that an automatic arrangement might be employed
to give notice that the temperature had been reached to which it
was intended to subject the digester.
     For this          purpose      I    employed     a   thermometer with a somewhat
wide tube              and     large bulb.        A platinum wire is              sealed   into the
bulb, and           touches        the mercury, whilst a brass wire passes down
the tube, and is held                    in position by       a   binding       screw.     The two
wires are connected with an electric bell, the brass wire being so
adjusted, that when                 a    particular   temperature is reached the mer
cury touches its end, and thus completes the circuit, and causes the
bell to ring.
     In order          to test the           digester, about      200     grammes of a mix
ture     of two-parts              bromine and        three of acetic acid was placed
in     it,   and       after fixing      it    in its frame, the whole apparatus                 was
immersed in an oil bath and heated                            to 150°     C,     the temperature
at which           reaction in this case takes place.                     The experiment was
made         in    a   cellar,     and   the bell placed in           a   room     some distance
off.         The    gas to heat the oil bath was led by                   a    tube from another
cellar,       so   that   it   could be regulated without going near the digester.
In     about an hour and                 a   half the bell rung,       and thereupon the gas
was      shut off;           and    on   examining        the digester next day,            it   was
found that the                 reaction had taken place,                and     that only twelve
grammes            of product had been            lost — very inconsiderable quantity.
                                                          a
     As the action of bromine                      on acetic acid         is   very sudden,      and
accompanied by the disengagement of                               a   large volume of hydro-
bromic acid, the apparatus may be considered to have undergone                                     a
very severe test, and that its efficacy for all ordinary purposes                                 is
established.
     Should the digester come into general use,                         it     will certainly save
chemists much time and labour.

1.  On the Connection between Cohesion, Elasticity, Dilatation,
          and Temperature.        By Professor George Forbes.
                                 (Abstract?)
   At various times there have       arisen supporters     of one or other of
two extreme hypothesis concerning the nature of what                we define
as force.    These are the hypothesis of "action at a distance" and
of " no action at   a distance."
   According    to the latter hypothesis, the centre        of gravity of  no
body, however large or however small, can be moved from a posi
tion of   rest, nor can   its motion   be altered   in direction or amount,
except by direct collision with another portion of matter.
   Starting from this supposition    as a basis  of argument,    and without
assuming anything further as to the manner in which the different
physical   forces  are caused    by collisions, it is possible to arrive at
some very general theorems; and from these theorems conclusions
may be drawn as the nature and connection of some of the physical
forces, which are necessarily true       if the hypothesis of    no action at
a distance be true.
   The principal result of these      theorems    is the following:  — Let   a
rod be chosen of any substance         whose   cohesion and elasticity do
not vary enormously with the temperature.              Let   a be its expan
sion, in terms of its length, when the temperature is raised               1°.
Let  /3 be the compression      of the  same rod, in terms     of its length,
when a unit weight         is supported at its summit.          Let c be the
number of these units which, when suspended               by the rod, suffice
to break it by sudden rupture.         Let  6 be  the absolute temperature
at which all these experiments are made.          Then the theory    leads us
to the conclusion that
   Only a few experiments have been made by which we can test

                          of Edinburgh, Session 1875-76.                                         143
     The engineering             problem to be solved              by the European Com
mission was the removal of the bar which obstructed                                     the   Sulina
mouth of the Danube, which, in 1856, had a varying                                        depth of
channel never exceeding 11 feet.                          The      design of Sir Charles
Hartley     —the         engineer to        the Commission — consisted in piers                      so
constructed         as to   confine the current of the river in its passage into
the    Black      Sea.      At the    date    of my last notice           the north pier had
been extended             to the length        of 4640 feet, and the south pier to
3000 feet, and a maximum depth of                       17J   feet instead of 11 feet had
been obtained.              I,   however,    suggested        in that notice, that as the
Danube must continue to bring down an enormous mass of detritus,
so   in course of time the works which had proved so successful must
be    extended; and it appears               that this has been found necessary,                     as
the south breakwater, completed in 1871, has been extended to 3457
feet    in length,       and     even with this additional length                it     is,
                                                                                         I     think,
not improbable that in the course                       of time still farther extension
may be required, for the Sulina mouth                      of   the Danube        will still dis
charge the same amount of water, bearing with                           it   the same amount
of alluvial matter, estimated                in high     floods at about 70,000 tons in
twenty-four           hours, the deposit of which at the extremity of the
piers    will still      have    a   tendency, though in deeper water, to form                       a
bar.
     The works have, however, proved most successful, and reflect the
highest credit on           Sir Charles Hartley,          by whom they were designed
and executed, and the following                   is
                                                  a       summary of the results that
have been obtained.
     The total length of piers executed                       is   8789      feet, at    a    cost   of
L.185,352, being L.21 per lineal                 foot, in an average depth of 14 feet
at low      water.       The navigable depth of the channel over the bar
has been      increased from 11 feet in 1856, to 20 feet in 1873.                                    In
1853, 2490 vessels,               of 339,457      aggregate tonnage, left the port                    ;
in 1869           there were         2881    vessels,    with      a   tonnage of 676,960.
Thus, while           the number of vessels increased                   only at the rate of
16 per       cent.,      the tonnage, due to the greater draught, had been
increased         at the rate of 50 per cent.,            a   good practical proof of the
value       of the improvements.                The number of shipwrecks                      at the
mouth of the Danube has also been greatly diminished.

the degree of      originality which they    can claim,   will, I  venture to
hope, prove useful additions to the catalogue of chemical-laboratory
 appliances.      The one is a new form        of the    precision   balance,
which pretends       to execute    exact weighings   with   a   hitherto  un-
attained degree of rapidity      ;  the other is a contrivance for main-       .
taining   a  constant pressure in a supply of gas, and thus making it
possible,    with comparative facility,     to keep,  say an air-bath,     for
 any length of time, at a constant temperature.
   The new balance differs from the instrument in its customary'

form only in two points, of which the more important is a modifi
cation of the centre of gravity "bob" arrangement, which enables
one,   at a moment's notice, to shift the centre                               of gravity of the
instrument       from       a      certain     definite        position,       I.,   to   a certain
other (higher)         position,        II.,   matters        being arranged so that                  in
passing from      I.   to   II.,    the sensibility, i.e. the deviation, correspond
ing to     an overweight            of, say 1 milligramme,                  is increased        in   an
exactly pre-determined ratio, such                       as   of 1:10, for instance.                 For
this purpose the            "bob"       is made very light,               so that the distance
through which it has to travel in order to effect the desired change
of sensibility is not too small, and, instead of to a screw as usual,
is fixed by mere friction to a vertical triangular steel rod forming
part of the needle.     The other new feature in the balance                                          is,
that the rider-principle,                besides         being discounted in              a   slightly
different    manner from the customary one,                               is    extended to the
determination of differences                   of weight up          to 100 (instead           of    10)
milligrammes.

   The arrangement                 adopted     is   represented           in the accompanying

parts, the former by notches filed into the beam, the latter by
marks; and to add, that there are two riders, one weighing centi                              p
grammes for the left arm, and another weighing                                   p   milligrammes

for the right arm, the balance being adjusted so that, when both
riders are at their zero-points, it is in equilibrium, and p being
chosen      so, that, supposing the large rider to                      be  shifted  to the
n mark, and the small one to the m mark, this virtually amounts
to the     addition of l0n +         wi   milligrammes            to   the charge in       the
right pan.
    There is no need of my explaining how the balance is meant to
be used;      I  will rather avail myself of this opportunity for drawing
the attention of readers interested in the subject to a few inferences
from the theory of the balance, which, obvious as they are, have
hitherto not been sufficiently appreciated                     by either the authors of
our physical handbooks or by practical balance-makers.
    I. Given       a balance      in which everything is constant except the
distance      s  of the centre of gravity of the empty instrument from
 the axis of rotation, and             it  is easily shown that (for a constant
charge) the deviation a of the needle for a given over-weight A, and
 consequently the           "sensibility"        a   -     — , is the     greater the     less
 s.    This, of     course,    is duly       stated    by all authors; but what is
 always forgotten to         be   pointed out are two things, viz. — 1st, That
 the    "sensibility"      has nothing         to do with the inherent precision of
 the instrument        ;  and   2dly,     That     supposing the sensibility to be
 increased,      all the other good qualities of the balance get less; we
 diminish       the rate    of     vibration (this rate            being proportional        to
 fj    — );   we    diminish      the range        of differences of weight deter
 minable by the method               of vibration        ;  we     diminish     the relative
 constancy (in opposition to variations in the charge) of the
  sensibility and the time of vibration.                    Considering now, —
     II.   The case of      a balance to be constructed,             the arm-length     I and
 weight w of the empty beam                     also     become       variables, related to
 each     other, according to some equation                      like   w = const.    I, and
 (assuming each of the pans to bear                  a  certain medium charge p) we
 have
                        t                  ,—          -
                                                  i

 i.e.,   by diminishing          I we can        increase       the sensibility     without
 diminishing        the rate of vibration           (or vice versa); but the other

disadvantages mentioned under            I.  must be taken into the bargain,
and, besides, the inherent precision of the balance gets less.*                  To
pass to an example       : What    we gain by substituting          a 7-inch for a
14   inch   beam    is that, for the most convenient           t,  the sensibility
becomes     2 to 4  times greater; but this advantage             is secured with
out expense in good qualities            by placing       before    the graduated
limb    a lens magnifying       the excursions of the needle into 2 to 4
times their natural size.        This   is the theory of the " short beams,"
which have lately      come so much into fashion.
    To   come    back to my own balance,          I  must not forget to thank
Messrs Becker Sons of Rotterdam                for the readiness       with which
they have,       at  their own    risk, tried to realise my ideas             in an
actual instrument, which, by the way, is now being exhibited at
 South Kensington.         To  increase    the usefulness of the instrument,
 I  have caused     Messrs Becker to add to it          a glass    plunger, which
 is adjusted so that it displaces exactly 10 grammes                   of water at
 15°, and     which consequently enables          one with great rapidity         to
 determine     the specific gravities        of   liquids   by the      method of
 immersion.
    To   pass now to the      new gas-governor,         its most essential      part
 consists of a mercury-manometer (fig. 2), of which one limb, A, is
                                      Fig.  2.
 about   20 mms. wide, and stands vertical;            while the other, C, is of
 the width    of  a thermometer tube, and is placed horizontally.

   The empty part of the wider limb communicates, through F,
with the gas-supply, through              G with the gas-lamp serving        to
heat    the  air-bath   ;  and    the   quantity of mercury is adjusted      so
that, when the gas is at the lowest pressure which, in the course
of   the   experiment,     it is likely to     ^assume,  the mercurial index
in C occupies a certain convenient position a.
    The manometer is connected with             a constant battery (the circuit
of which includes an electro-magnetic arrangement for opening or
shutting the gas-tap), in such a manner that, as soon as, through
an increase    of pressure     in E, the index in C travels ever so little
towards the right of a, the current is closed, and the gas cut off.

    I may say     it is a year or two since       I first tried the plan.
    It  consists    in first filling the outer glass cell one-third or one-
half with fine silver       sand,   then pushing a ring of glass (which              I
cut    from    a   common     ale pint-buttle with a hot soldering bolt)
down an inch or so into the sand.              The zinc element forms         a  ring
round the glass, and the copper lies as              a  plate on the sand within
the glass.      Its superiority      to the gravity      batteries, and to those,
such as Sir William Thomson's, where the sand forms                      a  dividing
layer between the copper with its sulphate below and the zinc with
its liquid above, will be obvious.          I did   not find the cupric sulphate
solution to diffuse       into the zinc division.         It so readily admits of
inspection that it would be infinitely preferable to the Meidinger
and other plans.

     Forms of Palaeozoic Corals. By H. Alleyne Nicholson,
     M.D., D.Sc., P.R.S.E., Professor of Natural History in the
     University of St Andrews, and James Thomson, F.G.S.
                                      (A bslract).
     In  this communication        the authors gave descriptions of several
 new    or imperfectly understood forms of Palaeozoic                corals.    After
 giving    a general account of the method             of investigation employed
 by them, the genus Heliophyllum,              Hall,    was   discussed  at length.
 The external        structure of this genus is very peculiar, and it was
 shown that the genus            is not by any means as nearly related to
 Cyathophyllum         as has been      generally believed.        The new genus
 Crepidophyllum was proposed             for a group of forms possessing           the
 extraordinary and characteristic endothecal dissepiments of                  Helio
phyllum, but with the remarkable character that the central tabu
 late area of the corallum is shut in by              a  well-developed accessory
 wall    or  inner mural        investment.         Sometimes      this   secondary
 investment constitutes          a complete circular         sheath to the central
 tabulate area,       and in this case        all   the primary      septa   become

150                  Proceedings      of the Royal Society
directly connected with the outer surface of the cylindrical tube
thus formed.         More commonly, the secondary           investment is open
all down      one side, and     becomes directly continuous           with two     of
the   primary septa, thus constituting            a horse-shoe     shaped     space,
formed     by the central tabulate area together with a wide fossula
containing       three   short septa.     It  was shown      that the fine coral
described     by Mr Billings under the name of Diphyphyllum               Archiaci
was    truly    a   Crepidophyllum.       It was further shown that two
different forms, of very similar aspect, had been included by one
of the authors under the name               of Heliophyllum       sub-ccespitosum.
One of these forms, the typical one, is a Crepidophyllum, and                    will
stand as G. sub-ccespitosum.          The other    is a Heliophyllum,      and   the
authors described this under the name of             H.  elegantulum.
   The name         of Thysanophyllum        was    proposed     for a genus of
festi'Eeiform     corals from     the   Carboniferous      rocks     of Scotland.
This    genus     is related   to Lonsdaleia     in the general       form of the
corallum, in the presence of an exterior vesicular zone of large-
sized    cells, and in the possession         of  septa, which      have   no con
nection with the outer wall.             It  differs from     Lonsdaleia,      how
ever, in the      fact that the    columella, so conspicuous in the latter
genus,    is wholly      wanting, and the central area of the visceral
chamber is occupied by strong remote,               transverse    tabulae.      Two
species of the genus were described,           under the names of Thysano
phyllum orientale and        T. minus.
   Finally,     the   genus   Linditromia      was    proposed    for a group of
small corals, in which the corallum is simple and conical, with an
extremely deep calice.          The septa     are   well developed, and meet
in the     centre    of the visceral chamber,        where   they coalesce to a
greater    or less extent, and form a strong twisted pseudo-columella,
which projects into the floor of the calice, and occupies                   a  large
portion of the entire visceral chamber.             There are no tabulae, but
the    septa   are furnished      with   more    or   less  strongly     developed
dissepiments, which, however,          are remote,     and  do not give rise to
any vesicular        zone.    The   genus    may, perhaps, be regarded             as
belonging to the Aporosa.          The species     L. columnaris     was described
from the Devonian rocks of North America, and                  it was mentioned
that the authors were in possession of other forms of the genus,
still undescribed,      from the Carboniferous rocks        of Scotland.

      Is  the Gaelic Ossian a Translation from the English                 ?
                           By Professor Blackie.
     The recent revival by   a distinguished    Celtic scholar of the theory
 of Laing that Macpherson's Gaelic Ossian is a translation from the
 English, affords an opportunity of examining that question in a
 more strictly philological fashion than it has hitherto had the
 fortune to enjoy.     Parts of the question were no doubt touched by
 Mackenzie in the Report of the Highland Society, published in
 1805 by Graham in his dissertation on the authenticity             of Ossian,
 by Dr Clerk of Kilmalie,          the distinguished     author of the new
 version of Ossian in the late splendid           edition   published   at the
 expense of the Marquis of Bute         ; but systematically grappled with
 the question has never been.         Having recently      gone   through the
 whole of the originals,       I  have    made   careful notes    of whatever
 might tend to settle this question, and have come to the conclusion,
 in the face of the statement of Mr Campbell — whose authority, no
 doubt, is one of the highest on the subject, that the Gaelic                 is
 unquestionably     the original.      The   tests by which     a  translator's
 hand seems clearly       discoverable are the      following   five: — (1)  In
 the English version, awkward, forced, and unidiomatic expressions
  frequently occur, which can be clearly traced to the influence of            a
  Gaelic original.    (2)  In  all poems of any antiquity       handed down

errors in transcription, confused connection, and other causes.                                     In
such cases it is a common practice with translators to skip the                                 diffi
culty, gloss over the matter with some decent commonplace,                                       and

frequent in Macpherson's English, and would be more so had                                        he
not indulged in such a habit of skipping generally that                        it    is   difficult
to say in certain cases decidedly that the skip was made                                  because
the writer of the English wished to shirk a difficulty. (3) It is a
common practice with translators, when they find a passage a little
obscure,     to remove       the obscurity        by some     manifest alteration                   of
the phrase, or even by interpolating                a   line, or interlarding             a     com
mentary.        This    also occurs in Macpherson.(4) It is not always
that    a   translator writes under the same vivid vision, or the same
fervid inspiration as the original poet;                and the consequence                is    that
he     will occasionally     degrade poetry into prose, and specially                         fail to
bring out that individuality of character in his word-painting which
Ruskin       has so triumphantly         insisted on in the case of the sister
art.     The instances of failure to seize the most striking features of
the original, and the substitution                of generic for specific epithets,
are frequent in Macpherson.                        Most translators vie                   — some
                                           (5)
times,      no doubt,   wisely — to the temptation of improving on                              their
originals;      and Macpherson, from             what we know of him, was                         the
last man in the world to think of resisting                        such    a    temptation.
How much of           the Gaelic, as we now have              it — that        is,   his      clean
copy of his own         originals — was        subjected   to this process           of   beauti-
fication,     as we   may call   it,   no one can now tell,         but   1     have          traced
in several instances departures from the simplicity                       of the          original
Gaelic, which can         be   explained most naturally            on the           supposition
that they proceed from           a    translator who has yielded, without                        any
just    cause, to this flattering seduction.               When the results obtained
by the detailed application of these tests are combined with the
amount of external evidence to be found in the Highland Society's
report to the effect that Macpherson                    actually   did translate from
Gaelic originals, and was seen by various parties for weeks                                      and
months employed in the work of traslation,                   a   cumulative proof was
produced that he was most anxious to see by what arguments                                        Mr

                   of Edinburgh,      Session 1875-76.                   153
Campbell could rebut.         If that gentleman, to whom Celtic litera
ture  owes so much (and who in fact is the           Wolf of the Ossianic
question), or any Galician       who thinks with him, shall succeed in
leading   a counterproof,    I can only conclude that, considering        the
scrappy and fragmentary nature of some of the materials in Mac-
pherson's hands, it might possibly have           been the  case  that the
translator filled up some of the gaps in his tale in English, with
the intention that they might       be done    into Gaelic before publica
tion by Strathmaskie, Captain Morrison, or some other of his High
 land coadjutors;    but that the English, as a whole, is a translation
from the Gaelic, and not       a translation of the best quality in many
respects,    may be accepted as one of the best ascertained        facts    in
the whole range of philological        investigation.

 1.  Notes on Dredging in Madeira, by the Rev. Robert Boog
                    Watson, B.A., F.R.S.E., F.G.S.
    The difficulties in the way of dredging at Madeira are many
 and considerable.      This has probably prevented any of this work
 having been done since the publication of Mr Macandrew's list of
 Mollusca,    presented to the British Association in 1854.     The author

154                      Proceedings             of the Royal Society
having dredged for several years at Madeira, confirms Macandrew's
generalisation of the Mediterranean                      character of the Mollusca —
excludes 12 of Macandrew's named list as having crept in by mis
take, and to the 115 remaining                       species   identified by Macandrew
as   Madeiran has added 200 to 250 more, making nearly 400 in all,
of which 80 or perhaps 100 are probably new.                                 These he hopes
soon to publish.
2.    Note on a New Fossil Foot-Print                               from       the Permian
     Sandstone of Dumfriesshire.                         By Patrick Dudgeon, Esq.,
     F.R.S.E.            (Plate      I.)
     What      appears       to be an entirely new foot-print                  has    lately   been
found in the red sandstone of this district.                        I   have    seen     many of
the foot-prints           from the various quarries in the neighbourhood,
but have not before observed this one, nor                      is   it like any figured in
Sir William Jardine's splendid work                     on the      " Ichnology of Annan-
dale."      The       foot-prints          in question were found in             a     bed about
20 feet from             the surface, at Locharbrigg's                Quarry,        three     miles
from Dumfries.               They exhibit the usual large hind and smaller
fore foot   ;    the impression of the hind foot measures                        ''5   x 2'-6, the
fore foot      2'3   x   l'-9   ;   the stride of the animal appears to have been
about 10'.           The impression of the hind foot does not interfere with
that of the fore foot, as              is   the case with      several of the foot-prints
figured in Sir William Jardine's work, the interval                             between them
being     2'
           :    the hind foot, therefore, must have been put down in the
rear of the fore            foot when the animal was walking.                        The impres
sion of the foot shows                five toes, the thumb being placed far back.
The most characteristic features                     in these foot-prints are the well-
developed        claws, and the oblique position                of the     toes, i.e., they are
placed to march                 one behind        the other.     In almost all the foot
prints I       have seen, where the toes can be made out, the middle one
appears the most prominent;                       this foot-print     is   markedly distinct
in this respect.
     As yet I        have       only been able to obtain one good specimen of
this foot-print — hind foot
                          a                  ;   the rest of the slab on which the casts
were     impressed was unfortunately                    used    for a paving stone             in   a
cottage     in the          neighbourhood.          I   got    it   lifted ;   but the rough

give the            above particulars.
     The accompanying photograph is                        a good one        of   the hind foot in
my possession, about half the size of the original.                                   The posterior
pad of the foot is not quite complete, and                        it,   together with the pads
of the         toes, are somewhat broken.
I      would propose                for these foot-prints         the    provisional         name of

3.    On the Decennial Period in the Mean Amplitude of the
     Diurnal               Oscillation        and    Disturbance           of the Magnetic
     Needle and of the Sun-spot Area.                             By    J.  A. Broun, F.R.S.
                                                [Abstract.*)
     The author, in presenting results relating                         to the decennial period
derived from observations made at Trevandrum during twenty-two
years, has sought                 a   redetermination of the mean duration of that

 156                Proceedings of the Royal Society
period, as shown by preceding magnetical observations connected
with his own.       The relation of the frequency and area of sun-spots
to the amplitude      of the diurnal movements of the magnetic needle
gives an increased     value to this investigation.
    Two very different       results have      been   obtained   ;
                                                                   —one by Dr
Lamont, showing a period of 10-4 years           ; the other, by Dr R. Wolf,
gives 11J years.       Dr Lamont's result depends on the assumption
that three periods occurred between 1787 and 1818 —an assump
tion which is opposed to the conclusions which have been deduced
from    the sun-spot, auroral, and          magnetic observations for that
interval.    Dr Wolfs result       has therefore been accepted       very gene
rally by many of the most eminent scientific men in England and
on the Continent.
    The author determines the epochs of maximum                 and   minimum
range    of the diurnal     oscillations of the magnetic needle           by the
more exact method, in which           the mean     for twelve months corre
sponding (at its middle point) to each month of the year is obtained.
Commencing with the Trevandrum observations, from the present
time, proceeding backwards to the earliest series, showing a maxi
mum, that of Cassini (Paris 1784-1788.) The maximum at this time
(1787 25) is confirmed nearly by Gilpin's observations (London,
1786-1806).       The latter do not show the minimum in 1792 and
maximum in 1797, which should satisfy Dr Lamont's assumption,
and they are considered by him, like the observations              of sun-spots
at the time, as worthless for this         investigation.     Dr Wolf, on the
other hand, finds support in both for a minimum              in 1798.
    It is concluded by the author, from an examination              of Gilpin's
observations, that      a  maximum      really happened      in 1797'7, but so
little marked     as to make   it probable that any slight corresponding
increase   of sun-spots would not       be  noticed by the single, not very
accurate,   observer    at the   time.     Evidence,    however,    of a slight
maximum is also found in Professor Loomis's investigation                for the
frequency of the aurora borealis.            As it is certain that another
maximum       occurred about 1804 to 1806,            the   author finds    that
Gilpin's observations,     which agreed with Cassini's at the commence
ment of the series,       showed    in all probability     the  true magnetic
variations afterwards.
    It results from these investigations that the mean duration of the

                    of Edinburgh, Session 1875-76.                              157
period is 10-45     years   ;  but that it appears          to undergo a variation
between 8 and       12J   years      in  an interval of 42 years.        The small
maximum of 1797-7,           if   a true result, may be         expected to repeat
itself at some    future time, a result which could not fail to aid in
the search    for the cause of these variations
    The author    shows, that according to the long period of 42 years,
a maximum should have happened                 in 1776    ; but that year Dr   Wolf
has concluded      to be one       of minimum sun-spot frequency. That
1776 was really      a year of maximum is confirmed by the observa
tions of Van Swinden, who, it is shown, appears                   to have been the
first to obtain a variation due to the decennial period, and to have
pointed out the appearance              of a law   : it is  also  confirmed by the
observations of Cotte at Montmerency.
    The ratio of     the   ranges       of the diurnal variation       in the years
when it is    a maximum          to that in the years of minimum, is com
pared for different parts of the world, and found nearly the same
in both hemispheres.           It   is also found that the law of the diurnal
variation   is the same in the year of maximum                    as in the  year of
minimum.        The author concludes that the increase of                the diurnal
variation is not due to         a  different cause from that which produces
the variation at the minimum, and that this cause acts when there
are no sun-spots in the same way                as,  though with less intensity
than, when the latter have their maximum                       frequency and area.
The magnetic variations are therefore not due to the sun-spots; the
latter appearing only when the common cause produces diurnal
variations having at least two-thirds of the maximum amplitude.
    The results derived from the sun-spot area are compared with
those from the magnetic observations. While a general agreement
is found in the decennial variations from year to year, it is evident
 that the attempt to calculate the amplitude of the diurnal varia
 tion from   the sun-spot frequency (as has been done                   by Dr Wolf)
 must give results frequently deviating widely from the truth, as
 might   be expected from the previous conclusion.
    The decennial period of disturbance of magnet ic declination at
 Trevandrum, deduced from hourly observations in the eleven years,
 1854 to 1864, is next considered.            It is found that the mean disturb
 ance at each hour of the day shows the decennial period; but that
 the range of the mean value, from the minimum to the maximum

158                 Proceedings        of the Royal Society
year, is different for each hour, while the maximum and minimum
do not happen at exactly the same time for                all hours of the     day.
Secondary maxima and minima                  are also shown,      which vary in
their epochs gradually from midnight to noon.
    No clear law appears to connect the amount of the maximum
disturbance for any hour with that of the minimum                   for the same
hour in the      11  years  ;   the ratio of the first to the second is least
for the hours near noon, and greatest for those near midnight.                    It
is found, however,        that the maximum           and minimum        mean dis
turbance in the diurnal variation            for each year, as well as in the
decennial variation       for each hour, are connected by the following
relations   : — D. being       the    maximum     and D, the minimum            dis
turbance.
                            JBm— JB0 = Constant.
    The monthly mean          disturbance at Trevandrum          in each of the
years 1854 to 1864       is compared        with the monthly mean sun-spot
areas   deduced      by Messrs De La Rue, Stewart, and Lcewy, from
Carrington's      and the Kew Observations, with the               following     re
sult :— The monthly        mean disturbance         in the years   1854-56      had
a  considerable value, and marked variations when there were few
or no sun-spots.       In  1857 to 1862 there are found several maxima
and    minima      of disturbance        and sun-spots which occur simulta
neously.      In   some cases, and        especially in June 1862, there is         a
well-marked       sun-spot area maximum            without   any corresponding
change of magnetic disturbance.                The  cause of the solar disturb
ance did not then extend its action to the earth at that time.
    The author concludes with a notice of the hypotheses                  proposed
to explain the decennial period of magnetic variations and                  of sun-
spot frequency, as well as of the cause of sun-spots.                It is pointed
out that no theory of sun-spot formation                can  be accepted which
does not explain their          non     (or very rare) appearance every 10 or
 11  years, and therefore the cause of the decennial period is bound
up with this explanation.             A planetary action which disturbs         the
equilibrium of the solar gases has been proposed               ; no other seems
to present     itself, and this the author believes will be found ulti
mately to     be  in question    ;  and though he has not himself been able
to find any satisfactory           evidence   in its   favour, yet remarkable
results have      been obtained        by Messrs     De De Rue, Stewart, and
Loewy.

   4.  On the Parallel Roads of Lochaber.                   By David Milne
                                Home,       LL.D.
                                   (A bstract.)
    The author referred to      the papers written       on the subject, begin
ning with that         by Dr Macculloch,          in the   year 1817;       and he
explained the various theories suggested.
    He intimated his adoption of the Lake theory,              and expressed     his
adherence       to the view he took in the memoir read by him in this
Society in the year       1846, that the blockages       of the lakes had      been
effected by detrital matter.
    In  support of this view, he pointed out that all over this district
of the Highlands there were immense beds of clay,                      sand,    and
gravel up to the tops of the hills, at even 2000 feet                  above    the
present level of the sea.
    These deposits      he considered       to be undeniable       proofs    of the
prevalence       of the sea over this part of the earth's surface to a
 height of 3000 feet at least.
     When the sea retired, so as        to expose to atmospheric action the
 higher parts of the country, there would be depressions in the sur
 face of the land, where lakes would be formed. These lakes would
 continue      at high levels,   till the streams issuing from them cut
 through the detritus.       In  some cases, the process of erosion          would
 be so gradual, that the lakes would subside            without producing any
 conspicuous      beach-lines   on    the   mountain    sides.    In other    cases,
 the removal of the blockages would be on               a  large scale, owing to
 the looseness of the detritus      ;  and   if these removals were separated
  from one another by a considerable interval of time, beach-lines
  of a permanent character would be formed on the sides of the
  mountains enclosing the valleys.
      The author referred    to the existence in this district of the        High
  lands, now, of several lakes at high levels, which were kept up by
  detrital blockages.      He instanced, in particular, Loch Earba, in the
  Lochaber district, at a height of about 1150 feet, which was kept
  up by such means, and on whose banks there was evidence that
  the lake had once stood 30 feet             higher than at present.          Near
  Kingussie there     was Loch    Gwynae, at a height of 1015 feet above
  the sea, on whose sides there were traces of five terraces, the highest
  of which is 132 feet above the present surface of the lake.

 160                Proceedings of       the  Royal Society
    He referred to the ample means of cutting through                  and remov
 ing detrital matter      possessed     by streams      and rivers, mentioning
 particularly    the   enormous cliffs of detritus cut through              by the
 Rivers Spean and Spey.
    He next proceeded       to discuss the theories of other geologists.
    With    regard to the    theory that the parallel         roads were formed
 by the   sea, he adduced     arguments to show, that this view was             im
 possible, inasmuch       as the    "roads" should in that          case have all
 stood at the same level;        whereas,   in the different glens, they      stood
 at different   levels.   Moreover, it had been found, that old river
 courses existed, by which the water in Glen               Gluoy flowed into    the
 water in Glen Roy, and that the water in Glen Roy flowed through
 Glen Glaster into Loch Laggan,          —a    state of things     utterly fatal  to
 the marine theory.
    With regard      to the   blockage of the lakes having been formed
 by ice, the following objections were stated           : —
    1st, The improbability that         some    of the glens      were filled with
 water,  whilst others were filled with ice, the temperature of those
 glens being all much the same, in consequence                   of nearly equal
 altitudes above the sea.
    2d,  The impossibility      of getting   a  glacier to come to the exact
spot, where the lakes stopped, to form             barriers several miles long,
so solid and permanent         in structure, as to prevent the escape of
 the water from lakes above 300 feet deep.
   The author concluded        by referring to the numerous examples in
the Lochaber district, of boulders perched              on tops   of hills, and of
rocks smoothed and striated.           These phenomena had been ascribed
by some geologists       to the action     of land-ice. But, coupling with
these high-perched boulders, the occurrence               of kaims or eskars on
the sides     of the hills (above      the    parallel roads),     and therefore
formed before the Lake         period,   the author was inclined to ascribe
these phenomena to one          agent — viz.,    a sea loaded     with ice, when
the land was submerged, and to a strong current in the sea, from
the north-west, which swept over the submerged                 land, and through
such valleys as Glen Spean and Glen Roy.                  The lakes, he referred
to the period when the land           was    rising out of the        sea.   Their
beaches were formed on the marine detritus;            — which    also for a time
dammed      back the lake waters.

    It has  been well said that the transmission of force is an "essen
tial condition in machinery."          It is no less true that directness in
transference is important;        that the fewer links in the chain bind
ing driver    and follower    together, the less likely is the machine to
be   put out of gear.     There is no question here       as to the    compara
tive values of the different         modes   of conveying       motion from a
prime mover, — rolling contact, sliding contact, wrapping connec
tors, or linkwork.      Each has its own excellencies       ;   each its special
advantages;      and one is to    be  preferred to another only according
 to the nature of the work to be done.
    I.  Watt's Parallel Motion.    — The general problem is         the   "com
 mutation of circular with rectilinear motion."           The importance of
 the question    began   to  be  felt soon after the    introduction of the
 steam -engine    ; and Watt, in 1784, patented an invention               which
 not only had the credit of being the earliest, but up to recent
 times, the most reliable and accurate        parallel motion in existence.
 This system     was a great advance       on the huge chains and         arches
 which were affixed to the working beam of the engine for the pur
 pose   of obtaining the desired motion ; and it       has proved    to be suf
 ficiently accurate for all practical purposes.          The construction      is
 simple, consisting of three bars     :  two, rotating round fixed centres,
  and connected at their other extremities to the third bar.            A point
  in this bar, either within or without the points of junction,          accord

 ing  as the centres are on opposite sides, or on one side of the con
 necting rod, moves    in a  straight line.      The simple explanation      of
 the underlying    principle is that the curvature in one direction          is
 modified by the curvature         in an opposite direction,       due to the
 motion of the other bar.         In both the original     and   the modified
 form of this three-bar motion there is a divergence from the straight
 line, which though inappreciable for small angles, becomes              some
 what more apparent for larger ones.
    The determination of the parallel point is given in the formula

                                              II.  The    Reciprocator. — About
                                          1864     M. Peaucellier           communi-
culed to the SocietePhilomathique           a paper  anent    a newly-discovered
means of producing parallel motion            ; but, at the time, little notice
was taken    of   the subject.     When Lipkin, a pupil of Tchebicheff,
rediscovered it     a few  years later, it awakened the attention of the
most eminent mathematicians of the day; and now it promises to
become a power in the field of higher analytical investigation.                     The
marvellous extension of the problem is due chiefly to the research
of Professor Sylvester, who was the first in this country to direct
attention to it.
   The fact of pure linkwork constituted                the  difference between
Peaucellier's     and   all other attempts        at parallel     motion.         These
have    been only approximate, or        if  exact, the slot has been called
into action   ;  while in the case before us the motion is entirely due
to the grouping of links around fixed centres.
   The system consists of seven links. (Fig. 5.) A cell or rhombus
MPNC is jointed at two opposite angles to two links AM and
AN, which      are called connectors.        To   one of the remaining angles
is attached   a  radial bar BP.       Of the two fixed points, A              is called
the  fulcrum; B, the pivot. The points C and P are the poles of
the  cell.   The variable distances CA and AP are called the arms
of the cell, while the difference between              the squares of        AM and
MP    is termed the modulus.

                                of Edinburgh,           Session           1875-76.                               165
     When A, the fulcrum, lies without the rhombus, the cell is called
a positive cell         ;       when    it falls within, the cell              is negative.
     The following results can easily be verified                                :   —
     (1.)    APC is         a straight line.
     (2.)    AT    .   AC is          a constant quantity             (Euclid             III.   36), N being
at every moment the centre of a circle with a radius                                               MP or NC.
This result is expressed
by        saying        that           the
curves described by                     P
and C are the inverse
of    one     another.               Now
the inverse of a circle
is     generally                another
circle.       If, then,           one of
the poles of the cell be
made to revolve in a
circle        round             B,     the
                                                                            Fig. 5.
other pole will                 describe
a circle.         There is however an exception, for when the fulcrum is
in the circumference of                      the circle described                by       P   or C, the other
pole describes              a   straight line.
     The following               is the geometrical proof:                —
     Let the positions of P                   be      pv   p2,   pv &c.,       and the corresponding
positions of C, cv c.,, c3, &c. and suppose that the initial position

straight line with                   the centres      A    and B.         Join     P      and pl   ;   C    and   cr

Therefore the triangles are equiangular (Euc. VI. 6), wherefore the
angle cfiA. = Pj^A . But P^iA, the angle in a semicircle, is a
right angle (Euc. III. 31), therefore CiCA is also a right angle.
   With any other position p2 of P, C will take up a corresponding
one    c2,   by       joining which with C                     a   right angle is formed.                       Where

equality, the position                     of the parallel                 point is      a        circle, which is
concave or convex with respect to the fulcrum, according as                                                       BP   is
greater or less than AB.   The results, as determined by methods
of analysis, show that the equation is the same for both the sym
metrical and non-symmetrical                              forms of the cell              ;    that        is,   for both

to deny any connection between                                 them.

       III.         The Gorgon Linkage.            — The parallel motion of Mr Scott
 Russell             is exact, and constitutes a two-bar motion.                       From    the fact
 that it was fitted by                          of the " Gorgon,"
                                          Mr Seaward   to the engines
 it may conveniently be called a Gorgon Linkage.      A link AB is
 bisected in C, and at this point another link CD, equal to CA or
 CB is attached. D is the centre of revolution.   If one end A of
 the link AB be guided along the axis of x, the motion of B is at
 every moment         in the axis of y from D.
           For every position C is the centre of                   a   circle ADB, and         ADB       is
 the angle in                   a semi-circle, that     is,   a   right angle.           Hence    B    de
 scribes           a   straight line.
   This system of links derives additional interest from the dis
 covery of the Peaucellier cell, as by    the motion of the parallel
                                                              it
 point can be thrown in   direction at right angles to itself that

     is,   parallel to the line joining fulcrum and pivot                       ;    and this can be
 transferred                to the line     of centres by means of the pantagraph.

 case          of the problem of Parallel Motion                  is   that produced by       a   hypo
 cycloidal movement.                        When   one circle      is   made        to revolve on the
 concave circumference                       of another circle, any point in             it   describes
 a    curve, which                 is   called the hypotrochoid         or hypocycloid.           If   the
 diameter              of   the revolving circle be equal to the radius of the circle

arm    AC,   and  in a contrary direction.     The number of teeth on HEO
is twice the number on NLF. Hence NLF makes two revolutions
round its axis, while the arm causes it to revolve round the fixed
centre-circle HEO. The axis C is rigidly connected with a wheel
X WP,      revolving on the upper surface of the plate-arm ABC, whose
circumference continually passes through A. Thus while the plate-
arm ABC makes one revolution round A in the direction of the
hands of a watch, XWPA, which is rigidly connected to the axis
C of NLP and partakes of its motion, makes two revolutions in
the opposite direction.         Thus it revolves round an imaginary
annular wheel XYZQ, whose diameter ZQ is double that of its
own ; and in virtue of hypocycloidal motion, if XWP be the
initial    position, the point  A in    the circumference of    XWPA will
move along ZQ.
     In  the annexed figure (fig. 9), the modus operandi of the machine
is   sketched.     The system is analogous to the sun and planet wheel
 invented by Watt.

     It  would be going beyond the limits of this paper            to direct
  attention   to the two modifications       of the Peaucellier  cell, which
  have been called respectively the          Quadratic-binomial   Extractor,
 and the Conicograph.         The introduction of     these into the sphere
  of  mathematical     investigation   has    given  several  indications  of
  valuable results to be obtained therefrom.          For a brief outline of
  these, we refer the reader to the pamphlet of Professor Sylvester,
  who not only was the first in this country to direct attention to
  the general problem, but also had the credit of demonstrating the

  170                Proceedings      of the Royal Society
 higher vantage ground opened to the mathematician by means of
 Peaucellier's discovery.        The extent of our own obligation to him
  is great.
     Not    less are we indebted to Professor       Kelland, whom    we have
 known both as        a  teacher and a friend.       The valuable hints and
 suggestions he has given us on this subject we are glad to take
 this opportunity of acknowledging.

    Mr David Milne Home         gave in the    Third Report of  the Society's
Boulder Committee, from which the following are extracts:               — In
November 1875, on the invitation of Sir            John Douglas of Glen-
finnart, the Convener went to visit him at that place, to have an
opportunity of examining           several remarkable boulders reported    to
the Committee as        situated in that part of Argyllshire.
    1. On the east side of Lochlong,          opposite  to Ardentinny, there
is the    farm of Peaton.         On this farm, a burn descends       from a
steepish hill which        faces the north.      A gneiss boulder lies in   a
gorge cut by the burn through rocks of clay slate.              The boulder





                      of Edinburgh, Session 1875-76.                                   171
rests on      the rocky sides of the burn, jammed in between the sides.
The boulder has some local name like "Jenny Meullen," meaning
'•
    House on a knoll." The height of the boulder above the sea is
about 226 feet.           Its distance from         the  sea-beach      is about     three-
quarters      of  a mile.     The size of the boulder is about 24                x  18 x 12
feet.      It  is most probable that the boulder was transported across
the loch from the            north   or   north-west, and        was    arrested     in its
further progress southward by the hill,                 on the north side       of which
it stands.
     Two sketches of this boulder          are given on       Plate   II.  figs.   1 and 2.
     2. Between the site of this boulder and the sea-beach                    an old sea
 margin occurs at        a  height of about 45 feet above the sea (medium
 level).      A  number of boulders lie along the line of this sea margin.
 There is       an old sea margin        on the opposite or west             side of the
 loch, at exactly the same          height — viz.,      45 feet.
      3. Close to the beach in this part of              Lochlong —i.e., about 8 or
  9  feet above     high-water      mark — at     a  place called
                                                                      " Letter," there
  lies another gneiss boulder, 12            x   8   x  8 feet.    Its long diameter
  points    N.W. by N. — viz., to Glenfinnart Valley.
      4.  Very near this boulder (about               100 yards to the north) the
  clay slate rocks have been ground down and                       smoothed.          Their
   smoothed surfaces        show numerous striae pointing N., 2° or 3° W.
   (magnetic).       The smooth surface dips towards                  the   north at an
   angle of 3° or 4°.
      5. On the    hill   above Carrick Castle, situated on Lochgoil,                 there
   is a  boulder called "Clach udelain," or the "Stone nicely balanced."
   It  is at a height of 1526 feet above the sea.                   This boulder       is of
    gneiss,  and lies on rocks       of clay   slate.     It lies on a bare rock, the
   face   of which      slopes   to   N.N.E.— i.e., towards Lochgoil.                   The
   boulder is within three or four yards of the edge of a precipitous
   rocky cliff, which goes vertically down about 500 or 600 feet.                       The
   block is of enormous size.            Unfortunately         the note taken of its
   dimensions has been lost.             This boulder, from its position, could
   not have fallen from any         hill. There is no hill near it from which
   it could have fallen.
       A sketch of this boulder       is given on      Plate   II. fig. 3.
       6. The next boulder visited         is about two miles to the eastward             of
   the last-mentioned,       and is   within   a quarter of a mile of Lochgoil,

 172                 Proceedings      of the Royal Society
 near its junction with Lochlong.            It is about 450 feet above the sea.
 It  may    be observed,      that all the rocks in this district have their
smooth faces          towards the north, their rough faces             towards    the
 south.     This boulder      has received    the name of the "Giant's Put^
ting-Stone,"        from   a  legend which       alleges that in former times
there were giants who inhabited the district on both sides of                 Loch
long, and who were in the practice of amusing themselves by throw
 ing these huge boulders across the loch.              The rock on which it rests
slopes gently N. by E.           This rock presents       a large surface,   ground
down and smoothed.           The space of rock occupied by the superimposed
boulder is only 18 inches by 12 inches.                 It  would not    be difficult
for two men with strong levers to move the boulder from its narrow
resting-place, in which case the boulder would probably roll down
the steep hillside into the loch.
    Two sketches of this boulder are given on Plate              III. figs. 4 and 5.
    7.  To  the north of      Knap Farm-house, there is a small hill, on or
very near the top of which eight or ten boulders are clustered.
They     suggest     the  idea   that this hill has arrested        or interrupted
the body, whatever that body was, which transported the boulders,
and caused them to be stranded here.
    8. There is another        hill lower down        the   valley of Knap (about
480 feet above the sea), the top of which consists of clay slate
rocks, rounded and smoothed            by some agent passing over from the
 north.     It   has   received    the popular name         of the " Pig's Back."
Several boulders lie on this ridge.            The largest rest on a very small
portion of rock.
    A sketch of this ridge of rock, with boulders               on it, is given on
Plate    III.   fig. 6.
    9.  Pulag boulder is       near the   top of a     hill  to the west of   Glen-
finnart, about 824 feet above the sea.              It is a large block of gneiss,
about 7 feet        high.    There are many other smaller boulders lying
near it.     The large boulder is almost on the edge of a precipice
which goes down at least 200 feet.               It could not     have been rolled
or pushed      to its present     position.    The levels of the district show
the    greatest    openings towards the north — a circumstance which
suggests     that the boulder came from the north.                   Moreover, its
south end rests on        a  smaller boulder, which seems to have stopped
its progress further south.

                      of Edinburgh, Session 1875-76.                               173
    A sketch of this boulder is given            on Plate   III.  fig. 7.
    10.   Along various parts of the hills in this district where their
highest ranges       are seen against the sky, and at a height               of  about
2000 feet above the sea, boulders are discernible                   from a distance,
lying    on the ridges.      It  would be very desirable to obtain particular
accounts of boulders at so high an elevation.
    11.   In  the last Report of the Committee, notice was taken of a
boulder in Ayrshire called the " Hunterston Boulder."                      Along   the
same coast, and especially on the                 property of Mr Alexander           of
Boydstone,        several   very large boulders may yet              be  seen.    One,
called the "Boydstone           Rock or Stone," is situated about two miles
north-west       of Ardrossan.       Some     chips of the boulder, sent to the
Convener        in a letter, show       that it is porphyritic.         The rocks on
this part of the coast are Old Red Sandstone. The boulder is in
length about 19 feet, and in breadth about the same. It is partly
buried in the mud of the shore.               Its highest point is 9i ftet above
the shore. It is said to contain 40 cubic yards above the shore
line.     It   is supposed      that the boulder is buried to the depth of
5 feet.      The tide at high water leaves about 3 feet of                the boulder
visible.      This boulder has inspired the poetic genius of              an Ayrshire
letter-carrier (Malcolm Kerr, post-messenger between                        Ardrossan
and West Kilbride), who, through                  Mr Weir of Kirkhall,        has sent
to the Convener the following stirring address                 :—
        To the Great  Boulder on  the shore opposite to the lands of Boydstone,
                        two miles north of Ardrossan, Ayrshire.
                      " Can'st  thou speak, old grey stone,
                                    Unto me ?
                        List thou   to the ocean's moan,
                                    I to thee  :
                        Music sweet    !   Spirits string
                        Wild ditties, as they cling
                        To the big waves which swing
                                    Around thee.
                         Stranger  ! whence    didst thou come
                                    To this shore   ?
                        Art  thou an Arctic crumb,
                                    Which of yore

  174                Proceedings        of the Royal Society
                       On some huge iceberg side
                       From thy first home did glide,
                       A wanderer on the tide,
                                  To this shore   ?
                       Alany  eyes   with wonder,

                       Looked   on thee !    What number
                                   Yet unknown,
                       Will gaze with curious eye,

                       And solve    a hidden  mystery,
                                   Old grey stone."
 Besides    the  boulder which inspired these              verses,   there   are  two
 others, also on    Mr Alexander's property — one of them,               as Mr Weir
 states,  "  even   larger than the big stone at Brigurd,               at  Hunter-
 ston."    This larger     one it was proposed          to split up for     building
 purposes     at Ardrossan    ;  but Mr Alexander           interfered, and saved
it.   There are many other boulders               along the Ayrshire sea-coast,
but none     so large as the    Boydstone boulder.          A chip of   one  of these
sent, shows that it is of gneiss, indicating a northern origin.
    12.  A   report has been received          of   a gneiss   boulder near Dun
blane, on the property of Cromlix,              belonging to the Hon. Captain
 Drummond.         The length of the boulder is stated to be 17£ feet,
its breadth (on an average) 10, its height about 5 feet.                          Its
longer axis lies in a direction south-west and north-east. At its
south end it dips into the ground at an angle of 45°.                     Its weight
above ground is estimated          at 34 tons.       Its height    above the sea is
about 450 feet.       It  is about four miles south from the Grampians.
The same reporter (Henry Wilkie,                    Ashfield Works, Dunblane)
refers to a group of four       boulders    in  the   parish of Redgorlon, at the
west end of a gravel ridge on the farm of Bertha, the property of
 Murray Graham, Esq. of Murrayshall.                   Three of these Bedgorton
boulders are within an area of 30 yards.                  They are angular; flat
on the top, and some of them             square.      They seem to be Silurian
rocks.     They are distant about twelve miles from the Grampians.
    13. Notice has been received by the Convener from Mr Robert-
son,  C.E., who     is in charge       of the Albert       New Docks at Leith,
that boulder clay was found in excavating for the docks beneath
the shore line, to the depth of about 70 feet.               The clay was full of

                     of Edinburgh, Session 1875-76.                               175
large    blocks.    Some   of  these were     of   sandstone,      weighing 10 or
12 tons, and appeared       to be of the same rock as that worked at
Granton      and  Craigleith   Quarries to the westward.              Beneath the
boulder clay, there was found what the engineers call                   a
                                                                           " running
       "
sand      lying over strata of shale and sandstone.
    Before concluding, the Committee may advert to the circumstance
that   a part of the district comprehended in this Report was many
years ago described by an eminent Scotch geologist — the late Charles
M'Laren — and with reference           to the very matters embraced            in this
report.      Mr M'Laren      read    papers   in this Society, in          the   years
1846-47, describing the boulders then existing                   on the shores       of
the Gairloch, and on the hills between               that loch and Lochlong.
Even then the destruction of boulders in that quarter had begun,
being appropriated, as Mr M'Laren states, to building                      purposes    ;
and    probably     by   this    time    they    have    all   been     annihilated.
Mr M'Laren in         these    papers     described     also   the striation and
smoothings       of the   rocks, which       he    found     from the sea-shore
up to the tops of the ridges, between the Gairloch                  and Lochlong,
at heights of about 1000 feet above the                sea.    It  is due alike to
the memory of our Associate, and             to the interests         of geological
science, to mention,       that    the boulders referred to by him,                  as
found on the Gairloch,          consisted of grey granite, of which he
counted above a hundred, one-third of them exceeding 30 tons in
weight;      as also mica slate,      which,    though      less   numerous, had
had    among them        blocks of      60 and 80       tons     in weight.         As
the rocks of the Gairloch in situ,         are of a more       recent kind — viz.
clay slate — Mr     M'Laren justly inferred that the boulders were of
northern origin.       For those of granite, he pointed to Ben Cruachan,
a mountain exceeding 3000 feet in height, situated to the                   N.N.W.,
 and distant about      thirty miles.       The mica      slate    hills  are also in
the same direction, somewhat more distant.               From his study of the
boulders and     other phenomena in this district, Mr M'Laren drew
two important conclusions.           One conclusion was, that the boulders
must have been brought to the district                from the parent moun
tains, across valleys and ranges          of hills, on ice floating on a sea
which stood from 1500 to 2000 feet above the present sea-level, and
in which    a strong current had prevailed from the             N.W.       This   con
 clusion, it will be noticed, is confirmed by the facts specified in the
    VOL. ix.                                                              2 A

176                 Proceedings       of the Royal      Society
present   Report, and also in former Reports by the Committee.                The
numerous instances given in these Reports of huge boulders shown
by their composition to be of northern rocks, clustered frequently
 on the summits or peaks of         hills, at heights of    1500 and 2000     feet
 above the    present sea-level, seem to leave no doubt regarding              the
soundness of that conclusion to which Mr M'Laren had come to
thirty   years ago.
   The other conclusion          to   which     Mr M'Laren     came, and which
 many good geologists of the present day hold, was this, that local
glaciers had at one time existed in all those valleys.                   This he
inferred from observing, that the striations on the rocks were all, as
he thought, exactly parallel with the axis of the valley, and which
 here generally runs in a direction           north-west and south-east     ;  and
also from discovering         accumulations of gravel and clay in the
form of elongated embankments — some across the valleys, others
parallel with the valleys, reminding him of the lateral and terminal
moraines of Switzerland.
   As to the soundness       of this second conclusion, or the correctness
of the observations    on which      it  was founded, the Committee give no
opinion.     None of the members of the Committee have visited the
localities, and their function          as a Committee has been        chiefly to
collect facts connected with the boulders.               But it may not    be out
of place to record the fact, that another of our Associates, the late
Robert Chambers, who had also                given much attention        to    this
branch of geological science, went to examine the districts referred
to by    Mr M'Laren,      and     expressed      doubts  regarding these last-
mentioned views.        In two      papers     read by him in this Society       in
 December 1852, Chambers states, that on the rocky ridge between
Lochlong      and   Holy Loch,      at a height of 600 feet above the sea,
the direction    of the striations was not parallel with the valley, but
" slanting   over the   hill   "
                                  and    as the striations were not merely on
                             ;
the sides of the valleys, but on the tops of the          hilly ranges  dividing
the valleys, he thought        they were more       probably due to a general
glaciation of the country than to local glaciers.             Chambers quotes
also the opinion of Sir Roderick Murchison, " that there is no
imaginable centre for the issue of glaciers of the ordinary kind down
the Gairloch."       On this point the Committee offer no opinion, and
wish only to advert to the investigations of eminent Scotch geolo

                  of Edinburgh,     Session 1875-76.                177
gists who in former days attempted a solution of these difficult ques
tions. The Committee would venture to suggest a re-examination
of the localities, as the fuller knowledge now possessed on these
subjects may possibly throw     a clearer light  on the phenomena.
   The   Committee wish only to add, that     if any geologists, whether
fellows of this Society or not, happen, in the course of their rambles
through the country, to fall in with or hear of any boulders re
markable for size, position, or composition, not yet mentioned in
the Committee's Reports, the Convener will be happy to receive a
 notice of them.
    After  some conversation, in which     Mr Ferguson of Kinmundy,
 Dr  Bryce, the Rev. T. Brown, and others took part, the Report was
 adopted, and the proceedings terminated.

    The Rev. W. Lindsay Alexander, D.D., one of the Vice-
Presidents, at the request         of the Council, gave the following
Opening Address        : —
   Gentlemen,     — The Council having appointed            me to    deliver the
address    at the   opening of this the ninety-fourth          session    of the
Royal    Society of Edinburgh,       I   have   not felt myself at liberty to
decline the appointment, though deeply conscious of my inability
to discharge adequately the duty which              has thus been     laid  upon
me.
   I  have, in the first instance,   to advert to the changes      which    have
taken   place  in the fellowship     of the Society in the course of the
past year.     During that period       the Society has lost by death nine
of its Ordinary Fellows and      three    of its Foreign Honorary Fellows.
These are by     name —
      Thomas Login, Esq., C.E., India.
      Sir George Harvey, Kt., P.R.S.A.

   Fifteen new members were elected during the past year.
                                       ....

    Following    a  practice which has grown to be a usage and                a  rule,
I  proceed to lay before       the Society brief biographical         sketches of
the   deceased    members,    so far as    I  have    been   enabled     to  gather
materials for this purpose.        I shall   take them in the order in which
they    have been enumerated       above.
    Thomas    Login,* born     at Stromness, in Orkney, in 1823, studied
engineering     at Dundee.       In  1844 he obtained an appointment in
the Public Works        Department      in India, and      was   engaged        from
1847 to 1854 in the construction            of  the Ganges Canal under the
late Sir P. T. Cautley, who has most cordially acknowledged that
to Mr Login's advice and assistance " he was greatly indebted in
designing and executing that work."
    After this period Mr Login was invalided and came to England.
In 1857 he returned to India, where he acted successively as
executive engineer of the Darjeeling and Roorkee Roads and of the
Northern Division of the Ganges Canal. In 1868 he again came
to England, returning to India in 1870 to occupy the post of offi
ciating superintending        engineer at Umballa,          where    his labours
were varied and arduous,         and a return     of his illness cut short his
useful career on 5th June 1874,         while engaged in an inspection of
the Thibet Road in the Punjaub.
    While resident    in  India Mr Login       made several communications
on engineering, among which may be mentioned his paper                      on the
 " Benefits of irrigation in India, and        on the proper construction of
 irrigating canals," for which he received a Telford Premium from
                                                  "

 and was elected a     Fellow of this Society in       1857.
    George Harvey       was a native    of St Ninians, near Stirling, where
 he was   born February     1806.     His father, a respectable tradesman
 in that city, and a man       of intelligence      and piety, trained up         his
children in the fear of God, and in a strict regard            to the claims       of

honour and duty, and sent them forth to the business of life                                     well
educated     and thoroughly imbued with upright                                and virtuous     prin
ciples.     From     an early period George showed that                             his bent     was
towards the pictorial art               ;    and his boyish efforts in that direction
proved     that he had           the natural             gifts which, under due cultiva
tion, promised to lead                 to     eminence.            In    order to obtain         this
necessary     culture he came in 1823 to Edinburgh,                             where he studied
at the     drawing        school connected with the Institution.                             His first
pictures were exhibited                     in 1826, and attracted               much attention.
In his earlier efforts           he seems           to have had          Wilkie     before    him as
his model     ;   at any rate, his subjects were selected                           from scenes      of
humble Scottish life, such as                   Wilkie delighted            to delineate.      These
Harvey reproduced              with scrupulous truthfulness, and his pictures
show a keener sense                   of the more humorous side of his subject
even than those of             Wilkie.         The       scenes     he preferred to delineate
were such as he had himself witnessed, and the features of                                     which
remained vividly impressed                     on his memory.               One of his earliest
pictures represented a village                          school during school hours, — the
respectable       master       engaged        in hearing a lesson from              a   class of boys
and girls, and           the   rest    of the pupils              employed either in working
at their slates or conning their lessons, or in weary vacuity                                 waiting
for the season of dismissal, or,                   as   their bent inclined, playing tricks
 and     working     mischief          out of the master's                 sight.       This picture
 attracted the attention of an eminent patron of art, who desired
 to purchase it      ;    but Harvey, having promised it to a friend, would
 not consent to sell             it,   even     though his friend               urged him not to
 lose the    advantage,         so important             tobeginner, of getting his pic

 ture placed in the gallery of                 a   celebrated collector.  To the village
 school Harvey resorted                 oftener than once, even                  in the more ad
 vanced stages of his career, for the subject of   picture, as his well-   a
 known pictures of " The Examination

 at this time, such as "                      "
                         The Leisure Hour," Disputing the Billet,"
 " The Small-Debt Court," and in later              his "       his  years              Curlers,"
 " Highland Funeral," his " Penny Bank," show the

 terest which the habits, pursuits, and                           manners of his countrymen
 had      for him.        As   a      religious         man, the        religious   history of his
 country could not fail powerfully                            to engage        his regards, and iu

connection with this some of the noblest efforts of his pencil were
produced;      his Covenanter pictures — The Preaching, Baptism, and

deep was his sympathy with those who in evil days had to seek
their spiritual sustenance and contend for their spiritual liberty at
the peril of their lives ; while his " Reading of the Bible in Old St
Paul's," his " Bunyan in Prison," and his "                Bunyan     selling   laces
 on Bedford Bridge," show that it was not to the religious                   history
 of his own country, or           the   struggles and sufferings of his own
 countrymen,      that his sympathies were restricted.             In  the ecclesi
 astical movements of his own time, also, he took a deep interest;
 and his " Quitting of the Manse
                                              " remains to show
                                                                     how he could
 appreciate a noble sacrifice for conscience' sake on the part of those
 with whom he himself            had    no ecclesiastical connection.         Tn the
 wider field of general historical             painting Harvey did not attempt
 the delineation of great and stirring events, but contented himself
  with depicting scenes and actions of individual life or personal
  enterprise.     As among his most powerful efforts in this wider field
  of his art may be mentioned his " Dawn revealing the New World
  to Columbus,"         his " Shakespeare before Sir Thomas Lucy," his
  " Robbers melting Plate," his " Castaway," and his " Dr Guthrie
  Preaching in the Highlands." He was fond also of painting groups
  of children,    whose      ways he had carefully          observed,   into whose
  affections and      sympathies      he    lovingly   entered,   and from whose
  mimic sports he could draw lessons which by his pencil he sought to
                                  It is                                   " Children

                                                                        "  Wise and
  blowing Bubbles in Greyfriars' Churchyard," and his
  Foolish Builders,"       to illustrate      his success  in this department of
  his art.    In his later years        he betook himself       to the painting      of
   landscapes   ;  and    here, in the judgment        of those   most qualified to
  judge,   he was at his best.            As a delineator     of Scottish    pastoral
   scenery, whether in the Lowlands or in the Highlands, he in many
  respects stands without a rival.              In portrait-painting    he was less
   successful;    still  some noble portraits, that, for instance,        of  the late
   Professor Wilson, came from his easel             ; and in several     of his his
   torical pictures      characteristic     likenesses of eminent       men     living
   at the time are introduced.
      I cannot pretend to offer          a critical  estimate of Harvey's merits

 20S                  Proceedings       of the Royal Society
 as an  artist.    Even an unskilled observer,           however,    could not fail
to be struck with the more prominent qualities of his works,                   — the
truthfulness of representation, the clearness of conception, the               power
and    precision of execution, and the freshness and thoughtfulness
by which       his pictures are characterised.            A peculiar      excellence
attaching to the productions of his pencil is derived from their high
moral character.          Of his historical paintings          each   depicts   some
scene of deep moral interest, or illustrates and enforces some great
moral or religious lesson         ;  and when he ceased         to occupy    himself
with such subjects, it was to Nature               in her serener      and grander
aspects    that he turned, or among the dwellers in quiet pastoral
regions that he sought the objects of his art.                In   scenes   of calm
natural beauty, amidst the solemn silence of the everlasting hills,
 he  delighted     to   roam, and      such   scenes    he sought     especially to
 transfer to his canvas.         They lifted up his own soul to            G-od, and
he sought by his art to make              them the means of producing the
same effect     on others.       He delighted also to depict scenes in the
common      life of    men,   scenes     which had powerfully         touched that
chord of human sympathy which so strongly vibrated in his own
soul.    With     a deep sense        of humour,      and  with    an   eye  for the
ludicrous both       in form and action, he never stooped               to cater for
the mere amusement of the public, nor did he ever use his skill
in such    a way     as  to offend     the  sensibilities   of the least refined.
 Nothing    mean, nothing      trivial, nothing fantastic,     engaged his pencil.
In all   ho did a high moral purpose           is discernible, and his works, if
they have secured         for him the reputation of a great artist, no            less
commend him         as a   great moral teacher.        This is wholly in    keeping
with his general character.             Endowed with genius and keen              sus
ceptibilities,   he was at the same         time a man      of high principle, of
a vigorous and         manly intellect, of simple and            natural tastes, of
broad sympathies, of warm             affections, and    of a kindly and genial
spirit.
    Not long after exhibiting his first pictures Harvey                  became an
Associate     of the Academy.           From     that time forward he took           a
lively interest in that Institution,           and   to his zeal and       energy it
was in no small measure             indebted for its establishment and early
success.     In  1870 he appeared as its historian in a volume in which
the origin and progress           of  the Academy are narrated, and            many

                    of Edinburgh, Session 1876-77.                            209
interesting documents connected with its history are given ; the
volume is entitled "Notes on the Early History of the Royal
Scottish Academy."         In due time he became an Academician and
a member of Council, and on the death of the late Sir            John Watson
Gordon     he succeeded     him   as   President   of the Academy.          Some
time afterwards      he received     the  honour of knighthood         from the
Queen.
    Endowed with a constitution robust and sound, Sir George Harvey
 was able up to an advanced period of life to pursue without serious
 interruption   the   work of his profession.        As  he approached         his
 seventieth year, however,      his health began to give way, and symp
 toms of a serious kind soon showed          themselves.     In   the spring of
 1874 his illness assumed     so serious a  form that his life was despaired
 of; and though      he rallied   so far as to be able    to leave     his room,
 take short drives, and receive his more intimate friends, it became
 increasingly  manifest that his work was done, and that his earthly
 career must soon reach its close.        Calmly, serenely, surrounded by
 loving friends,    and  tended    with affectionate solicitude        by those
 nearest  and dearest to him, he for several       months awaited his end.
 This   came to him on the evening           of the   22d of   January      1876,
 when he peacefully breathed his last.
    Sir George Harvey     became a     Fellow of this Society      in 1867.
    James Warbubton Beobie was born at Edinburgh                on the 19th of
  November 1826.       He was the second son of Dr James Begbie, for
 many years well known and held in much repute                as a   consulting
 physician   in this city.     Destined to follow his father's profession,
 young Begbie was carefully educated          with that view.       His   profes
 sional studies were prosecuted       at the University    and the Surgeons'
 Hall, Edinburgh, and afterwards at several of the continental
 schools, including those of Paris, Vienna, and Italy; and he had
 all along, while pursuing his studies, the advantage of his father's
 constant superintendence, instruction,        and counsel.     His   degree of
 M.D.   was taken   in 1847, and in 1852 he was elected            a  Fellow of
 the  Royal College of Physicians.           In  1855   he was appointed a
 physician   and  clinical lecturer in the Royal Infirmary; and much
 about the same time he began to lecture on the practice              of physic
 in the Extra- Academical School.        His  period of service at the     Infir

210               Proceedings     of the Royal Society
mary expired in 1865, and at this time he gave up lecturing,             as  his
private practice had    so increased    that he could no longer give the
time required for this.        For the    same    reason   he was   obliged to
resign the office of Examiner in Medicine for the Edinburgh Uni
versity, to which he had been appointed in 1869.               On relinquish
ing his connection with the Infirmary he devoted himself to private
practice   as  a physician   ;  but after the death of his father, which
took place in 1870, he found        it necessary     to retire  from ordinary
practice and devote himself to the work of a consulting physician.
In this capacity he continued to labour till the close of his life;
and in it he attained a position which has been described as almost
unique in his profession, his consulting room, on days when he was
to be seen at home, being crowded          with patients of all classes, and
his services being in request, not only in all parts of Scotland, but
frequently also in England.          For this    he was indebted, in some
degree, to the urbanity and kindliness          of his manner, in a greater
degree    to the excellent footing on which          he stood with members
of his own profession, but most of all to his undoubted skill, know
 ledge, and experience as a physician.
     In the midst of his professional        engagements,      Dr Warburton
Begbie found time to furnish several valuable contributions             to the
 literature and science of his profession.          These appeared, for     the
 most part, in the pages       of the " Edinburgh Medical Journal,"           to
 which he was for many years       a frequent contributor.       He published
 also, at an early stage in his career, a     little work, entitled "   Handy
  Book of Medical Information       and Advice.      By  a Physician."    This,
 though published      anonymously,       speedily obtained an extensive
 circulation, which was much increased          when the authorship of      the
  work became generally known.          In  the literature   of his profession
  he was deeply versed, and his extensive knowledge of the history
  of medicine enabled    him to illustrate      his own writings by appro
  priate citations from his predecessors      in the same field of inquiry
  and observation.     To his other accomplishments he added that of
  being an    excellent linguist; with the classical writers of Greece
  and Home he was familiar,        and   he was able to converse      freely  in
  several of the modern    European tongues.          As  a lecturer on medi
  cine he was distinguished by the accuracy and fulness of his know
  ledge, by the perspicuity of his style, and by the minuteness with

                       of Edinburgh,      Session 1875-76.                             211
which     he entered into the exposition           of his subject, both in its
theoretical     aspects and in its practical details;        and the same features
are discernible in the published productions of bis pen.                       When the
British Medical Association met in Edinburgh in                        the autumn of
1875 Dr Begbie was selected              to act as orator     of   a   section of that
body, and       on that occasion he delivered an address on the practice
of medicine in ancient and modern times, which displayed all                            the
excellent qualities of his manner as a lecturer and a                      writer, and
was not only well received by his professional brethren, but                           wel
comed with hearty applause by the general public.
   The incessant demands           made    upon him in the exercise of his
profession, and his unsparing devotion to the case of all who sought
his aid, his innumerable and often exhausting journeys, and the
toil, physical and mental, which he endured, began to tell upon a
constitution originally sound and healthy but not remarkably robust.
For     some years before his death he had, at intervals, suffered from
weakness in the action of the heart; and these attacks had come to
be so frequent that he found         it   necessary,   in the beginning              of the
 present year, to seek relief by retiring for           a season       from the active
duties of his profession.           With this view        he left       Edinburgh        in
 the beginning of February last, intending to proceed by easy stages
 to the south of England           and    ultimately    to   Italy.      He     had not,
 however, reached farther than to Carlisle, when the symptoms of
 his illness showed themselves in so aggravated a form that he saw
 his case had become         one    of imminent        danger.         He accordingly
 returned home.         Here, at first, he seemed to rally, but after                 a few
 days   his strength gradually sank, and though               several     of   the    most
 eminent of the medical practitioners             in the city were in constant
 attendance upon him, it soon became evident that a fatal issue could
 not    be averted.      He diedFriday the 26th of February 1876.
                                    on
His funeral took place on the following Thursday, and was attended
by some of the most distinguished members of the legal and medical
 professions, and by a large company of the citizens.
    Dr Warburton Begbie had all the qualifications of a great phy
 sician.  To natural abilities and excellent general culture he added
 profound knowledge of his profession, extensive experience in the
 practice of   great skill in the discernment of disease, and
                 it,                                            happy           a
 facility in suggesting fitting methods of treatment.                  His high moral

character also,            and     the  known conscientiousness with which            he
devoted        himself to the case of those who consulted him, tended to
inspire confidence in him on the part of the public, as well as to
encourage         his professional brethren to appeal to his advice incases
of emergency          ;   nor were there wanting that " hilaris vultus,"           that
kindly      demeanour,          and that gentle manner, which Celsus tells us
are such excellent qualities in the                " peritus medicus."*        Pleasant
looks and cheerful words                will not of themselves, it is true, effect a
cure; but every experienced physician knows how materially they
are helpful to the end he seeks to gain with his patient:                   —

    Few men have passed away more sincerely lamented than was
Dr Warburton             Begbie, as well by his professional brethren as by
the general public.                 As  a  skilled  physician, as   a man     of varied
culture, high moral character and amiable manners, as a sincere
Christian and          a  generous benefactor to the poor, he has left behind
him     a  reputation which will not soon             be  obliterated.
    Dr Begbie        became a        Fellow of this Society in     1870.
    Lewis D. B.         Gordon,}:      son of  Joseph Gordon, writer     to the Signet,
was born at         Edinburgh in 1815, and received his early education
at  the High School and University of Edinburgh.
    Having determined to follow the profession of engineering, young
Gordon was first sent to Dundee, where he had the benefit of work
ing at the bench and studying engine-fitting                 at the Dundee    Foundry.
His next introduction               to practical work was at the Thames         Tunnel,
where, by the kindness                 of Mr Brunei,     he had    an opportunity     of
seeing all the details of that unique work.                    Finally,  he completed
his studies at the Royal Mining Academy, Fribourg,                      and the   Ecole
Polytechnique            at Paris.

   I This      sketch has been contributed by D. Stevenson,       Esq., C.E.

                    of Edinburgh,     Session 1875-76.                  213
   On his return to Scotland         he commenced        practice as  a civil
engineer in Glasgow, in partnership with           Mr Lawrence Hill.
   In   1840 the Government determined to establish a professorship
of civil engineering in    the  University of Glasgow, for which Gordon
became a candidate, and so high were his recommendations                that
he received the appointment.         There can be no doubt that at so
young an age, and with the strict sense of duty which ever animated
him, Gordon felt the task of organising the new chair to be one
that called forth all his energies. No man could be more fully
alive to the importance of his new office, or knew better the large
amount of knowledge — scientific and practical — that was required
of its occupant, and his sensitive mind felt the responsibility           he
had undertaken very keenly.          But he had a spirit that was        not
easily daunted by difficulties, and in anticipation        of his appointed
work he produced the syllabus of a course             of study, embracing a
very   wide  field of engineering, under    the  following general heads: —
       The Mechanical Effect produced by Forces, and its Measure.
       Physical and Mechanical Properties of Materials.
       Results of Experiments on the Resistance of Materials.
       Friction.
       Doctrine of Mechanics.
       Animal-power     and its Recipient Machines.
       Water-power and its Recipient Machines.
       Steam-power and the Steam-engine.
    After delivering his lectures   he had     the satisfaction to find that
he had got through       the first session    with comfort to himself and
profit to his pupils.
    It may here be noticed that the skeleton syllabus of his opening
course   of lectures   was afterwards, in more matured form, published
 in 1847, under the unassuming         title of " Engineering Aphorisms
 and Memoranda,"       and ultimately,    in 1849, with further additions,
it was published, under the title of "         A Synopsis of Lectures     on
Civil Engineering      and Mechanics."
    He, however, knew that he had to make his professional character
as  an engineer, and that this was not possible were all his energies
to be   given to his professorial duties, and therefore, during the
time he occupied the chair, he invariably,            when the session   was
completed, devoted his whole time to the practice of his profession

214               Proceedings       of the Royal Society
as an  engineer, — first in conjunction       with Mr Lawrence Hill,          and
latterly with Messrs Liddell and Newall, with whom he entered
into  a second   copartnery.
   He ultimately found, as his engineering           business increased,     that
he could not    fulfil the duties of his chair        to his own satisfation,
and, in 1855, he resigned his professorship, in which              he was suc
ceeded by the late Professor Rankine.
   During the time of his first partnership he, in conjunction               with
Mr Hill, was employed in general engineering business in                    Scot
land, and reference      may, in particular, be made to the investigation
for the water supply of Glasgow in 1845, when they came to                     the
              " that
conclusion             the   nearest   adequate   supply of pure     water, that
can be brought       to Glasgow      by gravitation,    is what is afforded     by
the overflow    of Loch Katrine."        This project     was revived in 1852
by Professor Rankine        and  Mr John Thomson,         and was ultimately,
as  is well known,      successfully    carried out by Mr      J.  F. Bateman.
Among other works, Messrs Gordon and                 Hill   were  employed       in
advising the Marquis        of Breadalbane in his mining operations              at
Tyndrum,     and    in constructing       the   great    chimney    for   Messrs
Ten n ants' works at St Rollox, which was, at that                early   period,
considered   to be a work as bold as it was successful.
   But it was in connection with Messrs Liddell and Newall that
most of Gordon's engineering work was done.                Liddell and Gordon
were engineers for several         railways in England        and Wales,      and
designed and executed many iron bridges,               among which maybe
mentioned the Hereford,         the Usk, and especially the Crumlin Via
duct in South Wales, consisting of 10 spans of 150 feet, — a           structure
of marvellous lightness, and withal of requisite strength and rigidity.
Their firm was rendered famous by the introduction of wire ropes,
 which Gordon had seen in use at the mines in Germany, and                 iutro-
dnced into England       in 1840, under     a patent taken out by Gordon,
 Newall, and   Liddell.    The uses of these ropes became highly         import
ant when they were ultimately so largely employed in protecting                the
electric wires for submarine cables, — a new and large field of             work
was thus opened up for the firm, which was designated R. S Newall
and Co. of Gateshead.         The firm manufactured and laid upwards            of
4500 miles of cable in different parts of the world.             It was on    one
of his numerous voyages in connection with marine telegraphs                 that

                     of Edinburgh, Session 1875-76.                       215
he,  in 1859, had the misfortune to be shipwrecked in the Red Sea,
when he suffered exposure on a barren rock for four days, and con
tracted illness from which he never recovered.        Latterly    he suffered
from paralysis, which for many years prevented his engaging in
active business.
    In  preparing his lectures for the Glasgow professorship, Gordon
felt that   at his early age he had much knowledge to acquire,            and
 he seems to have had no difficulty in giving the result of his inves
tigations    to the Glasgow     Philosophical Society, of which     he was a
 member, and to which he communicated, between              1840 and 1844,
 many    papers.
    In  1841, in a paper
                           " On the Determination   of the Melting Points
 of Metals,"    he gave an account     of the experiments of Plattner of
Fribourg. In the same year, under the title of " Dynamometrical
 Apparatus," he detailed the investigations of M. Morin of Metz,
 and, under the " Temperature of the Earth," he          gave   an elaborate
 account    of the thermometric observations of Forbes and Herr
 Dove.     He also made communications on " The Flow of Water
 through Pipes," the " Measure of Impact by Pressure or Weight,"
 and other subjects of interest to the Society.
    Of papers     and  pamphlets, on subjects of general engineering,
 the following imperfect list may be given : —
       "Description of the Great Chimney of St Rollox          at Glasgow."
             1844.
       " On the
                   Supply of the city of Glasgow with Water from Loch
             Katrine." 1845.
       " Railway Economy, — an Exposition of the advantages of Loco
             motion by Locomotive Carriages instead of the present
             system of Steam-tugs."       1849.
       " Railway Economy, — Use of Counter-pressure           Steam   in the
            Locomotive     Engine    as a Brake.  Translated from M.       L.
            Le Chatelier, Ingenieur en Chef des Mines." 1869.
       " Exposition of a Plan for a Metropolitan Water Supply."
       "On the    most Advantageous Use of Steam."          1845.
       " Short Description     of the Plans of Captain     J.  Vetch, R.E.,
            for the Sewerage of the Metropolis."       1851.
    In 1848    he translated from the German the " Principles of the
 Mechanics     of Machinery     and Engineering," by      J.  Weisbach,     of

216                 Proceedings of        the  Royal Society
the Royal      Mining Academy, Fribourg; and as a supplement added
some original appendices "On the Strength of Materials," "Tubular
Bridges," and the
                        " Rigidity of Cordage."
    Even after being laid aside from active business he continued
to take a    lively interest in engineering,         and never failed to answer,
in carefully considered letters, whatever his friends in the profes
sion submitted for his friendly advice, which was always promptly
 and ungrudgingly       given.
    In proof of what I may call the           disinterested   interest   he took in
his profession and his professional brethren, it is pleasant to know
that the latest work in which Gordon was engaged was a labour of
 love and regard     for the memory of a professional brother.
    About the close of 1875 it occurred to             Mr James R. Napier of
Glasgow and Gordon, that          a memoir of the late Professor Rankine,
and   a  republication    of his contributions         on scientific    subjects    to
Societies and journals would be          a  task agreeable    to his friends, use
ful to his former pupils, and acceptable              to men    of   science.    His
last letter to Mr Napier on the subject                is dated    24th February
1876,   just   two months before his death.            But his    correspondence,
which had been going on three months, then ceased, and his friendly
desire — so like his nature — to give his time and strength as                one of
the editors of the works of his successor           in the chair of engineering
at Glasgow       came   to an end.       He died      at Poynters      Grove,   near
London,     on the 28th      April   1876.       He became      a   Fellow of    the
Society in 184u.
    Resignation    to the   will of God      was the    ruling principle of       the
last years of Gordon's long illness, and this gave cheerfulness                to his
daily intercourse, which was the admiration, and indeed the envy,
of  the many friends who now lament his death.
    David Bryce was       a  native of Edinburgh,          where he was born        in
1803, and where he received         his early education, principally at           the
High School.       The son of an architect he determined to follow                 his
father's profession, for which from an early age he had shown special
aptitude.      After serving     an apprenticeship        in his father's     office,
where he laid the foundation of his future eminence as a designer,
and acquired that technical        skill   by which he was distinguished, he
while yet young became assistant to            Mr Burn,     a well-known      archi

                    of Edinburgh, Session 1875-76.                                217
tect, by whom he was soon after received into partnership.                      On  Mr
Burn's removal to London in           1844,   Mr Bryce      commenced        business
for himself, and soon earned           a high   reputation in his profession.
For   a short time he was in partnership with             Mr Robert Anderson,
and a few years before his death he was joined by his nephew, Mr
John Bryce, in conjunction with whom he carried on business to the
close of his life.
    During his lengthened      career   Mr Bryce executed many important
 works, which remain to attest his ability and skill.                In style he was
cosmopolitan,     and, accordingly,       the buildings      he designed are in
 various styles of architecture.        In Edinburgh         the Life Assurance
 Company's Office, the Scottish Widows' Fund Office (originally the
 Western Bank), the Subscription             Library, the Surgical Hospital,
 the Standard Assurance Office, the Sheriff Courts, the Union Bank
 and Free St George's Church           are in the      Italian style, as are also
 the Western Bank and the Scottish Widows' Fund Office in Glas
 gow; the British Linen Company's Bank and the Clydesdale Bank,
 in Edinburgh, are in the Palladian manner; and the Fettes College,
 Edinburgh, and the Dundee Exchange,               are in French Gothic.           For
 churches     he generally    adopted      the Gothic,      rarely the      Norman,
 and still more rarely the Italian.            For   a  few public buildings he
 employed the old Scottish style, as in the iS'ew               I loyal   Infirmary,
 Edinburgh, and the Sheriff Courts,           Kirkwall; but        he reserved     this
 chiefly for private mansions.          Of   these   he erected       and altered a
 vast number throughout the country; indeed, it has been affirmed
                                "
 on good authority, that            perhaps no man in the kingdom has
 altered more mansion-houses than            Mr Bryce."*           Here, it may be
 said, his chief success was achieved, and here his peculiar                   genius
 was   chiefly   manifested.      " Many      an   inconvenient,         comfortless
 dwelling has been by him converted into one of the most comfort
 able   residences, and many a tame,            uninteresting,         commonplace
 mansion rendered a picturesque feature in the landscape."!                          Of
 the houses    of which   he was the architect        the most noteworthy are
 Cortachy House, the seat of the Enrl of               Airlie; Glen House, the
 property of Mr C. Tennent        ;  Ballinkinrain House,           the property     of
 Mr Orr-Ewing, M.P.; Hartrig House, near Jedburgh,                     the residence
 of Lord Campbell     ;  Castlemilk, near Lockerbie, the property of Mr

Swinton    ; Broadatone,    the residence of Mr   J.  Birkmyre     ;  and Wood-
croft, the residence     of Colonel Davidson.        All  these are in the    old
baronial style.      In other styles   are Panmure House        (Elizabethan):
Langton, near Dunse, the seat of Lady Elizabeth                Pringle (Eliza
bethan)  ;   Portmore, the residence of Mr Mackenzie (Elizabethan) ;
Kinnaird Castle (French); Belladrum, the property of Mr Merry,
M.P. (French) ; Easlburgh, the residence of Mr Carnegy (French) ;
and Kincaid Castle, the seat of the Earl of Southesk.                In adopting
these different styles    MrBryce    was not a mere copyist      ; he impressed
upon all his work the stamp of his own taste and genius.                   Essen
tially an artist, he had a fine perception of harmony, and he sought
always to bring his buildings into fitness for the place they had to
occupy,   and into harmony with         the  surrounding     scenery,     so as to
make them part of one great picture.             "When      he had a work on
hand where       anything    like  scope   was allowed     to his powers,       he
wrought upon it as a painter does upon his easel, recurring to it
again and again, altering proportions and rearranging the grouping
of masses,    and   in doing this he did not hesitate occasionally to
obliterate what had cost him much labour."*
   Mr Bryce     stood high in his profession, and his name           will remain,
along with those of Adam, Hamilton, and Playfair, among those
of the greatest of modern architects.           He was Grand Architect for
Scotland, a    Fellow of     the  Royal Institute of British Architects,
and a member of the Royal Scottish Academy,                as well as a    Fellow
of this Society. He was a man of varied acquirements, of high integ
rity, and of a genial disposition. Un^er a blunt manner, and some
what rough exterior, there lay in him        a kindly nature and       a generous
 heart; and, whilst his society was much sought after by his friends,
he drew to him the esteem alike of his servants and his employers.
   He died on the 7th of May last, in his seventy-fourth year.                  He
became a     Fellow of   the Royal Society in 1856.
   George     Stirling Home-Drummond           was the eldest son of the late
 Henry Home-Drummond,             Esq.    of Blair-Drummond,          and great-
 grandson of the celebrated Henry Home Lord Kames.                     His father
 was for many years member of Parliament, first, before the passing
                           * " The Builder," as above.

                       of Edinburgh,         Session 1876-77.                       219
of     the Reform     Bill, for Stirlingshire, subsequently for Perthshire;
in      which capacity he rendered          important services,       particularly    by
the      laws which he procured to         be enacted,    of which the Act for the
Regulation of Public Houses in Scotland, and that for the Small
Debts Jurisdiction in the Sheriff Courts, may be mentioned as
 specially valuable.         He   died   in 1867, and was then succeeded               in
 1 1 is  estates by his son, the subject of this notice.             This gentleman
 was born in Edinburgh           on the 1st       of March 1813.         He received
 his university education         at Oxford, where he was entered             at Christ
 Church College.          Some time after leaving           the university,     he tra-
  A-elled    through   Palestine     and    other parts of the East.            Of this
  tour he      wrote  an account, which was printed for private circula
  tion, but never published.
       Mr Home-Drummond           was a man of extensive culture and varied
  pursuits.       With the languages and literature of ancient Greece
  and Rome he was familiar; of several of the languages of modern
  Europe       he was accurately master,         especially French       and    Italian,
   which     he wrote and    spoke with ease and          fluency;     and  in several
  branches of natural         science,    he was proficient.         He    was   chiefly
  interested      in antiquarian     research,     and became       especially skilled
  in the deciphering of ancient         documents.         One of the fruits of his
  labours in this field was the collection               of  a   mass   of notes and
  papers relative to the Earldom of Monteith,                   which, it is under
  stood, is now in the possession of            a   learned legal antiquary, with
  the view of being       used in the preparation of a historical volume.
       Though interested in literary and scientific pursuits, Mr Home-
  Drummond         did not neglect the duties of          a   large landholder       and
  country gentleman.          In this capacity        as  well   as  in the relations
  of private life,     he was     much      respected    and    esteemed.      He   died
   somewhat suddenly in London, on the 3d of June in the present
  year.      He was elected a Fellow of this Society in 1869. He was
  also a Fellow of the Society of Scottish Antiquaries and                    a  Fellow
  of the Geological Society.
       Alexander      Russel   was a native of Edinburgh,              where he was
  born on the 10th of December 1814.                   His   father was a solicitor
  practising     in that city, and     his mother, from whom it is said he
  derived much of his mental vigour and character, was the daughter

220                     Proceedings of the Royal Society
of   a   Mr Somerville, whose interest in politics                        and stanch adherence                  to
his party may be said also to have been inherited by his descendant.
After receiving education              at several schools in Edinburgh                             MrRussel
was apprenticed to the               printing      trade with             Mr John Johnstone,                     a
gentleman well known in connection with literature as                                                an   editor
and author          still   more    than     as    a    printer.              To young            Russel      the
acquaintance and society of this gentleman and                                              his gifted       and
accomplished wife were of great advantage.                                     They        soon discovered
his abilities, and they did much to foster his taste for literature as
well      as   to direct his studies.             By them he was encouraged to the
use      of his   pen in composition, and several                        of his early essays were
introduced by           Mrs Johnstone into " Tait's Magazine,"                                       of which
she was at that time the editor.                            From         the       outset,       however,     his
bent was to politics rather than to literature                                 ;    and having been at
an unusually            early age appointed editor of the
                                                          " Berwick Adver
tiser," he was enabled thenceforward to devote himself to a career
to which his tastes inclined him, and                             for which he was by natural
abilities         and   acquired      facilities        and           resources           peculiarly       fitted.
After      some years he exchanged the editorship of the                                        " Advertiser"
for that of the             "Fife Herald,"         which post                  he continued            to hold
till towards        the close of 1844.                By this time his reputation                          as an
able writer and skilful editor was established                                      ;     and in 1845         he,
after      a   connection of short duration with a paper                                   in Kilmarnock,
was invited to become                the colleague                of    the        late    Mr Machiren          as
editor of the " Scotsman," then,                       as    it is still,          the leading         political
journal         in Scotland.         In connection with Mr Maclaren                                    he con
tinued to edit this journal, taking                              upon     him           almost the entire
management,              until     1849,    when        Mr Maclaren                       retired,    and      Mr
Russel became               sole editor.         In this position                   he     remained up          to
the       time   of his death, though latterly, through failing health,
 he was        obliged to devolve upon others much of that work which
for many years he had with Herculean vigour done alone.
         The " Scotsman

                          newspaper                   is,   as   is   well known, the recognised
principal organ of the Whig party in Scotland                                  ;    and for the advocacy
and diffusion of the principles held                             by   that party           it   was designed.
Of that party Mr Russel                    was    a    stanch adherent, of its principles
he was the bold, uncompromising,                            and consistent advocate,                      and its
interests he zealously laboured to advance.                                        The services           he reu

dered to his party were immense.           Nor  were    the members of the
party slow    to acknowledge      this;  as was attested      in many ways,
but especially    by the testimonial which was presented           to   him in
1859,  "in   recognition of his services and as        a mark of respect for
his honourable     and   independent     conduct    in public    and    private
life," and by his being spontaneously           elected   a member of the
Reform Club in London, which has been described as " the
central organisation of the Liberal party." Nor was it by persons
of that party alone that his merits were acknowledged, and the
tribute of  respect to his consistency and       integrity   rendered.     Per
haps no provincial newspaper was so generally read by men of all
parties as the " Scotsman whilst under Mr Russel's management ;
                              "
and   however    much some of its readers          might   dissent from his
opinions or dislike his principles, there were none who did not
admire the boldness, the steadfastness, and the consummate ability
with which     these were maintained       and  advocated.      For   the con
duct of  a public journal    he was eminently      qualified as well by the
brilliancy of his faculties   as  by the extent and variety of his know
ledge, his sound sense, and the manly vigour which characterised
all his utterances   on questions    of public interest.      Of him may it
be said, with much greater justice         than of the     person    to whom
Addison first    addressed  the line, that he was
             " For wit, for humour, and for judgment famed."
If sometimes    his wit was over keen,     if now and then in his humour
there was a flavour of coarseness,    if occasionally he jested where jest
ing was " not convenient," if the       showers   of ridicule with which     he
assailed  the objects of his criticism      were   often more copious than
deserved, there is this to be said on the other side, that his judgment
was seldom at fault, that in his satire there was no malevolence,
that his antagonism was open and manly, that he scorned to use any
base arts of insinuation, vituperation, or slander, and that when he
wielded the scourge there was so much cleverness in his manipula
tion, such felicity of expression and illustration, and withal such a
joyous hilarity pervading the whole, that even those who were the
objects of his most pungent strictures found it impossible to with
hold their admiration, or      to resent with    bitterness the castigation
they had received.

  Those who have been born and brought up in towns, and whose
avocations restrict them to a residence in " the busy haunts of
men,'' have often little or no relish for natural scenery, and no
inclination         towards the pursuits or pastimes                          of country life.             Dr
Johnson, it          is well known, thought Fleet                         Street much to be pre
ferred to Greenwich Park, and maintained that no man would live
in the country who could help it. Boswell, in recording this with
          " shelters " himself under the
approval,                                authority of one whom he
describes          as a man    of fashion, but distinguished                        also by a love of
literature, who declared that he preferred the smell of                                      a   flambeau

the delight which such a heart as hers                               must take in green                 fields
and gentle streams,                 replied — "Ah         !   il n'y       a pour moi de ruisseau
qui vaille celui          de    la Rue de Bac,"               a street        in the Faubourg              St
Germain, through which a paltry rivulet                                  flows.     There are many
who, without            having      a   distaste for the country                  so    pronounced as
this, are yet supremely indifferent                       to       it,   and either never care to
visit   it,   or   if   they are seduced           into       it,   are never          happy      till they
turn their back on             it   and find themselves once more among streets
and houses.             Mr Russel        was not of this class.                   Though         born in    a
town, and from his youth up                  a    dweller in towns, he had                    a   passion
ate love for the           country, and           found no relief from his toils so
refreshing and exhilarating                 as    a   ramble among                  the hills and          by
the streams           of his native land.                     He     was     also      enthusiastically
devoted       to angling, and there are few                              of the angling          waters    of
Scotland with which he was                        not acquainted.                   With         the    Gala
and     the Tweed he was especially familiar,                                and often       sought on
their banks that recreation which their streams afforded to him in
the     pursuit of his favourite                 pastime.                With the habits of the
tenants of the waters                he was careful to make himself                         acquainted,
and     he knew them             all well, from the                trout to the salmon.                   His
observations were embodied                   in an article which                    appeared           in the
" Quarterly Review,"                 and which        he afterwards expanded into                          a
volume   ;     and on the subject of fishing he became                                 so   much of an
authority, that he was repeatedly examined before Parliamentary
Commissions appointed to inquire into this matter.                                          Besides tra-

versing widely his own country, Mr Russel in 1850 made a tour
in Ireland; in 1863 he for the first time visited the Continent;
and in 1869 he went to Egypt, and was a witness of the ceremony at
the opening'of the Suez Canal. In 1872, after his first serious ill
ness,    he made a lengthened tour through the south of Europe, visit
 ing    several places in France, Portugal, Spain, and Northern Italy.
      The illness under which Mr Russel        suffered  was a form of heart
 disease,    and by this he was for some years before              his death   so
  seriously affected that he      was obliged to retire to a great        extent
  from the literary work of       the "Scotsman."        Towards the end of
  last year   the attacks became more        frequent and      severe, and his
  strong constitution at length sank under them.              He died on the
   18th of  July  last.
       Mr Russel  became a    Fellow of  the Royal Society in 1870.
       Thomas Laycock was born at Witherby,             in Yorkshire,     on the
   10th of August       1812.   He was the son of a Wesleyan minister,
   and received his early education at the Wesleyan Academy, Wood-
   house Grove.      Destined for the medical profession, he was, when
   fifteen years  of age, apprenticed to   Mr   Spence,   surgeon,    of Bedale.
   He afterwards prosecuted professional studies at University College,
   London, where he followed the full curriculum ; subsequently, he
   went to Paris, where he studied under Yelpeau and Lisfranc ; and
   from this to Gottingen, where he took his M.D degree
                                                                  " summa cum
   laude."    On his return from the Continent he settled at          York   as a
   general medical practitioner.      In  1841 he was appointed physician
   to the York Dispensary;      in 1844 he acted as      Statistical   Secretary
   to the British Association, which met that year at            York;   and   in
   1846 he became Lecturer on the Theory and Practice of Medicine
   in the York Medical School.        On the retirement of the late         Pro
   fessor Alison in 1855, he was elected Professor of the Practice             of
   Medicine and of Clinical Medicine in the University of Edinburgh.
   In 1869 he was appointed Physician to the Queen in Scotland.
   He   was a Fellow of    the Royal   College of Physicians       as well  as of
   the Royal Society of Edinburgh.
       Endowed with great mental ability, and possessed of indomitable
   energy, Dr Laycock contributed largely to the literature and science
   of his profession. He was an excellent linguist, and kept himself

 224                Proceedings oj        the    Royal Society
 abreast   of  the    most   important      advances     in medical     science   and
 speculation on the Continent.            He translated Prochasta's Treatise
 on the Nervous       System and Unger's           Physiology.       His own con
 tributions to various branches of medical science were many, and
 most of great value.           Besides numerous papers in the medical
journals and in the transactions of learned societies, he published a
 Treatise on the Nervous Diseases of Women, in which he first de
veloped    his views as to the scientific data of unconscious and                  in
voluntary brain        function,   and explained thereby the phenomena
of mesmerism, dreaming,            and    insanity.      The views advanced in
this   work he afterwards extended and                completed as a system          of
Practical    Philosophy,     in a work in       two volumes,       entitled   " Mind
and    Brain,   or the Correlation of Consciousness and              Organisation,"
of which    the first edition appeared        in 1S60 and the second in 1869.
He   also devoted     much     attention    to   the  subject of epidemiology,
and his papers on this and on questions              of sanitary reform contri
buted much to turn attention             to the important         matter of public
health, and to direct to the use of measures best fitted to secure and
promote it.
    The natural bent of Dr Laycock's mind was towards                    speculation
and theory; but he bad what many theorists and speculative                  thinkers
have not, a    capacity of minute observation and            a  patience of details
which have enabled          him to give to his writings a value and im
portance    independent of the          theories which they are intended to
advocate.     As to the soundness of these theories there may be, and                I
presume     are,   differences of opinion,         but there      can   be  but one
opinion    as  to the conscientious carefulness             and exactitude     of his
observations, and as to the value of the facts which he has collected
and described.        His doctrine concerning        the reflex function      of the
brain is now,    I  believe, universally recognised by physiologists, and
its importance both in        a scientific and a practical relation acknow
ledged to be great.        To   the subject     of mental    disease   Dr Laycock
devoted   much attention;         and he did not        a  little  to advance the
science  of mental pathology, and thereby to place                on a firmer basis
the  theory of the treatment of the insane. As a                 professor   his aim
was not merely to communicate knowledge to his students, but                     still
more to awaken them to thought, to stimulate them to inquiry, and
to urge them to use their faculties            in the  independent pursuit         of

                     of Edinburgh,     Session    1876-77.                  225
truth.     Complaints     have   sometimes been        made   of his want of
lucidity    as a lecturer, but the fault here may have        been   rather on
the part of the student than on the part of the professor; for where
the mind has not been previously trained to processes of thinking,
the most lucid exposition        of doctrines which are speculative and
abstract will fail of conveying      to the hearer a clear and just concep
tion of the teacher's meaning.          Dr Laycock's lectures      were always
thoughtful and instructive,       and  if they  often required    an   effort of
close attention and thought on the part of the student to appre
 hend them, this was never rendered without great advantage to the
 student thence accruing.
     In  outward manner Dr Laycock was somewhat             cold and    formal,
 and there was in his addresss          what had     the  appearance,    though
 slight, of hauteur. But under all this there lay an extreme kindli
 ness of disposition, which manifested itself in many acts of gene
  rous beneficence and tender sympathy.
      For some years before his death     Dr Laycock's health     had begun to
  fail. In  1857 he had been visited with a threatening of phthisis; and
  though he seemed entirely to recover from this, the insidious malady
  continued lurking in his system.         In 1866 disease of the left knee-
  joint rendered amputation of that limb necessary;           and   this gave  a
  shock to his system from which he never wholly recovered.              He was
  able, however, in the enjoyment of an apparently fair measure               of
  health and strength, to continue his ordinary avocations         and to fulfil
  his professorial functions up to the close of last winter session, when
   an accession of his old malady laid him aside.             As the summer
   advanced pulmonary consumption gradually extended             its ravages in
   his frame, and on the 21st of September         he breathed   his last.
      Dr Laycock     became    a Fellow of this Society in      1856, the year
   after his appointment to the Chair in the University.
      George Hay, Marquis of Tweeddale, was born at Yester House,
   on the 1st of February 1787; and succeeded his father as eighth
   marquis in 1804.      In  the same year     he entered    the army, and he
   was   engaged   in active service during the whole of the Peninsular
   War.     He served    as aid-de-camp to the Duke of Wellington, by
   whom he was highly esteemed        as a brave   soldier and  an able officer.
   He afterwards served in Canada.          He was wounded at the battle of

 226                  Proceedings      of the Royal Society
 Busaco, and be received other wounds in subsequent                 engagements;
 and when, in 1814, be returned bome invalided, he was so lame from
 the effects     of his wounds that he was obliged to use crutches.              As
 a  young man he was remarkable for his great strength, and many
 stories    are told of his powers        both on the field and in pugilistic
 encounters.        He wielded a sabre longer by several inches than the
 regulation standard;        he was an excellent horseman,           and a notable
 whip.      It  is recorded   of him that   he once drove the mail coach from
 London      to Haddington       without     leaving the box or resigning the
 reins for    a  single stage.    Even in extreme old age he was to               be
 seen    on   the streets    of this city driving a pair of spirited         horses
 with the vigour and        skill of an experienced charioteer.
    In   1842 the Marquis       went out to India as Governor and Com
 mander-in-Chief        at Madras.      Here he remained for six years faith
 fully discharging      the duties    of his high    and responsible office.     As
 one who had been trained under             Wellington     he could not but set
 himself     to restrain    and   cure the      lax discipline    which had been
 allowed to creep into the Indian army; and the severity of some
 of the measures he took with this view exposed him to no small
 obloquy and censure.          Events, however,       proved that he was right
in the course he pursued, and that his action was alike necessary
 and salutary.
    On his retirement from active service in the army the Marquis
devoted      himself to the duties and occupations of           a country gentle
man, and these ho continued to pursue               to the end    of his life with
the exception of the six years he was in            India.   He engaged largely
in agricultural pursuits, retaining in his own hands                 an  extensive
farm, which he cultivated with the utmost assiduity,                   sparing no
expense     of money, or labour, or skill, not only to render it produc
tive to the highest possible degree, but to make it a model of
scientific farming, from which others engaged in the same pursuit
might derive profitable instruction.                 He introduced many im
portant improvements both             in the practice of farming        and in the
implements used in agriculture;                so great, indeed,    were  the im
provements he introduced, both in the methods and in the means
of   tillage,     that he may      be  said   to have    revolutionised   Scottish
agriculture.        In 1836    he received       the gold medal of the High
land and Agricultural Society for the invention of a machine for

                     of Edinburgh,      Session 1876-77.                    227
the making of tiles to be used in drainage.                 He invented     also
the    Tweeddale       plough, an implement which has been found of
immense       use, as enabling      the cultivator     with the minimum        of
draught to turn up the subsoil so as to break it up and subject
it to the action of the atmosphere. The system of deep ploughing
which he introduced prepared the way for the use of the steam-
plough, which       he was the first to bring        under the notice of the
Society and to introduce into general use. As has been justly suid,
" the agricultural world was under adeep obligation to the Marquis
for the time, research, and large pecuniary expenditure he devoted
to the practical solution of the steam plough question."*
    To   the   agriculturist   the condition     and changes    of  the atmo
sphere are hardly of less interest than is the soil which he has to
till.    As might      be   expected, therefore, in one so interested in
 agriculture, the Marquis of Tweeddale attached great importance
to meteorology, and devoted much time, labour, and money to the
 fostering of that science.       Of the National Meteorological Society
 of Scotland he was from the first, and continued to be, the main
 support.     From time to time he offered prizes for the best essay
 or series of observations on meteorological phenomena; which had
 the   effect   of engaging the attention of competent inquirers              to
 these   phenomena, and drawing forth             some    communications      of
 the greatest importance to those engaged in agriculture and allied
pursuits.
    Besides holding the hereditary honours and dignities of his house,
 some of which had come down to him from a remote ancestry, Lord
 Tweeddale possessed        many personal distinctions.        He  was a  K.T.
 and G.C.B., a representative Peer of Scotland, Lord-Lieutenant of
 Haddingtonshire,      Colonel successively of the 30th Regiment, the
 42nd Regiment, and the 2nd Regiment of Life Guards, a General
in   the army, and a       Field Marshal.      He died at Tester Huuse on
the 10th of October last, in his 90th year.
    The Marquis of Tweeddale         became   a   Fellow of this Society in
1849.
   Adolphe Pictet        was born at Geneva on tLe        llth  of September
1799.      He received his education           at  the   Hofwyl    institution

founded by Fellenberg,               who was an intimate friend               of his father
Charles Pictet de Rochamont.                       He afterwards studied at Paris              ;
and from that he went to Germany, where he made the acquaint
ance  of Schlegel, Schelling, Hegel, and Goethe, as he had at Paris
that of Victor Cousin and other men of eminence.       A vast mass
of letters remain to testify to the intimacy of his relations with
these and other distinguished                  men among his contemporaries.
  He began to write in the " Bibliotheque Universelle," a journal
founded by members of his own family, and of which he became
the proprietor in 1825.               In   1838 or 1839 he commenced to lecture
on aesthetics    in the Academy                   at Geneva, and three years after
wards he was appointed professor there of aesthetics, modern litera
ture and linguistic.              This appointment               he   did not hold long;
circumstances led to his engaging in other pursuits, and for a time
he left Geneva         and       fixed his abode at Turin.                Obliged,   as every
Swiss citizen        is,   to serve as     a   soldier, he for some         time was in the
army, where he rose to the rank of colonel of artillery.                             Directing
his attention to the implements of artillery warfare, he introduced
such improvements                in these        that the Austrian Government pur
chased    for 25,000          francs       the    secret of bombs         of his invention.
Returning      to Geneva, he devoted                    himself to his favourite studies,
and    from time to time issued works in various branches of philo
sophy, and especially in comparative philology, which brought him
reputation much more in other countries than his own.                            In Geneva,
indeed, he was very little known, the abstruse                             character of his
writings rendering them acceptable only to the few, and the deaf
ness with which he was afflicted preventing him from                        mingling in
general society.            In   1839 the        Institute of France adjudged to him
the    Volney prize for          an essay        on the affinity of the Celtic language
 with the Sanscrit;          and twenty years afterwards the same prize was
assigned to him for              a   work in which          he developed at length         his
 views   as   to the primary relations                  of the Indo-European tongues
 generally.     This work, which                   is   entitled " Les Origines Indo-
 Europeennes, ou Les Aryas primitifs                       ;   Essai de Paleontologie      lin-
 guistique,"    is   one     of great learning             and acuteness,     and    has com
 manded the applause of philologists and ethnologists in all parts
 of the learned world.               In    1856     he published      a   work scarcely less
                                  " Du Beau
 remarkable in its kind, entitled                                 dans la Nature, Part, et

       M. Putet was a Meraher of the Royal Irish Academy, of the-
  Ethnographic Society of New York, of the Academie Stanislas of
  Nancy, as well as a Fellow of this Society. From Napoleon III.
  he received the decorations of the Legion of Honour and of St
  Maurice and St Lazare.                He was elected an Honorary Fellow in
  1804.      He died 20th December 1875.
       ADoLpnE-THEODoBK           Bronqniart wis        born   at  Paris    on the 14th
  January        1801.     He    was   the son     of Alexandre       Brongniart,      the
  celebrated       naturalist    and associate      of Cuvier, who died in 1847.
  Devoted       from childhood        to the study      of the natural       sciences,   in
  which     he was encouraged as well by the examplo as by the counsels
  of his father, Adolphe, while preparing               to tak-e his degree of doctor
   of medicine, cultivated         at the same time with earnestness             and suc
  cess botany and geology.                In 1822 he published a monograph on
   the classification and distribution of fossil vegetables ; three years
   later he published a work on Champignons, in which he embraced
   the whole of that family in              a natural classification      of its genera;
   and in 1826 he presented to the Academie des Sciences                    a
                                                                              " Memoire
   Fur la genération et le développement de l'embryon vegetal," for
   which he received         the first prize for experimental         physiology.       In
   this work      a new     light  was thrown      on the     most  important fact in
    the life of plants;        and  if it  cannot   be   said  that he entirely lifted
   the veil which had hitherto covered                the   mystery of fecundation,
    he advanced very near to the complete explanation                      of that phe
   nomenon.         The    course on which he had thus entered               of scientific
    investigation      he pursued with         unabated energy to the close of his
    life.   The number of investigations which                he conducted, and        the
    papers which he presented to scientific societies and to the scientific
    world through the press, indicate an almost unprecedented amount
    of activity    on his part.      His most important work           is his
                                                                                " Histoire
    des Vegétaux        Fossiles,"    which unfortunately         was    left unfinished
    by him.      In    this work new light is thrown on              both botany and

  230                Proceedings       of tlte Royal Society
  geology, and it may be regarded              as a  work of standard     authority
  on vegetable palaeontology.
     M. Brongniart        was   elected    professor of botany and vegetal ,le
  physiology in the Museum            of Natural       History at Paris in 1S33;
  and from 1852 lie was inspector-general of the University for the
  sciences.    He was a Member of the Academic des Sciences and
  an officer of the Legion of Honour.               He was elected an Honorary
  Fellow of this Society in         1872.     He died in February last.
     Christian Gottfried Eiirenbero was born at Delitsch, in Prussia,
  on the 19th of April 1795.             He studied chiefly at Leipsic, where
  he took bis doctor's degree           in medicine.        At Berlin,  in 1S15,   he
 devoted himself to microscopic researches             in physiology, and through
 these became      known to the scientific world.             In 1S20 he was sent
 by the Academy         of   Sciences, along with Hemprich, on a scientific
 expedition     to  Egypt, in the course of which he traversed Egypt,
 Abyssinia,     and    a considerable        part of Africa.       His companion
 having succumbed          under the fatigues of the journey, Ehrenberg
 prosecuted    it alone, and returned bringing            with him   a large collec
 tion of animals and plants until then unknown.                     He was named
 professor   extraordinary      in the   Faculty of Medicine        at Berlin  ;  but
 he preferred going with            Humboldt      to explore Central      Asia, and
 more particularly       the plateau    of  the Altai.     On his return he settled
 at Berlin,   where he was in          18-12   made     principal  secretary to the
 Academy of Science.             Here he devoted         himself chiefly to micro
 scopic   researches      on  the Infusoria,     and in this field made many
 discoveries,  which added materially to the knowledge of these minute
 forms of animal life, and suggested              the explanation     of many    pre
 viously unexplained         phenomena, such         as  phosphorescence     on the
spa, blood-rain, red snow on the          Alps,  and the blood-red spots which,
to the terror of the ignorant and superstitious, sometimes                appear on
broad.      To the heaps       of infusoria,    also, he attributed    "the exist
ence    of vegetable soil, and         according to his         observations these
infinitely small     creatures    have formed entire mountain-chains,            and
played an important           part in the formation of the crust of the
earth."*      His great work, entitled " Die Infusiorsthierchen                   als

    Herr Ehrenherg      was a member      of  most   of the learned Societies
of Europe.       He was elected an Honorary Fellow of this Society in
1845.      He died in April of this year.
     In the course of the past session       the number    of "papers "  read
at the meetings of the Society was forty-five, besides            the address
delivered at the opening of the session by the senior Vice-Presi
dent, Mr Milne-Home. Of the papers read, twenty-three were in
 the department of mathematics and physics, three in chemistry,
 four in meteorology, one in anatomy, five in geology, two in geo
 graphy,    five  in botany and natural history, and two on literary
 subjects.     Some of these papers were of considerable length, and
 most were of importance and permanent interest.
     The Keith Prize for the biennial period 1873-75            was awarded
 to Professor Crum Brown for his " Researches on                the Sense   of
 Rotation and on the Anatomical Relations of the Semi-Circular
 Canals of the Internal Ear;" and was presented to him by the
 President at the meeting on the 15th of May.
     The Society is to be congratulated on the evidence which the
 number and variety of the papers read last session afford of the
 continued     zeal and activity of its members        in various spheres   of
 scientific   inquiry and literary research.       At the  same time,  I ven
 ture to express     a wish that the range of the Society's activity were
 widened, so that incursions were made            into fields of inquiry and
 research     which, so far as our Proceedings         show,  are wholly   ne
 glected by the members         of  the  Society.    With   the exception   of
 the two literary      papers,  all the papers read last session      have  to
 do either with the exact sciences          or the sciences   of observation.
  Besides these, however, there are the moral sciences, the science
  of experience or consciousness, and the history of science, in all
  of which there are questions of high interest and importance which
  yet remain unsettled, and which await and invite the investigation
  of members of a learned body such as this. How little, for in
  stance, is known of the history of philosophic thought and scientific
  t-peculation among the Arabians and the Jews in the Middle Ages,
  or among the theosophists, mystics, and speculatists of the East!

In ethics, in political       economy,       in jurisprudence, in        international
law, how many points of profound interest are still in dispute or
are involved in obscurity 1 In psychology, how many new theories
and methods have recently emerged, both in this country and on
the Continent, which may change the entire aspect of that science,
and which, at any rate, challenge the careful consideration                        of all
philosophic thinkers       1    A   new science, indeed, has of late             sprung
up in this department, — the              science,     so-called, of physiological
psychology, — an infelicitous designation,               as I cannot but think,       see
 ing that     as  physiology can never become psychology nor                     psycho
 logy physiology, the union of the two words                     in one designation
 is almost tantamount to a negation of the possibility of the                    science
 so designated.       This   science    has found so many enthusiastic                and
 able cultivators that its claims on the attention and study                    of scien
 tific inquirers cannot be neglected.                I   confess    I  am not     myself
 sanguine of any great advantage accruing to psychology from its
 being approached       through the medium of physiology, for this, were
 there    no other reason, that, as on the one hand, the                    physiologist
 must first learn from consciousness             or experience the existence            of
 any    faculty before     he can      search     for or find an organ for that
 faculty in the body;        so, on the    other hand, he is unable from' the
 mere observation       of the bodily organs            or functions      to throw   any
 light upon the mental faculties, seeing all he can accomplish at the
 utmost     is to point to a connection of some sort between the                  mental
 faculty and the bodily organ.                At   the same time,        I  defer to the
 judgment of the eminent men who have appeared as the cultivators
 of this science, and claim for it            a place    among the objects which
  engage the attention of the members               of this Society.
     " Through      desire a man, having separated             himself, seeketh      and
                                         "
 intermeddleth with all wisdom              (Prov. xviii.    1).    This saying of the
  Hebrew sage might be adopted             as a  fitting motto for such        a Society
  as  this.    By joining it      the   members        separate    or set themselves
  apart,    under the    impulse of       a master desire,          to the pursuit      of
   knowledge;      and it beseems them, as so separated,               to take   all wis
  dom for their province.          It is true that in the present day know
  ledge is no longer confined to the few, or locked up within Societies
  of those who give themselves          to the pursuit of         it  as  their business
  and occupation.       It is true that "science has now left her retreats,

                      of Edinburgh, Session 1876-77.                               233
her shades, her selected company of votaries" (Channing) ; and
that many who are engaged in other occupations are at the same
time diligent cultivators of science, and often come forward to add
contributions to its stores.         Still, it is   to those who set themselves
apart as men of science or         as literary men that the world looks for
the steady pursuit of knowledge, and for the guidance of others to
the solution of those questions which from time to time press upon
the interest or affect the welfare of the community.                       And where
Societies of such are formed men look to them to intermeddle with
all wisdom, and leave         no part   of   the wide field    of knowledge un
 explored.*
    On the value and utility of such Societies it would                be   idle in me
 to expatiate in such an assembly as this.               Who knows not that          by
 intercourse     with   others men have their faculties            sharpened,       are
 helped better to understand themselves, and to bring to precision
 and definiteness their own cogitations, as well as stimulated to
 explore new fields of inquiry and guided to make new discoveries?
 It is long ago since Homer said —
                 " By mutual confidence and mutual aid
                   Great deeds are done and great diseov'ries mado.
                   The wise new wisdom from the wise acquire,
                   And one hrave hero fans another's fire" — +
 and ample experience has showed                 that this holds true no less of
  those who go in quest of truth than              of those who engage in mili
  tary adventure;      for as Plato,       after referring to this passage           in
  Homer, says,     "in society    we   all  are somehow      more    alert in deed
  and word and thought; "{ and Aristotle, also referring to this pas
  sage, says that by society
                                   " those engaged in great undertakings
  are rendered more potent to        think and to act."§        I  content myself
  with congratulating       the Society on its past achievements and its
  present flourishing      condition;    and    expressing my confidence that
  the energy which       has characterised the members            in   the past    will
  be no less displayed, and with           equally satisfactory results, during
  the session on which we now enter.

      We         need have no misgivings              as to    the worthiness of the               pursuits
 to which this Society is devoted.                           To search after truth,               to strive,
 as
       "
     the minister and interpreter of Nature," not only to discover
all her facts but to elicit their meaning, to educe the principles
 which underlie them, and to arrive at the apprehension                                      of    the laws
 which they obey, —

is an occupation than which none can be more noble, more worthy of
the faculties with which we have been endowed,                                  or more pleasing             to
Him         by whom these faculties have been                       conferred, — for He Himself
is    Truth;       and in proportion as men with sincerity and earnestness                               seek
after truth, in that proportion do they put on the similitude of                                         God
and come into sympathy with                        Him. The visible universe, moreover,
is as Goethe has expressed                   it,   " DerGottheit lehendigerKleid"
                                                                                   (tbe
living mantle of               the Deity)    ;     and by     it   He, who      is   himself     invisible,
reveals          himself to us, making known to us,                      as    the apostle tells           us,
by the things that are made his eternal power and Godhead (Rom.
i.   20).         Philosophy,      if   it   follow its normal tendency, leads                       up     to
God; for            the progress        of all true philosophic thought                     is   from the
many           to the       one, from      facts to principles,               from the relative             to
the absolute,              from phenomena to essence;                     and   it   is   illegitimately
arrested          in its proper course, and defrauded                     of its proper           issue,   if
it    be stopped           short of the Supreme Essence in whose infinite                               miud
are        the    archeal types         of all existences — "             the    forms       eternal       of
created          things."       Nor   is   the value      of literary and scientific                 study
as   a     moral discipline to          be   overlooked.            To   those       engaged       in   such
pursuits there arises an influence which, like some subtle                                        essence,
pervades           their whole inner nature, and unconsciously,                             perhaps,

themselves           elevates,     purifies, and refines it.               The study of              philo
sophy, of literature, and of science                          thus becomes            a    great moral
therapeutic, an instrument of spiritual culture                           :   — "Animum             format

 2.  Applications of the Theorem that Two Closed Plane Curves
        intersect an even number of times.              By Prof. Tait.
                                   (Abstract.)
     The theorem itself may         be   considered obvious,    and     is easily
applied, as     I  showed   at the late meeting of the   British Association,
to prove that in passing from any one double point of a plane closed
curve continuously       along the curve to the same point again, an          even
number of intersections must be passed through.            Hence,     if  we sup
pose the curve to       be constructed     of cord or wire,   and restrict the
crossings to double points, we may arrange them throughout                so that,
in   following the wire continuously, it goes alternatel y over and under
each branch it meets.          When this is done it is obviously as com
pletely knotted as its scheme          (defined below) will admit of, and
except in a special class     of cases cannot have the number of crossings
reduced by any possible deformation.           The excepted class is that in

238               Proceedings      of the Royal Society
which the intersections are either wholly or partially nugatory, i.e.,
not in reality contributing to the knot, whether on account of the
order of their arrangement or their signs.         All   nugatory    intersec
tions can be detected    at once     by the scheme      itself, and   may    be
struck out.    As will be  understood from what follows,         the  schemes
                      AABBCCand ACBBCA
are wholly nugatory, while in
                      ACBDCBDAEGFEGF
only the intersection A is necessarily nugatory.            In  fact a group
like C B D    CBD,   when not     itself nugatory by    reason of its signs,
is self-contained, and forms a special knot which may be drawn           tight
so as to present only a roughness in the string.               The following
sketches illustrate these essentially nugatory crossings: —
    I. Given the number of      its double points, to find all the essen
 tially different forms which a closed curve can assume.
    (a.) Going round the curve continuously, call the first, third,
 &c., intersections A, B, C, dec.        In this category we evidently
exhaust all the intersections.        The complete    scheme is then to      be
 formed by properly      interpolating    the  same    letters in the     even
 places; and the form of the curve depends solely upon              the way   in
 which this is done.
    (6)  It cannot, however,   be done at random.          For instance,    the
scheme
                        ADBECADBEC               \ A
is lawful, but
                        ADBACEBCEB               | A
is not.
    The former, in fact, may     be treated  as the result    of  superposing
two closed (and not self-intersecting) curves, both denoted by the
letters A D B E C A, so as to make them cross one another at the
points marked B, C, D, E, then cutting them open at A, and joining
the free ends so as to make a continuous circuit with a crossing at A.

                         of Edinburgh,          Session 1876-77.                                  239
   But in the latter scheme above, we have to deal with the curves
A DB A       and C      E C E,    and in the last of these we cannot have                          the
junctions alternately           + and  required by our fundamental prin
                                         — as
ciple.   In      fact, the scheme would require the point C to lie simul
taneously inside and outside the closed circuit A D B A.
   Or we may treat            A D BA          and C    E D C           as closed       curves    inter
secting one another and yet having only one point, D, in common.
   (c) Thus, to test any arrangement, we may strike out from the
whole scheme            all the letters of any one closed part                          as   A        A   ,
and the remaining letters must satisfy the fundamental principle.
   Or we may strike out all the letters of any two sets which begin
and end       similarly,      e.g.,   A...X,X...A,                             the two together
being treated          as one closed     curve, and the test must still apply.
   More generally, we may take the sides                               of any closed         polygon
as A - X,     X - Y, Y - Z, Z - A, and                  apply them             in the same way.
But in this,       as in the simpler case               just given, the             sides    must all
be taken the same way round in the scheme itself.
  (d.) Such schemes as the latter of the two in (6) above may be
made algebraically possible by slightly changing our assumptions.
Thus, for instance,           we might admit of a triple point, and agree not
to reckon it      as    an intersection on a continuous                        oval provided one
of the remaining branches               goes into the oval, and the other comes
out of     it,   these two not necessarily intersecting one another.                                  In
the case specified            the triple point would                  be   E   supposed      to lie on
the oval
           A
           D
           B             A,   and not to be counted                   as   an intersection while
we pass round that oval.                But this       is
                                                       a     mere algebraic escape from
a geometrical           difficulty, and will not necessarily help us when we
deal with knots on actual cords or wires.
   II.   A    possible scheme            being      thus made,               with      the requisite
number of intersections,                let   it   be constructed               in cord, with the
intersections      as above     alternately                  -
                                             Then [since all schemes
                                                   +   and        .
involving nugatory points, like those above mentioned, must be got
rid of, as they do not really possess the requisite number of inter
sections] no deformation which the cord can suffer will reduce,
though   itmay increase, the number of double points. If     do                                  it
increase the number, the added terms                             will       be of      the nugatory
character presently to be explained.                         If       it   do not increase        that
number, the scheme                will in general still                    represent     the altered

  240               Proceedings        of the Royal      Society
 figure.   Henco the scheme          is a complete and definite statement
 of the nature of the knot.
     (a.) One illustration depends upon the fact that all deforma
 tions of such a cord or wire may be considered as being effected by
 bending at a time only      a  limited portion of the wire, the rest being
 held fixed. This corresponds to changing the point of view finitely
 with regard to the part altered, and yet infinitesimally with regard
 to all the rest.    This, it is clear, can always be done, as the relative
dimensions of the various coils may           be  altered to any extent without
altering the character of the knot             All   such deformations may          be
obtained by altering the position of a luminous point, and               the plane
on which     it  casts   a shadow of the knot.            Any addition       to the
normal number of intersections which                 may be produced        by this
process is essentially nugatory.
    Another mode, really depending on the same principles,                 consists
in fixing temporarily one or more of the crossings, and considering
the impossibility      of unlocking      in any way what is now virtually
two or more separate interlacing            closed curves,     or a  single   closed
curve with full knottings, but with fewer intersections than                      the
original one.
    Another depends       upon the study of cases of knots in which               one
or more crossings can        be   got rid of.      Here, it is proved that       con
tinuations of sign are in general lost when an intersection is lost;
so that, as our system       has no continuations         of sign, it  can lose    no
intersections.
    (b.) Practical   processes   for producing all such deformations             gra
phically are given at once by various simple mechanisms.                      Thus,
taking    0 any fixed point       w hatever, let p,    a point in the    deformed
curve, be found from its corresponding                point, P, by joining        PO
and producing      it  so that
                                   P0-O^     = o2,
or so that
                                   T0 + 0p =     a, &c.,  Ac
   The essential thing is that points near O should have                    images
distant from 0, and rice versa. And p must be taken in OP produced
else the distorted knot is altered from a right-handed to a left-
banded one, and vice vcrsd.           This distinction     is shown in the      cuts

                          of Edinburgh, Session 1876-77.                                  241
1   and 3 below, where it will              be seen     that one turn of the coil may
be regarded           as wound         round the other — the screw being right-
handed in         3 and    left-handed in        1.
                  1.                            2.                                 3.
      It  is easy to show that these                 methods      give   merely different
 views of the same knot.                   The simplest way of doing this is to
 suppose the knot projected on a sphere, the eye being at the centre.
 Arrange        so that one closed           branch, e.g.,      A       A   ,  forms nearly
  a   great circle.          Shifting the      eye to opposite sides           of the    plane
 of this great circle the coil presents                   exactly the two appearances
  related to one another by the deformation processes given above.
  What was inside              the   closed   branch from the one point of view
  is outside     it from the        other,   and vice versd.
       Thus   1  and    2 above are      the only forms with three non-nugatory
  intersections.        2  may be formed         from 1 by putting 0 in either of the
  three border areas, each of which has two sides only.                       If O be   placed
   in external space, or in the inner three-sided area,                   1   is reproduced.
   Similar remarks apply to the deformation of                    2.
                          4.                                             5.
       Figures 4 and         5  aie the only forms with four valid intersections.
    Like   1 and    2, the    first of them is      a clear  coil (see below), the second
    not clear.       And, of course, any deformation of either produces the
   other, or reproduces itself.              6, 7, 8, 9, are     forms of an essentially
    not-clear     arrangement,          with    five    intersections.        The numbers
    inserted in       6  show which         form is produced by placing               0 in  the
    corresponding area.             The only other forms having                 five intersec

242                   Proceedings       of ike Royal       Society
tions, are the clear coil of two turns, whose                  scheme    is the first
given in      I  (6) above, and its solitary deformation.
                                                                   1

   (c.) Hence to draw a scheme,             select in   it any   closed circuit,  e.g.,
A   .  . .  .   A — the    more    extensive the      better,   provided it    do not
include any less extensive one.              Draw this, and build upon it          the
rest of the scheme         ;  commencing always with the common point A,
and passing each way from this to the next occurring of the junctions
named in the closed circuit.             [It  is better to construct both        parts
of the rest of the scheme inside, and then invert one of them,                   as we
thus avoid some puzzling ambiguities.]                    Inversions    with  respect
to  various origins will now give all possible forms of the scheme.
   III. Thus the scheme is perfectly definite as to the general
shape of the curve,        if  we take the possible deformations into account.
And the spherical projection, already mentioned, will in general
allow us to regard and exhibit the knot             as a more or less   perfect plait.
It   does so always when            the coil is clear, i.e., when      all the   turns
of the cord may         be   regarded  as  passing in the same direction round
a  common axis thrust through               the knot.       When     the coil is not
clear some of the cords of the plait are doubled back on them
selves.       Thus by drawing the plait from a given scheme                    we can
tell at   once whether one of its forms is a clear coil or not.
    From this point of view another notation for clear coils is given
in the form
                                   a y /3 a
                                   Pay (J    .  . . .

                      of Edinburgh,       Session 1876-77.                       243
Here o, p, y . . . are, in order, the several strings plaited — so that
in the coil /3 is the prolongation of a, y that of p, &c., and a that of
the   last of the series.    The expression            means    that a crosses over
                                                    ^
p.     It  is sometimes useful to indicate whether a crossing takes
place to the right or left.        This is      done by putting       + or  -   over
the symbol.        Thus the four crossings            above    may be more fully
written     as                  -i
                                       —

The properties of this notation             are    examined      in detail.    It  is
shown, that the combination just written cannot be simplified in
itself; but that
                           a y y a      _-     yy       .

This notation requires      care.   For instance, the          terms
                                     a a
                                     pp
are simply nugatory, and may be written                   off.  But, on the other
hand, the terms
                                     a    p
                                     P a
usually add to the beknottedness of the whole scheme.
   When the scheme is not compatible with                  a clear coil there occur
terms of the form
                                      a
                                      ai
and the application of this method becomes very troublesome.
   (a.) When the scheme has no merely nugatory intersections,
the most complete knotting is secured by alternate crossings above
and below;      or, as we may write,
                          A X B Y C                    &c.
                             -+ -+

                          +
and here there is no continuation         of sign.
   (J.)  Cases in which there is no knot at all may be obtained for
any scheme by making each letter positive on its first appearance.
The various coils are then, as it were, paid out over one another.
This   process  will give rise, in general,        to but few changes      of sign  :

but the number of such will usually               depend     upon the particular
intersection with which we commence the scheme.
    Additional  changes      of sign, still without any knotting,            may be
introduced by     various processes, of which the following                   is the
simplest: — When two letters appear together twice, not necessarily
in the same order, but with like signs, these signs may be changed.
Thus, the following parts of a scheme

 and the statements already made about               nugatory intersections         can
 be applied to these and other combinations               even   when they       occur
 separately once only in each of two separate                 knots on the        same
 cord.   This, and    a great number of similar theorems, allow of             a great
 special extension of the nugatory test already given — but                an exten
 sion which     cannot be       made     in any case until the signs of              the
 intersections are given as well as the order of their occurrence.
     Again, though, as has been           said above, continuations           of    sign
                          disappear when an intersection             is lost, it   does
                          not follow that      if  a scheme    have continuations
                          of sign it must necessarily be reducible.                 The
                          annexed     diagram is an excellent instance.                Its
                          scheme     contains fourteen continuations,                and
                          only twelve changes,          of sign, and yet the       knot
                          is irreducible.       But   if  we suppose    it cut   across
 twice at the single unsymmetrically              placed crossing, and the         ends
 joined so   as still  to preserve    continuity in the string, the            scheme
                           has  still fourteen continuations, but only                ten
                           changes, of sign ; and it does not involve                any
                           real beknottedness.
                              The    remaining         figure  illustrates     a fully
                           knotted scheme, where            there are no     continu
                           ations of sign, but in which the mere                change
 of sign of one of the intersections            produces four continuations             of
  sign, and the whole beknottedness dii-appears.                   Similar    remarks
  apply to most of the preceding figures.

    IV. A      great many other deductions from the fundamental                                pro
position are given — for instance,
    A   closed plane curve, intersecting itself, divides the plane into
separate areas whose                number is greater by            2   than the number of
intersections.
    Regarding the curve as                a   wall, dividing the plane into a number
of fields,     if   we walk along the wall and drop a coin into each field
as we reach          it,   each field     will get    as many coins as          it   has corners,
but those fields only will have                a   coin in each corner whose sides are
all described in the same direction round. The number of coins
is four times the number of intersections — and two coins are in
each corner bounded by sides                       by   each of which you enter — none
in these bounded by sides by each of which you leave.
    Cut off at any intersection and remove                         a    portion of the curve
forming      a   closed (not self-cutting)            circuit.     You thus abolish        an odd
number of intersections.                   Hence      if   there   is   an even        number of
coils, whether the whole be clear or not, there                         is   an odd number of
intersections, and vice versd.
  To form the symmetrical clear coil of two turns and of any (odd)
number of intersections, make the wire into   helix, and bring one  a
end through           the       axis in the same direction               as the helix (not in
the opposite direction, as in Ampere's Solenoids),                           then join the ends.
[The solenoidal arrangement, regarded from any point of view, has
only nugatory intersections.]   An excellent mode of forming this
coil    to twist
        is         long strip of paper through an odd number of
                            a
half-turns, and then paste its ends together, — the two longer edges
become parts of one continuous                        curve which        is   the clear coil in
question.           This result      is   applied to the study of the form of soap-
films obtained             by   Plateau's process on clear coils of wire.
  V. Another question treated    the numbers of possible arrange
                                                 is
ments of given numbers of intersections in which the cyclical order
of the letters in the             2nd, 4th, 6th, &c. places of the scheme shall be
the     same     as that in the 1st, 3rd, 5th,                   &c,    i.e, the alphabetical.
Instances        of such have already been given above.                           In   the first of
I   (6), for example, the letters in the even places are
                                           D  E  A    B    C.
Here the cyclical order of the alphabet                            is   maintained,      but   A   is
postponed by two places.

246                 Proceed in tjs of  the   Royal Society
   Whatever be the number of intersections a postponement of no
places leads to nugatory results.
   A postponement of        one place    is possible    for three and for four
intersections only.
   Postponement of two places is possible only for (four), five, and
eight — three for seven and ten — four for nine and fourteen — five
for (eight), eleven and sixteen, — six for (ten), thirteen, and twenty,
&c. Generally there are in all cases n postponements                   for 2n + 1
intersections   : — and for   3n +2, or      3n  + 1  intersections, according
as n is even or odd.      The numbers which are italicised            and put in
brackets   above, arise from the fact that a postponement of r places,
when there are n intersections, gives the same result as a postpone
ment of    n-r-1      places.    [It will    be observed      that this cyclical
order of the letters in the even       places    is possible for any number
of intersections which is not       6 or a   multiple of 6.]
   When there are n postponements              with 2n+l intersections          the
curve is the symmetrical         double coil — i.e., the plait       is a simple
twist.
   The case with 3n        + 2  or 3n +    1  intersections is a clear coil      of
three turns, corresponding to a regular plait of three strands.
   VI.   Numerous examples are given of the application of                 various
methods    of reduction.      For instance,     the scheme

3.    On the Distribution of Volcanic Debris over the Floor of
     the Ocean, — its Character, Source, and some of the Pro
     ducts of its Disintegration and Decomposition. By John
     Murray, Esq. Communicated by Sir C. Wy ville Thomson.
     During the present             session   I   propose   to lay before   the Society
several papers on subjects connected with the deposits which were
found      at the bottom of the oceans and seas visited by H.M.S.
Challenger in the             years 1872, 1873, 1874, 1875, and 1876.
      Instruments in          use   for obtaining information of       the Deposits.
     It   will   be convenient to introduce this first communication                   with
a    brief description of the instruments and methods employed                           on
board      II.M.S. Challenger with the view of obtaining information
and specimens of these ocean deposits.                        The instrument in        most
frequent use was the tube or cylinder forming part of the sounding
 apparatus.
     During the first six months of the cruise this cylinder                     was one
 having less than an inch bore, and was so arranged                     w   ith respect to
 the weights or sinkers that it projected about six inches beneath
 them.    The lower end of the cylinder                      was fitted with a common
 butterfly valve. This arrangement gave                      us a very small sample      of
 the bottom.
     In July           1873   this small cylinder was replaced by one having              a
 two-inch bore, and            it   was also made to project      fully eighteen inches
 below the weights.                 This   was a great improvement, as it gave a
 much greater quantity of the bottom in most soundings.
     The tube          was, in the clays, frequently forced nearly two feet into
 the bottom.             On its return to the ship, the butterfly valves were
 removed,        and a roll of the clay or mud, sometimes eighteen inches
 in length, could be forced from it.                   In   this way we learned that
 the deeper layers were very frequently different from those occupy
 ing the surface.
      In   the organic oozes — as the filobigerina,             Pteropod, Radiolarian,
 and Diatom oozes — the                tube did not usually penetrate the bottom
 over six or seven inches, these deposits offering more resistance than
 the clays and muds.            Occasionally the tube came up without any
 thing in        it,   but the outside was marked with streaks of the black

248                        Proceeding* of       the    Iioyal Society
oxide of manganese.                In about thirteen out of nearly four hundred
soundings we did not get any information of a reliable nature about
the deposit.
   The dredge in use was                a   heavy modification of Ball's naturalists'
dredge, and the trawl was the ordinary beam trawl of the fishermen.
  Both of these instruments had generally a bag of canvas or other
coarse cloth sewed into the bottom                      of the netting, to prevent             the
soft clay or ooze from being entirely washed out.                           In   this way we,
at many stations,             got, along with           animals, a large quantity               of
ooze, clay, stones, or manganese                 nodules.
  While trawling or dredging                   the ship often shifted her position a
mile or two, but we could not tell whether the dredge or trawl had
been   working         over all that distance, or had                 merely taken a dip
into the deposits.               This should      be    remembered         when comparing
the captures in one locality                with those of another.
  Altogether there is much uncertainty about the behaviour of the
trawl and dredge             in deep water.            It    occasionally    happened       that
when      the greatest         care was taken, and             when   it   was believed that
the trawl had been dragging for some                         hours, it came up without
anything in                or any evidence upon              or in the attached
                  it it,
                                                        it                              tow-nets
to show that               had been on the bottom.
  During        the last year of the cruise            a    tow-net was attached          to the
dredging line just below the weights, which last were placed                               a   few
hundred fathoms in front of the trawl or dredge.                             Tow-nets       were
also   attached to the trawl and dredge.                          These nets frequently
came up nearly        full of mud, and almost always contained minute
things and       fragments from the surface layers of the bottom.
  At times the water-bottle attached                        to the sounding      line   came up
with clay or ooze in             it,   or had some      of    the deposit adhering to its
under- surface.
  These then were the means and methods employed for getting
information concerning ocean deposits, and collectively they have
furnished us with            a   large amount of material.            A    careful examina
tion of the specimens procured has already much increased                                      our
knowledge of the nature and distribution of ocean deposits, of                                 the
sources    of   the materials           of which       they are built up, and of the
chemical processes taking place                  in   the deep waters and on the floor
of the ocean.

   The Volcanic Debris in       Ocean Deposits      and  some   of the Products
                  of its Disintegration and Decomposition.
    In  a preliminary      report to Professor Wyville          Thomson, which
has been published in the Proceedings                of the Royal Society of
London,      I  pointed out the wide-spread distribution of volcanic
debris in    ocean deposits and its probable influence in the formation
of deep    sea clays, and manganese          nodules or depositions.        In this
         I
paper propose to treat of these subjects in more detail, and to
give some of the results of observations which have been made
since the above report was written.
                                  Pumice Stones.
     The form of volcanic debris most frequently met with in                  ocean
deposits is pumice stone.
     Specimens of these stones, varying from the size of a pea to that
 of   a foot-ball,   have    been    taken in dredging        at   eighty of our
 stations.     I have   placed   the position of these stations on           a map,
 from which it will be seen that they occur all along our route.
     Near volcanic centres        the   dredge has frequently brought them
 up in great numbers, as off the Azores in the Atlantic, off New
 Zealand and the Kermadec             Islands, at several places       among the
 Philippine Islands, off the coast of Japan, and elsewhere.              As   a rule,
 they are    not numerous in shore           deposits when     these   are distant
 from volcanic regions.          In deposits far from land they           are most
 abundant in deep-sea clays, from which the shells and skeletons of
 surface organisms have been all or nearly all removed.
     In  the North Pacific the trawl brought up bushels of them from
  depths of 2300 and 2900 fathoms.              Perhaps in no single instance
  have we trawled successfully on any of our deep-sea               clays without
 getting numbers of       these stones.       If there  be an exception      it is in
 the North Atlantic.         But   here   it  is to be remembered       that while
  we were investigating        the conditions      of  the  North Atlantic our
  attention had not yet been directed to the importance of detecting
  the presence of pumice, and we have not preserved such large
  samples of the North Atlantic deposits as of those of other regions.
     On   the whole, pumice stones are more numerous in the Pacific
  than in the Atlantic deposits.
      In the Globigerina     and other organic oozes, they are abundau

 250                 Proceedings of      the Royal Society
 or otherwise according as the deposit is near or far removed           from
 volcanoes.     In   these oozes they never occur so abundantly     as in the
 clays.    They  are more or less masked and covered up by the accumu
 lated remains of foraminifera, diatoms, or other surface organisms.
 In like manner they       are obscured in shore deposits by river and coast
 detritus.    Besides those specimens which are sufficiently large           to
 be  examined by the hand, we detected with the microscope             minute
 particles of feldspar in all our ocean deposits.
    An inspection of the specimens which I have placed on the table
 will show that the majority of these pumice stones have a rolled
 appearance.      Some    of them    have undergone much decomposition,
 while others are little altered.       Some are coated with the peroxide
 of manganese,     or have streaks of this substance running through
 them.      They   are   the  most   frequent nucleus of the manganese
 nodules, to which      I shall presently refer.    Some    specimens which
 were dredged      from    a depth of over three miles will, when       dried,
 float for weeks in a basin of water; others, which have undergone
 partial decomposition, sink at once.
    They present      a great variety of texture and composition.       They
 are white, grey, green, or black in colour.          They   are highly  vesi
 cular, or rat her compact and fibrous.      There would appear to   be every
 gradation from common          feldspathic to dark green pyroxenic kinds.
    We   find in them crystals of sanidin, augite, hornblende, olivine,
quartz, lucite, magnetite, and titaniferous iron.          Magnetic iron    ore
was found in     all  the specimens examined, either in crystals or in the
form of dust.        The other minerals vary in kind and abundance in
the different specimens. The same crystals which we find in the
pumice occur in all the kinds of ocean deposits.
                         Sources  of the Pumice  Stones.
    The pumice stones which we find at the bottom of the sea have
most   likely all  been formed in the air.       Some    of them may     have
fallen upon the sea; but the great majority seem to have fallen             on
land, and been subsequently washed and floated out to sea by rains
and rivers.     After floating    about for a longer or shorter time they
have become water-logged and have sunk to the bottom.                Both    in
the North Atlantic and Pacific small pieces of pumice were several
times taken on the surface of the ocean by means of the tow-net.

Over the surface of some of these serpulae and algae were growing,
and crystals of sinadin projected, or were imbedded in the feldspar.
During our visit       to Ascension   there was    a very heavy fall of rain,
such     as had not been      experienced    by the inhabitants        for many
years.      For several days after, many pieces of        scoriae, cinders, and
the like were noticed floating about on the surface of the sea near
the island. Such fragments may be transported to great distances
by currents.
     On the shores of Bermuda, where the rock is composed of blown
calcareous sand, we picked up fragments of travelled volcanic rocks.
The same observation         was made by General      Nelson   at the Bahamas.
Mr Darwin noticed pieces of pumice on the shore of Patagonia, and
Prof. L. Agassiz and his companions noticed them on the reefs of
Brazil.      During     a recent eruption    in Iceland, the ferry of      a river
 is said to have been blocked for several day by the large quantity
 of pumice floating down the river and out to sea. All the pumice
 which we find need not be of quite recent origin. Mr Bates informs
 me    that great quantities of pumice         are  continually being floated
 down the Amazon.           These come from near the foot of the Andes,
 where the head- waters cut their way through fields of pumice stones.
 In the province of Wellington, New Zealand, two of the rivers run
 through     areas covered with     pumice, and during floods         bear   great
 quantities out to sea.
     Prof. Alex. Agassiz      has kindly furnished     me with    the following
  note  :—
     "The river Chile, which flows through Arequipa, Peru,                has cut
  its way for some thirty miles through             the extensive    deposits of
  volcanic ashes which form the base of the extinct volcano Misti.
  Some of the gorges are even          500 feet in depth, forming         regular
  canons.     The whole length      of the river bottom is covered by well-
  rolled pieces of pumice from the size of a walnut to that of a man's
  head.     In the dry season (winter) there is but little water flowing,
 but in the summer, or rainy           season,   the river, which    has   a  very
 considerable     fall (7000 feet in a distance of about 90 miles), drives
  down annually a large mass of these rolled pumice stones to the
  Pacific. The volcanic ashes are not recent. There is no tradition
  among the Indians of any eruption within historic times."

                                                Volcanic Ashes.
      Near volcanic centres, and sometimes at great distances                               from
land, we find much volcanic matter in a very fine state of division
at the bottom                  of the sea.        This consists of minute particles             of
feldspar, hornblende, augite, olivine, magnetite, and other volcanic
minerals.               In    the South Pacific, many hundred               miles from land,
and from a depth of 2300 fathoms, the trawl brought up a number
of pieces of tufa entirely composed of these comminuted fragments.
These particles appear to me to have been carried to the                                   areas
where we find them, by winds, in the form                            of what     is known       as
volcanic dust or ashes.                     Sir Rawson Rawson sent            to Sir Wyville
Thomson             a   packet of    the volcanic ashes which fell on the Island of
Barbadoes, after an eruption in 1812 on the Island of St Vincent,
W.     I.,   one hundred and sixty miles distant.                 I   have examined this,
and find        it      made up     of fragments of        the same character as those        in
the tufa to which              I    have   just referred, some of the particles            being
perhaps         a   little larger.         We have sometimes found this ash            in   con
siderable abundance mixed up with the shells in                         a   globigerina    ooze.
In    the deposits             for hundreds of miles about the Sandwich Islands
there are many fragments of pyroxenic lava, which                           I   believe have
been borne by the winds, either as ashes, or in the form                       of Pele's   hair.
      At Honolulu              we were informed that threads           of Pele's hair       were
picked up in the gardens there after an eruption of Kilauea,                                 one
hundred^and              eighty miles from the volcano.              This Pele's hair      bears
along with              it   small crystals of olivine.
                                  Obsidian and Lava Fragments.
      Small pieces of obsidian and of feldspathic and basaltic lavas                       were
frequently found in deposits near volcanic islands.
      At   two stations in tho South Pacific, many hundred                       miles     from
land, we dredged pieces of this nature of considerable size                               larger
than ordinary marbles.                     It   is   difficult to account for the transfer
ence       of   these         fragments to the places where they were found.                 It
is,   however, in this region, and this alone, that                   it   may be   necessary
to bring in             a    submarine eruption to account for the condition                  of
things at the bottom.

    A consideration        of these observations, and the specimens       which
are   laid on      the table, will,   I think, justify the conclusion that vol
canic materials, either in the form of pumice-stones, ashes,            or other
fragments, are universally distributed in ocean deposits.
    They have        been found abundantly or otherwise in our dredgings,
according       as these have been near or far from volcanoes, or as there
has been much or little river and coast detritus, or few or many re
mains of surface organisms in the             deposits.
      Some    of the Products of the Decomposition of Volcanic Debris.
     Clay. — Pure clay, as is well known, is a product of the decom
 position of feldspar, and         the clay which we find in ocean      deposits
 appears to have had a similar origin.
     In   the deposits      far from land the greater part of the clay origi
 nates,    I  believe, from the decomposition of the feldspar of frag-
 mental volcanic material, which            we have seen to be so   universally
 distributed.
      Pumice-stone      is largely made up of feldspar, and from its areolar
  structure is peculiarly       liable to decomposition.      Being permeated
  by sea water holding carbonic acid in solution, a part of the silica
  and the alkalies are carried away, water is taken up, and          a hydra ted
  silicate of alumina or clay results.
      Like   most clays our ocean clays contain many impurities,           these
  last being as varied as the sources            whence   the  materials of the
  deposits are derived.
      Let  us briefly enumerate the sources of these materials.
      We   have   first the matters derived from the wear        of coasts, and
  those brought to the sea by rivers, either in a state        of suspension   or
  solution.     The material in suspension       appears to be almost entirely
  deposited     within two hundred miles of the land.
      Where great rivers enter the sea, and where we have strong cur
  rents, as in the North Atlantic, some of the fine detritus may              be
  carried to a greater distance, but its amount can never be very
  large.     In  oceans    affected   with floating ice we have land debris
  carried to greater distances        than above stated; for instance we can
  detect   such materials in the deposits of the North Atlantic as far
 south as the 40th parallel N., and in the South Pacific as far north
  as the 40th parallel S.

 254                Proceedings       of the Royal Society
    Some of the substances       in solution,  as  carbonate of lime and       silica,
 are extracted     by animals and plants to form their shells and                 ske
 letons ;  these last,   falling   to the bottom,    form a globigerina,       a ple-
 ropod, a radiolarian, or a diatom ooze.             We   have also the bones of
 mammals and fish mixed up in different kinds of deposits.                    These,
 as  well  as  animal and vegetable tissues, generally are a source of
 phosphates, fluorides, some oxide of iron, and possibly of other inor
 ganic material.
    Sir Wyville Thomson, early in          the cruise, suggested         that much
 of the inorganic material in deposits is derived from the source                    to
 which   I  have  just alluded.        Our subsequent       observations have,         I
 think, shown that originally Sir Wyville gave too much                 importance
 to this as a source of the materials in our deep deposits.
    Second.  — We    have     the dust of deserts, which is carried great
distances by the winds, and which, falling upon the ocean, sinks                     to
the bottom     and adds to the depositions taking place.              In   the trade
wind regions of the North Atlantic we have a very red-coloured
clay, in deep water, which is largely            made     up of dust from          the
Sahara.      Such dust frequently falls in this region as what is called
blood-rain.
    Third. — We    have the loose volcanic         materials, which have        been
shown    to be universally      distributed  as   floating pumice, or as ashes
carried by the wind.
    This short review      shows that the clay in shore deposits is chiefly
derived from     river and coast detritus.           As   we pass beyond       about
one hundred and        fifty   miles from the shores of          a  continent     the
character of the clayey matter changes.                 It  loses its usual      blue
colour, and becomes reddish or brown, and particles of mica                       and
rounded pieces of quartz give place to pumice, crystals of sanidin,
augite, olivine, &c.        All   this goes,  I  think,   to show that in depo
sits far from land the clay is chiefly derived from volcanic debris,
though in the region of the North Atlantic trade winds much of it
may be derived from the feldspar in the dust of the Sahara.
    The pumice which floats about          on the surface of the sea must
be continually      weathering, and the         clay which      results and tie
ciystals which it contains will fall to the bottom, mingling with
the deposit which is in course of formation.             In our    purest globigo-
rina. ooze this clay and these crystals are present.              If a  few of the

                      of Edinburgh,      Session     1876-77.                       255
shells, say thirty foraminifera, are taken from such a deposit, and
carefully washed, and then dissolved away with weak acid, a residue
remains which is red-brown or grey in colour, according to the
region from which the          ooze came.     If  the same number of shells
be    collected    from   the surface and dissolved away in the same
manner,       no  perceptible residue is observed.              The clayey matter
would therefore        seem    to have infiltrated     into the shells soon after
they fell to the bottom.
    I  have already mentioned several instances                    of  pumice-stones
having     been found on coral reefs.         Many      more     instances could     be
given.      These stones, undergoing disintegration               in these positions,
add clay, crystals of augite, hornblende, magnetic iron ore, &c.,
to the limestones which the coral animals are                 building    up.
    I  have found these crystals in the limestones and red earth of
Bermuda, and in         a specimen of the limestone from Jamaica.
    This observation, it      appears   to me, points out that the red earth
of Bermuda, Bahamas, Jamaica, and some other limestones, may
originally      have   been    largely   derived     from     fragmental      volcanic
 materials, which were carried to the limestone                    while yet in the
 course   of formation.      There are also small particles of the peroxide
of manganese in the         red earth of Bermuda.
                             Peroxide   of Manganese.
    Peroxide of Manganese occurs widely in                  ocean deposits,     either
 as nodules, incrustations,        or as depositions        on the     bottom    itself.
 It  has been found most frequently in the nodular form in the deep-
 sea clays far from land.         It also occurs    in the organic oozes, when
 these contain much volcanic debris, or are near volcanic centres.
    In shallow      water, near some       volcanic      islands, it covers     shells
 and pieces     of coral or pumice with      a light brown incrustation.              It
 has   been    met with      very sparingly,     if   at   all,   in shore deposits
 removed     from volcanic centres.
    In my preliminary report         above referred to,       I  stated that further
 investigation     might show that manganese nodules and depositions
 abound in these        regions where we       ^have      much of the debris of
 augitic or heavy lavas.
    A re-examination        of specimens since our return confirms this
 view.     Wherever       we  have    pumice containing            much magnetite,

256                           Proceedings      of the Royal             Society
olivine,        augite, or hornblende, and these apparently undergoing
decomposition and alteration, or where we have evidence                                       of great
showers             of volcanic      ash, there         we find the manganese               in greatest
abundance.               This correspondence                between     the distribution of              the
manganese             and volcanic debris appears                 to me very significant of
the origin of the former.                    I regard        the manganese,           as we find          it,
as one         of   the secondary      products arising from the decomposition                            of
volcanic minerals.
      Manganese          is   as   frequent    as       iron in lavas, being usually                asso
ciated with            it,   though in very much smaller amount.                       In   magnetite
and in some varieties of augite and hornblende the protoxide                                              of
iron is at times partially replaced                         by that of manganese.
     In the         manganese        of these minerals, and in the carbonic                          acid
and oxygen             of    ocean waters, we have the requisite                      conditions         fur
the decomposition of the minerals, the solution                                of   the manganese,
and its subsequent deposition as                        a   peroxide.
     The carbonic acid converts the silicates of the protoxides
                                                                                                          of of
manganese,             and     the protoxides of manganese                      into carbonate
manganese,             and thus prepares           the way for oxidation by the oxygen
of the water.
     It   is   probable that the action of the carbonic acid is'not                          apparent,
and that the manganese                  is   at once deposited           as   a   high oxide       if    not
as   the peroxide.             This theory         is   essentially the same          as    that   which
Bischof gives for manganese                    ores generally.          I     have laid     a   series    of
these manganese                depositions on the table.                An inspection of           these
and their localities               will show that in the clays                and oozes the depo
sitions are nodular in form.                   If   a    section be made of one of                 these,
a    number of concentric layers will                        be observed       arranged around            a
central nucleus — the same                    as    in   a    urinary    calculus.          When         the
peroxide of manganese                   is    removed          by strong hydrochloric               acid,
there remains           a    clayey skeleton which still more strongly                      resembles
a    urinary calculus.
     This skeleton contains crystals of olivine, quartz, augite,                                magne
tite or any other materials which were contained in the clay                                        from
which          the nodule was taken.                    In the    process         of its    deposition
around         a    nucleus, the peroxide of manganese                          has   inclosed       and
incorporated in the nodule the clay and crystals and other materials
in which the nucleus was imbedded.       The clayey skeleton thus

many fine sandy particles usually fall to                 pieces.      Mr Buchanan
informs me that the purest portions of these nodules, that is those
portions made up of closely packed concentric layers, contain from
30 to 34 per cent, of the peroxide.
  Taking      the nodule as a whole,      it will of   course contain very much
less than this.       The nucleus varies in      each nodule, 'and that part of
a nodule which is made up of concentric layers  will vary with each
locality, and with the depth from which it comes. We may expect
therefore that analysis will show considerable variations -in the
amount of alumina, silica, and metals, lime, &c., in the nodules
from different stations.         At   some places in the Pacific               the nodules
show periods of deposition very distinctly.                We       have       first a very
compact nodule which may have              a   shark's tooth for a nucleus, and
which appears          to have   been   formed slowly.          Then there would
seem to have been         a shower of ashes.           After    a    time manganese
was again deposited, inclosing in the nodule a layer of these ashes.
The most frequent nucleus in the nodules                 is a piece        of pumice or
other volcanic fragment.
  In    deep-sea clays, far from land, sharks' teeth, ear-bones                  of whales,
and fragments of other bones are very often the nucleus around
which    the manganese is deposited.  In one instance a piece of
siliceous sponge forms the nucleus.  In a globigerina ooze a por
tion of the deposit has apparently formed the nucleus. In these
we have perfect casts of the foraminifera,              but all the carbonate            of
lime has been removed.                The volcanic fragments               which       have
formed the nuclei of nodules appear frequently                 to have undergone
peculiar alterations.        For instance, obsidian         is usually surrounded
by beautiful     agate bands.
  When        we found the bottom composed             almost entirely of volcanic
ashes, or so hard from other reasons that the sounding tube did not
penetrate      it,
                the manganese    was deposited in layers over the
bottom itself.        Large pieces of this nature were taken several times.
  The    escape of carbonic acid through the. floor of the                     ocean   near
volcanic islands may in these regions greatly accelerate                          the pro
cesses which         end in the deposition of the peroxide of manganese,

                        Native Iron and Cvsmic DuM.
   While examining         the deposits during         the cruise   I   frequently
observed     among the magnetic particles from our deep-sea                    clays
small round black coloured particles which were attracted by                      the
magnet,    and   I  found it difficult to account for the origin of          these.
   On our return home        I  entered   into a more careful examination
of the magnetic particles.            By    means     of   a  magnet      carefully
covered    with paper     I  extracted these particles from the deposits,
from the pumice-stones, and from the manganese                 nodules of many
regions.      The    great majority       of  these     magnetic    particles     are
magnetic iron ore and           titauiferotis   iron, either in      the   form     of
crystals, or   as  fine dust.  In the clays,   and in the manganese         nodules
from stations far from land and in deep water, there were again
noticed many small, round spheres among the magnetic particles.
   On mentioning        this to Professor       Geikie, he suggested         that    I
should try the method employed by Professor Andrews of Belfast
for detecting minute particles of native iron.
    This  process consists    in moistening the magnetic particles, which
have been extracted by means of the magnet, with an acid solution
of sulphate of copper, when           copper   is at once     deposited     on any
native particles which may be present.             In this way   I have detected
native iron in many of our deposits,             in the powdered       portions of
manganese      nodules, and in pumice-stones.
    Professor Andrews tells me that there can be little doubt                    that
 the particles on which copper is deposited            are native iron, as he     has
 found that it is not deposited        on nickel, and the chances of cobalt
 being present      are very slight.       Professor Andrews warned           me on
 the extreme precautions necessary in conducting these observations,
 that no iron from a hammer or other instrument should get                    at the
 specimen under observation.
    It is true that all specimens of our deposits have             been obtained
 by means of dredges        and    iron gear, and       some  of  these    particles
 may be from this source.
    Many of the particles must have another origin.                 I  have taken
 two of our manganese        nodules, and washing them carefully, taking

                        of Edinburgh, Session 1870-77.                          259
care to     let no iron instrument      come near them, have        broken them
by    rapping them together.          Then taking only the interior parts of
these nodules        I have pulverized them in a porcelain         mortar.      The
magnetic       particles were afterwards extracted by a magnet covered
with paper.         Now, placing these particles on         a glass   slide under
the microscope, and adding the sulphate of copper solution, there
was     in  a few moments a deposit of copper on several           small perfect
spherules, varying in size from the 10\|6 to the                  of an inch in
diameter.        I have placed some of these spherules under the micro
 scope and now show them to the             Society.    It will  be  noticed that
 on     one the copper is not deposited all over             the sphere, but in
 ramified spider-like lines.        On the cut surface of a meteorite, from
 Professor      Sir Wyville    Thomson's     collection, which    I  also exhibit,
 the copper is precipitated        in precisely the same manner as on the
 little sphere from        the manganese      nodule.   Besides the spherules
 on which the copper is deposited,           there are others generally of         a
 larger size and dark colour.            These are, so far as microscopic ex
 amination shows, quite like the particles on the mammillated outer
  surface of this Cape meteorite, also from Sir Wyville's collection.
      These spherules have hitherto only been noticed in those deposits
  in deep water far from land, and where for many reasons we believe
  the rate of formation of deposits to be very slow.
      They occur also only in        those  manganese      nodules which come
  from the same deep-sea        clays or deposits far from land.
      The particles of native iron found in pumice-stones are not
  numerous, and never take the form of spherules so far as observed.
  Some of these particles of native iron may then come from the
  dredge.       Other particles come from the pumice and             the    volcanic
   materials.     Professor Andrews long since showed that minute par
   ticles of native iron existed in basalt and other rocks.            And lastly
   the spherules       of which   I   have  been speaking      appear     to have a
   cosmic origin.
       The   reason,   for these spherules occurring only in deposits far
   from land and in deep water,          may be more apparent by reference
   to   the annexed diagram, which           might   represent    a section from
   the west coast      of South America out into        the   Pacific 500 miles.
   Along the shores of the continent            as at a we have an accumu
  lation of river and coast detritus.            At   I  in depths from         1400

 to 2200 fathoms we have a globigerina ooze mostly made up                   of sur
 face shells.     At   c,  in a depth of 2300 to 3000 fathoms, all the surface
 shells are removed from the bottom. No coast detritus reaches this
 area, and we       find in the deposit pumice stones,              some   volcanic
 ashes, manganese           nodules, sharks' teeth, and ear bones of whales.
 It  is only in areas       like this that   we find sharks' teeth and ear bones
 of   cetaceans    in any numbers.            Some of them from the same haul
 are deeply surrounded with               manganese    deposit, and contain little
 animal matter       ;    while others have no deposit on them, and seem
 quite recent.       These, and other facts which might be mentioned,
 all argue for an exceedingly slow rate of deposition.                Now it is    in
 these    same    areas       that   the   spherules of   native iron and other
 magnetic spherules are found, both in the deposits and                     in   the
 manganese       nodules from them.
    Finding    them in this situation favours the idea that they are of
cosmic origin, for in such places they are least likely to be covered
up or washed away.              It is certainly difficult to understand why the
spherules on which the copper is precipitated                   have not become
oxidised.      If nickel       be present in them, this may retard oxidation
to some extent.
    The   manganese         depositions in our ocean deposits are very dif
ferent in structure and composition from any of the ores of man
ganese     I have had an opportunity             of examining, and the deposits
of the deep sea far from land have not, so far as               I know, any equi
valents in the geological series of rocks.
    All  the subjects treated          of in this paper are still under investiga
tion, and at some future time                 I  hope  to present a much     more
detailed account.
    These observations seem to me to give ground for the following
conclusions    : —

                      of Edinburgh, Semon 1S76-77.
   First, That volcanic debris, either in the form of pumice              stones,
ashes, or ejected fragments, are universally            distributed   in   ocean
deposits.
   Second,     That pumice      stones   are continually   being carried into
the   sea by rivers and rains, and are constantly floating          on the sur
face of the ocean far from land.
    Third, That      the clayey matter in deposits far from land is prin
cipally derived from the decomposition of the feldspar in fragmental
volcanic rocks, though in the trade wind region of the North
Atlantic the dust of the Sahara contributes much material for
clay.
    Fourth,     That the     red   earth of Bermuda, Bahamas, Jamaica,
and other limestone countries, is most probably originally derived
from      the decomposition       of pumice stone,    while these limestones
were in the process of formation.
    Fifth, That the peroxide of manganese is probably a secondary
 product of the decomposition of the volcanic rocks and minerals
 present in the areas where the nodules of manganese             are found.
    Sixth, That there are many minute            particles of native iron in
 deposits far from land; that some of these particles are little sphe
 rules  ;   that these last, as well as some other spherules which are
 magnetic, have probably         a  cosmic origin.
    Seventh,     That the peroxide of         manganese    depositions in the
 deep sea are different       in structure and composition        from known
 ores  of   manganese.
    Eighth.   — That   we do not appear to have equivalents of the rocks,
 now forming in the deep sea far from land, in the geological series.
    In conclusion,     I  have to acknowledge much assistance           in these
 investigations from all my colleagues, especially my indebtedness to
 Sir Wyville Thomson and Mr Buchanan.
    Since my return      I have   received many hints from Professors Tait,
 (xeikie, Turner, Dr Purves,         Mr Morrison,  and other gentlemen.
    In  much of the mechanical work which an examination of these
 deposits has entailed,       I have, both during the cruise and since my
 return, had the assistance        of Frederick Pearcey.

Survey of Scotland).
    The following is new to     science.
               Nematoptychius    gracilis, sp. nov. Traquair.
    Of   this  two   specimens have       occurred at Gilmerton.            The
 more perfect of these, compressed        on its side, displays      the entire
 contour of the fish, including all the fins, and measures          9 inches in
total length, by    1J inch in depth     between     the  head   and the ven-
trals; the length of the      head    is contained about 4£ times in the
total. The ventral fins       arise   opposite a point      3i  inches distant
from the tip of the snout    ;  the commencement of the anal is mid
way    between   that of the ventral and of the caudal;           the dorsal   is
situated nearlyopposite the anal, commencing only            J inch in front of
it. The form of the fish is thus elongated and slender, gradually
tapering from behind the shoulder towards the tail, the dorsal fin
being situated very far back.        The other and slightly longer          spe

                        of Edinburgh, Session 1876-77.                            263
cimen lies compressed          on its back, and shows         the under surface of
the head, both pectoral and both ventral fins, with traces                    also of
the dorsal, anal, and caudal.              Its length is 9J inches, but the fish
must originally have been a            little longer, as its caudal extremity is
imperfect.
    The scales      are very small, and much disarranged, as is the case
in nearly all the        fishes occurring in the same bed, but their            confi
guration is apparently the same as in N. Greenockii, and their ex
ternal ornamentation consists,            as in that species, of very fine oblique,
thread-like, branching,         and anastomising ridges;          the median ridge-
scales, extending from behind the dorsal fin along the upper margin
of the caudal body- prolongation, are very large and pronounced.
The bones of        the head are much crushed and broken, so that only
a few    of  them can be made out.             The suspensorium is very oblique
 and the gape extensive, the length of the lower jaw being, in the
 first mentioned        specimen,    li    inch.    The external surface of        the
 lower jaw is ornamented with a minute and very close tubercula-
 tion; the dental margin of the maxilla is also tuberculated, but                  the
 rest of its surface is marked with delicate ridges, which run for                 the
 most part parallel with its superior and posterior margins.                   Large
 conical teeth occur in both jaws, with a few of the external                   series
 of smaller ones. One of the larger teeth in the mandible of                   speci
 men No. 2 measures a little over            J  inch in length by        in diameter
 at the base; its form is regularly               and  acutely conical, with well-
 marked smooth enamel-cap at the apex, below which the surface
 is   delicately    and    beautifully     striated, the stria) being more pro
 nounced than is usually the case in N. Greenockii.                  The opercular
 bones are not visible, but some of the branchiostegal                  rays may    be
 detected    ;   their outer surfaces are ornamented by very fine flexuous
  ridges.     The paired fins      are moderate       in size ; indeed they might
  safely be termed small.          The pectoral of No.        1 measures    one inch
  in length    ;  in neither specimen can its number of rays be ascer
  tained, but it is evident that the principal ones were unarticulated
  for about ^ of their length.           The length of the ventral in the first
  specimen is £ inch ; its rays, probably 25 in number, are delicate,
  smooth, and with their transverse articulations rather far apart.
  The dorsal and anal fins        resemble      each other in form, but the latter
  is apparently       slightly  the   larger; both      are triangular,   acuminate,

 264                   Proceedings        of the Royal Society
high in front, with concavely cut out posterior margin;                  the height
of the dorsal in front is        1^ inch, its base of origin is disturbed        ;    the
apex of the anal is imperfect, its base                measures     £ inch. Their
rays are numerous, slender, and smooth, dichotomising only near
their extremities, and having their transverse articulations compa
ratively distant.         The caudal,     as  it lies  before    us, can hardly be
called   inequilobate,        but   as   the upper      lobe    appears    somewhat
crumpled, its entire length            is probably     not accurately exhibited.
It  is deeply bifurcated, the lower lobe            being narrow and of great
length, measuring          If inch, though its extreme point is cut off            ;   its
 rays are like those of the dorsal and anal, being slender, smooth,
and with rather distant articulations,             the joints being at first more
than twice      as broad,    but getting a little closer towards the end of
the rays   ;  in the upper lobe the rays are, as usual, short and very
delicate.      Small and closely set fulcra are observable on the ante
 rior margin of all the fins.
    Remarks.    — It  is  of course at once evident that the present species
is closely allied to the powerful Nematoptychius                Greenockii,   Ag.    sp.,
of the 'Wardie Shales;          it differs, however, from the latter in several
particulars beside       its smaller size. The transverse articulations of
all the fin-rays are considerably more distant                ;   and the principal
rays of the pectoral are unarticulated             for a greater distance than          is
the case in N. Greenockii.            The form of the laniary teeth differs
also  somewhat in the two species.              In N. gracilis these are more
regularly conical, gradually           tapering from the base to the apex;
whereas    in N. Greenockii they assume a more slender form, owing
to the more sudden          narrowing of the base upwards into the body
of the tooth, although          the relative proportion of the diameter                 of
the base to the length of the tooth is about the same.                  The   specific
name    "gracilis"       is bestowed      on the present species in allusion to
the slender and elegant shape of the body.
    Geological    Position and Locality.      — The two specimens           above de
scribed were found in the blackband ironstone at present wrought
in Venturefair       Colliery,    Gilmerton, near Edinburgh,           and are both
preserved    in the Museum of Science and Art, Edinburgh.                         This
ironstone, well known for its Rhizodus remains, is a member of                       the

     The body is fusiform, the            scales    rather large, rhomboidal, orna
mented        with striae and         punctures,        sometimes     nearly     perfectly
smooth.         Rays of pectoral fin articulated;             base  of ventials short;
dorsal and anal large, triangular, dorsal situated behind                      the middle
of the back so that the middle of its base is opposite the                    commence
ment of the anal          ; caudal following          closely on the anal, powerful
and deeply cleft with well developed body-prolongation along the
upper lobe;         rays in all the         fins numerous, and closely jointed.
Suspensorium           not quite       so    oblique      as   in  PaUconiscus,       Elun-

 Amblypterus ;         operculum large, oblong, suboperculum wanting,
 interoperculum * quadrate ; branch iostegal rays numerous, with a
 median lozenge-shaped plate behind the symphysis of the mandible.
 Jaws stout       ;  teeth   closely set and of very peculiar form, being
 cylindro-conical,       first inclined slightly inwards, then bent outwards
 at an obtuse angle, the apex coming then by another curvature to
 point upwards (or downwards in the case of the upper jaw).

 another and smaller plate, which I interpret as "suboperculum," and which
 is wanting in most of the genera of this family.            (See the author's account of

rounded snout       ;    the external ornament of the bones of the               cranium
proper is rugose in character.              The operculum          is oblong, broader
above    than below,          and ornamented with             delicate ridges which
radiate from the anterior-superior angle downwards and                         backwards
over its surface       ;  the interoperculum        is nearly square, and marked
with ridges which for the most part pass horizontally over its                     surface
from before backwards; the praeoperoulum                    is well developed.          The
jaws are stout; the broad part of the maxilla                    is ornamented         with
delicate and not very closely placed                 branching     and anastomosing
ridges, which for the most part tend to run parallel with its superior
and posterior borders          ; the striation      of the mandible         is close, the
ridges running           longitudinally, but the dentary margin                  is finely
tuberculated.          The teeth with which the jaws are armed                   are most
peculiar in form and arrangement                ;  they are about             to  ^     inch
in   length, slender-cylindrical            in    shape,   but suddenly          narrowed
near the extremity to a sharply conical apex.                     Each tooth        is first
inclined   a  little inwards, then bent outwards                at an    obtuse      angle,
and again bent so that the apex comes to point upwards (or down
wards    in    the case of the maxillary teeth).                     They      are nearly
uniform, and arranged in one closely set row, inside                         which     there
are no larger teeth,           nor have   I   seen any evidence        of smaller       ones
outside.     The branchiostegal          rays are thirteen          on   each side, the
anterior of each series being broader than those                       behind,      besides
which there is       a    median lozenge-shaped plate in front.                The    bones
of the shoulder girdle are well shown in most                      of the      specimens,
and   like  those of the face are ornamented externally                   with flexuous
branching and anastomosing ridges.
   The    scales    of the flank      are     slightly higher than            broad, with
gently concave           upper, and convex lower margin;                   the articular
spine is well marked.             On the under surface, the socket for                    the
spine of the scale below is distinct, but the keel is obsolete                        ;   the
latter   appears       as we proceed      backwards towards the tail,                 while
the spine and its socket diminish               and ultimately       disappears.         The
posterior margin of the scale is finely and obliquely                     serrated.        On
the outer surface the margin overlapped by the scale next in front
is very narrow       ;   the exposed area is in the most anteriorly situated
scales, is ornamented with delicate and rather feebly marked ridges,

they run parallel, and usually becoming speedily obsolete over the
rest of the scale, so as to leave a considerable space above                              and
behind, marked only with tolerable                     coarse     punctures, though in
many cases shallow grooves also extend for some distance forwards
from the notches between the denticulations of the posterior border.
These stri,e are much more pronounced in some specimens than
in others; except              on the small scales at the base of the dorsal               fin,
where      they are pretty             well marked, they cease to be observable
 before the origin of the ventrals, whence backwards the only scale-
 ornament consists of scattered               punctures passing into short oblique
 furrows, especially near the interior margin, these punctures and
 furrows being persistent even on the small lozenge-shaped scales
 clothing       the      sides   of the caudal body-prolongation.              The      scales
 also vary considerably in size on different parts of the body, becom
  ing rapidly smaller posteriorly.               One from the middle of the flank
 between the head and ventral fins in                 a specimen of       6  inches, mea
  sures nearly         \  inch in height by         in breadth, while the breadth
  of one from the side of the posterior part of the body opposite the
   termination         of the dorsal fin is only equal to one-half that of the
   former.       The      scales immediately below and adjoining              the base of
   origin of the dorsal fin           are  of particularly     small size.      The usual
   large scales are seen in front of the dorsal and anal fins, and the
   squamation of the prolongation                of the   body axis along the upper
   lobe of   the caudal present nothing specially worthy of note.
      The pectoral fins are acutely pointed, and of considerable ex-
   pause.       The length of each is equal to about three-quarters that of
   the  head     ;    the ventrals       are smaller  ;  the base of each           is rather
   short.     They        are likewise pointed in shape, and have their posterior
   margins       considerably cut out.           The dorsal is        placed   behind the
   middle of the back, so that the centre of its base is nearly opposite
   the commencement of the anal                   ; both these       fins aro largo and
   triangular       ;  the caudal is powerful       and deeply cleft.         The rays of
   all the fins       are very numerous and delicate            ;  in the pectoral these
   cannot    be less       than 30   ;  in the ventral, 23   ;   in the dorsal and anal,
   45 each    ;    those of the caudal cannot be counted.               The articulations
   of the fin rays         are also tolerably close, especially in the            finer rays
   of the posterior           part of each     fin, where the joints appear nearly
   square, being in the other rays rather longer than broad                     ;    the  arti-

dilations    are more      than usually distant towards the proximal ex
 tremities of the principal rays of the pectoral, and also, though to
 a less extent, in the lower lobe of the caudal.           The joints are scale
 like in  general   aspect; the distal margin of each is notched or
 concave, the proximal correspondingly convex ; and the outer sur
 face  is in most      cases marked with       at least one delicate       furrow
 parallel with the anterior and posterior borders ; near the bases of
the dorsal and anal fins the joints present indeed an appearance as
of fine striation.       The fulcra of the anterior margins of the fins are
 closely set and very minute, being only observable with the aid of
a lens.
    Remarks. — Under the name of AmbIt/pterus              punctatus,   three  im
perfect specimens of fossil fish from the shules of             Wardie were de
scribed and figured by Agassiz in the
                                                  "  Poissons Fossiles."      One
of these is a head with the anterior part of the body (Atlas, vol. ii.
tab. 4 b, fig. 4)      ;   the second         fig. 5) wants the head and
shoulders and the extremity of the tail             ; the third (ib. fig. 3) dis
plays the entire caudal fin, but is obliquely cut off just in front of
the dorsal and anal.         The principal characters which          he assigned
to this species    were — the considerable depth of          the anterior part of
the body; the character of the teeth, which had the form of small
obtuse cones apparently disposed          in several      rows; and the orna
ment of the scales, which consisted,        in those in front, of oblique un
dulating lines closer together at the anterior part of each scale and
mingled with punctures, the latter more                numerous towards the
posterior margin      ;   while on the scales of the hinder part of the
body those lines were less crowded, and the punctures more numer
ous, the former entirely disappearing           on the scales      of the pedicle
of the tail, where only a few scattered points were left.
    For  some time after commencing the study of the fossil fishes               of
Wardie, this species "punctatus,"         stated by Agassiz to be common
in   that locality,     was to   me   a complete enigma,          as among the
numerous entire specimens of fish which              I had    the opportunity    of
examining,     I  could not find one which agreed           in all its characters
with Agassiz's      description, though       in some      the anterior, and in
others the posterior       part of the fish answered        well enough.      The
mystery was, however,         at once  cleared up by an examination of
the figured specimens,        of which two, collected by Lord Greenock,

                       of Edinburgh, Session 1876-77.                                             269
are in the collection of the Royal Society of Edinburgh ; while the
third, collected by Dr Buckland, and contained in the Oxford Uni
versity Museum, was forwarded to me with great liberality by Pro
fessor Prestwich. A comparison of these specimens with a series
of entire fishes from the Wardie                 beds establishes the fact, that the
Amblypterus punctatus of Agassiz was founded upon fragments of
two distinct species, the specimen with the head, but without the
hinder part of the body, being even generically distinct from the
other two, which display the hinder part, but without the head, —
the fishes     to which        they respectively appertain                    differing    not only
in dentition, but also in many other particulars connected with the
head, the scales, and the fins.
   The peculiar form and arrangement of the teeth in the first of
these render necessary the institution of a new genus, to which I
have given the name Qonatodus*                      These teeth were somewhat in
correctly described by Agassiz                   as being       "en cones obtus," this
appearance in the specimen he examined being due to their being
there only seen          in antero-posterior          vertical       section,        their pecu
liar flexures and pointed apices being invisible                          ;    their being dis
                                           "
posed   "sur plusieurs          rangees         seems also to be an              error as far as
the mandibles         and maxilla are concerned, though                           probably there
were    additional       teeth     on     the     margin       of the           palate.        Perfect
 examples      of the species           to which     the other two type specimens
belong show that the teeth are in it acutely conical, incurved, and
of different       sizes, large and small, and that in these and other
 respects the fish is closely allied               to the Amblypterus                nemopterus,
 Palaoniscus       ttriolatu*,    and     P. Robisoni of Agassiz,                    along       with
 which forms it        is,   in my opinion, referable to the genus Elonichihy*
 of Giebel.f   It now, however, becomes      question for which of

 these two fishes the specific term "punctatus" should be retained.
 Now, although          the enlarged representations                  of scales given by
 Agassiz (Puis. Foss. Atlas, vol. ii. tab.                     c. figs.        and   7)   are taken

" Amblypterus

contrasted it as occurring in the same                beds,  it  seemed to me more
 appropriate to retain his name           "punctatus" for the species of which
these peculiarities       are characteristic.        For the other       I  propose the
name     Elonichthys      intermedins ; it is very closely allied both              to E.
nemopterus and       E.  striolatus,   and   will be described in my next com
munication on the fossil fishes of the Edinburgh district.
    The peculiar dentition of Gonatodits was, however, first correctly
described    by Mr R.Walker* in a fish from the oil shales of ritcortbie,
Fifeshire,    to which     he gave      the name of Amhlypterus              anconoach-
modus, the horizon in which            it occurred being probably            that of the
Burdiehouse Limestone.              Mr 'Walker's     fish undoubtedly belongs to
the same genus with that described above, and may possibly                              be
the same    with G. punctatus — if        not, it is certainly very closely allied,
— but    I have had no opportunity             of instituting a comparison              by
means of actual specimens.              Mr Walker, however,           makes no men
tion of punctures as a scale ornament, and his figures represent the
entire surface of the scale covered — as he says in the text — "with
fine striaa which run parallel with the anterior and lower margins,"
and "are more conspicuous on the scales of some specimens                        than  on
those of others."      f    Regarding the arrangement of the teeth in                 the
lower jaw,    Mr Walker         also gtntes that they

appearance      of which      I   have   observed    some    slight     indications     in

   t In the Wardie specimens the scales appear for the most part dull, and'Wi-
cately striated all over ; this is, however, internal structure, not external sculp
ture, and is due to the fluking off of the external ganoine layer. When this
is preserved in eitu, as it is here and there in many specimens, the surface of
the scale is brilliant, largely punctured, and the appearance of striation more
or less limited or obsolete, as already described.

     Description.  — The    usual   length of examples of this species              is
 from four to six or         seven    inches, but although           a  considerable
 number of specimens         more or less perfect have occurred in no two
 do the proportional measurement agree, owing to the greater or less
 amount of alteration of form, frequently amounting to positive dis
 tortion, which they have           undergone, apparently           both   soon  after
 death, and also during the consolidation of their ironstone matrix.
 Seldom do the scales, save on the caudal body-prolongation, remain
 in their original relations      to each other on any considerable part of
  the body, but are always more or less jumbled up, even though the
  contour of the fish        may   re main   tolerably regular, and the shape
  and structure      of more or fewer of the fins be quite intact. As
  remarked in the description of Nematoptychius                  gracilis, this con
  dition affects nearly all the small fishes occurring in the Gilmerton
  ironstone.     In  one example      of the present    species in my collection,
  the apex of the anal fin appears             neatly cut off, and dislocated a
  quarter of an inch forward from the rest of the fin.
      The   most   perfect specimen in my collection                is      inches in
  length by    If   in depth at the ventral        fins, and      is nearly perfect.
   In no specimens        are the bones     of the    head     well shown, these
  being always more or less crushed and broken                 ;   what can    be seen
   of them shows that they were conformed essentially as in the pre
   ceding species, and sculptured much in the same way, though per
   haps a little more coarsely.        The configuration of the teeth is also
   essentially the same, though they appear to            be a   little  more clumsy
   in shape, and not quite so regular in arrangement.                   But  the most
   salient peculiarity of the      present   species    lies in its scale?, which
   are considerably    larger than in G. punctatus,        except on the caudal
   body-prolongation,     where they are equally small.              Their outer   and
   brilliantly-polished    surfaces are also devoid of ornament, and might
   indeed be described as completely             smooth, only         a  few delicate
   punctures being discernible by careful examination with the lens;

their posterior margins are finely denticulated as in the preceding
species.   The form and position of the fins is the same as in G.
punctatus, but their rays are slightly coarser and proportionally
fewer in number, though it is difficult to ascertain with accuracy
their numbers in the various fins.    The articulations of the rays
are also a little closer, but the configuration of the joints is the
same, these being emarginate distally, *convex proximally,                              and with
a    little furrow parallel with their anterior                  and posterior          margins,
but       I   have not observed      any additional furrows or strite than those
near the bases          of the dorsal      and anal as in the           Wardie species.
     Geological        Position and Locality. — A considerable number                          of
examples of this species have occurred in the Blackband                                ironstone
atVenturefair Colliery, Gilmerton, and are contained in the Edin
burgh Museum of Science and Art, and in the private collection of
the author.            A fragment in the Hunterian Museum of the Uni
versity of Glasgow, from the ironstone of Possil, also a member of
the Carboniferous Limestone series, though higher in position than
that of Gilmerton,            is probably also referable to the same.
     5.       On the   Ruff   (Machetes pugnax).                 By Professor Duns.
     The exceedingly beautiful bird now on the table was forwarded
to me on the 1st   of September last by Mr Wilson, Edington Mains,
Chirnside, Berwickshire.               It    had been shot two days previously.
Mr Wilson          says,
                           " On comparing it with all the Waders figured
by Bewick (the only work of the kind which            possess),  find      I              I
none that correspond ; whence I infer that it is really a rara avis."
He adds, " When noticed by the edge of the pond by my children
it   had a young one with            it,   which they saw        it    feeding.    The    young
one, they said, was much lighter in its plumage, but was old enough
to fly strongly."          The    note      led me to expect           a   full-grown    female
wader          and young one.        But the size of the bird and its general
features of maturity showed                it   to be   a   male, in    full winter    plumage.
Its companion,           described    as    young, doubtless from its size,               seems
to have         been   the female, or reeve, which               is    little   more   than half
the size of the male.             In this       respect     the ruff differs from most        of
the sub-family          Tringina, in which           the females are generally larger
than the males.

                        of Edinburgh,      Session    1876-77.                    273
    The ruff is polygamous.          After the breeding      season a separation
takes place between the          sexes, which      continues     till the approach
of the following spring.             The example now           before   us is thus
exceptional,       as occurring    along     with one female long after the
breeding       season     was  past,   which    is late in the spring, or in
May.       At   one time these      birds were met with in great numbers
in the low-lying districts of Norfolk                and   Lincoln,     where    they
bred.      Even     in these localities they are now seldom met with.
 There     are   no instances on record of their nesting in Scotland,
 where they        are    even  more    rare   than   in   England.
                                                                           " On    the
 east coast of Scotland,"        says    Macgillivray, " they usually         appear
 about the middle of September              and depart in about a fortnight            ;
 but    I have  never seen an adult male killed there,              the little flocks
 that occur being young birds              and  females."     " Except in a very
 few instances," says        Mr Gray, " I    have   never met with the ruff in
 the western counties.          One or two occasionally penetrate as far as
 the Clyde, but these are mere stragglers."*              The forms now noticed
 appeared at a considerable distance from the coast, in a district,
 however, which at one time must have presented                    as good nesting
  ground     as could be found       in Norfolk or Lincoln, but which by
  drainage and many other features of high farming has become
  almost    free   from conditions suitable        to  their habits.       It  would
  almost seem as        if some birds have a transmitted instinct towards
  certain localities, which at long intervals finds high expression in
  certain pairs.      Might not this account for the occasional occurrence
  of the bittern, the night heron, and many other forms in districts
  where they are now regarded as stragglers?                   I  know, moreover,
  one   locality  where the names of places show how common the raven
  had been     at one time, but where only one pair is known to have
  appeared in forty years.          Many instances of this kind might                be
  given.     The habits of the ruff have been, I might almost say,                   so
  exhaustively       described by Montague, Rennie, Selby, and others,
  as to make     it unnecessary    to refer to them here.         I  have, however,
  placed on the table other specimens than that now noticed, with
     * Dr John Alexander Smith has noticed specimens from Carnwath, Alloa,
  Portobello, and Kenton Barns, East Lothian.          As many as a dozen were
  recently  seen   near  Grangemouth    by  Mr  Harvie   Drown, fivo of which were
  shot.

 fact is curious and interesting from the physiological point of view.
  The theory of sexual selection does not help to explain it. The
  birds are polygamous,          and      the   male has to fight       to   obtain   the
  female.     It is not, however, the size or colour of the               frill, but the
  strength of beak and of leg that conquers.                   Then what is it that
  determines the colour of the frill in different birds of the same
  species,  and what keeps the hue persistent throughout                  all the yearly
  changes of plumage?             The questions          are easily put.     One would
  like  if they were as easily answered.

     The    name    Elonichthys was first proposed by Giebel* for certain
 fishes   (E. Germari,         crassidens      and  loevis) from the coal-measures
 of Wettin, near Halle, which he considered intermediate in generic
 character between            Amblypterus        and    Palceoniscus,     as   defined    by
 Agassiz.      They      were     said   to resemble        Palceoniscus     in their ful-
crated fins, but to differ from            it in the   absence of the scaly covering
to the rays, affirmed by Agassiz to exist in some Palaeonisci, while
to certain     "Amblypteri" they showed an affinity in the striation
of their scales, and to " Amblypterus " in general in the large size of
the    fins.    Their special characteristics               were   to  be found in the
dentition, which consisted of an external series of minute teeth
                           " Biirstenzahne ' of
comparable to the                                      Amblypterus, between which
there were large conical teeth,               " wie ich dieselben weder bei den
Palaeonisken noch Amblypteren finde."                        Unfortunately, however,
for this diagnosis, the fin-rays of Palceoniscus are no more covered
with scales than those of any other genus belonging to this family ;
nor are the fins of Agassiz's "Amblypteri" destitute of fulcra
,:
    except on the upper lobe of the tail," as has been                     so   repeatedly
stated by compilers, who, copying this error from the                     " Tableau     eyn-
optique des Genres et des Especes" have apparently overlooked the
correction of it made by Agassiz himself a few pages further on in
his general description of the genus.f                    The dentition, too, of Gie-
bel's Elonichthys is essentially similar               to that of Agassiz's         Ambly-
terus    macroptertis      (Rhabdolepis Troschel) in which large conical
teeth     were shown to exist by Goldfuss in 1847,J and again by

                    of Edinburgh,         Setssion 1876-77.                       277
Troechel in 1857,* the latter author using this character to separate
the striated-scaled " Amblypteri" of Saarbriicken and Lebach,
under the name of Rhabdolepis (iJ. macropterus, R. eupterygius)
from their smooth-scaled associates with minute slender teeth, for
which the term Amblypterus was retained (A. latus, A. lateralis).
    An examination of the type-specimens of Elonichthys in the
Mineralogical Museum at Halle has, however, convinced me that
the genus is tenable, and that to it is referable an extensive series
of Pabeoniscidae, which will include,               besides    Giebel's     originals
and several new species,         various      forms referred by Agassiz            and
other writers to Amblypterus, Palaxmiscus,            and Pygopterus.         Several
species also, whose position, from want of sufficient information, is
somewhat doubtful, may best be placed here provisionally.
   Elonichthys     most closely resembles          Acrolepis and Rhabdolepis,
but differs from the former in the anterior covered area of the scales
being    reduced to a very narrow margin, and from the latter in the
absence of the subopercular plate.             From Amblypterus,       as restricted
by Troschel, the greater obliquity of the suspensorium, and the
dentition, are obvious marks of distinction ; the teeth in the
true Amblypteri being minute, slender, without differentiated lani-
aries, and more meriting the title            "en brosse" than        those of any
other genus of     Palaeoniscidae.       From Palaoniscuts it is distinguished
by   the large size of the median fins, and by the possession of large
conical    teeth in the jaws, the teeth          of Palaxmiscus,     as that genus
 must now be restricted, being small, and though, of different sizes,
without conspicuous laniaries.              It is also widely separated from
 Pygopterus by the structure of the pectoral fin, in which the prin
 cipal rays   are articulated for the greater part of their length, where
 as in the last-named genus, they are unarticulated              till towards their
 terminations;     by the position of the dorsal fin, which, in relation
 to the anal, is further forward       ;  and by the form      of  the anal, which
 is not produced backwards in         a   fringe-like manner along the lower
 margin of the body.
    Accordingly Amblypterus        nemopterus      of Agassiz,     and one     of the
 two species    included in his A. punctatus, must be transferred to
 Elonichthys,    as well as his Palaxmiscus          Eobisoni,   P.   striolatus,   P.
 Egertoni, and Pygopterus Bucklandi.             The mutual       resemblances       of

they should have been placed by Agassiz in different genera ; his
having done so seems, indeed, to indicate the arbitrary nature of the
distinction which he drew between                                        Amblypterus and              Palceoniscus,

Jackson, judging from                           the figure given.               f        The   same must also be
said of        P.   peltigerus of Newberry,                     J   which was indeed first described
by that author                as an Elonichthys.^
     As above defined,                  Elonichthys                 is pre-eminently a carboniferous
genus, and well represented                            in strata of that age in Great Britain
and other countries.                       The necessary restriction of the limits of the
genera Palcecniscus,                   Amblypterus,                 and Pygopterus,             and the transfer

Elonichthys and other genera (Nematoptychius, Ehadinichthys) leave
the three first named without representatives in the carboniferous
formation,          so   far   as   our present knowledge goes, — a conclusion which
may       appear         at    first somewhat startling to geologists, who have
been so long accustomed                          to look upon them as characteristic of                            that
era, as well as of the succeeding Permian.                                          |]

margins finely denticulated, ornamented with delicate ridges, which
are     mostly parallel        with     the anterior and          lower margins, some
above being parallel with              the upper one, and which             in the hinder
part    of the fish, tend, on the posterior part of the scale, to become re
placed by punctures ; dorsal and anal fins very high in front sharply
acuminated ; the rays of all the fins delicate, with rather distant
articulations (in the principal rays at least twice as long as broad).
     By Agassiz the rays of the dorsal fin are described as being
"   tous bifurques a plusieures reprises jusque vers leur milieu."                         It
seems to me, however,             that the dichotomisation             of the longer rays,
 as is usual in this genus, does not commence                    till towards their ter
 minations.         He   also described the surface of the scales                 as  being
 "ornee      de petites rides saillantes, disposers a-peu-pres comme                      les
 lignes d'accroissement en losanges concentriques                          plus on moins
 regulieres et un peu obliques, de telle sorte que leurs angles aigus
 sont tournes vers les angles supérieur-anteiieur                      et infcrieur-postu-
 rieur     de  chaque ecaille," — a description which                   is hardly correct,
 as there are no striae parallel with the posterior margin                    of the scale.
 The     scales   of the type-specimen            are, however,      in very bad preser
 vation, the exterior ganoine layer having everywhere disappeared,
 and their markings can only be made out from the impressions on the
 counterpart.        Agassiz seems also to have been much struck by its re
 semblance to the Amblypterus (Rhabdolepia) macroptcrus of Saarbriic-
 ken   ;  to me, however, although the bones of the head are very badly
 preserved, its affinities         to the     following    species seem so plain        and
 obvious, that       I have no hesitation in referring             it to the same genus.

 other, and also with a series                of more or less perfect fishes in my

280                  Proceedings        of the Royal Society
own collection, which belong to a species perfectly                 distinct, even
generically, from the first. The presence in the jaws of this species of
sharp conical teeth of different sizes,        as well as its entire aspect, shows
that it is referable to the same genus as Elonichthys                     striolatus,
(Palwoniscus sinWaftts, Agassiz) with which it is indeed closely allied.
    Description. — The largest specimen in my collection measuresS J
inches in length, but, as it is a little contorted laterally, it must have
been    originally somewhat longer; the more ordinary length is from oh
to       inches. The form of the body is fusiform, but as hardly any
specimen is absolutely free from some amount of distortion, it is
difficult to ascertain the proportional measurements with absolute
accuracy;        two very good examples, however, agree in this, that
the length of the head           is contained a little more than four times,
and the greatest depth of the body (just in front of the dorsal fin)
a  little  more than three times in the total length, up to the bifurca
tion of the caudal fin.
    Many      of  the   details of the structure of the head are clearly
shown.       The outer surfaces of the bones of the cranial shield dis
play     a fine    tubercular      ornamentation,     the tubercles frequently
passing into        short rugae;      the superethmoidal       forms as usual        a
blunt prominence          projecting      over the front of the mouth.            The
suspensorium is very oblique, and the gape consequently of great
extent.     The operculum is rather narrow, its posterior-superior angle
is rounded off, the posterior-inferior           one acutely pointed, its outer
surface     is marked       with    delicate and somewhat distant             ridges,
which      mostly follow the direction of the lines of growth.                   The
interoperculum        is square-shaped        and apparently similarly orna
mented, though it          is difficult   to obtain a satisfactory     view of its
external surface.         The exact number of the branchiostegal              rays is
hardly ascertainable         ; in many specimens the anterior one of             each
lateral series is distinctly        shown to be much broader than the            rest,
and a median lozenge-shaped plate is also conspicuously                      present
between     these, and behind        the symphysis of the mandible.               The
maxilla is of      the usual form     ; its broad portion is ornamented with
delicate raised striae placed rather widely apart, and mostly parallel
with the superior and posterior margins;               they are closer and more
pronounced along the dentary margin.                  The mandible is        moder
ately stout,      and   closely striated externally        with delicate      ridges,

which run in      a direction  slightly oblique     to its upper border.       The
teeth are rarely seen, being usually covered up by the matrix, whose
intense hardness defies all attempts at working them out; in some
specimens, however,        a few are exhibited both on the mandible and
maxilla.      They    are conical, sharp,    and   incurved, and of different
sizes, the largest measuring about             inch in length, though in one
specimen      a broken     tooth is perceptible which           must have been
larger, probably attaining about        7,^ inch in length.        The   bones   of
the shoulder girdle, usually well seen, present nothing remarkable
in their configuration ; they are ornamented externally with closely
set, wavy, branching, and anastomosing ridges.
    The scales of the body are of medium size ; as usual they
diminish from before backwards, but not in so very marked a
 manner as in Gonatodus          punctatus.     Externally they       are marked
 with oblique furrows       passing into isolated coarse punctures in the
posterior part of the scale.         In the anterior part of the fish, and
along   the  line  of  the  back  in front  of the dorsal fin, these furrows
are closer, producing sometimes a ridged appearance               between them,
and extend      more    over the surface    than is the case further back,
 where they are shorter, and more limited to the anterior margin, so
that the greater part of the exposed             area of the scale is simply
punctured;      the furrows become,     indeed, almost entirely lost on the
scales   of the tail pedicle.      The posterior margins of the         scales are
finely denticulated.
    The length of the pectoral fin is equal to about § that of the
head; it is sharply acuminated, and contains about 30 rays, which
at the medial edge of the fin become very short and delicate.                 The
first three rays on the lateral edge,          which are short and do not
reach the apex, seem entirely          unarticulated     ;  the articulations    of
the others are distant proximally,         but becoming rapidly closer dis-
tally, so that over the greater part of the expanse of the fin the          joints
are square-shaped, becoming at length even                 shorter   than   broad.
The ventrals      are situated midway between             the pectorals and the
anal; they are also acuminate in form, each containing about                    15
rays, articulated from their origins, their joints also diminishing in
length from their proximal towards their distal extremities.                  The
dorsal is situated nearly opposite the interval              between   it and  the
anal  ; both of these fins are very similar in shape, being triangular,

 282                 Proceedings      of the Royal Society
 very high in front, acutely pointed, and with the posterior                border
 gently concave.        Their  rays appear coarse, compared         with those of
 Elonichthys     nemopterus,    and     especially with those of Gonatodus
 punctatu»,   so  that had Agassiz only seen the fins of the latter              he
 could not have coufounded it with the present species.                Each    con
 sists of about 30 rays, finely striated externally in the direction of
 their length;     their transverse    joints  are conspicuously longer than
 broad   in the principal      rays,   but become shorter in the posterior
part of the fin, and also in the longer rays towards their extremities.
 The longer rays begin also to bifurcate towards their terminations,
the process      gradually    creeping upon the posterior part of the fin
till in    the delicate hindermost rays it takes place about their
middle,   —  a very general characteristic of the fins in the species of
this genus.      The caudal is very powerful ; the rays of its lower lobe
are divided by rather distant articulations,          and dichotomise towards
their extremities     ;  those of the upper lobe divide about their middle,
and are characterised by the extreme closeness of their articulations,
the joints being rather shorter than              the rays are     broad.      The
fulcra of all the fins are minute and closely set.
    Remarks. — The close resemblance which this species bears                to  E.
striolatus is quite apparent^        their specific distinction     is also   suffi
ciently pronounced.         In E. striolatus    the articulations    of the prin
cipal rays of the dorsal and anal fins are much closer; the dorsal              and
anal fins do not seem to be quite          so sharply acuminate in form      ; the
laniary teeth are larger;        the scale ornament, though belonging             to
the same general type, is more delicate in character.              To E.   nemop
terus its resemblances      are also very strong    ; it differs, however,    from
it in the greater coarseness of the fin rays, with closer articulations,
this being especially marked           in the case of the pectoral,    as  well   as
in the nature of the scale ornament.             The  aspect of the fin rays is
somewhat intermediate between              their condition    in the two other
species    named,     hence   the specific     term which      I  have adopted
for the present fish.

     During     the cruise of the Challenger the specific gravity of the
 surface water was observed           daily while at sea, and that of water
 from the bottom and intermediate depths as often as opportunity
 offered.     These observations were          almost entirely confined to the
 region between        the parallels of 40°    N. and     40° S. latitudes, which,
 including     as  it  does   the regions of the equatorial calms, of the
 trade   winds, and to a certain extent of both the northern and
 southern westerly winds is decidedly the most                 interesting field for
 such investigations.          Many valuable observations          have been made
 by other observers,        and   I have   availed myself more especially of
 the series   of observations       made by   Lenz during Kotzebue's voyage
 to the    Pacific and back.         His observations       were    almost entirely
 confined to the surface water.
    The density of       sea water depends      on the amount of salt which          it
 contains, on its temperature, and             on   the   pressure    to which   it  is
subject.      Away from the disturbing             influences of the shore, the
 water   of the   ocean is subject to comparatively slight variations in
saltnesss,     so   slight indeed that         different    waters    may without
sensible error be assumed to be equally affected by changes of tem
perature and pressure.            As  the remarks which          are offered in the
present     paper have reference to the salinity or concentration                   of
the   water, the specific gravities          have    all  been    reduced    to their
value at 60° F., the unit being that of distilled water                  at its tem
perature of maximum density.               The   pressure    is that of one atmo
sphere.
    There are two meteorological           causes which affect the saltness of
the sea; the one is the formation           of vapour    and the precipitation      of
it as rain, and the other is the freezing of the water and melting of
the ice thus      formed.      Vast quantities of solid matter, chiefly car
bonate    of lime     and  silica, are removed        from the water by living
organisms, and these substances            form the chief components of the
solid matter brought down in solution by rivers.                  Although this is
   TOL.   IX.                                                             2 v

284                 Proceedings     of   the  Royal Society
a very important cause        of the transmigration of rock, it does not
sensibly affect the specific gravity of the sea-water,         because only a
very limited amount either of silica or of carbonate of lime can be
in solution at any one time. The general distribution of saltness,
as  indicated by the specific gravity of the water at a common tem
perature of 60° F. at the surface, is shown on a chart on which
localities of equal saltness     are connected by lines, and the spaces
between    successive   lines coloured distinctively.        The vertical  dis
tribution    is shown in diagrams in sections along certain lines of
route, the depths at which the same saltness           is observed being also
connected     by lines.    The variations of     saltness   at the surface   on
the lines of section are further shown by curves              having for ordi-
nates   the reduced     specific gravity,      and for abscissae degrees of
latitude or longitude according to circumstances.
   These diagrams show at once how great are the differences in the
saltness  of the water in different depths and at different localities
on the surface,    and  it must    be remembered       that we are here con
sidering bona fide ocean water, litoral waters so much influenced by
the drainage of the land being reserved for separate treatment-
Looking     at the chart we see that specific gravities above           1-0270
occur in three localities only — namely, in the trade-wind             regions
of  the North and South       Atlantic,    and of the central South Pacific.
In the North Pacific        the  specific gravity was nowhere as high as
1-0263, whereas large tracts both of the North and South Atlantic
reached   1  0275.    The greater part of the year 1873         was passed in
the North Atlantic, and the central part was crossed             on the home
ward voyage.      On the eastern side and in the track of outward bound
ships, the maximum of        1 02763 was reached in latitude 24°.        In the
central part the maximum was           1  02768 in latitude 25°, and in the
western    part it was 1-02743      in 27°30';    so that between    the meri
dians of 20° W. and 70° W. the line of maximum saltness would
appear to run nearly due east and west,          with   a slight northerly  in
clination    towards the west.        In the central South Atlantic         the
maximum of 1-02768          was observed      in latitude 17°26',   and in the
western part 1-02783,      in latitude 15°15', so that here also the line
of maximum saltness would appear to have a slight northerly trend.
Between these two lines the specific gravity falls off until           a mini
mum of 1-0260 is reached at about 3°N. latitude, and following              the

                      of Edinburgh, Session 1876-77.                              285
equator    from east to west the specific gravity appears to increase
pretty steadily.       In the Central Pacific the maximum sallness                    is
observed in latitude 18° S., where the specific gravity is 1-02725;
in the north the maximum is               1-0263,   in latitude      22°   N.     The
minimum of         1-02488     was   found in latitude       7°26'    N.     In the
Western Pacific the        series   of observations     was not so continuous,
there being a considerable gap between               latitude    15° S.   and   2 S. ;
the northern portion, however, is complete.                     Here,    again, the
 absolute maximum         is in the south, reaching 1-0268,          in 22°30° S.      ;
 in  the north the maximum is 1-0263 in 22° N., but the dense water
 of  the Southern     Pacific penetrates into        the northern part        of the
 ocean,  giving another       and higher maximum          of 1-0266    in lat. 2' N.
 The actual maximum observed was 1-0242 close to Humboldt Bay,
 in New Guinea. Other very low specific gravities were observed
 occasionally even at considerable distances from the coast                ; but the
 fact that there was frequently drift-wood            floating    about,   and that
 the  light water    was confined to a stratum of 10 to 20 fathoms             thick
 ness, showed that we had here             to do with      shore   water.     If   the
 general run of the curve be followed, the oceanic minimum will                     be
 found to occur about 10° N., marking 1-0258.
    The saltness, which increases        on both sides of the equator           until
 a maximum       is reached     in the trade wind districts, decreases again
 towards the poles and the whole of the ocean to the southward of
 latitude   40° S., has a specific gravity         below 10260,       and    for the
 greater part below 1-0255.           In  the neighbourhood of ice in sum
 mer great and sudden variations are frequently observed, the specific
 gravity amongst loose park ice frequently falling as low as 1-0240.
    Confining our consideration,           then, in the meantime,             to the
 surface, we find that the maxima in the Southern Pacific                         and
 Atlantic   are situated nearer the equator than those in the northern
 parts of  these oceans     ;  that the maxima in the Atlantic are higher
 than the corresponding ones in the Pacific           ; and that the maximum
 maximorum occurs in            the South Atlantic        about latitude      15°    S.
 The equatorial minima in both oceans             are to the northward         of  the
 equator ; and from all these facts we          see how intimately the con
centration     of  the sea-water is connected with            the distribution of
 the trade winds.
    If we  turn now to the consideration of the vertical distribution

                                                                                    ¦
286                Proceedings      of the Royal       Society
of density, we see that the influence of atmospheric conditions               does
not cease when we leave the surface.              In   the trade-wind districts
we find the excessive concentration            extending     to greater or     less
depths, according      to the ocean        which    we are    considering,     and,
as might    have    been expected, this effect       is much more sensible in
the Atlantic      than in the Pacific.          In the Atlantic, again,         the
amount of concentration is much greater in the northern than in
the southern portion, while in the Pacific the reverse                is the  case.
The great amount of concentration in the North Atlantic is doubt
less due chiefly to the form of its basin.               The south-east trade
which    blows with a preponderating           force drives constantly        fresh
supplies of water in to the northern basin, where             a large portion of
it is kept constantly circulating by the prevailing winds in a region
where the atmosphere is ever greedy of moisture. This circulation,
assisted by the yearly oscillations           of temperature, bring       about a
constant concentration        of the deep waters, and at the same time,
as  I  have pointed out,     a   heating   of the deeper     waters by convec
tion.    The effect of this concentration of the water is to render it
heavier than an equal bulk of water further to the south, and                  con
sequently    it forces its way southwards along the bottom. This
under outflow from the North Atlantic was conjectured by Cap
tain Tizard from a consideration of the temperature of the deep
water of the western         basin of the South Atlantic, and a glance
at the vertical     section of the Atlantic is sufficient           to show     the
great likelihood of its existence.            From     a consideration     of this
section it would appear        probable that at some position           about 40°
north latitude a tolerably uniform density of from 1*0265 to               1-0270
will  be found, and, indeed, in the neighbourhood                 of the   Azores
the following bottom specific gravities were observed             : —
       Depth in fathoms,         .    .     1675      1000      900       750
      Specific gravity at 15 56,      . 1-02670   1-02693  1-02691   1-02679
Although     we find    that in all tropical and temperate regions              the
temperature of the water is highest at the surface, and decreases
as the depth increases, we do not by any means               invariably find    the
highest    specific gravity at the surface, nor does it decrease regu
larly with     increasing      depth.    The water is usually least salt
at between 500 and 1000         fathoms from the surface.        The maximum
specific gravity at any locality is frequently observed at depths of

from   25 to 150 fathoms from       the surface, and it is not unusual       to
find besides the normal minimum between 500 and 1000 fathoms,
a second minimum        at 25 or 50 fathoms     from the surface.      These
maxima and minima          are caused   in some cases by currents, and in
others   are the evidence   of past  wet or dry seasons.     In the Southern
Ocean the surface specific gravity varies between         1 0240 and 1-0250,
 being nearly constant     at 1/0250 in localities    free from ice; it in
 creases, however, with the depth, the bottom specific gravity being
 usually 1-0255 or 10256.

  1. Note on the Manganese Nodules found on the Bed of the
                     Ocean. By J. Y. Buchanan.
     The manganese nodules occur in greater or less quantity all
 over the ocean-bed, and most abundantly            in the Pacific.     They
 occur of all sizes, from minute grains to masses of a pound weight,
  and even greater, and form nodular concretions of concentric shells,
 round   a nucleus, which     is very frequently   a   piece  of pumice or    a
 shark's tooth.    Their outside has    a peculiar and very characteristic
 mammillated     surface, which      enables them to be identified       at a
 glance.    When freshly brought       up they are very soft, being easily

288                        Proceedings         of the Royal Society
scraped       to powder with              a knife.     They gradually get harder                on
exposure to the air.
    The      powder,       heated     in a closed tube, gives out water which                   re
acts alkaline, and has an empyreumatic odour.                          Heated with strong
hydrochloric           acid,     it liberates       abundance of chlorine,             and the
residue which              remains       is white, consisting         of silica, clay,        and
sand,     the sand being the same as is found in the bottom mud from
the same           locality.        Their composition           varies greatly, different
nodules containing                different quantities        of mechanically          admixed
mud, and the number of different elements found in them is very
large.        Copper, iron,           cobalt, nickel,      manganese,        alumina,      lime,
magnesia, silica,             and phosphoric           acid have      been     detected     in     a
large number            ;   but   I   have not as yet been able to make a com
pleted analysis of any of them.                         I  have,   however, made          a few
determinations of the most important component substances.                                    For
this purpose           the outside and densest              layers of the nodules were
selected,        and    portions of them pulverised and dried for                        ten or
twelve hours at 140° C.                      The amount of chlorine              liberated      on
treatment with               hydrochloric        acid was determined            by Bunsen's
method, and the iron was determined by titration                              with stannous
chloride.         The samples analysed             were from four different localities.
    Nos.      2,   4, and 5 were from the same place,                     No. 2 being          the
matter collected round a shark's tooth as nucleus                          ;  Nos. 4 and          5
being the outside rinds of ordinary nodules.
    The results           are given in the following            table, the numbers being
in many cases the means of several observations : —

besides silica and clay, sand         of the  same mineral nature as is found
in the bottom at the same locality.                 The manganese is present
wholly       as MnO2,    and  the  iron  as Fe2O3 .    In No. 6 there is 3 per

is present in all of them.           Zinc was not found in any of the above

  2.   Note on the Measure of Beknottedness.                   By Prof. Tait.
     In   drawing the various closed curves which have          a given number
of double points,        I found it desirable to have some simple mode of
ascertaining whether a particular             form was a new one, or only a
deformation of         one   of those   I  had   already obtained.    Of   course
the schemes        (as described in my former paper) contain the desired
information, but it may sometimes be difficult to obtain in this
way; for, when the number of intersections is large, we may have
to change         the crossing which is taken as the initial one several
times before we hit upon the same notation for like crossings                  (if
such       exist) in the two schemes compared. And the methods of
deformation already given often present their results in forms so
distorted that it is not easy at once to recognise           their identity with
other drawings of the very same curves.
     The method of treatment described in my              paper, which depends
 upon the study of the plait, supplies (by the + and                -  signs over
 the various crossings) exactly the sort            of information   we require,
 though it may leave ambiguities.              But  some simple mode of apply
 ing it is requisite.
     I   first tried a modification of the process (formerly described) of

290               Proceedings    of the Royal Society
going round the curve and pitching a coin into each field or cell as
it is reached.     To make the required distinction between crossing
over and crossing under, we may suppose the two coins to be          of dif
ferent kinds, — silver and copper for instance.       Let  the rule be    : —
silver to the right when crossing over, to the left when crossing under.
Then, however the path be arranged, of the four angles at each
crossing, one will have no coins, the vertical or opposite corner will
have two silver or two copper coins, the others one copper or one
silver coin each.
   It  is easily seen that a reversal of the direction of going       round
leaves    the single coins as they were, but shifts the pair of coins
into the angle formerly vacant;        also that in the deformed     figures
the circumstances are exactly the same as in the original.           Hence
 we may     divide the crossings into silver and copper ones, according
as   two silver or two copper coins come together.        And   the excess
of the silver over the copper crossings, or vice versd, furnishes an
exceedingly simple and readily applied test (not however, as will
soon be seen, in itself absolutely conclusive of identity, though
absolutely conclusive against it), which is of great value in arrang
ing in family groups (those of each family having the same number
of silver crossings), the various knots having a given number of
intersections.
   I  soon saw that this process, so limited, was intimately connected
with that required for the estimation of the work necessary to carry
a magnetic pole along the curve, the curve being supposed to               be
traversed by an electric current, and it occurred to me that we
might possibly obtain     a  definite measurement of beknottedness          in
terms of such a physical      quantity:   as it obviously must be always
the same for the same knot, and must vanish when               there   is no
beknottedness.       The  measure     may  be   made   more complete by
recording the numbers of non-nugatory silver and copper cross
ings separately, with the number to be deducted as due merely to
the coiling of the figure.     I shall recur to this point later.
   When unit current circulates in a circuit,        the work required to
carry unit pole once       round any closed      curve once linked      with
the circuit    is ± 4;r. Instead of the current we may substitute a
uniformly and normally magnetised surface bounded by the circuit.
The potential energy of the pole in any position is always measured

                          of Edinburgh, Session 1876-77.                                           291
by the spherical opening subtended by the circuit                                 ;    but its sign
depends upon whether the north or south polar side is turned to the
pole.     Hence there is no potential energy when the pole is situated
in the plane of the circuit but external                          to   it,   and the value            is
± 2* when the pole just reaches the plane of the circuit internally.
Gauss gave from              these    results the value of             a   remarkable            double
integral     extending             over each       of any two closed curves linked

circuits with which            we are now dealing, so that             a   special set of rules
must be made for determining                      the beknottedness            in terms of the
silver and copper junctions. But the difficulty just mentioned
leads, as will be seen, to very curious result.

to infinity in one direction               (say, for definiteness,
upwards from the plane of the paper), and having
the circuit for its edge             ;    or we may form, as           in
the figure,     a   finite autotomic surface of one sheet,

culty in estimating the work lies in the definite statement of how
the pole   to move along the curve itself.
            is                               For,     its path screw         if
round the curve,           ±   4ir must be added to the work for each such com
plete     turn.       As     an     illustiation,
suppose we bend an                 india-rubber
band coloured black on one side, as
in the figure,       so    that the black          is
always the concave surface, we find on pulling                         it    out straight          that
it   has no twist.        If both loops be made         by overlaying, when pulled out
it   becomes twisted through two whole turns.                              This   is    an instance
of the kinematic principle that spiral springs act by torsion.
     Perhaps      the most simple definite condition                   is    that which      I     first
employed,viz., to make the pole move along the curve, keeping always
in the osculating plane and on the convex side.                              But      we have then
to arrange beforehand what                  is   to be done at     a   point of inflexion.
     A   practical     rule, however, may easily be given from the con-
     vot. IX.                                                                            2   Q

  sideration of the magnetised surface above                  mentioned.       Go round
  the curve, marking an arrow head after each                   crossing to show the
 direction in which you passed it.               Then a junction like the fol
                              lowing gives +       27r   at each time of crossing           ;
                              or,  if  we use the infinite           surface spoken of
                              above,    it gives   + 4it     for    the upper branch,
                              and nothing       for the      lower (which,       on    this
 supposition, does not pass through the magnetic sheet).                          Change
 the crossing from over to wider, and these quantities change sign.
 The junction      figured above would, in              our first illustration,       be a
 silver one.     But   a   still simpler       process    is to go round putting a
 dot   to the right after each           crossing over, and vice versa.             Silver
 crossings have      two dots in one angle            ;  copper one in each of two
 vertical angles.
     Now, in order that our rule may be such as to give no work
 where there is no beknottedness, we must make the required                             ex
 pression   such    as   to    vanish      whenever      all   the    intersections     are
 nugatory.       Those       which     are   nugatory     only     in consequence         of
 their signs are in pairs, silver and copper, and will take care of
 themselves,    as we see by special examples                 like the following,         in
 which the reversal of one of the directions                     simply     reverses the
                                  signs.     Hence the only part to correct for
                                  is that depending on the number of whole
                                  turns, and the sketch of the india-rubber
                                  band     above   shows      that the     work at      the
 vertex of each such partial             closed   circuit is simply           not to     be
 counted   — i.e., that      the  ±   4ir, which would be reckoned               for each
crossing by our rule, is to be considered as made up for by the                        cor
responding screwing of the pole round the curve.
    To illustrate the application of this process, let                us consider again
the two distinct forms with five non-nugatory intersections

have all its signs changed) whose schemes are, respectively                   —

The lower signs refer         to over or under, the upper to the electro
magnetic     work, or to the silver-copper          distinction.         These two
instances, in which both series of signs are absolutely identical,
each with each, show at once that we cannot take the two sets of
signs alone as fully descriptive of the knot.
   To determine       the electromagnetic work for any knot, we must
divide the   scheme     into independent circuits, no one of which in
cludes a less extensive one       ; and omit from the reckoning the work
for the terminal      of  each such circuit, and for each of the intersec
tions which     is not included in any one    of   the separate circuits.           The
particular   closed circuits    chosen do not affect the final result,             as is
easily seen by thinking of the various deformations of each figure.
   In  the first of the two schemes above there is but one independent
non-autotomic circuit, which may be taken              as
                                A D B E    C A   .
In this all   the intersections are included, so that the whole work is
to be found by leaving out that for        A only    ;   i.e.,  it is  - 16 a-.
   But in the     second scheme     we may take the two circuits
                          BADBandCADC,
and  E  is not included in either.       Hence we must leave out of count
the work for B, C, and           E  ;  and thus the        whole work is only
 -Sir.
   In fact,  the figures show that to untie the first knot we must not
only  have the signs such that we can slip off             B   and    E, but    also  C
and D, i.e., two signs must      be   changed ;  while the second           loses    all
its beknottedness     if A  and D could be got rid of, that is           if  one   sign
only be changed.        This is  an instance in which the estimate by the
electro-magnetic      process exactly agrees with         the result      of simpler

  294                Proeeeditig8     of the Royal Society
  considerations.      And it is probable after all that the      true measure
 of beknottedness is the smallest number of signs in a scheme which
  must be altered in order that the wire may cease to be knotted.
     It will  be found that the alteration        of  five signs is sufficient    to
 remove     the knotting     from the annexed figure, and the stages of
 operation of the various modes of reduction show that this form can
 be  regarded as made       up of simpler knots intersecting one another
on the same string.        In such     a case  it is not  easy to give a strict
definition     of the beknottedness in any other way than by defining
 it as the smallest number of changes          of sign which will    take off all
 the   knotting.     For the separate knots are virtually independent,
and to    change all the signs in any one of them does not in every
case     necessarily   simplify the knot.           Uncorrected    the  work is
  -  13 x 4ir.    Corrected it is - 10 x       4ir,  which    agrees   with    the
removal of the beknottedness by change of five signs only.
    If the sign of the one unsymmetrical crossing be altered, four
changes     of sign will suffice   ; for the uncorrected work is        11 x   ir;
corrected it is     - 8 x 4ir,  corresponding to four changes of sign.
    The various      modes     alluded to in my paper of adjusting              the
(lower) signs so that there shall be no beknottedness, follow at once
from these remarks.            For we may make all the free letters in
each    circuit +,   save those     which we have taken, in pairs, in        some
previous circuit.
    Tbis   test, though extremely useful as above explained in classi
fying knots with the same number of intersections,                 is not fully
descriptive of a knot, being ambiguous whenever there                    is more
than one class of knots with the same number of intersections                  and
with the same excess or defect of silver as regards copper crossings.
This consideration, which promises           to clear up some obscure          and
difficult parts of the subject, has led me to some very curious re
sults.     The most important of these is when a knot, whatever                  be
its number of intersections, has equal numbers of silver and                      of

                       of Edinburgh, Session 1870-77.                          295
copper crossings, or when the uncorrected expression for the electro
magnetic work vanishes. Thinking of this in connection with the
fact that a change from right-handed to left-handed in a knot simply
changes silver       to copper, or vice versa, i.e., reverses     the sign of the
electro-magnetic work,         1 was  led to see that there is    a class of knots
which      are capable   of being changed   from right   to left-handed, without
change of form, by the ordinary          processes of deformation.       Of course
this implies that there is        a  mode of interchanging        the letters, two
and two, in the scheme,          so that  their order remains unaltered       ; or,
what      comes to the same thing, that we shall get exactly             the same
scheme        (signs  not included) by taking either of two different
crossings as A, and lettering as usual from it in the same direction
 round the curve.
     It   will be readily found     by trial that this can be done with the
only forms which have four valid intersections — as they are figured
 in my former paper — if only the wire or cord be so twisted about
 that, while the form is preserved, the junctions B, D be brought into
 the positions relative to the figure which were formerly occupied
 by    A, C.     For the  scheme
                              +--++--+
                              ADBACBDC|              A
                              -+-+-+-+
 remains the same, so far as the letters are            concerned,     if we keep
 the     same    cyclical order of letters, but write     A for B, B for C, &c.
  In estimating the electromagnetic work, by the rule above, we find
  we may leave out either A, C, or B, D.             So that the work is ± 8v,
  i.e., one degree     of beknottedness.
      The following      case, with six intersections,      is very instructive.
  Either figure is formed from the other by throwing               the lower coil
  over the top of the whole.

 the       knot and loop are interchangeable                         between        two groups             of
 three       intersections.           The knot         is right-handed        when transferred
 to    the      second       group    ;   left-handed        in the first.        But the figures
 plainly show that they                    may       also    be regarded as a right nnd                     a
 left-handed simple knot having a part common to each,                                           so    that
 neither can           be    pulled tight, subject to our convention that there
 shall     be   nothing higher than              a   double point.      And       here the   peculiar
difficulty associated               with the amphicheiral forms comes in                     ;    for, in
estimating the electromagnetic work, we find we must leave out one
copper          and one silver junction              — t he result being +8ir            - 8x.        This
is to be treated as             ±    16ir (or two degrees           of beknottedness)        because
the portions with different signs belong to what are, virtually                                            at
     two
 least,            knots *

      The possibility of such amphicheiral forms is obvious from one
of the first            illustrations       in       my former       paper;       where     we        have
only to suppose               the    irrelevant        crossing removed,          and one         of    the
separate simple knots (which are both right-handed in the cut)
made left-handed.   But I was not at first prepared to find this
property in any knot not separable                            into detached,        self-contained
portions        ;   so that   it    is possible that some           of my former          statements
may require modification.

figures above are mere transformations of the last cut in my former paper
— which is shown to be capable of being opened up by a single change of
sign. This can be done in the figures above, at either end of the lower
coil where it forms part of the external boundary.     But    without alteringif,
the outline of the figure, we change all the signs in either of the two com
ponent knots, so as to make them both right-handed, or both left-handed, the

      It will      be seen   that the sole difference between the amphicheiral
knot and that last figured, lies in the inversion of the positions
of A and F in theireven places in the scheme.
      It   appears,       then, that none of these abbreviated methods,                  how
ever useful  temporary aids to classification, can take the place
                     as
of the scheme in fully describing the form of a knot and in
measuring the amount of beknottedness in general.                              Especially is
the scheme required                  in order to calculate the beknottedness in
terms of the electromagnetic work.                       And this conclusion might,             I
think,        have    been     inferred    from the        prominent    part which          the
arrangement of the letters in the even places plays in determining
the form of a knot; an arrangement of which only traces are left
when we substitute the sign of the work at each junction for the
letter attached to             it,   thus losing all control of the amount to                be
added or subtracted on account                 of the mere number of coils.

thus raised, i.e., the distinction between Knottiness and Beknottedness,                   is   a
very troublesome and delicate one, and        obviously related to several of the

Thomson,        I  am indebted for various hints, usually in the especially
valuable form of criticisms and reasons for doubt), has lately called
my attention to a paper by Listing, of date 1847, part of which is
devoted     to the subject of knots.             I  have this morning obtained it
from the Cambridge University Library, but have not yet thoroughly
read it.     As    was to be expected,        I  find that the author has antici
pated some of the contents of my papers                  ; and he mentions at        least
one very curious fact, which              I  had thought possible, but had not
observed, though         it is very directly connected with one of the results
of the present note.          He virtually     shows, by    giving  a  particular   case,
that the method of deformation which                    I  employ does not always
give all possible forms of a completely knotted wire.                          I  believe
that this depends on the fact that a part of the scheme is amphi-
cheiral.     I     propose    to give the Society          an  account of Listing's
method     and results on the earliest opportunity.

                         Powders.         By Professor Tait.
   Several years ago Professor Dewar gave me a specimen                          of silica
in a state   of exceedingly minute division, which had                  been produced
in Dr Playfair's laboratory in the preparation of fluosilicic acid.                       I
noticed at the time how much its great mobility                       is increased      by
heating — so that it          behaves     almost like a liquid.        And    I   fancied
that  I observed       close to the surface a thin stratum of what might
by the same          analogy be called         a  vapour;    consisting of particles
thrown up and falling back again, like the little drops thrown                       up at
the surface of soda-water.             I  was inclined to ascribe these pheno
mena     to     heat   directly — supposing that the particles                 were fine
enough to behave,           though in      a very imperfect way, as the kinetic
theory assumes the particles of a gas to behave.                  However this        may
be, the extreme mobility            of   such   powders when heated on            a plati
num dish      ;   and the fact, noticed by chemists, that a bath of calcined
magnesia is capable            of propagating        waves when heated       ;   seem    to
show that valuable results might                 be obtained by seeking for evi
dence of inter-diffusion          as the result of experiments made              by   very

experiment)     some   of  the  Fellows, who may have access to a suit

be induced to give the experiment a fair trial.
   4. Abstract of Additional Memoir on the Parallel Boads
             of Lochaber.         By D. Milne Home, LL.D.
    Mr Milne Home stated that         he had been induced     to resume    his
researches in     the Lochaber      district, in consequence of a lecture,
in June last, by Dr Tyndall of London, at the Royal Institution,
Albemarle Street, and subsequently printed aud published.                  In
this lecture, Dr Tyndall controverted            the detrital theory of lake
barriers, and advocated the glacier theory ; — supporting          his views
by a reference      to observations      which    Dr Tyndall said he had
recently made on a special visit to the Parallel Roads.
   Mr Milne Home said that on account of Dr Tyndall's reputation
as a man    of science, and his great knowledge of glacier action,         he
had thought     it right to reconsider his own opinions, and go back
to Lochaber with      Dr Tyndall's lecture in his hand.
   During this recent visit, Mr Milne Home said he had obtained
farther information bearing       on the question, which he hoped might
be   deemed sufficiently       important     to  be  communicated      to the
Society.
   He would first mention the import of this information,           and then
offer remarks on Dr Tyndall's lecture.
   After recapitulating      the grounds on which        he had in his last
Memoir suggested that the barriers of the old lakes had been com
posed of the natural detritus of the district, he mentioned the fol
lowing facts, in corroboration of      these grounds —
   1. He specified several additional cases of lakes, in Stratherrick
(a district not far from Lochaber), now kept
                                                       in by detrital block
age, and which, owing to a partial lowering of this blockage, had
subsided from higher levels, —these higher levels being indicated
by  horizonal lines of cliff.

300                   Proceedings of        the  Royal Society
   2.  He specified the occurrence of thick beds of detritus, consist
ing of clay, gravel, and sand, along the hills between Stratherrick
and    Strathspey, at levels of from 2000 to 2500 ft. above the sea,
— heights far greater than the sites of the barriers of the old
Lochaber lakes.
    3.  He next indicated         on a map the probable sites of the barriers
by which      the lakes of Glen        Roy   and Glen Spean had been respec
tively    confined,     till the barriers       were    broken     down,    and gave
reasons for     fixing on these sites.
    4.  While in his last Memoir              he  had    attributed     the breaking
down of the barriers to the agency of the rivers discharging from
the lakes, and also of streams flowing upon the barriers from the
adjoining      mountains, he         now added       another probable cause of
injury,    to the barriers at the mouths of Glen Spean and Glen Glusy
in the agency       of the   sea, there being probable evidence that when
these barriers existed, the sea was standing at a level                  of about 500
or 600 feet       higher than at present          ;   and   that the blockages        of
these two glens were so near the sea, when at that                      height,   as to
form sea-cliffs.
    He explained that this evidence consisted, first, in the occurrence
of sea shells, said to have been found at two places                      outside   the
Glen Spean barrier, in beds of clay from 200 to 500 feet above                      the
sea, by persons whose              trusworthiness      he had      ascertained  ; and,
second,    in the existence of a series of terraces,           in the district about
Spean     Bridge,     from 400 to 500 feet above the sea, which he                 con
sidered to be marine.
    5.  Mr Milne Home then adverted               to the grounds on which the
glacier     theory rested,        and   stated   that by another          visit   made
 last autumn        to   Corry     N'Eoin     and Glen       Treig,    the only     two
valleys, where a glacier is supposed                to have    existed, when Glens
Spean     and Roy were occupied by lakes,                 he had     discovered    that
these valleys, instead         of being then filled with        ice, must have been
occupied     by water,      viz., the water of the Glen Spean Lake ; inas
much as there are beach lines round the whole of L oc Treig, and
also at the mouth         of Corry N'Eoin.
    6.  Referring      to   what had      been    called     the    Moraines    of   the
alleged Treig glacier — viz.,           at Murlaggan,      and in the district       be
tween     the  Rough Burn and Fersit,            — he said that at Murlaggan

                      of Edinburgh,      Session   1870-77.               301
the knolls referred to were composed entirely of beds of sand and
fine gravel, — manifestly       deposited by water, and not brought by
a glacier.
    The    supposed     Moraines, between Rough Burn and Fersit,          con
sist of enormous embankments of gravel, apparently sub-marine,
and formed when the sea stood some thousands of feet above its
present level.       The boulders    strewed  over this district, and heaped
on these embankments, had probably been brought by floating ice,
in a current from the westward, flowing up the valley of Spean
towards Strathspey.
     7. In   regard to Dr Tyndall's lecture, Mr Milne Home pointed
out,    that when      impugning    the soundness of the detrital       barrier
theory, Dr Tyndall had given a representation of that theory only
from Sir Thomas D. Lauder's Memoirs, written fifty-nine years
 ago, and not from the more            recently published    Memoirs,    which
stated facts and arguments not to be found in           Sir Thomas Lauder's
paper.        Moreover,   Dr  Tyndall    had unfortunately misapprehended
Sir Thomas Lauder's views regarding the formation of the barriers,
ascribing      to him views on this subject disparaging         to the detrital
theory, which neither Sir Thomas nor any other author entertained.
     The only specific objection to the detrital theory suggested by
Dr Tyndall, was the alleged absence of any traces of barriers.
 Mr Milne Home stated that he thought there were traces; and
 that, even if there were none, the want of them would be no valid
 objection to the theory.
     With regard to the grounds on which Dr Tyndall maintained
 the glacier theory, Mr Milne Home stated that Dr Tyndall ought
 to have shown, how there could be such a difference in the climatic
 condition of the two sides of Spean Valley, that while the glens on
 the south side were filled with ice, the glens on the north side were
 filled with water; — this, however, Dr Tyndall had failed to do.
     Mr Milne Home farther          stated that though    it was undoubtedly
 true   t hat some traces    of glacier action  were visible in various parts
 of Lochaber, these, as it seemed to him, belonged to a period in the
 world's history long antecedent to the lakes of Glen Roy and Glen
 Spean.       When    these  lakes existed, the water of the Spean        lake
 penetrated into the two glens (Corry N'Eoin            and  Treig), supposed
 to have been       occupied by glaciers.       It  was therefore a physical

302                 Proceedings of     the  Royal Society
impossibility, that there could have been glaciers in these two glens
at the time that there were lakes in Glen Roy and Glen Spean.
    Even    if there had been glaciers in these glens, these glaciers,
to reach the position    of the Glen Roy barriers, would,     after emerging
from their parent glens, have had to travel seven             or eight miles
across uneven ground, push themselves round the corners             of several
hills, and rise up to a level several hundred feet above these glens.
If it was    possible to suppose that the tongues of these glaciers could
reach    the   required spots, the notion of their forming solid           and
permanent barriers at these spots seems quite untenable.

 space, the point at which       light coming from    a fixed source     is re
 flected, moves in a curved surface.          In this paper the motion        of
 the wire was supposed to be restricted to the plane passing through
 the eye and the source of light.        The curve   was shown to be of the
 third order, having a straight line as a symptote both ways, and             to
 depend for its form upon a characterising          angle.    The interest of
 the subject lay chiefly       in the remarkable transformations        of  the
 curve.

     The following is but     a short and incomplete account of a com
 pound formed on the carbon and binding screws of a makeshift
 Leclanche battery. The cells employed were ordinary Bun sen ele
 ments,    of which the    carbon   was embedded    in manganese dioxide;

the substance in question grew on the brass binding screws, and as
a thin layer on the carbon. The external appearance of the mass
was reniform, the colour ranging from a pale blue to a dark purple
and lilac tint ; the portions from the carbon were of a pale green
shade, and of     no special shape.     The quantity being small, it was
impossible    to make    more  than  one   analysis of each substance, and
that only with very small quantities.          The exterior portions which
 showed no crystalline structure, and were efflorescent, appeared            to
 contain less water than the interior portions, which possessed               a
paler colour, the composition being otherwise the            same.   The in
 terior  was not homogeneous, as particles of some          white substance
 could  be distinguished  scattered through the mass.        The dark purple
 and green portions, when heated to 100° C, give off ammonia and
 water in varying quantities (NH3 2 02-0-87 per cent.), and left a
 bluish green powder, which was only slightly soluble in water or
 in dilute sulphuric acid, but easily dissolved with effervescence by
 nitric or hydrochloric acid.      The original substance treated with
 water formed    a blue alkaline solution, resembling that produced by
 the solution of cupric hydrate in excess of ammonia, a green residue
 being left undissolved,      which,    with   potassium   hydrate, yielded
 ammonia.
    The analyses point    to a formula,
                           0ntZn4Cli(NH3)4CO3.
 If  the carbonic anhydride be present        as zinc carbonate, and in all
 probability the above-mentioned         white particles    are  (ZuCOJ,    we
 have present the substances,
             (2NH3Cu)Cl2 +    (2NH,Zn)Cl, + ZnCO,        + ZnCl3  .

  And in another analysis,    no carbon dioxide being present,

    In  contact with  a portion of the substances analysed was metallic
  copper;  this may probably account for the varying            quantities   of
 combined     copper in its immediate        neighbourhood,     some   of the
 results obtained indicating the presence of an ammonio-cuprous,
 as well as of an ammonio-cupric       compound.      No trace of metallic
 zinc could be found.

    In  a work recently     published   by Professor     Plantamour      on the
 climate of Geneva, the hourly means of the aqueous vapour of                  the

 made    during the twenty-seven years ending with         1 875.   The    curves
 drawn from these figures are undoubtedly           the most remarkable          of
 the meteorological specialties of the climate of Geneva.
     Professor    Plantamour     endeavours to explain       the facts of     the
 diurnal    hygrometric     curves at Geneva       by    the ascending        and
 descending currents of air consequent on the diurnal march of                 the
 temperature.       These systems of air currents serve to explain apart
 of the phenomena in question, — but only a part, and we think                    a
 very small part.       A reference to   the curves at other places is suffi
 cient   to  show that      this  explanation    is insufficient.     There      is
 another cause to which the characteristic           feature    of the     curves
 is due, and that cause is the diurnal        changes of the wind, which

occur at Geneva, arising from its position                    with reference to Lake
Geneva, and from the qualities              of these winds as determined                 by
the relative size of the lake.
     The hourly variations in the direction of the wind show that the
land    and lake    breezes     are strongly      marked —the breeze              from the
lake prevailing during those hours of the day when the tempera
ture of the land is in excess of that of the lake, the land breeze
during the rest of the day. In December, when the land is at no
hour of the day warmer than the lake, no breeze from the lake sets
in    over Geneva, and also          in January       the breeze from the lake is
but slight    and   of short continuance.               These       breezes    leave their
impress in a most distinct manner                  on     the curves of the hourly
variation of the vapour tension.                During the winter months, when
no    breeze from the lake,          or but a feeble one,          sets     in, the vapour
curves show only one daily minimum, occurring about sunrise, and
one maximum, about 2 p.m., whereas during the other months, from
March     to October, the vapour curves           exhibit two daily minima, one
about or shortly before sunrise, and the other from 2 to 4 p.m., and
two maxima, one from 8 to 11a.m., and the other from                           6 to 10 p.m.,
according to season.           Equally marked         are the curves of the hourly
variations    of cloud, the maximum during the winter months occur
ring about sunrise, and the minimum about sunset.                             On the other
hand, during the warm months there are two maxima and minima
— the first maximum occurring about or shortly after sunrise, and
the second, but by far the larger maximum,                       about 6 p.m., and the
two minima shortly after midnight, and from                        9 to 11 a.m.
     The explanation of        these instructive        phenomena is doubtless to
be found in the       size of Lake Geneva, whichis large enough to
occasion a strong breeze during the duy from the lake all round its
shores.      On the setting        in of the
                                         the air conveyed by
                                                breeze,                                   it,
having been resting sometime previously on the surface of the lake,
is   necessarily moist, and while this state of matters continues                       the
first daily maximum of vapour tension                   is   reached.       As the   breeze
continues, the current          is   necessarily drawn from higher strata of
the atmosphere, and being thus but               a   brief interval in contact with
the lake the air becomes           constantly drier       till    the second daily    mini
mum occurs, from      2   to   4   p.m.   The   breeze then gradually diminishes
in   force, and the air consequently            becomes          moister,    till the maxi

 mum vapour tension        of the day occurs about          the time when the
 breeze from the lake falls        to a calm, and before the        land breeze
 springs up.
    A cursory examination of the curves           suffices to show that there
is a close connection       between    their critical phases and      the corre
sponding phases of atmospheric pressure and temperature;                  and the
idea is suggested that in this great contribution of Plantamour's                to
the meteorology of Geneva, we are put in possession of data                 of the
utmost importance as regards           the  relations of the vapour of         the
atmosphere and its movements to changes of atmospheric pressure
in a way such as could be done by the observations of few observa
tories.
                 5.   On Knots.        By Professor Tait.
                                   (Abstract.)
    At  the last meeting of the Society       I stated that    I  had just pro
cured    a remarkable essay by        Listing, part of which bears on the
subject of knots, and that I had found in it an example of a change
of form not producible by the modes of deformation I had employed.
    It had for some time struck me as very singular that, thoug:                    I
could easily prove that (when nugatory intersections are removed)
a knot in which the crossings are alternately over and under is not
farther reducible,     I  could not prove all its possible deformations            to
be producible by inversions or projections          of the kinds     specified in
my paper; but,      as   soon as   I  recognised the existence of amphi-
cheiral forms,   I  saw that    it was probable that they would furnish a
key to my difficulty.        I  immediately     set to work to classify          the
simpler of such forms; and while            I was thus engaged         I  got the
Gottinger Studien for 1847, in which is Listing's paper,                 with    the
title Vorstudien zur Topologie.
    By this title Listing      means     qualitative as distinguished         from
quantitative space-relations.        He  commences      with a study of inver
sion (Umkehrung) and perversion ( Verlcehrung),           — the first being     the
effect  of  a rotation    through two right angles about any axis, the
second the result of reflexion in a plane mirror.
    He next treats of screwing of all kinds, including twisting                and
plaiting.

                      oj Edinburgh, Session 1876-77.                                      307
  He then applies the notion of lines winding or screwing round
one another to the projection of a knot on a surface, and shows that
we can thus obtain a knowledge of the relative situation of the
various coils.     At    each crossing portions         of    the two branches may
be regarded as small parts of lines twisted round one another.                                Of
the four angles       so formed, two vertical or opposite             ones are bounded
towards the right, the other two towards the left, by that line which
passes over the other.           We thus distinguish          these pairs of vertical
angles into right- and left-handed.                [Listing   uses right-handed for
what     we should call left-handed            in screwing, but the difference is
of no importance,   far as his results are concerned.]
                        so
   Next he shows that perversion, but not inversion, changes right-
handed into left-handed angles.
   He then gives         the complete knot with three intersections, and
shows that when         it is in    a reduced (as     distinguished by him from
a reducible) form, all the           angles in each separate               mesh     have        a
common character; but that, when                   it is reducible,         some      of the
meshes have angles of both kinds.                  He distinguishes         between           the
right-    and left-handed forms of the reduced                 knot, and shows that
they     are not convertible        into one another;          also    that (including
external space, or the Amplexum) there are three meshes with two
corners each, and two with three corners; one class being right-
 handed, the other left.           And   he states     that the Amplex may be
made to change its character from right to left by being changed
 from a three-cornered to a two-cornered mesh, or vice versa.
   He points out that        a   loop (i.e., a mesh with only one corner) does
 not appear      in the reduced        form, and then writes, as the type-
 symbol of the reduced right-handed knot of three intersections, the
 expression
                                         3ra

 denoting three right-handed meshes with two corners each (Oescn),
 and two left-handed          meshes     with three corners each (Maschen).
 [The perverted, or left-handed, form              is of course represented           by the
 same symbols, with the interchange of r and                   I.]

 number     of   meshes (the       Amplex included), and             is   greater     by is   two

than the number of crossings.              The sum of the products of       the
coefficients into the corresponding exponents gives, in each of the
two parts    of the symbol, double the number of crossings. These
symbols contain the topologic character of any particular knotting.
    Listing next points out that the reduced three-crossing knot may
be obtained by three half-turns about one another of two originally
parallel    cords  whose   ends     are   afterwards joined into     one  ring,
and that the character depends upon the direction            of the torsion.
    He  proceeds to give a symmetrical knot, with seven crossings, in
two different reducible, and one reduced, forms. The reduction of
the first gives the three crossing knot, that of the second the four
forms of the essentially non-clear coil of five intersections.           (Figs.
 6-9 of my first paper.)
     Their  common     symbol he writes      as
                                    2r4-t.r*

and he points out that, in this case, the            Amplex   belongs to   each
 in succession    of these four kinds of meshes.
     He then states that the symbol
                                    2r* + 3,* )
                                    2V, +  IP   )
gives five different reduced forms, each with seven crossings; while
the symbol
                                I* +2£> +    2P   j
 has six distinct forms.
     But  he adds the    following extremely important remark : — u In
 certain cases one symbol is equivalent               to another, so that the
 reduced forms of the one can be transformed into those          of the other."
  He states that this is the case with the last written symbol and the
  following   : —
                              2>a + 2c3           .»
                                 ll  + 213 + 21'  \
 which has five reduced forms.
     Thus there   are, in all, eleven     reduced    forms of these kinds, all
 equivalent to one another, and all having seven crossings.                 The

following     are his figures:    the first and second     belonging to the
former of     the two equivalent symbols, the third to the latter —
    He concludes this part of his Essay by saying that                 " these
examples (confined as they are to single,            closed lines), and the
remarks made upon them, serve to show that the fundamental
conception of twisting       of lines is capable of being applied to the
most complex space relations."
    It  may be added that these very elegant and important results
 are given as statements      merely, without any hint of how they were
 arrived at, or how they may be extended.               In fact brevity    has
 been sedulously studied, for       all that is given   about knots forms a
 comparatively small part of the whole of Listing's extremely valu
 able, but too brief, Essay.
     The   rest  treats, rather more fully, the whole subjects of inver
 sion and perversion, screws of various kinds, plaiting and twisting,
 (with their applications to vegetable spirals, &c.), the numbers of
 lines joining given sets of points, the extensions of the meaning of
 the word Area, &c., &c.
    The   above abstract, which contains almost all of      Listing's remarks
 on knots, shows that he has long ago anticipated a very great deal
 of what    I  have lately sent to the Society.      For myself,   however,   I
 may say that      I have  had to learn only two things (about knots) from
  Listing, viz. (1), a special case (which will be examined imme
 diately), in which two forms are equivalent, though not transform
  able  into  one another by the methods      given in my first paper; and
  (2), to value more highly than        I had  hitherto done the method of
  classifying forms by the numbers of each kind of mesh, and the
  right-handed or left-handed character of each.
     My first   paper, as sent to the     Society, was essentially confined
  (as indeed its title indicates) to the results deducible from a special
 elementary theorem,      — one of two which      occurred   to me long ago

310                         Proceedings               of the Royal Society
when designing Vortex- Atoms                            of various forms, and wbich    gave             I
to Section         A    at the late meeting               of the British Association.   The
second      of   these theorems (as                  will be seen by reference to my British
Association paper, Messenger of Mathematics, Jan. 1877), was virtually
the same as Listing's division of the meshes of a reduced knot into
right- and left-handed,                 —only I           called them black and white,                      but.
as   I   did not   see how to         connect this theorem directly with the measure
of beknottedness,            I    did not formally introduce it into my papers read
to the Society.              It   virtually included in the state
                                      is,   of   course,
ments regarding coins thrown into the corners of cells, — for, taking
the case of the silver and copper coins, the pair of left-handed
vertical angles are those in which, or in one of them, there is
silver — the right-handed, copper.
     Nothing          can    be clearer than                   Listing's statements                on   several
parts of      the subject         :    it   is   greatly to be desired that he had made
many more.               Still, with        a    cordial recognition of the great value                          of
all that      is   to be found in                Listing's          paper, I   adhere to what           I   said
in my last communication, to the effect that the full character                                                  of
a    knot cannot            be    learned except from its " scheme," or some
thing equivalent             to   it. That the type-symbol (when such   repre                           a
sentation        is   possible)       is    ultimately equivalent                  to the scheme            may
possibly      be       true,* especially when we consider that virtually                       it
contains two independent descriptions of     knot (i.e. in terms of itsa
right-handed and its left-handed meshes separately) that for pur                          ;

tially different characters.               Listing's      avowed object was to            simplify
notation     as far as possible.  My impression is that, in one respect
at least,    he   has carried simplification a little too far; for it cost
me some little time and trouble to draw, from his type-symbol,
the    one   knot which          he speaks of, but leaves                     undrawn,    viz.,    as
above, —
                                           2H   +   3r'   >
                                           2P   +   2P    j"
Here is      one    of     its forms:        transformation               will    give   the     four
others.
In    fact the type-symbol,          even in this specially simple and symme
trical   case, where     it    is much condensed,              contains just as many sepa
rate typographical characters as the scheme             ; and I think there can
 be no doubt whatever that             it is almost incomparably more easy to
 draw the figure from the scheme than from the symbol.                                   Given the
 scheme, the symbol can be formed from it in a moment;                                   while the
 finding of the     scheme from the symbol is very troublesome.                                But in
 such a matter experience is the only guide, and                          I   have had almost no
 practice in trying to draw from the symbol.                              Listing's type-symbol
 leads directly, however,            to an inquiry             not even suggested           by the
 scheme; (for the latter, as have givenI                       it,
                                            essentially confined to  is
a                        —
   single closed curve), viz., the forms of more than one closed
 curve, intersecting           one   another or not, which jointly                       divide an
unlimited plane into given numbers of                          meshes with given numbers
 of sides.

312                    Proceedings     of the Royal Society
  The first idea of this was suggested to me when                         I endeavoured to
draw the curve with six intersections, whose type symbol is
                                      3r
                                      21*i   + 3P   }'
This symbol obviously satisfies the three numerical conditions;
but, on trying to draw the corresponding figure, I found that it
always came out as             a species     of endless chain of three separate
links.        One of its forms, from which the others can be found by
transformation, is three circles, every two of which intersect.
  Two figures of         8,   linked together at each end, give the symbol
                                                      '
                                      2h +     IP )       .
And      by   shifting   the twist from one         to the other, as explained            in
the latter part of this paper, the symbol may be changed to
                                       + 2c3 + r"
                                                         }.
   I   have not as yet studied the theory of type-symbols, as                      it differs
so much from my own method;                   but it is obviously desirable to find
the criterion by which           to distinguish       from one another the type-
symbols necessarily denoting one closed curve, and those neces
sarily denoting two or more intersecting curves. It is probable that
there are symbols which may represent either                          kind of figure.   The
inquiry will no doubt be found very simple,                      if   only approached from
the proper side.
   I   now pass to the sole point of               which (so far as
                                                Listing's         paper
knots are concerned) was thoroughly new to me, though not unex
pected ; and       I
              shall lead up gradually to the special case which he
gives, using for the purpose the properties of the amphicheiral knots
mentioned in my last paper.
   To apply       the amphicheiral           property to the production             of new
forms, we may begin by studying under what conditions the internal
arrangements of a knot can be altered while four points of its con
tour, and two of the parts of the cord or wire joining pairs of these,
are fixed.       [The    reason for the number            four    is,   that when two only

                     of Edinburgh, Session 1876-77.                                        313
are employed to mark off separate parts                     of   a knot,     it is either (a)
virtually unconstrained, or (6) it is divisible (and is actually divided)
into two separate knots.] If, under these circumstances, changes
can be made on one side of the fixtures, they will be practicable
also in whatever way         these   points   be   connected by the rest      of   the   string,
provided always that it be not led through the amphicheiral                               part.
Hence,    if there
               be an amphicheiral part of any knot, it may often
be transformed in situ ; the rest of the knot being unaltered, but
the amphicheiral           part being made          to present, as      it   were, another
hand to the rest.
  To begin with a very simple case, let us take the simplest amphi
cheiral form — the complete knot with four crossings — as below.
When the first of these is inverted, 0 being within either of the
interior three-sided meshes, the second is produced : if 0 be in one
of the boundary three-side meshes the perversion of the second is
produced.    But we may easily convert 1 into 2 by fixing the lower
crossing (i.e., by fixing a point near it in each of the four lines
diverging from       it,   so that the dotted part remains fixed), and making
the upper loop rotate so             as   to banish      the upper crossing.              Thus
the upper parts of these two figures are equivalent.
  And     we can now suppose the (dotted) portions between                          the fixed
points to be cut open and reknotted in any way we choose,                          — subject,
of course, always to the rule of alternate over and under, else the
knot would in general be reducible.    Of course, unless we wish to
study linking, the ends must                  be   joined    so   as to preserve           con
tinuity throughout the string.
  The simplest        modes of  joining (without additional intersections)
give us   at once     two different aspects of the same " trefoil" knot                          :
— with     one   crossing        additional        we   have      the   original         figures

314                Proceedings      of the Royal      Society
              above: with two additional                   the following,   —
(1 and   2)                                      we have
figured in my first paper.
   With   three we have two apparently different forms,
These are, however, only transformations of the six-crossing amplii-
cheiral form (figs. 3 and 4 of my last paper), and are directly trans
formable into one another.         They  are,  of course,  unchanged if    the
lower part   be reversed,   for the upper parts are symmetrical.
   But  when we add       four new crossings, as below,       instead of   the
single crossing removed,      we get the two equivalent figures
which are not transformable into one another by the processes of
my first paper.     In fact the schemes will be found to be incom
patible, begin each where we choose.           In Listing's notation their
type-symbols would stand respectively, thus —
                   2r* +   2rM               f r* + r* + i3+,*
                                    a"
                   2!* + 31*  ]              \2li + 3P
The schemes are

                                                                           A.
   Hut even this simplest amphicheiral         form has other applications.

                     of Edinburgh, Session 1876-77.                         315
Thus,   it  will easily  be seen   that the figures below are mere distor
tions of fig.   2 above; and that, the dotted parts being fixed, they
can   be   changed on an actual cord into one another, and                  even
reversed (as from left to right), thus giving four distinguishable
forms, of which I figure only two, —
 Each of     these may be changed without undoing the fixtures              to its
 reverse (from left to right) by the first simple process just described,
 the loop, in fact, being transferred from one branch of the (undotted)
 cord to the other.
    Of  course the number of ways in which             the dotted part can      be
 varied is infinite.     I therefore give here only that which reproduces
 the forms already quoted from Listing             as equivalent.
  A glance    shows that their type-symbols are
                   r6+3r3          |                (2ti + 2r3
                   i4 + 2J3 + 2/2  j                Ua + 2t» + 2P
  which are those already quoted from Listing.
    In  fact, looking at Listing's figures above, we see that in each
  there is  a  part of the curve, containing four crossings, exactly the
  same as one or other of the two (partly dotted) distortions of the
  4-crossing knot above.
     The   paper contains many other instances of these applications             of
  amphicheiral     forms.
     In conclusion, it appears that the problem of finding all the abso
  lutely distinct forms of knots, with      a  given number of intersections, is
  a much more difficult one than        I at first thought;  and it is so because
  the number of really distinct species of each order is very much lies
  than  I  was prepared     to find it.    The question now belongs more to
     vol. ix.                                                          2 t

quantitative       than to qualitative                 relations.      It   resembles,        in fact,
the species      of problem originally suggested                       by Crum Brown, and
resolved    by Sylvester and Cayley, of determining                              the number             of
conceivable Hydrocarbons                       under given conditions                of limitation.
And here     I   am glad to leave               it,   for at this stage         it   is   entirely out
of my usual sphere              of work,        and    it   has already occupied too much
of my time.

    It  appeared to the author that facts having an important bearing
on the question, which of these is the better representation of the
constitution of such bodies, might be obtained by the study of the
sulphur compounds of trimethyl-sulphine,              of the     corresponding
selenium compounds, and of the intermediate substances.
    The following    list, in which   each substance is formulated — a,
on    the assumption of tetrad sulphur       and selenium, and         6, on the
supposition of molecular union illustrates this idea.

    Of these it is obvious that (3) and (6), (5) and (7), and (4) and
 (10) form three pairs of isomers.
    Upon any theory (3) and (6) may be expected to be different, but
 it is not so with the other two pairs.       They ought to be different,
if the assumption of tetrad sulphur and selenium                 is correct, but
on the theory of molecular combination          it is difficult to    see how   a
difference of properties could    be  accounted for.
     The hydrate and also the carbonate of trimethyl-sulphine                 are
readily acted upon in the dry condition by sulphuretted hydrogen,
and the product is colourless    if air  has been    rigidly excluded.       The
characteristic reaction with nitroprusside shows the product to                be
a  sulphide or sulphhydrate, but the action of oxygen upon it is so
rapid that it has not yet been obtained in a condition fit for
analysis.      Before attempting to prepare it in a state of purity, it
was thought best to examine the products of its oxidation.                 These
are— (1), an orange polysulphide, which in the presence of moisture

and oxygen is further oxidised, with separation of yellow sulphur,
yielding (2) hyposulphite of trimethyl-sulphine.
   The action is thus similar to that of sulphuretted hydrogen on
potash or carbonate of potash, but takes place with much greater
rapidity.
   The examination of the sulphide and polysulphide of trimethyl-
sulphine will form the subject of the next part of the paper.

                                               (A bstract.)
  Though          in my former papers on knots                             I    have   made    but little
allusion to cases in which two or more closed                                      curves     are linked
together, the method                I   have         employed is easily and directly ap
plicable     to    them.        I   stated         to the British Association                   that the
number of intersections                   passed         through           in    going   continuously
along    a   curve, from any intersection to the same again, is always
even   — whether it        be   linked with other curves or not                             Hence, even
when a number of closed curves                           are linked together,               the intersec
tions may be so arranged as to be alternately over and under along
each    of the    curves.
   When this is done, each of the meshes has all its angles right or
left handed ; so that Listing's type-symbols may be employed, just
as for a single knotted curve.    The scheme, however, consists of
as many parts as there are intersecting curves                                  — each part contain
ing, along with each of its own crossings twice, each of its intersec
tions with other curves             once.
  Thus                              A B    |   A          AB       |   A

   Of   course such figures can be transformed or deformed                according
to the methods given in my first paper              — the  scheme and the       type-
symbol alike remaining unaltered.               And alterations of both      scheme
and symbol are, in various classes             of  cases, producible by     the pro
cesses of my last paper without any change of links or linking.
   The    genesis of the scheme         of a link may be most easily studied
by forming a knot into a link. This is done by cutting both turns
of the wire at any junction, and joining them again so as to make
two closed curves instead of one.              No intersections are lost by this
process, except that which was cut across, provided,                 of course,   that
the original knot had no nugatory intersections, and that none are
rendered     nugatory by the operation of cutting             the whole across.
   Any crossing with four adjacent crossings when the turns of the
coil pass alternately over and under one another will appear in a
scheme as follows         : —
                   .  . .    . AXB                  CXD     .
                               -     -
                                                               . .
                                                      -
                                                                   .
                                  +                 +    +
implying that from X through B and C back to X forms one con
tinuous circuit ; similarly from X through D and A back to X.
   There are but two ways            in which continuity can be kept up if
we cut the cord twice at X, and reunite the ends in a different
arrangement from the original one.
   It is obvious that if we pass from C to B, by way of              X  (abolished),
and    similarly with        the rest, we divide the continuous closed curve
into two separate           (but generally inter-linked) closed curves.             If
we pass     from A, by way of X (abolished) to C, we pass thence in
time to B, and finally          by way of D to A.        Thus the curve remains
continuous, but with one intersection less than at first.                    And, in
either case, the alternate order of the signs of the crossings                will  be
 maintained throughout.
    In   the former of these modes we take the part containing C and B
(and we may, if we please, also take the rest) in the same order as
 before the change.            The scheme is therefore, without any other
change,     simply divided into two parts,            which are separated        from
 one another by the (abolished)           junction X in its two positions.
    In   the second     mode,    it is obvious    that the letters in one of the
 two parts     separated from one another by the mark X in its two
places are simply        to be inverted in order without change.

    The  process   presents   no difficulties, so that       I shall give only two
simple examples.         Thus the    scheme of the pentacle, viz.           : —
                           ADBBC ADBEC                   | A
is divided    at A (in this   case   it  does not matter which          junction   we
take) into the    two superposed       non-autotomic ovals
                      DBEC|D,                  DBEC|D,
by   the first mode   : —,  and is simplified into
                            DBECCEBD                | D
(i.e., a wholly nugatory scheme)            by the second.
    The type-symbols in the original            state, and     in the two altered
 states, are, respectively,
                                    2r,   I
                                    2r*   )
    The last of      these   is   virtually nothing.            In   fact,  terms   in
 r or I   to the first    power    are    rejected by Listing.            And, when
 these loops are taken ofifby untwisting or by opening up, the scheme
 becomes
                                r/
                                P + 21)1
 and   a second application of the process removes the whole.
    Operating in a similar way upon the only other figure with five
 non-nugatory intersections — viz.          : —
                      A4D4B2E2C.AD4C.2E2B,             I   A
    or

                               2P + P     )
 we find three classes of cases, according to the particular intersec
 tion operated on.
    [I may here introduce, though it involves                a  slight digression, a
 method which I have found very convenient as an assistance in
 finding which intersections have similar properties as regards the

  324                Proceedings          of the Royal Society
  figures which will be obtained when they are made in                        turn the
  point of section.         In  the scheme above written the suffixes           express
  the numbers     of letters which intervene, in the            scheme,   between the
  two appearances         of the same letter.       If  n be the whole number of
 letters,   the suffix may        of  course be either 2r or      2n-2r-2.         It  is
 convenient to write always that one of these two numbers which is
 not greater than the other.               When    a   particular suffix occurs only
 once, the corresponding crossing has evidently different                    properties
 from the others      ;   if  twice, we find in general that the corresponding
 crossings have similar properties.             If three   times, two of them have
 usually like properties, but the third not — and soon.                  This method
 is useful, but it is in certain cases misleading.                 In  fact, we must
 look not only at the suffix itself, but at the place which it occupies
 relatively to the whole group of suffixes, in order to obtain absolutely
 definite information.           Something similar to this is obviously hinted
 at in   Listing's  paper, where he seems to determine the number                     of
 possible    transformations         of the figure representing         a  symbol, by
 treating the numerical coefficients much               as  I have here    treated the
 suffixes.     But this is mere conjecture on my part.]
    By this method then,           or by examining the diagram, we see that
 A and D are similar, so are B and C, while                  E may possibly    possess
 distinct properties of its own.            We   need, therefore, take only three
 cases, A, B, and         E.

     From the rules just given for removing an intersection, it is of
 course    easy to pass to those required for the introduction of a new
 intersection.
     In   endeavouring to frame          a   general method of determining
 whether a particular type-symbol necessarily denotes one continuous
 curve, or a superposition of two or more curves, I was completely
  unsuccessful.     But, as indicated in a note to my last paper,      I found
  the   reason to be that no such distinction necessarily      exists. And  by
  the application of the methods of adding or removing intersections
  given,   I found a number of instances in which the same type-sym
  bol may represent many entirely different kinds of figures.             Thus
  the following
   are all represented   alike by the symbol
                               r,   + r*  + r3 + r2 >
                               I* +  2P    + 21-    J
      But  I have since succeeded      in obtaining cases in which the same
   type-symbol    represents  two perfectly distinct single closed curves.
   One instructive example is the following

326                   Proceedings           of the Royal Society
      The common type-symbol is
                                  r'   + ^ +    r'-^r2   )
But the schemes are
                 AjE,B4G6C8HrtD6B<E6A6FsC6G6FsH6Ds                     |   A
and
      Now no change in lettering can affect the suffixes,                         so that the
two schemes are essentially different.                   In fact     the sum       of   the suf
fixes is 84 in the first scheme, but only 64 in the second.                                   The
first has, only one degree of beknottedness,                        the second         has two.
The first is not amphicheiral, the second is.
      There   is no   connection between the type-symbol, as Listing gives
it,   and the singleness or complexity of the curve represented,                          but    it
is    possible to make analogous             symbols capable of expressing every
thing of this kind.            Only we must now adopt something very much
resembling Crum Brown's Graphical Formulae                          for chemical compo
sition.    Some very remarkable relations follow from this process, but
I    can only allude to     a   few of the simpler of them             in this     abstract.
     The only necessary          relations among the numbers forming                          the
right or left part of       a   symbol are satisfied         if   no one    is   greater than
the sum of the others, and             if   the sum of all    is   even.       With     any   set
of numbers       subject to these conditions, we can form the right                             or
left-hand side of       a   symbol — and from that we can form the                        other
when we know the grouping.
     An example or       two    will make this clear.             Take, for instance,         the
symbol
                                        2r* + r2
                                        2P    +P
which represents the five-crossing knot of                   p.   242 above.
    A   glance at the figure shows that the following                       is   the   arrange
ment of the right-handed meshes.
the single mesh with two corners                  having one of these corners                   in
common        with    each of the       two four-sided            meshes,      which      again

                        of Edinburgh, Session 1876-77.                                     327
have three corners in common.                    Hence in this notation           the   joining
lines represent       the crossings.     Hence also the characters of the left-
hand meshes are obvious from the figure.                             Outer space has the
three external lines for             corners — inside           there is one triangle      and
two spaces bounded by two lines each (i.e.,with two corners). Thus
we reproduce the left-hand part of Listing's symbol.        But the

common,       and enables us at once to draw the annexed figure

which gives us exactly the same information                          as the first, only from
a   different point of view.
    The connections in the former figure cannot be varied, so that,
in this particular case, Listing's symbol for the right-handed meshes
alone suffices to draw the figure;                   at least   if   nugatory crossings      be
rejected.          Such would arise, for instance,                if   we tried to draw the
symbol in the form
                                             U r4
which would give three ovals joined like the links of                         a   chain — the
last having an internal nugatory loop.                      In this    case the second part
of the symbol would be

or one of its deformations.
    The criterion by which to distinguish        at once   whether    such
symbolic representations as those just given represent knots      or links
is easy to find.     If we remember that each of the (even number of)
crossings lying on a closed curve is a corner of one black and of one
white mesh (contained within the curve) — while each of the crossings
lying within it is a corner of each of two white and of two black  meshes
— we   see that unless we can enclose a part of the graphic symbol in
 such a way that the sum of the exponents within the enclosure,
 and that formed by the doubling of the number of the joining lines
 which are wholly within the enclosure, and adding it to the number
 of those which cut the boundary, are equal even numbers — the figure
 is necessarily a knot.    But if  we can enclose such a part, it requires
 to be farther examined to test whether the figure consists of links
 or is a single knot.
     Thus, in the example just given, the part
                                    /\
                                   P

 is a simple oval divided by two intersecting chords into            three-
 cornered meshes — but in the following formula
                                      r2
  although the par
  seems to  fulfil the conditions   above, it does not represent a separ

ate closed curve.       In fact, the upper line represents  a crossing on
the    boundary,   at which there is (internally) only     a   left-handed
mesh, which is impossible       if the boundary were a closed curve.
    And the lowest line in the figure is       a point in the boundary
which forms a common vertex of three (internal) meshes, two right
and one left-handed. This, also, is inconsistent with the boundary's
 being a closed curve.
    There is only one other      case which  may   cause a little trouble.
 It  can easily be seen by the fig. of last page.    For we may take out
 the following part of the symbol
                                        P
  which must obviously represent the lemniscate in the figure. Its
 exponents and lines do not satisfy our condition : but they will
 do so if we remove the diagonal line — which corresponds to what
 is (in the lemniscate when alone) a nugatory intersection.
     I  conclude by giving the representations, according            to   the
  method just explained,      of some of the preceding figures.         Thus
        \/

     It may be observed that the present method gives great facilities
  for the study   of cases in which knots are reduced, or are changed

330                Proceedings    of the Boyal Society
into links, by the removal of an intersection.           For, to take off   an
intersection   is easily seen to be equivalent simply to rubbing out
one connecting line in the figure, and simultaneously            diminishing
by unity each of the exponents at its ends.         If  it  be the   only line
connecting    these   exponents, they are      (after reduction by unit
each), to be added together.        And this consideration enables us
to obtain, even    more simply than before,     the rules for distinguish
ing  a knot from a     link.  I propose,   when   I have   sufficient leisure,
to re-investigate the whole subject from this point          of view.
   Meanwhile     I  may notice that it is exceedingly easy to draw the
outline of any knot or link by this method. All that is necessary is
to select a point in each of the lines   in the figure, and join (two and
two) all these points which are     in the boundary of each closed area.
The four lines which will thus be drawn to each of the chosen
points must be treated as pairs of continuous          lines intersecting   at
these points, and at these only.       When there     are only two sides —
and,  therefore, only two points — in    an area, two separate     lines must
be drawn between       them, and these must cross one another at each
of the two points.
   The annexed diagram       shows the result   of this   process as applied
to the following    symbol

  the only     two kinds possible with 5.

     The three last forms have each essentially only one degree of be-
knottedness.                In certain    cases (see the foot note ante p. 296) we may
give two degrees of beknottedness by altering some of the signs
— but the knot                 has then one nugatory intersection, and falls into
the class with five crossings.
     A number of curious                    problems                   are suggested              by       the process

 a parabola between       L = 0 and   L = GO"™, but for higher values of     L
 it appears to tend towards an asymptote at a finite distance from the
 axis. Thus it would seem that to double the length of very long
  sparks under these circumstances, a comparatively small percentage
  increase of potential will suffice.      This may   enable  us to explain
  some singular peculiarities      of lightning.   Mr Macfarlane intends

 1.  On the Biliary Secretion with reference to the Action of
       Cholagogues.        By Prof. Butherford,         F.R.SS. L. & E.,
       and M. Vignal.
                                  (Abstract.)
    Notwithstanding     the fact that substances      supposed   to affect the
 flow of the bile have been administered to man for more than 2000
years, there is  still very great uncertainty     as to what does and what
does not augment the biliary          excretion.    The indefinite     state    of
knowledge regarding this point is due to the circumstance that
 variations in the flow of bile from the human liver are estimated by
 simply observing the colour of the dejections, — a method that is of
 necessity exceedingly      rough, for it is impossible thus to detect
 slight variations in the excretion of bile, especially when, as in           the
 case of rhubarb, the substance          gives to the dejections      a colour
 similar to that of the bile, and where,         as in the case     of  sodium
 sulphate, the substance gives rise to copious dejections of a watery
 character, whereby the colour is diluted.
    Even   in the case of those substances            generally   believed      to
 augment the biliary flow,      e.g.,  podophylline,   observations on       man
 have entirely failed to determine whether they merely occasion an
 expulsion of bile from the gall bladder, or an increased secretion
 by the liver.    The determination of the point is of great import
 ance in scientific medicine, for it is calculated to advance our

knowledge of the nature of the diseased condition relieved or cured
by the cholagogue.
    By    experiments on animals, both of the above-mentioned diffi
culties may be overcome, and definite knowledge arrived at.
    The want of precise knowledge in this department of thera
peutics induced Nasse, Kolliker, and Miiller, Scott, Hughes
Bennett, and Rohrig to perform some experiments ; but the results
have been limited and unsatisfactory, owing to the faultiness of
the experimental methods adopted.
    In   the present research the experiments         have been performed
on dogs, fasting and curarised, in order that the secretion of bile
might be rendered constant. The bile was continuously collected
from the common bile duct, and measured every fifteen minutes,
 and the flow of bile into or out of the gall bladder was eliminated
 by clamping the cystic duct. The results obtained are as follows: —
    1. In a curarised dog that has fasted 18 hours, the secretion of
 bile is tolerably uniform during the first four or five hours after the
 commencement of the experiment, but falls slightly as a longer
 period elapses.     Its composition remains constant.
    2.   Croton  oil is   a cholagogue of feeble power.      The high place
 assigned to it by Rohrig was probably the result of his imperfect
 method of experiment.
    3.   Podophylline is    a very powerful stimulant   of the liver.   During
 the increased secretion of bile, the percentage amount of the special
 bile solids is not diminished.        If the dose  be too large, the secre
 tion of bile is not increased.       It is a powerful intestinal irritant.
    4. Aloes is   a  powerful     hepatic stimulant.    It  renders the bile
 more watery, but at the same time increases the excretion            of biliary
 matter by the liver.
     5.  Rhubarb is  a certain though not a powerful hepatic stimulant.
  The bile secreted under its influence has the normal composition.
     6. Senna is a hepatic stimulant      of very feeble power.     It  renders
  the   bile more watery.
     7. Colchicum     increases to a considerable      extent the amount of

     10.   "Euonymin,"             an impure resinous matter prepared from                 the
bark of Euonymus airopurpureus, is a powerful hepatic stimulant.
It    is    not nearly         so    powerful      an   irritant of the        intestine    as
podophylline.
     11.   " Sanguinarin,"           an impure resinous matter prepared                 from
the Sanguinaria canadensis,                is a powerful hepatic stimulant.                 It
also stimulates the intestine, but not nearly so powerfully as podo
phylline.
     12.   " Iridin,"      an impure resinous matter prepared from the root
of Iris    versicolor,      is a powerful hepatic stimulant.                It     also stimu
lates the intestine, but not so powerfully                 as podophylline.
     13. Leptandria         is a hepatic stimulant        of    moderate       power.      It   is
a feeble     intestinal irritant.
     14. Ipecacuan          is a powerful          hepatic stimulant.          It    increases
slightly     the secretion of intestinal            mucus   ;   but has no other appa
rent stimulant            effect    on the intestine.       The bile       secreted     under
the influence        of ipecacuan        has the normal composition.
     15. Colocynth          is a powerful        hepatic as well as intestinal stimu
lant.      It   renders the bile more watery, but increases the secretion
of biliary matter.
   16. Jalap is a powerful hepatic                 as well as intestinal stimulant.
     17. Sodium           sulphate is a hepatic           stimulant       of     considerable
power.          It also   stimulates the intestinal glands.
     18. Magnesium            sulphate is an intestinal but not a hepatic stimu
lant.
     19. Potassium sulphate is a hepatic and                     intestinal stimulant of
considerable power.                 Its action   on the liver    is,   however, uncertain,
probably owing to its sparing solubility.
     20. Sodium phosphate                        powerful hepatic, and
                                        is
                                        a                                      a   moderately
powerful intestinal stimulant.

                                   a                              a
stimulant.
     22. Sodium chloride                  very feeble hepatic stimulant.
                                     is

     23. Sodium bicarbonate has scarcely any appreciable effect                             as   a
hepatic stimulant.
     24. Potassium bicarbonate has scarcely any appreciable effect                               as
a    hepatic stimulant.

    25. Mercuric chloride          is a powerful      hepatic stimulant.        Its
stimulant      effect on the intestinal glands is feeble.
    26. Calomel       is a powerful stimulant       of the intestinal    glands,
but    does not increase the secretion       of bile.
    27. Ammonium chloride has no stimulating effect on the liver of
the   dog.
    28. Castor oil stimulates the intestinal glands, but not the liver.
    29. Gamboge stimulates the intestinal glands, but not the liver.
    The foregoing results, although adding greatly to our know
ledge, are in complete harmony with observations on man in every
case,    save those      of calomel and ammonium chloride;               but the
 want of harmony is probably more apparent than real, for there is
 no evidence that in man these substances really do excite the
 hepatic cells.       They may possibly occasion merely             expulsion     of
 bile already     secreted,  or may act on the liver in other ways.           The
 general conclusions of the research are as          follows : —
     1. That, as the liver      of the dog is affected by medicinal agents
 in the same sense as the human liver, this animal is suitable for
 observations that cannot        be made on    man.
    2.   The attention of medical       men is hereby directed to a number
 of valuable cholagogues,          such  as euonymin,       sanguinarin,   iridin,
 ipecacuan, sodium phosphate, sodium sulphate, &c., hitherto but
 little or not at all employed as such, owing to the absence of
 positive information       regarding their actions.
     3.  As regards the whole question of hepatic pharmacology,
 definite is hereby substituted for indefinite knowledge           ; for it is not
 only shown what         substances   really do act as cholagogues, but        it  is
 proved that they all, excepting calomel and ammonium                   chloride,
 really   do stimulate the liver to secrete more bile.
     4.  It is shown that, as such substances          as magnesium sulphate,
 gamboge, and         castor oil do not increase the secretion of bile,
 although they irritate the mucous membrane of the duodenum and
 the remainder of the intestine, the action of stimulants                 on     the
  secreting     apparatus of the liver is probably not reflex from the
 intestinal mucous membrane, but             a direct    action either upon the
  hepatic cells or upon their nerves.
     5.  It  is shown that when a purgative substance            is not a chola-
  gogue it diminishes         the biliary secretion.      The importance of          a
  knowledge of this fact is indicated.

   2.   Specimen of Auriferous Quartz.            By Patrick Dudgeon.
      The specimen was found near Wanlockhead,           Dumfriesshire,     in
 1872, by Andrew Gemmell, miner, who unfortunately broke up the
 piece, and      disposed   of the fragments to different parties in the
 locality.      Mr Dudgeon      was enabled to   get possession   of all the
 fragments, and has restored         the mass to its original form.      The
 specimen is a very interesting one, being the largest known piece
 of auriferous quartz found in Scotland ; and Mr Dudgeon thought
 it would interest the fellows of the Society to exhibit it at the
 meeting before placing it in the Museum of Science and Art, which
 has now been done with the consent of the different owners.

  1.   On    a Problem of Arrangements.           By Professor Cayley.
     It  is a well-known      problem to find for n letters the number of
the arrangements in which no letter occupies its original place              ;
and the solution of it is given by the following general theorem         :—
viz., the number of the arrangements which satisfy any             r  condi
tions is
                           (l-l)(l-2).... (1-r),

                           -2(1) +  2(12)  .. . ±(12...r),
where      1    denotes   the whole number of arrangements;          (1) the
number of them which fail in regard to the first condition ; (2)
the number which fail in regard to the second condition ; (12) the
number which fail in regard to the first condition, and also in

                                 of Edinburgh, Session 1876-77.                                                                  339
regard          to the second              conditiou              and           bo on :          2(1)       means
                                                             ;
                                                                                (1) + (2)
...     +(r):         2(12) means              (12)      +
                                                     (13) (2r)          +
                                                                            r) ; and so  . . .      +(r-l,
on, up to (12                . . . .   r),   which denotes the number failing in regard
to each of the           r       conditions.
      Thus, in the special problem, the first                                                   condition            is   that the
letter in the first place shall not be                                          a; the              second           condition       is
that the letter in the second                                place          shall not be                    ;b      and    so     on   ;
and taking           r   = n, we           have the known result, No.                                   =

I      proceed to consider the                         following problem, suggested                                       to me by
Professor Tait, in connexion with his theory of knots                                                            :    to find the
number of the arrangements of n letters a                                                       b   c . .j      k,     when the
letter in the first place                    is   not    a       or   b,   the letter in the second place

so    on   :    the numbers which refer to the conditions being always
written in their natural order, and                                     it       being understood that they
follow each other cyclically, so that                                       1    is     consecutive to n.                      Thus,
n=    6,   the set 126 of conditions                             is    [3], as consisting                       of   3    consecu

maining symbols of the column                                ;    these   are for this reason said to

columns are each                     of them           a     type by itself; viz., operating                           with

2. On the Construction of the Canon of Sines, for the Decimal
                    Division of the Quadrant.            Edward Sang, Esq.
     The convenience of having only one system of numeration                               is
so well             recognised,    that    there is no need     for   any discussion.
Already the numerical nomenclatures of all nations having any
culture             have been converted to one, namely, the decimal system,
and traces of the ancient use of dozens, scores, fifteens, or sixties,
can be found in only a very few of them.                     Although      we count our
hours in sixty minutes, we do not date the present                          as the      year
thirty-one sixties           and    seventeen.   Yet, in the matters of           measure,
weight, and value,                the old and irksome divisions       continue to be
used      ;    nay, even in those departments of science which most need
laborious calculation, we continue to employ the ancient scale of
division.
     It       is,   indeed, remarkable that, while men of business are             striving
for uniformity in            the modes      of counting and of measuring, trigo-
nometers and astronomers should remain unconcerned                            as      to the
subdivision of arcs and of time.                 We      are rapidly approaching the
anomalous position of using the decimal division                       of   the       earth's
quadrant as the source  of our standards of weights and measures,
and of yet rejecting that division in our notation of angles.
  The want of trigonometrical tables suitable to the new division
isthe real cause of this backwardness; the construction of these
tables         is    essentially the first step to the universal employment of
the decimal system.                 This   has been long and well recognised.             In
the end of the last century, Borda                 computed the decimal canon              ;
this computation was superseded by that which the French Govern
ment caused              to be made under the superintendence                of Prony      ;
but neither of these has been put to press.                    The only centesimal
table available to the trigonometer                 is   that given for each minute
                           " Tables Portatives
of the quadrant, in Callet's
                                                                  ;"
                                                                  it       was collated
with the manuscripts of Borda and of Prony, but                       is   presented      in
a   most inconvenient form.
   The eminent astronomer, Laplace, adopted the decimal divi
sion of arcs, of distance and of time, in his
                                               " Mccanique Celeste,"
published in the last year of the century.    The force of this illus
trious example might long                    since have gained universal           accept'

 344                Proceedings       of the Royal Society
ance for the system,      had not the non-publication           of the  requisite
canon prevented all progress in this direction.
    Notwithstanding       many       solicitations,   and   even   the offer by
the   English    Government        to defray a share       of the expense,     the
tables computed in the Bureau du Cadastre remain unpublished;
and the fact of their existence remains a discouragement to other
computers.
    Now, fifty years ago,       having fallen upon a method of approxi
 mating very rapidly to the roots of numerical equations,              published
 in 1829 under the title,         "Solution of Algebraic Equations           of all
 Orders,"   I  applied it to the quinquisection of an arc, and thus
obtained    directly the sine of any proposed decimal division of the
quadrant.      After proceeding       a short way in the construction of the
canon by this method,         I laid it aside, from the conviction that         the
labour could, at best, only produce a repetition of what had               already
been accomplished.
    Many   years    ago, after having felt for long the want of a table
of logarithms       more   extensive      than    any existing,    I  designed     a
 nine-place table up to one million          ;  and  having carried the     manu
script fifteen-place table up to 300 000, laid it before this Society,
 whose Council did me the exceedingly great favour of presenting to
 Government      a  memorial soliciting aid in the completion and publi
 cation.
    One   of our scientific      periodicals,     in  noticing   this  memorial,
 supplied to Government         a most      potent reason for not acceding        to
 the request, in this, that the labours of Prony              in the Bureau du
 Cadastre    had already anticipated           and surpassed    all that   can be
done in future in this department of calculation.
    Forced thus into      a  critical examination of the Cadastre Tables,
so far as that could be accomplished               by help of published docu
 ments,  I  arrived at most unexpected conclusions.
    In the first   place, the fundamental table, that of the Logarithms
of the Prime Numbers,             as   given by Legendre        in his work       on
 Elliptic Functions,     was found to be correct up to 2000; that is, as far
as Abraham Sharp and other ancient computers had gone.                      But of
 the primes bet ween       2000 and 10 000 computed in the Bureau, only
five have    their logarithms correctly given, while almost all of               the
other logarthims err on one side.

                        of Edinburgh, Session       187t5—  77.             345
      In  the second place, Henry Brigg's original table had been col-
luted by Prony's assistants, and errors in the tenth                and  higher
places had        been found   ; yet no notice had been      taken of the very
 many errors in the fourteenth and even in the thirteenth place.
      Thirdly, the system of computation adopted was so imperfect
 that, although differences of the sixth order were extended to the
 thirty-sixth place, the results were liable to errors up to the
 twentieth figure.
       Lastly ; the Cadastre calculations were used by M. Lefort for
 correcting Adrian Vlacq's ten-place table (that table of which all
the      subsequently published seven-place tables are abridgments);
  w  ith the result of sometimes putting Vlacq in the wrong when he
  is right. That is to say, the Cadastre calculations cannot be trusted
  for the compilation of       a ten-place logarithmic table.
       Such being the case with that part of Prony's great work which
  was comparable with previously published tables, we are unable to
  place confidence in the trigonometrical          portion, which necessarily
  is almost entirely      new  ; and we are forced, when contemplating the
  compilation      of the Canon of Sines, to hold the Cadastre Tables         as
  non-existent,      or at best, as useful for controlling    palpable errors of
  the press.
       In  actual trigonometrical      calculations we very seldom      use the
  sines and tangents themselves, but employ their logarithms instead;
  wherefore, both the Canon of Sines and the Logarithmic Canon are
  needed     as  the joint foundation of our working tables.       Having car
  ried the table of logarithms      as  far as to 370 000, and being satisfied
  of the insufficiency of the work done in the Bureau du Cadastre, I
  resumed the computation of the sines, and have now proceeded to
  such a length as to be able to submit the methods employed to
  the Society, and through it to the mathematical public.
       The decimal division of the quadrant          is effected  by bisections
  and quinquisections, and the first thing to be determined is the order
   in which     these operations should be taken.          Now, we obtain the
  sine of the half arc, not from the sine of the whole arc, but from
   its  cosine,   or rather from its co-versed-sine;     when the arc is small
   the co-versed-sine, or defect of the cosine from the radius, is repre
   sented by a very small decimal fraction, the number of whose

346                    Proceedings      of the Royal Society
effective figures is less than the total number of figures in the cal
culations; we have to extract the square root of its half, which
square root, can only be true to as many effective figures,                       and thus
cannot be extended to the full number.                       If, then,        we desire      to
obtain accuracy to a specified number of decimal places, we must
extend our first calculations            far beyond.         Whereas the sine of an
odd sub-multiple           is deduced   directly from the sine of the whole
arc, and the computation           is such as to retain the full number of
effective figures.          Hence we must proceed by first making all the
requisite bisections, and thereafter the quinquisections.
  There     is,   however, an obvious exception.                The sines of      20°, 40*,
C0' and  80' are obtained by the solution of quadratic equations, so
that this quinquisection naturally comes first; the bisections after
wards,    and then the remaining quinquisections.
   Having prescribed unit in the thirtieth decimal place as the
limit of inexactitude, and taken three figures more to obviate the
accumulation of the minute errors inevitable in all approximate
work,  I    computed the sines            of these four arcs             to    thirty-three
places.
  The     bisection of the quadrant gave the                    sine of 50'; that of
G0' gave for 30° and for its complement 70'                     ;   that of 20' gave for
10' and 90t, thus completing the table for each tenth part of                              the
quadrant.
  In    the same way the bisections              of   10', 30% 50', 70°, and 90t gave
the sines of the intermediate fifth degrees.
  The bisections were continued in this way until the quadrant
was divided into 80 equal parts.
  In psrforming this work,           each of the roots
         sino=     J{\-\cos2a),                         cosa=       J{\ +
                                                                       \      cos2o}
was extracted twice, and sin a was also found from the division

                                   sin   a   =
                                                 2   cos a
by which means      the values of sin a and cos a were securely got,
and     the previous computations of sin 2a, cos 2a again verified.
There were,       as   a   matter of course, small errors in the last                  places,
but the results, to the thirtieth place, were made sure.

                                                                                              347

  The quinquisections               were obtained by help               of the equation
              16 sina4         -20     sin   a3 + 5   sin a     - sin 5a = 0 = E    .
  Begarding E             as a function           of sin a, its successive derivatives
are

now, while         resolving       the equation, we get the values of all the

the first of these gives us, by extracting the square root,

                                                                  an

 error in any part of the work, propagated subsequent errors,
                                                 the results at each
 could not possibly be overlooked in comparing

.^48                  .Proceedings     of the Royal Society
 fifth step with the previously computed test values. In this way
 immunity from error was obtained, excepting in the last places,
 where small errors are inevitable.
     In performing the multiplication sin na.2 vera stopping at               the
 thirty-third      place, the last figure   of each partial product  may err in
 excess or in defect by        J; now it is possible, though not    likely, that
 all of  these errors maybe on one side, and therefore there        is a possible
 error in the last place of the total product, of half as many units
 as there are lines         in the multiplication.     By using the table of
 multiples up to one thousand, we reduce            the number of lines to one
 third, and therefore the possible amount of residual error in the
 same ratio; so that the auxiliary table both saves labour and
 augments the exactitude of the result.
     These     final-place    errors were corrected at each fifth step by
 altering the last figures of the second differences, and thus the
  accumulation of those errors was prevented.              In the whole calcu
 lation of the sines of the quarter degrees, it was not found necessary
 to alter any one second difference to so much as the          limit of possible
 error, and therefore we may hold that the manuscript table of the
 sines of these arcs is absolutely correct to within the prescribed
 degree of precision, namely,         unit in the thirtieth decimal place.
     The next quinquisection, conducted in the same way, gave                the
 sine and cosine of 5'; the functions of whose multiples were                ob
 tained as before, and compared, at each fifth step, with the previous
 work.       The table of sines to every fifth minute is already            well
 advanced.
     The third quinquisection gave the sine and cosine of the single
 minute of the decimal division.           A table of the multiples of 2 ver 1'
 has    been    constructed up to 1000, and has been used in forming            a
 good beginning         of the canon of sines to each single minute.
     For the purpose of preventing all error in the record of              these
 calculations,       the second    differences only were copied       from   the
 duplicate       scroll calculations,    and the successive first differences
 and sines were thence recomputed on the record sheet.                Since any
  error   in  copying, or even in the original computation, was neces
  sarily continued and extended into the after part of the record,            its
  detection was rendered certain, so that the recorded results may be
  implicitly relied on. To make the record more secure, each page

    Tlie method of computing might         have   been extended to differ
ences of the fourth order, in which case the common multiplier,
4 ver a2, would     have  been     much smaller, and the terms of the
products fewer.      But, on the other hand, the entries in the record
would have been mure, and the effects of the residual errors would
have been much greater and more troublesome in correction.                 For
the interpolation of each quarter degree, the saving obtained by the
 use of fourth differences would have been unappreciable ; for those
 of each fifth and of each single minute, it would have been hardly
 such as to compensate for the inconveniences just mentioned;              but
 for the future interpolations of each tenth second and of each single
 second, the fourth differences may be advantageously used.
     When the   canon   of sines shall have been completed, the com
 putation   of the working      table, that of logarithmic     sines,  will be
 easy, particularly   by help of my fifteen-place table of logarithms.
     Beginning, as John Nepair did, at the sine of the whole quad
 rant and proceeding downwards, the computed logarithmic sines
 may be verified by their differences, which are small.            When the
 work has been brought down to the log sin of the half-quadrant,
 the farther progress is easy and rapid, for the formula
                         2  sin a. cos a = sin 2 a
 gives log sin a = log    J  + log sin 2 a   -  log cos a,  so that the    dif
  ferences of any order may be got at once from the previously
 tabulated differences of that order, and, what is most             worthy of
 remark,   may be used      without    the fear of an      accumulation      of
 residual error.
     The table of logarithmic tangents follows       as a matter    of course.
  3. On the Precautions        to be taken   in recording and using the
     Records of Original Computations.              Edward Sang, Esq.
     The real utility of tables of numerical     results is ouly secured    by
  making them accessible      to those computers who may require them           ;

350                        Proceedings                   of the Royal Society
and the essence of their utility lies in this, that the labour of a
single computer saves that of many others.
     It is
        indispensable that those who use the tables be able to rely
implicitly on the accuracy of the tabulated numbers, and that they
have a ready means of detecting any error should the existence                                             of
one be suspected.
     I    do      not mean,           at present,            to say a word       on the mechanical
arrangements of setting up the types, of stereotyping, revising the
proofs, and printing ; these have already often been discussed, but
I shall take the matter up at this critical point : — The investigator
has in his hands a set of printed or of manuscript tables, which he
means to use in his researches, and he wishes to know whether the
individual           book          be or be not to be trusted.                 His    confidence         must
necessarily be influenced by the history of the book and by its co-
relatives.           Thus,         if it    be a stereotype        copy of a work in extensive
circulation, he may accept the general opinion                                   as        to its accuracy ;
but      if    the table be one                  seldom used,      such as those which serve as
the foundation of working tables, this source of confidence fails him.
     The nature of the                       case may be           most      clearly        seen   from   an
example : —
     We       propose to extend the logarithmic                            canon beyond the limits
to which            it   has        been         already printed      ;    this extension must             be
founded           on the     logarithms of the prime numbers                           ;    now Abraham
Sharp computed,                    to 61     places, the logarithm of every prime num
ber up            to 1097      ;    these were           printed in Sherwin's collection, and
thence reprinted by Callet in his Tables                                  Portatives;        shall we then
build our more extensive                             tables     on the computation              by Sharp?
Sharp was known                      as a most           zealous    and careful        computer      ;   both
Sherwin and Callet would take care that the numbers be correctly
copied        ;   yet for all that, we cannot venture to found on Sharp's
work because there is an essential omission.
     If   we were to proceed to compute, by help of these, the logarithms
of larger primes, and                      if,   after   a   lengthened series of operations, we
were          to find    a   disagreement,                   we should be left in doubt as to
which of the many logarithms that had been used may be in fault;
we    should have to recompute  such of Sharp's logarithms as might
be   implicated, while the labour and irksomeness of the search would
become intolerable.

                       of Edinburgh, Session 1876-77.                            351
   In all such calculations we seek to arrive at the result by two
independent processes.            All the use, therefore, that can be made
of Sharp's tables, is to hold his work as constituting one of these
processes   ;  a great use certainly, yet, at best, only          half of what it
might have been.
   Now, in the computation,            to twenty-eight    places,   of the logar
ithms of      the   prime numbers, no error whatever was discovered
among     those given by Callet          ;  so here   we have      an  instance of
records, in themselves quite exact, and yet insufficient                 to obviate
subsequent recomputation.
   The   means       of readily verifying      the record are awanting       ; these
means must necessarily vary with the nature of the tabulated func
tions.
   In  the volumes containing the computation of the logarithms to
twenty-eight places of all primes below ten thousand, which                      was
laid before the Society, the articulate steps of every calculation               are
recorded and indexed, so that            if  an error be suspected      in any one
logarithm,     we    have the means of instantly        verifying     the table, or
of detecting      the   source of the error.       Had   such    a record    accom
panied Sharp's admirable table, the need for subsequent re-calcula
tion would have been entirely obviated.
   The vast majority of tables have their arguments arranged with
equal differences, consequently the functions              progress gradually        ;
and, for the most part, these tables have been constructed by help
of differences.       It is then sufficient to record the differences along
with the values of the functions.              For the canon of sines I have
found it convenient to place the first difference, with the sign + ,
and then the second           difference, with the sign      - ,  below the pre
ceding sine, as shown below          : —

     This arrangement enables the computer                     to  examine any sin
 which he wishes to extract, so              as  to guard against any typographi
 cal    error ;    and,    if the table of the multiples of               2 verl'   were
 appended,      to   check readily         the computation itself.        When, how
 ever, the differences have only a few figures, the ordinary method,
 of placing them in separate              columns, is to be preferred        ; it  saves
room, while the practised calculator has no difficulty                  in performing
 the requisite additions or subtractions.               The utility of this    arrange
 ment has been long recognised.
     In the     case of tables         for common use, which are, in general,
 abbreviations of original calculations to              a greater number of places,
it is enough to give the first differences when these vary much.
    When such means of verification have been provided, the user of
the table can make            sure that the number which           he extracts       con
 tains    no   error   ;  and    if   all  users   were   to habitually     make this
 examination,         printed     tables,    and above     all  those    printed    from
stereotype,      would be gradually freed from errors of press.

    This annuloid fossil        was obtained from upper Carboniferous strata,
in    a  cutting on the Midland Railway,                valley of the Ribble,       near

the median dorsal line led              me to   conclude that the form was pro
bably rare, or one that had not been described.                       It  was thus of
importance to get the other part of the slab on which the impres-

                      of Edinburgh, Session 1876-77.                               353
 sion, or intaglio,      corresponding      to the rounded         relief, might     be
 expected.      The friend who had forwarded the fossil made diligent
 search,   but found the upper part of the slab had been destroyed.
 In answer     to a request for any animal tracks, or traces of organisms
 that might be met with in the same, or closely related deposits,                    he
 sent me several slabs of compact dark-coloured                  micaceous, sandy
shale, on which some markings occurred.                   On splitting these, they
 were found crowded         with tracks and casts of forms closely resem
bling that first     sent, though      the matrix      is  lithologically different.
These shales intervene between bands of the so-called gritstone, in
 which the form now noticed was found.                 Its position     was about 16
feet from the surface, in a gritstone bed 4 feet thick, having                  above
a deposit    of alternating shales and gritstones nearly                15 feet  thick
and below a bed of limestone.
    The dark-coloured        slabs present features       of much interest.     They
contain     traces  of three     species, the prevailing one being identical
with that     now before us, though          none of the characteristic         marks
are so sharply outlined.           They make it clear, however, that               the
surface on which the median line occurs is dorsal, and they estab
lish the bisulcate character of the track.                  On the reverse of one
slab, the intaglio     I  was anxious to obtain shows           distinctly that the
dorsal line is ridged.          This   is also very well       marked in another.
In   both the slight dorsal ridge is represented               by  a   corresponding
depression or furrow in the overlying shale.                  Even the outlines of
these tracks are suggestive to the ichnologist.                  Some of them are
comparatively      deep, some shallow        ; in some the bisulcate character
is well seen, while in others the lower surface of the track is flat.
The explanation of this is obvious.             If, for example,      we look at the
tracks, say, of our common whelks (Littorince), we                    see  that those
formed in shallow shore-pools are flat            ;  those on very wet sand are
slightly hollow, their edges presenting a corrugated appearance;
while    those   made on fine sand         beginning      to dry,    are  marked at
regular intervals with distinct          transverse lines.       It   is not unusual
to observe all these crossing one another, or seeming to form loops
with   each other.        The waved whelk (Buccinum undatem) makes a
bisulcate    track  on   the  sand when it is partially dry. Occasionally,
however, it trails the sharp edge of its operculum in such a way                    as
to give three sulci.        Ichnologists    may thus have the track of only

354                      Proceedings         of the Royal Society
one form before them, when they describe                           three or four apparently
different ones, and trace them to different species.                                  Thus,      such
terms as unitulcus, biiulcus, trisulcus, unisulcus corrugatns, and the
like, instead of indicating so many distinct species, may, in reality,
express the varying form of the track of one only.                                 Perhaps, even
the Hitchcocks'           in their magnificent works on ichuology have not
given due weight to this consideration.*
     The   slabs laid on the table have been examined with great care,
in the hope of detecting traces of hairs,                        setae,   or any other charac
teristic marks of true recent annelids.                        But neither hairs nor bristles
have been found.              On most of the slabs, however, markings occur,
which      I   am inclined      to regard      as    the outlines of organs analogous
to the gill-leaves of such forms as Phyllodoce.                                These are worthy
the attention of naturalists.                They         are numerous, and have not,               I
think, been observed before.                 While occurring              on the same surface
as   the outlines and tracks of the organisms, only in one instance
they seem attached to them, but even in this case the association
is doubtful.        See       Plate   IV.   fig.    2, for an outline of some             of   these
markings.          In    one case, in which a good                 duplicate was obtained,
distinct traces         as   of a fringe appear.               An enlarged rough outline
of part of this fringe is shown on the Plate, IV. fig. 4. On the
same specimen a good many annulate pointed objects occur, two of
which are represented            at a and     b    fig.   2.
     There can be no doubt that both tube inhabiting and errant
Annelida existed in             palaeozoic         time — traces of some being found
even in the Laurentian             rocks    — though little is known of their                    true
nature and relations.            The genera          conchiolites,        comulites, serpulites,
spirorbis, and trachyderma,             may be said             to complete the        list of   the
former, and         the      genera arenicolites, crossopodia, myrianites,                       and
nereites that of the latter.           But     even some of these generic designa
tions are open            to criticism,      or cumbered            with       doubt, and it is
questionable       if,   in any of these cases, we have                   a   true representation
of the animal itself.            Such considerations add to the value of the
specimen now under notice. It has no resemblance to any of the
forms just named.  The first examples on record having some

Albany Hancock contributed an able paper to the Annals of Natural
History, entitled " Remarks on certain Vermiform Fossils found in
the Mountain Limestone Districts of the North of England."                                   §    This
paper is illustrated           by six well-executed              plates, the last                two of
which      (xviii. and xix.)        bear on the present            inquiry. The other
figures are undoubtedly                 mere    tracks,   and     Mr Hancock believes
them to be those of crustaceans, but the grounds for this belief are
far from clear or satisfactory.                 Eeferring      to a species        of Amphio-
poda — Sulcator arenarius — he                  says, — "While forming its track,
the animal is never seen            ;    it   moves along a      little below the surface
of the sand, which it pushes upwards with its back, and the arch
or tunnel thus formed partially subsides as the creature passes
forward, and breaking along the centre the median groove is pro
duced."          Now all that this observation                 shows      is,   that    a    median
groove     is    formed in the line of this crustacean's track,                              though
the probability            of the realisation        of   a   form like this in such                 a

the forms figured by          Mr Hancock occurs            on one     of the slabs      on
the table.
    At   a  meeting of the Dublin Geological Society in 1858, Professor
Haughton, the president, read             a paper
                                                     " On the Occurrence of         some
New and Itare Forms of Annelidoid Tracks in the Coal Measures,
Lugacurren, Queen's County."*                  A year later, and again in          1860,
he   returned to the subject, indicating his belief that the Lugacurren
tracks resembled         those   described by       Mr Hancock,        and   ultimately
accepting       his theory of their          crustacean      origin.     As Professor
Haugh ton's         papers   were     illustrated      by lithographic        plates    ad
naturam, they, like          Mr Hancock's,          are  available for comparison
with     the specimen before         us.     The Lugacurren          specimens differ
from the Northumberland             forms in having at one part four, in one
case, and      in another five circular        depressions in the median line.
They differ from that         on the table in having            circular depressions
confined to      a small part of the form, and a median groove, instead
of, as here, oval depressions running              the whole length of the body,
and a median ridge.            In neither the English nor the Irish               speci
mens is the characteristic striation so conspicuous as in this.                  These,
however,      seem all to be specimens          of closely related species. Both
Mr Hancock          and   Professor Haughton think that the depressions
in    the median groove          may have        been    made     by the pygidium
of a carboniferous trilobite,            the  print of    the   tail being the only
trace     the animal has left          of its having         had a place in          this
deposit     !   Now such marks        as   those on the Lugacurren           specimens
could only have been made by the pygidium being set down ver
tically, then lifted for       a  time, and so placed at regular intervals,
their being no evidence of dragging, — most unlikely,                       if  not im
possible conditions.          Fortunately,       a good      representation      of   the
form     figured by Professor Haughton                occurs   also on    these slabs.
From this it is evident that the characteristic circular punctures
run the whole length of the body.
    It  seems to me that the reference            to the track    of Sulcator    arena-
rius has been misleading.            It   can, indeed, have no bearing on any

                      of Edinburgh, Session 1876-77.                                  357
of  these     closely related forms, being unisulcus,              destitute of stria,
and not more than three-eighths of an inch wide, while all these are
striated and seven-eighths of an inch wide                ; that under notice being
moreover distinctly bisulcate.          It  is acknowledged that the relations
of this     to recent forms are obscure.               The features which chiefly
claim attention are —
   First, The outline of the animal. — A glance                       at the specimen
is sufficient to convince us that we have here not a track merely,
but the representation of an annulose form.                   (See  Plate    IV.  fig. 1.)
On one         of the   slabs   this   is associated         with several      inches of
the track over which it            has   passed.        The median dorsal line
is fully      exposed    above,   while     the median          ridge, which       makes
the   track      bisulcate, is precisely        what would         be   formed by the
ventral      groove of a      nereis — Alitta        virens (Sars), for example.
The     striae   which pass round the body leave                   no   traces   of their
outline      in this   track  ;   but in another,           from which        the   repre
sentation of the animal was removed,                 these striae are well marked.
Again,      on the bulged       sides   of the tortuous            outline, the      striae
are   wider than on the opposite side, while in the comparatively
straight     parts they are symmetrical.               So far as      I  know, similar
markings do not occur on any recent annelid.                      They     are, however,
represented, though not         so distinctly       as here, on a      small annelid —
Epitrachys rugosis — figured by Ehler of Erlangen in his paper                          on
the " Fossil Worms of the Lithographic States of Bavaria."*
   Second,      The tracks. — They differ widely            from the tracks both         of
mollusca and      Crustacea — those of the former being, for the               most part,
sharp in their turns, and those of the latter consist generally of
lines more or less straight, not tortuous. In addition, they have
two furrows divided by a distinct median ridge.                         I  am sure that
had the able observers          named      above      seen such specimens          of the
tracks, and also of the intaglios of the rounded dorsal surface                     as are
now on the table, they would not have questioned the true annulose
character of this organism.
    Third, The median dorsal line. — This                is exceedingly well repre
sented, not only on the outline of the animal itself, but also in one
of the intaglios referred          to.    It    consists of small, shallow, oval

depressions,    deepest   in the centre, and narrowing                at   each end,
where they meet a slight ridge which stretches between the                    depres
sions,  giving to the line, looked at      from     a short distance, a chain
like  appearance.    Were the branchial tufts of some recent annelids
plucked out, we would have        a  somewhat similar appearance.
    Fourth,   The characteristic      striation.   — This is most distinctly
and even sharply marked on the form in the gritstone slab.                       It  is
also, though less definitely, marked on some            of  the softer micaceous
slabs.    Mr Hancock     says, with reference to his specimen which has
most   resemblance    to this —
                                  " The transverse striae on the surface
of the grooved form certainly gives it much the appearance of some
organism ;" but the value of this acknowledgment is lost by the
supposition that the striae might have been
                                                          " produced by the in
termitting   progress of the animal."            Now it is simply         impossible
that such striation as is seen here could have been produced in this
manner.
   The    expression
                        " ondeleusement      et   symmetriquement,"          used   by
Cuvier in describing the striae on the shell of a cephalopode,                   very
well indicates a leading       feature of this striation.              Indeed,     the
symmetry of these beautifully regular undulating striae maybe best
understood by comparing them with the striae on the shells both of
recent and fossil nautilidie.       Fig  3  is intended for a representation,
ad naturam,    of the characteristic striation, but the         striae are sharper
and better defined than shown on the figure.
   In conclusion, it will    be seen that the distinctive           features of the
specimen now brought          under the notice of the Society                are  the
median dorsal line and the waved striation.             In   the generic features
set down at the     head    of this   paper,    I  have  described       the former
thus, — linea dorsualis continua, alternasque cavaturas                    ovatas et
vertices ortendens.        As, however, uncertainty              attaches to      the
nature of this line, the latter — the striation — may be taken as the
outstanding generic feature, — striae tenues, in ordinem undulatae,
et ubique corpus cingentes,        ita ut cutis subrugosa videatur.               The
term Ctmaderma, or wave-skin, is proposed              for a genus, whose true
zoological position is as yet uncertain.           Should the examination            of
other specimens    show that the oval depressions in the median dorsal
line are only specific marks, not points of insertion of organs,                  and
the striaa mere lines formed by the contraction            of  the cutis — a most

unlikely circumstance — the organism would have closer nemertean
than annelid relations. But, if proof be ultimately obtained that
the branchiee-like organs referred to above were connected with the
oval depressions, and that the transverse markings are really not
striae but annuli, the zoological position of the animal will be
among true annelids, characterised,             however,    by structural features
widely divergent from recent           forms.

     The assumption that there is a limit in Professor Tait's problem
regarding the interpretation of Limn =x(cosnx) means that if we
start with an angle x, and find the number which is its cosine, then
the number which is       the cosine of this number, and so on, we shall
at last come to a limiting result              id,  such that cos   w = t¦,.  The
problem is thus transformed into the solution of the equation
<,, = co8 td, which may be accomplished as follows : —

    The corresponding limit in the case of other functions may be
similarly interpreted; that is to say, the limit of t/i"(•**), if such be
possible, when n is indefinitely increased, is a root of the equation
tft(j:) = x.  We may view such limits as implying an infinitude of
operations ; and we have seen that when this infinitude of operations
is carried out upon any value          (within certain limits) of       the  inde
pendent variable, the result          is always the        same; in other words,
we have seen that those functions, in the case of which the                limit is
possible, are levelling functions, having              the  property of bringing
everything     they act on to the same dead level.                In this  respect
they may be compared           with Euler's expression

             8.     Sevenfold Knottiness.             By Prof. Tait.
                                     (Abstract.)
    From   the point of view of the Hypothesis of Vortex Atoms,                   it
becomes a question of great importance to find how many distinct
forms there are of knots with a given amount of knottiness.                   The
enormous numbers of lines in the spectra                  of certain elementary
substances    show that the form of the corresponding Vortex Atoms
cannot be regarded         as very simple.     But this  is no objection against,
 it is rather an argument in favour of the truth of, the Hypothesis.

364                           Proceedings               of the Royal Society
For not only             are the great majority of possible knots not stable forms
for vortices         ;    but altogether independently of the question                                of kinetic
stability, the number of distinct forms with each degree of knotti-
ness is exceedingly small, — very much smaller than                                          I was prepared
to find it.       I      have already stated that for three, four, five, and sixfold
knottiness, the numbers are only                                  1, 1, 2, 4.        For    a reason given
in my first paper, knots whose number of crossings is a multiple of                                             6
form an exceptional class                      :   so    I   thought it might be useful                   to dis
cover and to figure                  all   the distinct forms with seven-fold knottiness.
Eight       and          higher numbers are not likely to                             be     attacked      by      a
rigorous process until the methods are immensely simplified.                                                 The
method         of partitions, supplemented by the graphic formulae of my
last paper, is to some extent tentative.                                  I   have verified the present
results by means of                     it,   and have extended                it   to 8-fold       knottiness,
but  I    am not certain that                  I     have got           all   the possible forms of the
latter.
     AsI       did not         see    how to abridge the process,                   I      wrote out all the
admissible permutations of the seven letters in the even places                                                 of
the scheme.               These  I      found to be 579, five of which were, of                          course,
unique.          The others (as                7   isprime number) were divisible
                                                        a                                                    into
82    groups — those of                    each group being mutually equivalent.                              On
examination,              it   was found that only 22 of the 87 selected arrange
ments satisfied the criterion for possible knots (see                                I     §(6) of my paper,
ante      p.   238), and             several       even      of   these were         repetitious.         These
repetitions were of two                     kinds — 1st,          the mere inversion             of   the order
of the scheme             ;   2d, the relative positions of                   a   3-fold and    a   4-fold knot
which in certain cases wero found                                   combined          as    a    7-fold form.
Clearing off these repetitions, and along with them                                          a    form really
belonging to 6-fold knots (because consisting of two trefoil knots
and one nugatory intersection), there remain only eleven distinct
forms of the 7th order.                        These are           as   follows :—
     This      has       a    great        many forms, with correspondingly                            different

                  of Edinburgh,
symbols, being a mere compound of
which may have any relative positions

     Sir WILLIAM THOMSON,                 President, in the Chair.
   The following Communications            were read      : —
   1. Professor    Geikie exhibited a large Map showing the
          progress of the Geological Survey of Scotland.
  2. Notice of a Saline Water from the Volcanic Eocks of
             Linlithgow.     By Professor Geikie, F.R.S.
   From    a boring which has recently been made about a mile west
from the town of Linlithgow, water has been obtained differing              so
much in character from that of the usual wells and springs of              the
district   that some notice of it deserves     to   be   placed on record.
When the fact was communicated to me          I was    asked to explain by
what   means sea-water could obtain access to underground rocks in
an inland district.    On visiting the ground    I   found the site of the
bore to be among some         hollows of the gravel and sand which
cover    the country   between   Falkirk   and Linlithgow,         its height
being about     165  feet above the sea, from which it was distant
about three miles.     The ordinary wells of the district       are situated
in the superficial deposits,  and supply good potable water, though
the supply is necessarily limited. A more copious flow being desired
the bore was sunk through the sands, gravels, and clays (here
rather more than 100 feet thick), and then entered upon a succes
                                          " whinstone."       After
sion of green, brown, blue, and red                                   a depth
of 317 feet had been passed through, consisting entirely of these
alternations of "whinstone," a sample of the tolerably copious
supply of water which had now appeared was drawn up and sent
for analysis to Dr Stevenson Macadam, whose results were as
follow : —

    This large admixture of saline ingredients rendered             the boring
 unavailable for the increase of the water-supply;             but the boring-
 rods   were driven    30 feet further     in the hope that possibly this
 mineral      water might    find   some    other subterranean means of
 escape.     The  hope was of course disappointed, and the operation      ter
 minated at a depth of 451 feet from the surface, the lower 348 feet
 of the boring having been found to pass wholly through " whin-
         " in numerous
 stone                   bands of varying hardness and colour.           Two
 samples of the water, taken when the ultimate                depth had been
 reached,    were submitted for analysis to different chemists, and gave
 nearly similar results.      The proportions of salts obtained by Mr
 Robert M'Alley, Falkirk, were the following          : —

    One character of the water not noticed in the analyses, but dis
tinctly perceptible to    me in a freshly drawn sample, was the odour
of sulphuretted hydrogen.         I  may add that the bore was begun
from the bottom of a previously made well 18 feet from the sur
face, and that    I found  the water flowing out abundantly from the
top   of  the bore-tube into the well from which          it  was temporarily
pumped away.
   It  was evident that the idea of any subterranean communication

                      of Edinburgh,     Session 1876-77.                     309
with the        sea was    quite inadmissible.        In the first    place,  the
locality is three miles from the nearest part of the sea-coast, with
a lidgeof high ground intervening. In the second place, between it
and     the sea-margin    lie the numerous     deep pits of the Borrowstoun-
ness     and   Kinneil coal-fields, which, it may      be supposed,   must pre
vent     at least any superficial water-communication.         And in the third
place, the proportions of the various salts contained in the water
are quite different from       those which would have resulted         from the
mere access of ordinary sea-water.            The salts can only have been
derived from the subterranean rocks traversed by the water.
     An acquaintance with the geology of the district enables me to
 recognise the various kinds of "whinstone" found in the bore.
They      are successive beds of the    dull  green and brown, usually more
or less     decomposed,   dolerites (diabases) forming the long volcanic
 range between        Bathgate and the sea, and which were poured out
 partly    as  submarine and partly as subaerial lavas during the de
 position of the Carboniferous Limestone, or Lower                Coal series of
 Linlithgowshire.       Occasional bands of green and red tuff mark in
 tervals between the lava-flows.         Since the water from the superfi
 cial gravels was of the usual      potable quality there can be no doubt
 that the saline impregnation        comes from the underlying rocks.
     So far    as  I am aware, the first detection       of soda as a chemical
 constituent      of rocks was made      by Dr Robert Kennedy, and           an
 nounced       to this  Society as far back as December 1798.                 He
 analysed the specimens of whinstone employed by Sir James Hall
 in his classical experiments upon the fusibility of whinstone and
 lava, and found the constant presence of soda to the extent of four
 or five per cent., with one per cent, of muriatic          acid.   He further
 examined pieces of sandstone from the neighbourhood of Edinburgh
 and elsewhere, with the invariable result of detecting an appreciable
 quantity of common salt in them.               Since the early date of his
 researches chloride of sodium has been found very widely diffused
  among the minerals and rocks of the earth's crust.
     There seems to     be   three chief sources     from which rocks derive
  their chloride of sodium: — 1. Bain; 2. The evaporated water of old
  salt lakes and inland seas; 3. Volcanic sublimations.

  370                  Proceedings     of the Royal Society
  sition of rain in different parts of the country have shown the very
  general prevalence of chlorides, and particularly of chloride of
 sodium, in the air.           As might      be expected,     the proportion of
 chlorides is greatest nearest to the sea, though abnormally                 large
 quantities      are found    in the air of manufacturing          towns as the
 result of the combustion of coal, &c.           On the west side of Britain
 the proportion of hydrochloric acid in rain was found sometimes to
 amount to nearly four grains per gallon, or 56 parts in a million.
 On the east side of Scotland the proportion sinks to -9 grain per
 gallon, or 12 parts in the million.          There can be little doubt that
 most of this is chloride       of sodium.     Dr Smith    has pointed    out the
 curious fact that this salt cannot be conveyed into the atmosphere
 merely in spray driven from the surface of the sea by high winds,
 for   if that  were the case the composition         of the rain should         be
 approximately like that of sea-water.            But the saline ingredients
 do not occur at all in similar proportions.           It  seems reasonable to
 suppose that the superficial parts of rocks liable to be saturated with
 rain-water must thereby receive an appreciable amount of chloride
of sodium.        In this   case  it is evident that much care should            be
 exercised in procuring          for analysis    portions    of rock   which    lie
beyond the reach of this surface saturation.              Possibly in    some of
the instances cited by Kennedy, in the paper already referred                   to,
the common salt may have been introduced by the action of rain.
    2. The    Deposit   of Salts  on the Floor of Old   Lakes and    Inland  Seas.
— This      mode of origin is doubtless by much           the most important
source     of the chloride of sodium in      rocks.   When      we consider the
large proportion of marine strata in the stratified part of the earth's
crust it is surprising,        as   De la Beche remarked long ago,* that
saline waters       are  not more abundant than they really are.                Dr
Sterry Hunt has pointed to the mineral waters of Canada and                    the
North-Eastern         States as probably deriving        their   salts from    the
original sea-water of paleozoic           times still imprisoned within        the
pores of the rocks.      f I    need not refer to the abundant deposits of
rock-salt      and   gypsum,     as   well as of saliferous and       gypsiferous
clays, which occur in so many districts of the world.

                    of Edinburgh, Session 1876-77.                          371
stalactites of common salt upon the walls and slopes of a volcanic
crater after eruption,    and    the appearance     of the same substance
upon the surface or within the chinks of recently-consolidated lava
streams, have long been observed.            On Vesuvius vast quantities of
salt have   been gathered      again  and   again, and have been used by
the inhabitants    at the foot of the mountain.         Among the Icelandic
volcanoes the same fact has occurred.            But   besides   this  outward
and conspicuous manifestation, chemical analysis has revealed the
presence of chloride       of sodium in many volcanic             rocks, either
diffused through their crystalline matrix or entangled within their
individual constituent minerals.            In such volcanic minerals         as
Hauyne, Nosean       and Sodalite     it has been found       to be noticeably
present.    It  has been      extracted even by pure water from clink
stones, basalts, and from various plutonic rocks.
   There   can be  little doubt that it is to this volcanic origin that
the large admixture of salt in the Linlithgow water is to be traced.
The bore may        have   reached a stratum of ancient lava or tuff,
originally   permeated    or incrusted with salt, which may have been
dissolved by percolating water, and yet have remained in solution
below for want of any ready means              by which      the water could
escape to the surface.       This  escape is now provided by the bore, and
the water is consequently now removing the salt from the rock.
   It may be mentioned that some of the best known saline waters
of Scotland rise from volcanic rocks. At the Bridge of Allan, water
containing 95 grains of chloride of sodium in the gallon takes its
rise from near the top of the enormous mass of lavas                  and tuffs
erupted during the Lower Old Red Sandstone period, and forming
now the chain of the Ochil Hills.           At Pitcaithley, Bridge of Earn,
water containing 114 grains of the same salt in the gallon rises
from the same volcanic band, while at Dunblane, water                  with 48
grains of common salt in the gallon comes through the lower parts
of the red sandstones of that district,         which    lie upon    the  same
great volcanic series.      In most of    these cases the rise of the saline
water appears to have been determined by an accident, such as the
sinking of a bore for water, or, as at Bridge of Allan, during the
search for minerals.

                                    (Abstract.)
    Fait. EnpiiROSTNics. — In Euphrosyne foliosa, Aud.             and Ed., the
 separate    nerve-cords are comparatively large, and lie quite within
 the body-wall,      the oblique muscles,       which   generally     bound      the
longitudinal ventral muscles, decussating beneath them.
    Ampninomid.b. — The cords are somewhat small and flattened
 in Chloeia, and occupy an area bounded internally by                    a   trans
 verse band of fibres, and externally by the circular muscular layer
and     the   hypodermic       basement-tissue.       The     oblique     muscles
are attached     at the outer border of each trunk.
    Apuhoditid/E.    — The nerve-cords in Aphrodita          aculeata,   L., occur
in a transversely elongated space between            the ventral attachments
of the oblique muscles, and bounded externally by the hypodermic
basement-tissue and the cuticle.           In Hermione hystrix,     Sav., again,
they lie — as distinct       trunks — in a well-defined       hypodermic       area
within    the dense cuticle,      and   separated   by an interval      from     the
attachment of the oblique muscle on each side.
    PoLYNOiDiE.   — In Lepidonotus       squamatua,    L., the cords     occupy    a
hypodermic area between the ventral longitudinal                muscles.       The
oblique muscles       pierce the vertical at the upper and outer angle            of
the   space, and are attached         to the hypodermic        basement-tissue,
external and superior to the cords.          A belt of hypoderm intervenes
between     the latter and the cuticle.       In Polynoe scolopendrina, Sav.,
the interval between       the ventral attachments of the oblique muscles
is less, and the cords      are bounded superiorly by a special longitu
dinal muscle.
    Actktid.e. — In Panthalis (Erstedi, Kbg., the trunks are              situated
in the hypodermic region between the ventral longitudinal                muscles,
a   thin layer of      the former tissue occurring         between     them     and
the cuticle.       The great oblique muscles            pass    down      to their
upper and     outer border.      The space between        the ventral longitu
dinal muscles is less than in the Polynoidte.
;   Siqalionidjs. — The       space between       the ventral longitudinal
muscles    anteriorly in Sthtncluis boa, Johnst., is still more narrowed

                       of Edinburgh, Session 1876-77.                            373
than in Panthalis,         and the hypodermic area for the nerve is thus
increased in depth.          Superiorly the arch is completely covered by
the insertions of the vertical and oblique muscles              ;  and it is inte
resting that the latter do not pierce the former (which occupy the
 middle line), but are attached to the basement tissue below them,
on each side of the nerve-area.              The   cords are almond-shaped          in
 transverse section, whereas in S. Mathildas, Aud. and Ed., they are
round, and the hypodermic               area enclosing    them is much more
expanded inferiorly.
     Nephthydid-s. — In Nephthys           cceca, Fabr., the combined oblique
and     vertical    are   attached    along the entire arch of basement-
tissue, above        the nerve-area.        A broad hypodermic belt exists
above the nerve trunks, and a narrower between                     them and the
cuticle.
     Pnyi/LODOCin^.     — The nerves in Phyllodocc         grcenlandica,      (Erst.,
are      situated     within    the   circular    muscular    coat,    and     above
the insertions        of the oblique      muscles (which decussate in the
 middle line), as well as such fibres of the vertical muscles as are
inserted      into the basement-tissue of the ventral hypoderm.                    In
Eteone picta, De Quatref., and Eulalia viridis, 0.             F. Miiller. certain
fibres of the oblique pass at intervals right over the cords,              so as to
form      a continuous     band from side to side, and in the former an
interval     between    the oblique muscles is indicated.
     In  Alciope the cords also lie within the circular muscular layer —
 in the interval between the longitudinal ventral.               The oblique pass
 below the cords, but do not appear to meet in the middle line-                  The
 sole   specimen, however,        is indifferently preserved      for microscopic
 work.
     Hesionid^. — The trunks in Ophiodromus                vittatus,   Sars.,   have
 in the anterior        region    passed    below the ventral attachment of
 the oblique      muscles     to the basement-tissue.        A thin stratum of
 longitudinal     fibres occurs superiorly, while externally is a thickened
 hypoderm.        The    nerves seem to be proportionally        large.
     Stllida. — In Syllis armillaris, 0. F. Miiller, the nerve-cords
  are also comparatively large.          A considerable depth of the closely
  approximated        ventral    longitudinal      muscles   shuts    them      from
  the very    thin hypodermic elements within the thickened cuticle,
  except    in the intervals between the ganglia, where there is a

374                Proceedings      of the Royal      Society
slender pedicle.      The oblique muscles bend below the cords to be
attached to the raphe in the same intervals.                  Fibres from the
walls of the alimentary canal also descend to the raphe on each
side of the trunks.
   Nereids. — In      Nereis   pelagica,  L., the nerve-cords lie rather
above the attachments        of the oblique muscles to the hypodermic
basement-tissue, the area being continued to the hypoderm by a
central pedicle. Nereis (Alitta) virens, Sars., an epitocous form,
likewise has the oblique muscles attached on each                   side   of the
pedicle of     the nerve-area,     while   the vertical      are inserted      in   a
chitinous arch at the upper and lateral regions.              Two well-marked
longitudinal     muscles    lie over   the cords.      Several neural       canals
exist, — viz., two large infero-lateral,     a single superior median, and
a  smaller, a little below the latter, on each side.          In Nereis diversi-
color,  0. F. Miiller,    each  cord has a neural canal of considerable
size towards its inferior border.
    Stacrocephalid^. — The          cords   are    large    in   Staurocephalw
rubrovittatns,    Grube, and occur in the somewhat wide interval
between the ventral       attachments of the oblique muscles.              Exter
nally are the basement-tissue, hypoderm, and cuticle.
    Lumbrinereid^e.    — In    a   Lumbriconereis      from     Herm,    a   large
neural canal exists above the cords, which are carried inward by
the approximation       of the great longitudinal ventral muscles. The
oblique meet      over   the neural canal.        Externally      are basement-
tissue,   hypoderm, and cuticle.         The    nerves    are   pressed   further
inward in Notocirrus tricolor, Johnst., the oblique muscles being
attached     to the summit     of the nerve-area (laterally),        outside the
fibres   forming   the special chamber for the vessel.              Some fibres
pass down each side, and cross below the nerve-area.
    The neural canal in the posterior third of Lysidice ninetta, Aud.
and Ed., is situated toward the ventral border of the ganglia, but
between     the cords in the intervals.          The oblique muscles pass
below the cords.       The latter takes place likewise in Palolo viridis,
Gray.
   Eonicid^;. — The cords in Marphysa             sanguinea,     Mont.,   lie   be
tween     the greatly developed       longitudinal     ventral    muscles,      and
present    the aspect of a margin to the large median neural canal.
The fibres of the oblique muscles are attached to the upper and

                      of Edinburgh, Session 1876-77.                             375
outer border of the region, — a few fibres                 passing downward        to
curve outward at the circular          coat of the body-wall.          Externally,
between the latter coat (and a layer of somewhat isolated longitu
dinal fibres within it), are the hypoderm and cuticle. In Eunice
norvegica, L., a similar arrangement occurs                  in the anterior third,
and a large median neural canal lies below the cords.                   The strong
oblique     muscles    pass    down to the ventral           hypoderm.      Distinct
muscular      bands also enclose       the ventral blood-vessel and nerve
trunk in     a tunnel.      A little behind    the   middle of Eunice Harassii,
Aud.     and Ed., the cords present the same external coverings, only,
from the great size of the oblique               and vertical muscles, they are
somewhat supported by the latter inferiorly.                    The same arrange
ment occurs in        a large male Eunice from the
                                                               " Porcupine."     The
constancy of the muscular tunnel for the nerve-cords and ventral
blood-vessel is interesting.
     Oncphidid^. — The oblique             muscles      in     both   Nothria    con-
chylega,     Sars.,   and    Hyalincecia     tubicola,   O.   F. Miiller,   are well
 developed, and not only meet,              but slightly cross, in the middle
 line.    The nerve-cords lie in         the   angle of decussation superiorly,
 and have      a single neural       canal of considerable size towards the
 lower border.         Besides the oblique         are   externally    the   circular
 muscular coat (which, in H. tubicola, is specially developed                  in the
 median line),      a narrow band of hypoderm, and the dense cuticle.
     GoNiADiDiE. — In       the    anterior    region     of    Goniada    metadata,
 CErst., the powerful oblique muscles sweep from below the bristle-
 bundles     on   each    side,  with   a   slight   inclination    downward      and
  inward,    and meet for insertion          on each    side of the hypodermic
  wedge above the nerves.           The latter occupy a somewhat triangular
  area of the hypoderm, and each has               a   small neural canal toward
  the   upper    and narrow part.           In Eone Nordmanni,           Mgrn.,   the
  nerves are proportionally smaller, and the hypodermic area less.
      Gi.yceridjb. — The cords at the anterior third of Qlyccra
   capituta, (Erst., are large, and occur in a hypodermic region, wedged
   between    the great longitudinal         ventral muscles, which         touch in
   the middle line, so as to form an arch over the nerves.                The great
   external circular muscular layer ceases before reaching the nerve-
   area, so that externally      the latter has only the hypoderm and the
   specially thickened cuticle.        The oblique muscles         are very  slightly

developed     in this species,      and their terminations        over the cords
can only be seen occasionally.            Each cord has a neural           canal  at
its upper third, near the middle line.           Glycera Gtesi, Mgrn.,        shows
nearly the same arrangements;              while  G. setosa, (Erst., exhibits
more evident separation         of the cords.   The insertions of       the oblique
muscles over the nerve-area are best seen in G. alba, Bathke, a
large species, in which the cords are proportionally              less.
    Ariciidje. — In the anterior region of Aricia latreiUii, Aud.
and Ed., the cords are situated at the upper part of a somewhat
triangular hypodermic          area, bounded laterally      by that part of the
 circular coat clasping the ventral longitudinal muscles.                  Powerful
oblique muscles meet for insertion            over each cord.        In   the same
 region of Scolopos armiger, O.        F. Miiller, the cords also lie       beneath
 the point of union of the greatly developed and nearly horizontal
 oblique muscles,      and supported laterally by the massive edges of
 the ventral longitudinal.          A single neural canal exists superiorly.
 Between the cords and the hypoderm is the thick circular muscular
 coat.   In   the middle     of the body the nerves      are thrust upward by
 the great ventral muscles, which are only separated                by the narrow
 pedicle of the area.
    Opheliid>e. — Throughout          the   greater    part    of   Ammotrypane
 aulogaster,   H. R.,   a peculiar    modification of the body-wall            exists,
 in the form of      a constriction between the dorsal and ventral longi
 tudinal   muscles.      The intermediate pedicle is formed              apparently
 by the metamorphosed vertical muscles,           which have coalesced over
 the nerve cords.       The oblique muscles      pass from the outer edge of
 the ventral     longitudinal    to the middle     line below the nerve-area.
 A small and indistinct neural canal appears toward the upper part
 of the latter.     In Ophelia limacina, H. R., the cords in the smoothly
 rounded anterior        third   lie in the middle of the           long     interval
 between     the   ventral longitudinal muscles.          The oblique         are in
 serted   far outside the cords.         Externally    are   a  granular area,       a
 series  of transverse fibres, and the cuticle.           Toward the posterior
 part of the body, where the ventral ridges are well-developed,                    the
 cords,  by an intricate change in the relationships of the muscles,
 get above     the median (ventral) insertion of the vertical, the fibres
 of which extend outward and somewhat downward into each pedicle.
 The true oblique is with difficulty seen ; but it appears to be a

slender muscle passing from the outer border of the ventral longi
tudinal. In many sections a neural canal is seen somewhat above
the middle of the area. A muscle passes from the bristle-tuft up
ward in a slanting direction through each pedicle to the raphe be
low the nerve. In Truviaia Forbeaii, Johnst., the nerve-trunks are
situated       between,    and   somewhat above,       the insertions     of   the
oblique      muscle.      Externally   are the circular     coat, a translucent
basement-tissue,        a granular hypoderm, and a very thin cuticle.
      Scalibreqmid*. — In Eumenia Jeffreysii the cords in the anterior
 region occur toward the inner aspect of the thick layer of trans
 lucent basement-tissue, below          and   between    the insertions of the
 two long oblique muscles.            Toward the middle of the body the
 trunks still indent the basement-tissue, the circular muscular coat
 forming their inner boundary.           A   series of strong transverse    fibres
 occurs at intervals as an arch        over the cords.       In Scalibregma     in-
flatum, H. R., the cords (in the posterior region) lie below the cir
 cular muscular fibres, which occur beneath the commissure of the
  oblique in the middle line.           Externally     are the hypoderm and
 cuticle.
      TELBmuai. — In the anterior third of Arenicola marina, L.,               the
  cords form     a  comparatively small ovoid mass — clasped         by the great
  longitudinal      muscles,  and   connected    with the circular coat by        a
  narrow granular pedicle.
      Spu^erodoeid^. — While there is a very thick cuticle in Ephcsia
  gracilia,   H. R., the hypoderm is slightly developed below the
  nerves.     The oblique muscles pass from the inferior border of the
  bristle-tufts    to the outer margin of the nerve-trunks.
      Cvclohexlive..   — In Trophonia     plumosa,   0. F. Miiller, the nerves
  lie above the median decussation of the oblique muscles, the cords
  being distinct in the intervals between           the ganglia.      Externally
  are    also the circular     coat,  a narrow     hypoderm      and   a roughly
  papillose cuticle.*
      Ch^toptekid^;.     — In  Ghcetopterus norvegicua,     Sars., the cords   are
  placed wide apart in front, in consonance                with   the peculiarly
   modified muscular arrangements of the body- wall.             They are hypo

the homologues of the ventral longitudinal                are pushed   outward.
The oblique     preserve   their usual relations with the latter and the
nerve-cords, over which their ventral termination occurs.              Another
muscle,    probably the homologue of the transverse, passes from the
termination of the oblique inward to the middle line on each side.
As the late M. Claparede has shown, the cords approach each                 other
in the posterior region in Chwtopterus, while in Telepsazus             they re
main separate throughout.*
   SriONiDJi.  — As pointed out last      session,  f the cords  in this family
are hypodermic in position.         Their relation to the ventral inser
tions of the oblique muscles are also well shown, since they follow
the   latter in their gradual      progress    inward from the sides      of the
body in front until the cords touch and the muscles meet                     over
them. The neural canals are largely developed.
   Cieratdlidj;. — In Cirvatulus       cirvatus,   O. F. Miiller,  the cords   in
the anterior region lie in the median line ventrally within a              thick
hypodermic area. The oblique muscles are inserted at the summit
of the area, and the sides of the ventral longitudinal muscles over
lap its upper arch.      The circular muscular        coat is continuous     over
(internal to) the cords.       In Dodecaceria concharum, (Erst., a thick
median mass of blackish hypoderm protects the cords, and the
relations    of the oblique      and   longitudinal      ventral   muscles    are
similar.
   Halelmintuidjj. — Thisfamilyapproaches              the Lumbricidae in   hav
ing the nerve-cords placed within the great and nearly continuous
longitudinal muscles of the body-wall.            Externally (in the ventral
region of Capitella capitata, Fabr.) are in addition a dense circular
muscular coat, a thin layer of longitudinal fibres, basement-tissue,
 hypoderm, and cuticle.        Anteriorly there are two divisions of the
ventral longitudinal      muscular fibres under the nerves, but in the
 middle region of the body they have coalesced into a single mass.
 A neural canal occurs superiorly in the ovoid nervous area. Two
 vertical muscles bound those above which the nerves lie, but the
 oblique are not recognisable.

area.        A similar arrangement            occurs    in Nicomache      lumbricalis,
Fubr., and in         a large Canadian species of the same genus.
     Asimociiaeid^e. —About a quarter of an inch behind the snout
the nerve-area in           Owenia   filiformis,    D. Ch., forms an ovoid mass
outside the tough basement-tissue bounding the great longitudinal
muscular layer. The area is entirely hypodermic, and as very little
of this       tissue    remains in     the   majority     of the preparations, the
cords      are often bare.      The oblique muscles are not visible, and the
longitudinal         are only separated        in the median line dorsally and
 ventrally.
     Hermellice. — In Sabellaria spinulosa, R. Leuckart,                      the cords
 remain quite separate throughout their entire length.                      Anteriorly
 each is placed in the substance              of the great ventral muscle, near
 its upper and inner border.              No distinct oblique     muscles     appear in
 this form. Posteriorly the           nerves occupy the same relative position
 in the diminished          muscles,   and each has a large neural canal at its
 inner border.
      Amphictenid2E. — In         Cystenidcs      hgperborea,    Mgrn.,    the   united
  cords in the anterior region occur             as an ovoid  mass over      the  trans
  verse muscular fibres in the ventral median line.                The large oblique
  muscles are widely separated from the nerve-! ranks.
      AmpharbtiDzE. — In Amphicteis Gunneri, from Canada, the nerves
  (in   transverse     section  of the body-wall) appear        as two   minute sepa
  rate bodies enveloped in a common                neurilemma lying in the thick
  hypoderm of the median ventral region.                   Internally   are the fibres
  of the circular coat and the insertions of the oblique and vertical
   muscles.
      Terebellid^. — Anteriorly in           Terebella nebulota, Mont., the nerve-
   cords are placed outside the transverse band of fibres                (part of the
   circular coat) between the oblique muscles, and therefore are hypo
   dermic. The same arrangement occurs posteriorly. In Polycirrus
   akrantiacus, Gr., the cords           have    the same relative position, only
   they are considerably         larger   — a   feature   of interest in connection
    with   the phosphorescent properties of the species.                   Within the
    circular coat is      a  small median longitudinal         muscle.      In Tcrebel

380               Proceedings of       the  Royal Society
tides straemi, Sars., the cords are small, and lie      within the hypoderm
and strong circular coat in a line between           the ventral longitudinal
muscles.     The slender oblique are attached on each               side of     the
trunks, and must be carefully distinguished from the much larger
muscles     which cut off the great lateral longitudinal                 muscle
externally.
    Sabellid.e.  — In  Sabella pavonina, Sav., the nerves        occur in front
as widely separated cords — each situated at the inner border of the
ventral longitudinal muscle.        A large neural canal lies above each.
Externally are the circular muscular coat, the greatly thickened
hypoderm and the cuticle.         The feeble oblique muscles are partly
inserted above the neural canal and             partly    into the basement-
layer below and internal to the nerve.             Proceeding    backward, the
neural canal increases very much in size, so that it occupies the
whole area on each side of the central region, and presses the ovoid
nerve-cord to the exterior.        The canals     appear to be filled    with      a
slightly yellowish substance     — consolidated in the preparations. The
same relative position is maintained posteriorly, though the neural
canal is smaller, and,     as in front, placed superiorly.        The arrange
ment in Dasychone bombyx, Dalyell, agrees in most respects                   with
 the foregoing.
    Chone   and Euclwne seem to approach             the next    family in     the
 arrangement of the nerve-cords and in the remarkable structure of
 the great longitudinal       muscles.     In  Chone infundibulum,       Mont.,
 the nerve-trunks occur between          the ventral longitudinal      muscles,
 and placed much more closely together than in Sabella.                 A   large
 neural canal     lies over each     nerve.      Externally     are the   strong
 circular coat, the thick     hypoderm, and        the cuticle.    The  oblique
 muscles are attached to the sides         of the median vessel above         the
 neural canals, and to the summit of the latter on each side.             While
 the cords are lost in the ganglia, the neural canals remain distinct.
 In  Euchone    a  similar condition exists, for though the cords              are
 distinct anteriorly they are closely approximated posteriorly.
    Eriograpiiididj!.' — In the anterior third of Myxicola infundi
 bulum, Renier, the cords are approximated in the interval between
 the   great longitudinal     ventral     muscles,    and   beneath the     large
 blood- vessel.    A neural   canal appears to exist toward        the superior
 border.    The slender oblique muscles are inserted into the summit

of the     nerve-area.       Externally       are circular    coat,   hypoderm, and
cuticle.    Posteriorly the cords are connate, and a single neural
canal of considerable size exists superiorly.
    Skrpulid^;. — In Protula protensa the cords anteriorly are situated
under the great longitudinal dorsal muscles as widely separated
trunks. They then fall into position and approach the increasing
 longitudinal ventral muscles — a large neural canal being at the
 inner border. Posteriorly the neural canal is proportionally larger
 than in front, but the relations of the nerves are similar. At their
 commencement          in front the         nerve-cords are internal,      and have
 beneath them all           the   tissues    under the dorsal muscles.              After
 reaching the inner border of the ventral longitudinal                  muscles they
 have externally (i.e., inferiorly) a thin layer of longitudinal mus
 cular fibres, the circular coat, hypoderm, and cuticle. A transverse
 band bounds them superiorly.                   Posteriorly     the first-mentioned
 (longitudinal) layer is absent externally.                 In Serpula vermicularis,
 L.,   a similar arrangement occurs, but the neural canal is external,
 that    is,   next the ventral longitudinal            muscle, and the thin longi
 tudinal stratum       is   internal.

       mination of the Efficiency of Machinery.                        By Professor
       Fleeming Jenkin.
                                         (Abstract.)
       The general    of the paper was to show how by graphic
                       scope
  methods we might find the relation between effort exerted at one
  part of  machine and the resistance overcome at another part.
               a
  It   was shown that for          a    given machine at any instant            a   linear
  frame might be substituted, such that the stresses                     in the links
  corresponded to the pressures at the joints between the elements
  of the machine, including the pressures due to driving effort and
  resistance.        Numerous       examples were given of the application
  of this frame, called the dynamic                    frame, to the solution       of the
   above problem, the friction,             inertia, and weight of all the parts
   being taken rigidly into account.

     5. On Professor Tait's Problem of Arrangement.                       By
                          Thomas Muir, M.A.
    The problem in question         is — To find the       number of possible
arrangements of a set of n things, subject to the conditions that
the first is not to be in the last or first place, the second not in the
first or second   place, the third      not in the second or third place,
and so on.
    A little consideration    serves    to show that we may         with advan
tage shift the ground of the problem to the theory of determinants.
For the sake of definiteness take the case of five things, A, B, C,
D, E. Here A may be in the second, third, or fourth places only ;
B in the third, fourth, or fifth places only; and similarly of the
others — a result which we may tabulate thus :—
                            .AAA.

 an   A being written in      the places which         it is possible for A      to
 occupy, and a dot signifying that the letter found in the                 same
 line with    it may   not occupy its place.             Hence,   to obtain    the
 various arrangements, we see that for the first place we may               have
 any letter that is in the first column         ;    for the second place     any
 letter that is in the second column, provided it            be not in the  same
 line with the letter taken from the first column               ;  for the third
 place, any letter that is in the third column,            provided it be not    in
 the same    line with either of the letters previously taken, and               so
 on.    This law of formation, however,             is identical   with that     in
 accordance with which the terms of a determinant are got                    from
 the elements of the     matrix;     so that the problem we are concerned
 with is transformed into this        :   Find the number of terms of           the
 determinant of the nth order of the         form, —

   If   a cord be knotted, any             number of times, according to the
pattern below
it is obviously perverted by simple inversion.                  Hence, when the
free ends are joined it is an amphicheiral knot.
                                                                Its simplest form
is that of 4-fold knottiness.            All its forms have knottiness expres
sible as 4n.

392                       Proceedings      of the Royal Society
  The following             pattern gives amphicheiral             knots of      knottiness
2 + 6n.
   And     on the following         pattern may be formed amphicheiral                    knots
of all    the orders       included in 6n and 4 + 6n.
   Among them these forms contain all the even numbers,                               so that
there is at least one amphicheiral            form of every        even order.
   Many         more      complex   forms are given in the paper,                 several     of
which are closely connected with knitting, &c.
   In     one      of my former      papers    I    gave    examples of type-syrnM
which individually represent two perfectly different knots.
   I     now       give examples of the same               knot represented         by    type-
symbols which have neither right nor left-handed                           parts     in    com
mon.       One of the most remarkable of these is
which can be analysed (but not separated) into a combination                                  of
the two forms of the 4-fold amphicheiral knot.

    In this chapter Professor Heddle submitted               the results of the
analyses of Orthoclase from fifteen localities         ; of Albite from four    ;
of Oligoclase from eight ; of Labradorite from eleven ; of Andesiel
from five ; of Anorthite from three ; and of Latrobite from two.
   The three last minerals being now, for the first time, recognised
as   British   species.
   Dr Heddle        also   described a peculiar association of Orthoclase
 with Oligoclase, in crystals nearly of the form of the former, from
certain    localities   ; he drew the conclusion from his researches       that
the above felspars are all well individualised,           if   not by physical,
at least by chemical characters         ;  while they are probably more or
less special to certain rocks.

                 2.   On Ocean Circulation.                     By John Aitken.
      It   is with extreme reluctance that                  I   venture to disturb the pre
 sent repose of the much-contested field of ocean                              circulation.            My
 object is not, however, to provoke discussion on the general theory
 of ocean circulation,            as    I    am sure all        will   agree in      thinking that
 the subject has           already been discussed                 far beyond the point                      at
 which it is likely to              be       benefited    by discussion.             My object              is
 simply to call attention to certain influences at work in the ocean,
 the effects of which seem to have been totally overlooked.
      The first of them          to which       I   wish to refer is the influence of the
 winds on the ocean. The extreme holders of the wind theory of ocean
circulation consider that the action of the wind is quite sufficient                                    to
account for all the currents which we find in the ocean.                                   That the
wind        is   a cause        of ocean       currents no one can doubt.                        If    we
examine a lake when the wind is blowing                                over    it,   we shall find
that the plants growing in the shallow water near the surface                                         are
all bending in the direction of the wind, indicatingthat there                                        is
                                                                                                      a
current at the surface flowing in the direction of the wind, — the
appearance            of the bending plants in the lake reminding                          one    of    a
slow-running           river.     To supply the water for this surface current
there must, of course,             be another current, flowing in the opposite
direction underneath.                  The luke      and the ocean            are not, however,
parallel cases.           In the       case of the lake, the wind             is   blowing    in      the
same direction all over                it,   so that the return current               is   forced to
flow underneath the surface, as   cannot get back any other way;
                                                    it
whereas, in the ocean, the wind blows in one direction at one part,

and in a different direction at another part, and the question now
comes to be: What is the effect of the difference in the two cases?
If   the wind does not blow in the same direction at all parts over
the surface of the water, will the return current flow underneath
the surface current, or will it return by some other route?
     It   is extremely       difficult   to  get   a  satisfactory    experimental
answer to this question. The following attempts were,                      however,
 made : — A trough with glass sides was filled with water,                the water
 being well stirred just         before the experiment was made, to prevent
 difference of density due to temperature having any effect on the
 result.     When all was again at rest, a solution of colouring matter
 was dropped into           the   water    at different  points.    Each drop of
 colouring      matter,  as   it sunk   to the bottom, left a vertical      coloured
 streak in     the water.       A jet of air urged by      a  pair of bellows was
 now directed along the surface of the water, so as to act on only a
 small part of the surface, near the middle of the breadth of the
 trough. The upper part of the coloured streaks, situated underneath
 the air-jet, at once indicated a current in the surface water in the
 direction of      the air-jet.    The return current did      not, however,     flow
 underneath the air-driven current,            as  in the case of the lake, but
 the air-driven current divided in two at the far end of the trough,
 and flowed       bade  on the surface,      one current     on each   side   of the
 air-driven current.*
      When    the air current was first started, the water currents             we re
  confined to the surface; but after the motion had been kept up
  some time, the depth of the currents gradually                 increased,   till all
  the water      in the trough was in motion, — the             direction    of   the
  motion of the water at any part of the bottom                being the same as
  at the surface vertically over it.          The water showed not the smallest
  tendency to take up        a  " vertical " circulation, similar    to the circula
  tion produced by difference of density.             The surface water simply
  circulated to different parts of the surface, and the bottom water to
  different parts of the bottom, almost the whole of the motion taking
     * The trough in which the experiment is made must have sloping and
  not  vertical ends, because if the wind-driven current strikes against a
  vertical surfaco, it raises a " head," which causes a vertical current to
  descend at the end of the trough, in addition to the two return surface
  currents.

 396                Proceedings       of the Royal Society
 place in a horizontal direction.          In  order to get quit, as much           as
 possible,   of the effects   of friction   on the sides    and bottom of        the
 vessel, the experiment was repeated           in a pond, with a like result.
    From these experiments we may conclude that, save under very
 exceptional circumstances, the wind can only give rise to a hori
 zontal circulation      of the oceanic       waters,  — the exceptional      cases
 being, when the wind-driven           current is deflected by the irregulari
 ties in the outline       of the    bed   of the   ocean, or strikes against a
 deep and nearly vertical coast; or when the north wind drives the
 waters of the Antarctic       Sea against the great barrier          of  ice-cliffs
 which surround the south pole.             The depth to which the vertical
 currents will descend in these cases will depend much on the rela
 tive densities of the water       in the currents and of the water sur
 rounding them.
    It  may possibly     be objected that we are not entitled to come              to
 any conclusion, from experiments made on so small a scale,                   as to
 what takes place in the ocean.           Such objections would be perfectly
 valid,  if there  was not some evidence, in the conditions we find in
 the ocean, to support these conclusions.             If the return currents in
 the   ocean   flowed underneath          the wind-driven       surface currents,
 then we should      be perfectly justified      in expecting some evidence
 of their presence.       For instance,     we would expect that the water
near the bottom, underneath              the wind-driven      currents near the
equator,    would be hotter than the water at corresponding depths
at other parts of the ocean.          An examination, however, of the tem
                                                                   "
perature sections of the Atlantic Ocean, taken by the Challenger,"
shows no evidence whatever of the return current by this route;
wo aro therefore compelled to conclude that the water must return
by the surface,       and that the wind does only produce horizontal
currents, and therefore cannot account for the presence               of  the cold
water which we find all over the bottom of the ocean,                   from the
poles to the equator.
    The second point      1  wish to refer to, is the effect of these        wind-
driven surface currents on the cold water underneath them.                         I
have said that almost the whole of the motion               of   the wind-driven
currents     takes   place   in a horizontal       direction.      Such was     the
general result given by the -experiment.               But, in addition to    this,
there is another point to which             I must refer.      The   wind driven

                      of Edinburgh, Session 1876-77.                                             397
horizontal currents have             an    influence         on the         water     underneath
them which, for the         sake    of    clearness,    I    have reserved          for separate
consideration       here.   Let      us draw an         imaginary            section     across     a
wind-driven current, at a point near its source, that near where                is,
the wind begins to act on it. And let us imagine another section
                                                                 " down" the
of this    same current, at    a     point some distance farther
stream.    As the current    acted upon
                               is                      by
                                          the wind between these two
sections,    will be much deeper at the second section than at the
              it
first, and will also be going at greater velocity. There will, there
                                          a
fore, be much more water passing the second section than passed the
first, and the water necessary               to supply this growing stream                   must
be supplied to      it   between     the two imaginary sections.                       The result
 is,part of the necessary supply rushes in at the sides, but part of                               it
rises from the still water underneath the surface stream.         This
lifting of the      deeper water by the surface current was very evident
in the experiment already referred               to, so long as the surface current
was shallow, and gradually                 became      less,      as   might be expected,
when the current deepened.
       From    these considerations, we are naturally                   led to expect that
the hot surface water         at]   those parts of the ocean over which winds
are constantly blowing, will              be much reduced             in depth, and that
the cold bottom water will                be found at         a   less depth underneath
these surface currents than at any other part of the ocean.                                  Part
of this cold water will, in all probability, get mixed up with the
bottom water of the surface current. And further, we would expect
that this wind-driven         hot surface water, after                 it   passes beyond the
windy regions, will gradually                  lose    its     motion and             increase     in
depth.
       These expectations are in         a   remarkable manner supported                    by    the
evidence of the temperature sections of the Atlantic taken by the
" Challenger," and given in Dr Carpenter's paper in the " Pro
ceedings of the Royal Geographical                     Society,"        vol. xviii. No. iv.,
1874.         Take, for instance, the section between                        Tenerife     and      St
Thomas.          In the first part of      the journey there            is   not much altera
tion in the relative position of the isotherms, but after crossing
the Tropic of Cancer and getting into the region of the north-east
trade winds, the hot surface isotherms                        gradually        approach          each
other, and the isotherm of 40°, which off the coast of Tenerife was

   398                 Proceedings oj     the  Royal Society
   at a depth    of nearly   1000 fathoms, rises to about 700 fathoms              be
   fore  it arrives  at St Thomas.      Again, in the passage north from St
   Thomas      to Bermuda, and on      to Halifax and New York, the tem
   perature sections show that after getting out of the region of                  the
   trade   winds, the drifted     hot surface water has gradully           lost its
  motion and increased in depth.            This  refers  to the great     mass of
  ocean     water,  and   not to the comparatively shallow Gulf-Stream.
  For instance,      the isotherm of 60°, which     at St Thomas was found
  at   a depth     of only 200 fathoms, was found at a depth of 330
  fathoms for hundreds of miles all round Bermuda, notwithstanding
  a   considerable reduction in the temperature of the surface water.
      The temperature sections of the South Atlantic do not illustrate
  these    points so well     as the temperature       sections of the North
  Atlantic, partly     because a very large part     of the hot    surface water
 of the south equatorial current does not return to the South Atlan
 tic, but is driven into the North Atlantic, and partly on account                  of
 the great amount of cold surface water of the Antarctic             drift, which
 gets mixed np with the return current; and further, the temperature
 sections are not taken at the best places          for our present      purpose.
 The only two available sections, however,            point to the same         con
 clusion as the North Atlantic sections.           There is no section of         the
 south     equatorial current, but we may suppose          it  to be somewhat
similar     to the section taken between         St Paul's Rocks       and      Per-
nambuco, which gives the isotherms of the branch of the                       south
equatorial current which passes into the North Atlantic.                     If   we
compare      this section with the part of the stream which has             flowed
southwards, as given in the section taken between Abrolhos Island
and     Tristan d'Acunha,     we find that the hot surface water, in flowing
southwards beyond the region of the south-east trade winds,                      has
deepened,      notwithstanding     a considerable  fall in the   temperature       of
the surface water.       The isotherm of     40° which was found at a depth
of 300 fathoms off Pernambuco,            sunk to a depth of between             400
and 500 fathoms between          Abrolhos    Island   and Tristan    d'Acunha.
We might have expected that this hot surface water would                       have
kept its depth all the way to the Cape of Good Hope.               It, however,
does not do so, probably on account         of the cold   surface water     of   the
Antarctic drift.
     I am  aware   Dr Carpenter   has offered a different explanation       of the

                    of Edinburgh, Session 1876-77.                             399
rising of the glacial water under          the equator.        He considers that
the rising of the glacial water under the Line is due to the meeting
of the Arctic and Antarctic underflows. That part of the effect is due
to this cause is very probable,      but when we consider the very great
area of section of the under glacial currents, and the small amount
of water that     can be carried by them, it is evident that their rate
of motion must        be very slow, and     it is very doubtful how far the
whole phenomena can be explained              in this way.        Our doubts on
this subject     are somewhat confirmed by the consideration of the
fact that the Arctic underflow is warmer than the Antarctic under
flow, and would therefore — other things being equal              — tend simply
to overflow the     Antarctic underflow, and not to rise vertically as
Dr Carpenter      supposes.     That the wind-driven currents, so long
as they are increasing in volume, have            the power      of drawing the
bottom water upwards cannot be doubted, and                 I  have already said
was most marked in the experimental illustration.                We should not,
however, expect to find this lifting power          so  marked in the ocean,
as the ocean currents are so much            deeper   and     do not so rapidly
increase in volume      as in the experiment.        And further,     the bottom
water in the ocean is denser than the surface water,               and   does not
rise so easily as the bottom     water in the experiment.
   If we   take the' evidence of the temperature sections             of the At
lantic on    the subject, we shall find that they also point to the wind
as  one of the causes of the rising of the cold bottom water.               If  we
take the section between Madeira and lat.            3°  N.   and long. 16° W,
we find that the isotherm of 40°, which at Madeira lies at a depth
of about 900 fathoms, rises to        a depth    of only 300 fathoms at the
equatorial position, and further, neither this section nor the section
between lat.     3° N. and long.      15°  W.   and    Pernambuco, show the
least  evidence of the presence of Antarctic water               so  far north  as
the equator,     in the eastern     basin   of the Atlantic.        This rising,
then,  of the glacial  water  on the eastern side       of  the  Atlantic cannot
therefore   be  due to the   meeting   of  the  glacial streams, and in the
absence    of further evidence we may suppose             it to be due to the
wind-driven currents.        We thus    see, that though the great bulk of
the wind-driven     circulation   is a horizontal      one, yet there is also
produced    in a comparatively very small degree            a  modified vertical
circulation.

400                   Proceedings         of the Royal Society
   It  may here be asked,         Is this lifting power of the surface           currents
sufficient to account for the vertical circulation which we                       find   in
the ocean     ?    In all     probability    it is not.      There seems        to be no
reason why this vertically           rising current under the equator should
draw its supplies from the furthest limits of the ocean, which it
would require to do to explain                 the conditions       we   find existing.
Yet there       can be no doubt but that these              horizontal      surface cur
rents really do assist in producing a vertical circulation.

this function (looked                on as corresponding             to   deformations             of the
knot)       is     subject,   is   that no two values    of   p   shall   ever       be   equal even at
a     stage of the deformation.                 Subject to this proviso,                  tp   may suffer
 any changes whatever — retaining of                         course its periodicity.                Some
 of the simpler results of     study of this novel problem in the

 autotomic and             (if required) non-intersecting.

   The first shock occurred on the 11th March, and was                        observed
at the Lighthouse      station of Hynish in the island of Tyree,                      and
at Sound of      Mull, near Tobermory,            the distance between the two
places being about 34 statute miles.
   The report from Tyree states: — " On the 11th current (March),
at half-past 11 o'clock a.m., a smart shock                of earthquake       was felt
all along the island      ;  a great many people             both heard the noise
and at the same time felt the earth to tremble.                    It was heard and
felt very distinctly at the station."             Bar. 30-18 at 9 a.m.
   That from the Sound of Mull says:—" On the 11th, at 11.30
a.m., this district was visited by a smart shock of earthquake.                         It
began by a rumbling        noise   like distant thunder.            When the       noise
was at its height     the   houses, and       everything        about them, shook,
and the slates    on the roof rattled.             The shaking       was not    of  long
duration, but the noise was heard a considerable time before                          and
after the trembling of the earth."             Bar. 29-92 at       9 a.m.
   The second shock, which seems to have been more severe,                           took
place on the 23d     April,   and was observed          at the island     of  Phladda,
off Easdale, and at Lismore,         at the    eastern     entrance to the Sound
of Mull, the distance between             the two stations being about                 73
statute miles.
   The report from Phladda            states  : — " At     3.40 a.m. the Principal
Keeper on the watch felt         a severe    shock of earthquake.          The    tower
and   dwelling-houses       shook very        much.          All  the neighbouring
islands felt it at the same time."            Bar. 29-74 at       9 a.m.
   At Lismore      the   lightkeeper        describes       the effect     as   follows
(the lighthouse clock had been under repair): —                       "I   beg     leave
to report that on the morning of the 23d, at 3.30                         a.m.,   while
I   was   standing   on   the grating        inside      the   lightroom      I  felt   a
heavy shock on the tower, with a strange rumbling sound of                         noise
which lasted some seconds, and made everything in the lightroom
shake at an alarming rate.           It  awoke      all the inmates     of the dwell
ing-houses.      Mr M'Leod jumped out of                 bed,   thinking the      tower
had fallen, but afterwards thought              it  was a   peal of thunder.         1 do
not think it was thunder.           I  saw no       lightning, and      the wind was

light at the     time.     There is no damage           done   to   anything about
the station so far as     I  can see."         Bar. 29'43 at  9 a.m.
    These observations are valuable because of their trustwortniness
as    coming from wholly          independent observers,         and because      few
more sensible earthquake shocks have, so far as                   I  know, been ob
served in Scotland.         It  is also remarkable        that they do not appear
to have been felt at any other lighthouse                stations, although there
are several others in         the    immediate vicinity.          A  record of them
may      therefore   be   useful     to   those     engaged in seismic       investi
gations.                              ,

    The author, in laying before the Society a revised and condensed
 version of the various papers recently communicated by him, took
occasion to make some            additional       remarks.     Of   these  only one
 need     be given here.       He pointed out that another fundamental
 term is requisite besides those already used viz., Knots and Links.
 For three    endless cords may be             inseparably   entangled with       one
 another, or locked together, even            if no one of them be knotted and
no two interlinked.

    The " Challenger          Expedition        had   no opportunity      of visiting
 Barbadoes, and      this   I   regretted greatly, as Sir Rawson            llawson,
 who was at that time governor of the island, had paid great atten
tion to the marine        fauna,     and was anxious to introduce us to his
 fine collection, which        included      many specimens of the rare and

 406                  Proceedings      of the Royal Society
 remarkable       forms for which         the sea of the Antilles is famous.
                                 "               "
 However, although the Challenger                   was not there in person, on
 her return Sir Rawson Rawson most kindly and liberally placed
 the finest of his specimens at my disposal for examination and
 description   ;   and  it is through his liberality that         I  now have it in
 my power to exhibit           the  very singular creature which is the sub
ject of   these     notes.    In   1837 M.    Alcide d'Orbigny        described and
 figured in the
                     " Magasin     de Zoologie," under the name of Holuput,
 a  new recent genus of fixed Crinoids; and as the description                 of this
 distinguished palaeontologist indicated an undescribed form of great
 interest, it was speedily reproduced in the Annales
                                                         "              des Sciences
 Naturelles" and in Wiegmann's " Archiv."
     The specimen described by D'Orbigny, which was for a long time
unique, was brought from Martinique by M. Sander-Rang.                        It sub
sequently passed into the possession of M. D'Orbigny, who described
it under     the     name    of H. rangii.      D'Orbigny's      account was very
clear and     intelligible, and his determination was fully borne out
                                          " Classen und

 figures are repeated,        and   a distinct    family, Holopidae, is adopted
 for the reception of the single species.               It  is very    singular   that
 in   the " Historic Naturelle           des   Zoophytes      Echinodermes,"        by
                                                                                      "
Dujardin    and Hupe, published as a volume            of the "Suites      a Buffon
in 1862, the authors express             their opinion     that Holopus is not        a
Crinoid, but some totally different thing, probably a Cirriped, and
they profess to have been unable to find D'Orbigny's specimen.
    At M. D'Orbigny's death his whole museum was bought by the
Jardin    des Plantes, and in the year 1867, through                the courtesy of
M. Fischer,      I  had an opportunity of examining            the original    speci
men there;        and  although it      was in a very dilapidated          condition,
I   had  no difficulty     in satisfying     myself that it was       a true Crinoid
of a very peculiar type.

    Professor Louis Agassiz
in 1873, and he there saw             a second     specimen of Holopus in Sir
Rawson Rawson's collection.              Professor Agassiz      intended to have
published    a   full description of the specimen, which was lent to him
for that purpose by Sir Rawson Rawson, but he was prevented from
doing so by failing health, and after his death the figures which

he had prepared were published by Alexander Agassiz, with a short
note by Count Pourtales, in the " Zoological Results of the ' Hassler'
Expedition."
    During the last few years three specimens of Holopus rangii
have fallen into Sir Raws',n Rawson's hands, and from these we
will  be able to give a pretty good account of the hind               parts.    All
were brought up on fishermen's lines from deep water off Barbadoes.
One is very complete          in all important       points, wanting only the
two   "bivial"    arms, but retaining the mouth-valves.           The  second is a
little larger; it wants the mouth-         valves, and again the bivial arms       ;
and with      Sir Rawson Rawson's sanction             I  boiled this specimen
down, to figure and describe the separate              parts.    The third   speci
men is quite perfect, the arms closely              curled in, in their normal
position when contracted;         but it is very young, only about         8  m.m.
in height.       Besides the four examples mentioned              I am aware of
only another, which       I have not yet seen     ; it was shown at the     Phila
delphia Exhibition, and was afterwards bought by the Museum of
Comparative Zoology at Cambridge, Mass.
    Holopus is distinguished       from all other recent Crinoids by hav
ing the    basal   plates, and the first and probably also the second
 radials fused together, forming the wall of a tube-like             body-cham
ber, which      is cemented     beneath    to the foreign body to which the
Crinoid    is attached, by an       irregularly expanded calcareous           base.
This    mode   of attachment     also occurs in the fossil genus Apiocrinus,
and in many other forms of the Apiocrinida)                   and Cyathocrinidss,
 but in these, of course, the cement matter is thrown                 out at the
 base of a   jointed  stem.
    The upper portion of this hollow column expands slightly,                  and
 its thickened      upper border is divided into five strongly-marked
 facets  for the articulation      of five arms.       Each facet is traversed
by a transverse      articulating ridge, a little in front of which there
is the mouth of the tube which lodges the sarcode axis of the
joints, and a little behind its centre there is a somewhat longer
aperture which appears to lead into the cancellated uLucture of the
outer part of the wall.        There are two large shallow muscular im
pressions on the surface of the facet on the proximal                   aspect   of
the transverse ridge.       These facets,    I conclude,    represent the upper
surfaces of second radials, but         if  so, they differ from the second

radials of all other recent Crinoids               in being connected with the
radial axillaries by a true muscular joint instead of by a syzygy.
The alternative is that they may be the upper articulating surfaces
of the first radials, in which case the next joints may be                    formed
of the second and        third radials     coalesced,    and the syzygy between
them obliterated       ; or, finally, there may be only two radials.            There
is no trace of any further          division    of the wall of the column,         and
the cavity is continued           contracting      gradually   to the bottom.         A
vertical   mark, sometimes a groove and sometimes a ridge, runs
from the centre of each articulating facet down the inside of the
wall for about two-thirds of the depth of the cavity, when it is lost.
The upper border of          the cup, bearing the facets, is very irregular
in thickness    ;  and in all the specimens which          I have   seen, including
D'Orbigny's,      one side     of the border is much thicker and consider
ably higher than the other side, and the three arms articulated                       to
it are   much larger than those               articulated   to  the opposite      side.
There is thus a     very marked division into
                                                       " bivium " and "    trivium,"
and consequently a bilateral symmetryunderliestheradiated                   arrange
ment of the antimeres.           Singularly enough, the specimen           described
by D'Orbigny was abnormal, only four arms                      being developed,        a
circumstance which no doubt greatly conduced to the doubt                         with
which its determination as an echinoderm was received.
   Five " radial-axillary " plates, three larger and two smaller,
articulate by corresponding            ridges and muscular impressions            with
the facets    of the border of the cup, and each of these bears                    dis-
tally two   facets, sloping outwards and downwards, for the insertion
of the first brachials.        The outer surfaces of the radial axillaries          are
very gibbous, thrown out into almost hemispherical                      projections,
studded with low tubercles            ;  a deep    groove runs up the centre          of
the inner aspect of the joint, and the two sides send inwards                     very
strong projecting processes, which abut against the corresponding
processes of the contiguous joints on either side, and lock into them
by a system of corresponding                ridges and grooves, so that          there
appears   to be   little or   no motion between         these  joints.
   The radial-axillaries         are each succeeded       by two series of      about
eight similar,      thick, wedge-shaped brachial joints, very convex
externally,   and    giving off laterally on each side of the arm alter
nating, very flat broad pinnules each consisting of about six plate

                      of Edinburgh,      Session        1876-77.                409
like joints.      The brachials are also provided with strong lateral
processes forming       a wall on either side         of the radial   groove,    and
the sides of adjacent         series  of these       first eight   arm-joints     are
marked with corresponding grooves and ridges, eo that, although
from the presence of articulating ridges of varying degrees of ob
liquity, and of muscular impressions; the proximal portions of the
arms must be capable of some motion, that motion would appear
to  be slight.     After about   the eighth      the    joints suddenly contract
in size and      become     greatly   compressed,         and this narrow teries
extends to about sixteen in number, gradually tapering to the end
of the arm.
    At the bases of     the   arms,  just   above the       edge of the cup, five
thick calcareous       bosses,  each   composed of the contiguous lateral
processes of two radial-axillary joints, project interradially              into the
cup   ;  and opposite these five rather large triangular plates, meeting
in the centre of the disk, form a low pyramid covering                 the mouth.
The oral plates are interradial, and the spaces between               them radial
corresponding with the arm -grooves.
    D'Orbigny described the animal            as possessing     no anal opening,
and this is probably the case, but           the    material is still too scanty
 to admit of the full examination of            a   complete specimen        of the
skeleton, and the soft parts are unknown.
    All   the  specimens of Holopus which have                been  hitherto pro
cured are in a very peculiar condition            ;  the thick-walled     foot, and
 massive, somewhat rudely shaped             cup and arm-joints        are formed
of a    loose  spongy calcified areolar tissue deeply stained with a
black-green pigment.           There is no appearance of any separate
organic matter, either on the outer surface of the skeleton, which
is very delicately sculptured like shagreen, or on the articulating
surfaces of separated plates ; indeed, the whole body is so perfectly
hard and rigid that at first sight        I  thought it might be semi-fossil.
It  is without    doubt recent, but     I  suspect that the tissues are very
 imperfectly    differentiated, almost protoplasmic.            When     an arm is
 put into boiling water it falls into       pieces at once, the     joints simply
 coming asunder, and showing no              trace    of muscular or other or
 ganic connection except the axial cords of the joints, which some
 times keep two joints hanging in connection for a little.
    Holopus is thus specially characterised among living Crinoids

  410                  Proceedings of        the  Royal Society
  by the     absence    of  an   articulated     stem    or its representative          the
 centro-dorsal       plate  ;   by its    viscera    being       lodged     in  a hollow
 peduncle with a continuously             calcified wall       ;   and by the     absence
 of an anal opening.
     In   1846 Professor Steenstrup described under the name of Cya-
 thidium, a genus of fossil Crinoid from the chalk of Faxoe, which
 occupies     a debatable     position between       the base of the Eocene Ter-
 tiuries and the top of the Cretaceous             series.       The only portion       yet
 described      of Cyathidium is       a deep cup or tube with a spreading
 base     of attachment and        a thickened      rim with articulating           facets
 for five      arms.    The cup of Cyathidium is somewhat more sym
 metrical and coralloid than that of the recent West Indian form ;
 but   I  see  no distinction between them of generic value, and                  I think
 we must accept Holopus as another of the                    links which       recent in
 vestigations have made so numerous between                          the faunae of later
 geological periods and that of the present time.
  2.   On the Diurnal Oscillations of the Barometer. — Part IL
                            By Alex. Buchan, M.A.
    In this communication the author                 stated       that he limited       his
remarks on the present occasion to some of the more prominent
results he has arrived at in the course of this investigation.                        The
paper itself, with the tables,         will  be submitted when the computa
tions have been finished and thoroughly                    revised, — a work which
must necessarily yet take some considerable time.
    It  is proposed    that Part    II.  consist chiefly of tables showing             the
arithmetic mean values of the hourly                  variations of the different
months of the year, with remarks on the more evident conclusions
which may be drawn from them.                  The number of places for            which
data   of   more or less completeness have now been obtained exceed
130, situated in different parts         of the globe.        To    these it is proposed
to add the results       of observations made at sea, chiefly those made
by the
           "  Challenger
                           " and " Novara " expeditions.
   As regards temperate regions, such as Great Britain, periods of
no    more     than three years'        observations give only the broadest
characteristics      of the diurnal         barometric       curve.       From     20    to
25 years       will probably      be   found     to   be    required      to   show    the

peculiarities     of the curve with such completeness as to exhibit
the variations          impressed on             the curve by          season       and by geo
graphical      position,       particularly         as     regards masses               of land       and
extended        sheets    of water.           In    lower latitudes             a comparatively
short time is required             ;   but even here, where a general regularity
in the phenomena is perhaps the most striking fact in the meteor
ology of equatorial regions, the variations which do occur from
year to year ought to be carefully                        observed     from their important
bearing on the whole theory                  of the movements of the                     atmosphere.
The summer months of the northern hemisphere,                                      as regards the
diurnal oscillations of the barometer, that is the                                      period      when
the influence      of    the sun is at the maximum                     as    regards its effecls
on these phenomena, are                   May,     June,     and      July,      and         the   winter
months, November,               December, and January, both corresponding
with the sun's declination;                 that    is,   the effects are not cumulative,
as in the case of the temperature of the air or that of the sea,                                        by
which the critical periods are retarded from one to two months.
  Among the many interesting features of the curves which                                            were
pointed out may be noted the enormous influence of latitude and
of land and      sea respectively in determining                   the amount and time
of occurrence of the different                     phases     of the oscillations, and                  a
diagram was exhibited                  showing the curves of                a   large number of
places, from which         it   appeared         that as regards the summer the a.m.
maximum occurs at any time from 6-7                            a.m.   to    2   p.m.,    and the p.m.
minimum        from   3   to   8   p.m.   — the stations       selected showing               a    regular
gradation between these extremes,                     a    gradation        dependent on geo
graphical position.            The tendency of assimilation of                      the curves for
certain elevated stations and those for strictly sea-side stations was
pointed out, and attention was drawn to the striking fact that the
summer curves of inland stations within lat. 30° N. and S. essen
tially differed from           those      of higher latitudes —             a   difference which
the varying declination of the sun with season failed to obliterate.
  An examination of the different theories yet propounded                                           shows
that none of them are in accordance with the facts which                                             have
been collected.          It    would not      be   difficult     by   a     proper selection of
stations to bring proof in support of any of these theories.                                          The
truth   is,   however, that as more facts are obtained the difficulty of
framing   a    satisfactory theory can scarcely be said to                              be   materially

   An examination of       these curves by the harmonic analysis and             a
similar examination       of the temperature, hygrometric, wind, mag

the true theory of the diurnal barometric oscillations            can be stated.

4.  Why the Barometer does not always indicate real
   Vertical Pressure: A continuation of the Paper laid before
   the Royal       Society of Edinburgh in           July    1875, in which,
   in addition       to several other points, this           was    attempted
   to be      shown.      It   is now more       fully written        out.    By
   Robert Tennent.
   The barometer only indicates real pressure when the atmosphere
is in    a state   of perfect     rest.    It may then be represented           a
existing    in vertical columns, but when it moves over a resisting
surface   its lower surface currents will be         greatly retarded,     while
those aloft will    move    comparatively free and unimpeded.            In  this
state it may be represented         as moving in columns inclined in the
direction towards which it moves.             The atmosphere may         thus  be
conceived as being divided into a number of spheroidal concentric
layers, each of which is possessed of a different rate of speed,             and
moves     more    rapidly   than the one       beneath    it:    an  increasing
amount of friction        will take     place  betwixt  the    layers   as  they
approach     the surface  where its influence     is greatest.      What   takes
place   may be represented        in this way.     Let R S    be the resisting
surface,  and let

at different         rates of speed.               Those     being most           rapid where            the
arrow      heads      are     most numerous.                 Let   these     layers also exhibit
equal masses of air, but of different volumes, which                                         increase in
size from the ground upwards, accompanied also by much greater
mobility,            Tyndall in his experiments at Chamouni and
                as shown by
the summit of Mount Blanc. An important point is this. The surface
current      D D'         has only       a horizontal          source of supply from the
direction D' from which it                     is fed,      while the upper current A A'
has not only a horizontal                      source       of supply from A', but it also
derives                                 current B B' beneath
             supply from the slower moving                                                                 it,
                               "
which will be drawn upwards, or lifted," in the direction of the
small inclined arrows abed. To enable this upper current to
supply itself in this              way, while         it    possesses       the same amount of
mass as that beneath                    it,   it   must have          a   greater velocity,              and
therefore greater momentum than that of the current beneath                                                it,
from    which        it   draws its supply.                 Each of the lower currents,                    as
they approach the surface, are                       also    supplied in the same manner,
but in a decreasing ratio, from those beneath them, until the lowest
layer   is   reached,         which     is    that which         is   most       retarded, not only
owing      to    its proximity to              a     resisting      surface, but also to                  the
scarcity of supply, which can now only be derived from                                    a   horizontal
source, and not from beneath,                        as was the case         with those above it.
A  tendency in the air to accumulate aloft will now take place, by
" lifting," in the direction of the small inclined arrows abed.
Pressure        is   thus diminished            at the       surface, while        it   is   abnormally
increased higher up.
     The   effect     of this will      be that the surface barometer                        will exhibit
diminished or fictitious                    pressure, while           the    real   weight          of    the
atmosphere remains unaltered.                          A    partial vacuum          is   found on the
lee-side of      a   wall, over the top of which              a    strong wind blows           :   it   with
draws the air there to such an extent, that                                 it   causes       removal to
exceed restoration, but                it     does    not affect the real vertical mass of
the column overhead                except to an infinitesimal                     degree.          In this,
as   in the former            case, real pressure            cannot be ascertained by the
surface barometer.                It   is   only to be obtained from the result of an
observation of            a   series   of barometers placed vertically                       above each
other, and not very far apart.                        From     the results thus obtained,                  it
would be found that the normal upward diminution                                             of pressure

414                    Proceedings           of the Royal          Society
which takes place when the atmosphere is at rest would                                   be greatly
altered when its upper portion is in rapid motion.
  Retarded surface currents and rapid upper currents which move
in inclined      columns and produce these effects, can only                                 be found
with an imperfect fluid, and on a resisting surface, into which                                     the
element of friction            enters.        On a frictionless               surface this could
not take place.   The atmosphere would there move in vertical, not
                                  "
in inclined columns, no " lifting   would take place, pressure would
be real or statical ; its upward diminution would be normal, as
when it is at rest, and horizontal                       movement would not take off
vertical pressure.
   Barometric         pressure      must hence           be regarded           in two points of
view — 1st      as   being a cause       ;   and 2d, as being an effect.                  When,       as
in the first case, it is real or statical, it operates as a cause due                                 to
gravitation, which is unresisted.                   When, as in the second instance,
there is an introduction of the dynamical element, surface gravita
tion is diminished            by
                                    " lifting," and it must then to                        a certain
extent be regarded as an effect.                        The practical conclusion                   from
this is obvious.          On weather charts the constant rise and fall                                of
the barometer, which               is there reported, is              to    a large    extent simply
due to the passage           of air   over a resisting surface.                   Over       a surface
devoid     of friction        these      mechanical             effects      would      be entirely
removed     :   its rise and fall would be greatly                          reduced, and         might
be considered as being solely dependent on the effects                                  of   heat   and
vapour. The gradients and isobars which are represented by                                        these
movements of the barometer would consequently require also                                         to be
similarly corrected.
  The barometer does not indicate the real weight of                                      the atmo
sphere,    it only exhibits the amount of its elasticity, from which                                  its
real weight can only be deduced                    when the dynamical                    element      of
motion does not enter into its currents.                               The two          cases    above
mentioned may illustrate this point.                         The surface        barometer         there
indicates       fictitious     pressure,      or in          other words, the amount                  of
pressure    due to the elasticity            of   the    air,   but not to that           of   its real
weight, which        is   there diminished              by   "lifting," and           as lifting    can
increase    or diminish in amount, so also can the elasticity of                               the air,
while its real weight remains unaltered.
  As   a    general rule, in the British                     Isles,        equatorial    winds      are

accompanied          by these   rapid upper movements,            while polar winds
move      with a greater uniformity in the velocity of their various
layers, and sometimes even those on the surface move more rapidly
when copiously supplied from               a vertical  source.      There is thus a
remarkable difference in their            mode    of inflow.      Equatorial    winds,
as they increase in force,          are hence accompanied by " lifting
                                                                                 " and
a  fall of the     barometer.      Polar winds are not attended            " lifting,"
                                                                       by
and    if   their supply is copious and partly from a vertical source,
their increase in force        is accompanied by a rise of the barometer.
    The range of         the thermometer is equally great, both above              and
below      its mean    ;   but with the barometer the extent of its range
above the mean            is not more      than one-half of that which takes
place when it is below it. When it is below the mean, equatorial winds
generally prevail, which           are accompanied by        lifting and extensive
range.        When above the        mean, polar winds prevail, which are not
attended by lifting or such             extensive fluctuations.        Hence, as       a
general       rule, equatorial       winds    exhibit    fictitious   or  dynamical
pressure, while polar winds possess               more    nearly, real    or statical
pressure, being less accompanied by rapid upper currents, and by
the mechanical oscillations due to the passage of air over a resisting
surface.
    Observations of a general description and illustrations                  will  pro
bably be afterwards introduced to exemplify the above conclusions.
    It  is to this difference      in  the mode   of inflow that     an attempt has
 been     made     to  explain    the causes why depressions            move     in an
 easterly direction.

gravitation, &c., almost identical with that of Le Sage, to                                     which
our attention was lately recalled by our President.                               Professor Blair

     As we could not find pure cobalt for sale in the                     state   of foil
 or wire suitable for thermo-electric               experiments,       we resolved      to
 prepare      it by electrolysis of chloride of cobalt in the way recom
  mended by Mr G. W. Beardslee of Brooklyn, N.Y.*                              For this
 there is required pure chloride of cobalt of a certain strength
  to form the electrolyte,           and   spongy metallic       cobalt to form the
  positive     electrode.      By the kindness        of   Dr Crum        Brown     these
          prepared with very great care in the chemical                  laboratory by
   Mr Robinson,        to whom       we are    much indebted.           The following
 note of the method of preparation employed has                     been   supplied    by
   Mr Itobiuson : —
      " Oxide ol cobalt        was    dissolved by heat in hydrochloric             acid;
   the acid solution     was treated     with ammonia in great excess, the pre
   cipitate    at first   formed being        then   dissolved    ;  the ammoniacal
   solution of chloride of cobalt was then oxidised by passing clean,
        air through it     till the colour    was no longer altered, i.e.,       till the
   purple   colour was          succeeded     by   a  reddish-brown,        and    till it
   admitted of precipitation           by hydrochloric      acid.     This    was done.

The precipitate purpureo-cobaltic            chloride was collected on a filter,
well washed with very dilute hydrochloric acid, and dried carefully,
great care being taken to avoid contamination                by iron.     The dried
purpureo-cobaltic chloride was then reduced in a current of hydro
gen     in    small  reducing    crucibles,     and  fine   skeletons of spongy
cobalt were obtained.           26 gms. of cobalt were made in this way                  ;
the    remainder of the purpureo-cobaltic               chloride was     heated        to
expel chloride of ammonium, dissolved in hydrochloric                      acid and
water,      and when evaporated      to dryness, yielded 32 gms. of chloride
of cobalt.       This  was made up to 900 c.c. with distilled water."
    Having obtained these, some experiments were then                   made as       to
the    substitution     of aluminium        for the carbon-electrode        used     by
Mr Beardslee,        and   as  to the strength       of current required.         The
aluminium was found to answer admirably.                   These preliminary ex
periments over, we set about preparing such a bar as would serve us
instead of a wire in our thermo-electric work.                        For this end
we    took a strip of aluminium            about 100 mm.         long, and    8   mm.
broad, carefully       covered    it with wax      on one side, and used it as
the negative electrode.           To form the positive        electrode   a piece     of
glass tube,      10 mm. wide, and         20 mm. long, was taken and closed
at one       end, through which       a   platinum wire was passed;          the one
end     of this was connected        with the positive pole of the           battery,
 while the       other end was       coiled    into  a   spiral   inside   the tube,
 into which some of the spongy cobalt was tightly packed                    so as to
 make       good  contact with the wire.          These electrodes      were placed
 in a porcelain bath containing           some of the chloride of cobalt solu
 tion, rendered      very slightly alkaline       by the addition of       ammonia.
 The battery found most             suitable consisted of two large           Bunsen
 cells   ;   when less was      used    the deposition went on          too    slowly,
  while pieces prepared         with a stronger battery-power            were inco
  herent.      The action   was usually allowed to go on for two or              three
  days, at the end of which time the metal had a considerable thick
  ness.      The cobalt  was separated      from the aluminium by boiling             it
  in a strong solution of caustic soda.              The   pieces    of cobalt    thus
  prepared     were of very great hardness         and compactness,      being    with
  difficulty filed.
     It    was with these pieces of cobalt that the thermo-electric             obser
  vations were made,          The first observations showed that          the cobalt

line lay very far down on the thermo-electric diagram, while subse
quent observations showed that it lay below all the lines formerly
obtained. Hence it lies in a region in which it is very difficult
accurately to determine its position. This difficulty is increased
by the circumstance that the line which lies nearest        namely,                it,
that of nickel,    not straight line. Another difficulty in carry
                     is       a
ing out the experiments arose from the shortness of the cobalt bars,
but this was in great measure overcome

scrihed to this Society.* The following      brief account of
                                                            is   a                           the
experiments and their results —            :
    In    the beginning of March one of the bars was ready for use.
Preliminary observations           carried     on with hot oil having shown that
no marked         peculiarities existed within the temperature                     of boiling
 oil,   a quadruple junction       of M,       N,f nickel     and cobalt was formed
 and     heated by means          of   a   red-hot iron cylinder.                The nickel-
 cobalt deflections obtained from this experiment, when plotted in
 terms of the M-N deflections, gave line showing clearly the nickel
                                                 a
 peculiarities,     and    supplied us with           an approximate             position     for
cobalt.
   On the opening of the laboratory for the summer session experi
 ments with the hot cylinder were resumed, and quadruple junction   a
 of M, N, palladium, cobalt, was used. This was connected with
 the galvanometer          in such a way that the deflections due to the
 thermo-electric     pairs Pd-Co,          M-N, M-Pd, could             be read separately,
 and in rapid succession.              The     M-N junction supplied                us with
                   scale as in former experiments, and                       the lines got     by a
 temperature
 plotting    the other deflections in terms of this gave an easy method
 of fixing   the relative positions of cobalt, palladium and M, and hence
 of fixing the position of cobalt on the thermo-electric                           diagram."
 Owing     to the much greater electro-motive force in the                         Pd-Co     and
 M-Pd circuits than in the M-N circuit,                  a    resistance of 192 ohms
 had to be inserted between                the palladium wire and the galvano
 meter.      The   M-Pd curve      presented      the usual well-known               uarabolic

appearance       without any marked peculiarity, but the Pd-Co                 curve,
though parabolic at comparatively low temperatures, showed at the
higher      temperatures     an   apparent      tendency to straighten,          thus
indicating      a possible point     of contrary-flexure,      i.e.,  abend in the
cobalt line at      a temperature somewhere        about or above a bright red
heat.      The approximate position of the cobalt line may               be gathered
from these facts       : that the line of 15° C is divided by the points of
intersection      of the cobalt, palladium        and M lines in the ratio of
11  : 8,  and that the cobalt line is inclined to the horizontal               at an
angle not quite double of the angle of inclination               of palladium.
   In experiments         made   to-day with       a double circuit of Co-Pd
against nickel, with some resistance            thrown    into the cobalt arm, a
neutral point has been got at         a  temperature of about 500° F.           This
shows us that by the aid of cobalt we shall be able to investigate the
peculiarities of nickel more accurately, while from the parts of the
nickel line which are already known we shall             be able to    fix definitely
the position of the cobalt.         It  is worthy of notice tli.it even at the
high temperatures of the red-hot or even white-hot                     cylinder the
cobalt shows no tendency to oxidise.
   Electric     Conductivity.  — During the last       few days we have been
carrying      on a scries  of experiments       on the change       of the electric
conductivity of cobalt with change of temperature.                     For this   we
prepared     a very narrow strip     of   cobalt by depositing      it  on the edge
of a piece of aluminium.            To the     ends  of the strip       so prepared
stout copper wires were         soldered,    and the experiments were then
carried on     as  in the case of nickel (Proc. Roy. Soc. Edin., 1875-6,
p. 120).       The line obtained was not straight but slightly curved,
showing apparently         a gradual alteration      in the rate of change of
conductivity.         Within   the temperature       of boiling oil, however,
there    is no indication     of a sudden      change, and the curve in the
line may be due to several disturbing causes which we have not                    as
yet been able to eliminate.

                                 (Read 5th June 1876.)
     On     March     25th,   at 8.15    p.m.,   very few clouds being visible,
there      appeared    a luminous       arch   in a vertical plane, passing true
E.    and W. nearly through the zenith.               This   arch, to my surprise,
gave everywhere          a continuous      spectrum.     I  had, in company with
Professor Dewar,          observed     a phenomenon similar         in all respects
(continuous spectrum included) some seven years before, and was
 then inclined to fancy the arch a mere low-lying cloud, and its
 light due to the town lamps. But on the present occasion, after
 about forty minutes, when             the arch     had disappeared,     an   aurora,
 showing      unmistakably in the spectroscope           the characteristic green
  band, appeared       near the magnetic north.            And   a few  days     after
  wards there appeared in the Edinburgh              newspapers    several descrip
 tions of     a similar    arch   seen at almost exactly        the same     time at
  Colinton,    &c., and     even so far off as Dunfermline.            Most of the
  observers remarked         the entire absence of coruscations          as   a  proof
  that   the phenomenon could not be auroral.              The facts stated seem,
  however, to leave no doubt that it was connected                with the aurora,
  and the peculiarity of its spectrum remains to be explained.
     On    May 10th, the sky cloudless but hazy, from                  11   a.m.     till
  nearly    3   p.m.,  I  observed     a magnificent       halo of 22°, with its
  tangent arcs forming          almost a complete external oval.             Various
  observers     in different parts of Scotland seem to have noticed the
  halo itself from       2 p.m.  till  sunset,    but none   have   mentioned the
  external oval, which at midday was brighter than the halo.
      As showing that the ice-crystals in the air were very widely
  spread about this period,        I  append     an extract from a letter      I   have
  just  received    from Mr Aitken of Darroch.
     "  I  have   sent you     a  sketch    I  made   of an atmospheric pheno
  menon which        I  saw at Cadenabbia, Lago di Como, on Sunday the
   30th   April, and hope it may be useful to you to-night.
      " The weather during the previous day was very bad                 ;  it rained
  heavily     all day.     The wind was northerly,          and   the temperature
   low.    In  the evening there was a thunderstorm, accompanied                   by a
  good deal      of lightning.       Sunday morning broke clear and               fine   ;

  426                  Proceedings      of the Royal Society
  without a cloud in the sky, almost no wind, and barometer high.
  At   10.45 a.m., when      I  first noticed the phenomenon, the sky             was
  covered with a very thin uniform white haze, and no clouds visible.
     "When first       observed,   the large circle which passed        through the
  sun was complete,         but only the upper half of the              small circle
  which surrounded the sun was visible.                   There was no colour in
  the large    circle, but the small circle was fringed with colour, the
 outside being of a bluish-violet            tint, the inside reddish.        In   the
 centre     of the band, between         the two colours,       no colour could be
 distinguished      ;  it looked pure white.          On each side of the small
 circle there was a short strip of colour, cutting the large circle at
 an acute angle.          This short    band     was visible on the white band
 of the large circle, and only extended to              a  short distance on each
 side of it.      The small coloured        circle was never very perfect, only
 the top part remained steadily brilliant, and at this part the colours
 were more       brilliant than     at any other part.        The sides were par
 ticularly always rather undefined.
     " For
             part of the time, while the phenomenon lasted, there was an
 extraordinary        change    in its appearance.          There  appeared    to be
 two     circles of nearly the        same    diameter surrounding         the  sun,
 neither of which was concentric with the sun. and were separated
 from each other horizontally,            as   shown in the lower of the two
 sketches.      While this       was the    case the circles were       never com
 plete, only little more than the upper halves of them being visible.
 Another curious point was that the coloured circle did not                  seem   a
 perfect circle.       The horizontal       axis seemed       longer than the ver
 tical  ;  but of this   I am not certain, as      I  had no instruments to take
 any measurements.           The only means of observation            I  had was a
circular piece of paper          I hurriedly cut, and       held  between    my  eye
 and the sun, in such a position that the sun shone through a small
hole in the centre.           When this disc was held at such a distance
from the eye that the upper part of the coloured circle was just
seen past the edge, the lower part and               the sides were seen to pro
ject some distance beyond it.
    " About     11.5 a.m. the haze      began to collect into clouds,       and the
phenomenon         ended    at 11.20.      As the day advanced, clouds con
tinued to form,         and   rain began      to  descend     at 2 p.m.    Towards
evening it became very wet, and it continued to rain every day for
more than a week."

     Description.                — Allowing for                    the     anterior part of the head, which
is deficient, the entire length of the specimen to the extreme                                                       point
of the upper lobe of the caudal fin would be about 5| inches                                                         ;   the
greatest depth of the body in front of the dorsal                                                    fin is    li    inch.
The       distance               from the origin of the pectoral                              fin    to that of the
ventral is             a   little over            1   inch, to opposite the commencement                            of the
 dorsal      l\        inch, to opposite that of the anal                                li inch,    and to opposite
 that of          the lower lobe of the caudal nearly 3 inches.                                         The general
 form of the fish is thus remarkably short,                                             deep, and ovoid, and              its
 general appearance does not indicate that its peculiar form is due to
 post mortem distortion or change.
       Nothing can be said regarding the osteology                                          of the head, which is
 hopelessly crushed, and its anterior part cut off by the edge of the
 stone.          The scales                are    of moderate size, and ornamented                        externally,
 like     those            of    E.        striolatus, with                   delicate    punctures and oblique
 furrows, the latter mostly observable                                           towards the anterior margins.
 The paired fins are small, the pectorals                                               only equalling        J inch in
 length, the ventrals being                               a   little shorter        ;    the median      fins, on the
 other hand, are very largely developed.                                                The dorsal     and anal fins
 contain about                    35       rays       each, as nearly as can be ascertained.                             The
 former fin is the larger, and is very high and acuminate                                                in front, the
 length of its longest ray being 1£ inch, while its base equals 1 inch in
 extent.  -The anal fin commences opposite the posterior third of the
 dorsal      ;    it   is not so acutely                      pointed, for while the length of its base
 is,    as       in        the    dorsal,             1    inch,          that    of its longest        rays    is       the
 same    ;       its posterior              margin            is   also   a   little more concave.            The prin
 cipal rays of these two fins have their transverse joints rather longer
 than they are broad.                             As       usual, they begin to dichotomise towards
 their       extremities               ;    this process,                  however,        occurs     proportionally
 sooner in the shorter                           rays behind.                 The caudal      is    very powerful          ;

inequilobate.                  The anterior rays of the lower lobe have, for                           a con
siderable extent of their length, their transverse articulations                                         more
distant than those of its other rays and of the whole upper lobe, in
which           the      joints    are very short.
      Remarks. —This                 species     closely resembles               E. striolatus,        but      is
distinguishable                 from   it by    the very short and deep form                  of the    body,
and the more largely developed median fins, of which the dorsal                                                 is
especially striking,                 from its great            size.    Although            fully   aware       of
the danger, in dealing with Palaeozoic fishes, of defining or founding
species upon proportional                      measurements,           yet, seeing that, as already
observed, there seems to be no evidence that the present specimen
has            undergone           any      material     change        of   form       by post        mortem
processes,            I      have, after due consideration, thought                    it   best to bestow
upon it          a    new specific designation.

      I   have not seen the original                    type of this species, figured by Dr
Hibbert in his celebrated memoir                          on the Burdiehouse limestone, and
stated by Agassiz to be                      in the collection of the Royal Society                          of
Edinburgh.                    This   may,      indeed, have            been     a    mistake, and           the
specimen may possibly have been in the private collection                                              of Dr
Hibbert, now                      unfortunately        dispersed.           From Hibbert's             figure,
however, and the very brief notice of this species in the "Poissons
Fossiles,"               I   feel pretty confident             in referring to it            a number of
mostly fragmentary remains of                          a large   Palaeoniscoid fish from Burdie
house contained in the Edinburgh Museum of Science and Art.
   The only entire specimen                      I have        seen is 11£ inches           in length. It
is,   most unfortunately,                   crushed on its back.                It   displays, however,
the right pectoral and ventral fins.                             The former has its principal
rays articulated throughout                     ;   the ventral        is   of moderate size.             The
median              fins are       large.     The dorsal         is    not shown in any of                  the
specimens belonging to the Edinburgh Museum, but in                                          Dr     Hibbert's
figure         it   is   seen to resemble the anal, and                is   evidently placed nearly

 opposite the interval between that fin and the ventrals, although the
latter are not shown in the                   figure.        The anal            is,    however, well
shown in one specimen           ;   it   is   large, triangular, and                   acuminate,       and
is   closely followed by the caudal, which                      is   very powerful.                The fin
rays     are externally       ganoid        and     finely striated          ;     their transverse
articulations are very close            ;   the fulcra       are closely           set, and minute
for the size of the fish.           The scales of the body are proportionally
small.      Those of the front part of the body are apparently nearly
equilateral, but posteriorly, and more especially                            towards the ventral
margin, their form         is   low and narrow.               Their anterior             covered area
is    very narrow   ;    the posterior margin                is   very finely denticulated.
The     exposed    area    is   covered        with     a   delicate        yet sharply-defined
ornamentation, consisting of fine sub-parallel ridges which pass from
before backwards across the scale in                        a   gently sigmoid direction,
tending to become intermixed with punctures posteriorly, especially
above the diagonal between                    the     two acute            angles       of the scale.
Towards the tail the ridges become less marked on the posterior part
of the    scale, giving way to the            thickly dotted punctures, till,                       on the
caudal body-prolongation, the former, after lingering at the anterior
margin, altogether disappear,               and punctures alone remain.
     Very little   can be made out concerning                     the      bones       of the head        ;
however, in the above mentioned entire specimen the lower jaw                                             is
seen to be very stout, and ornamented externally                                 with     fine, sharp,
closely set, wavy, branching,                 and anastomosing and interrupted
ridges running       in   a   longitudinal          direction.             The laniary teeth are
very strong, incurved, and smooth, with apical enamel cap                                   ;      similar
teeth are seen on the maxilla, the dental margin of which                                      is   finely
tuberculated.
     Remarks.   — The structure of            the pectoral        fin, the relative position
of the dorsal and anal fins, and the form of the latter, show clearly
                              not       " Pygopterus"             to       which
that this species        is         a                                                  genus       it   was
referred by Agassiz.          On the other hand, its affinities to Elonichthys
etriolatvs are unmistakable, though                   it    attains     a   larger size.           In this
and in some other respects          it      resembles       considerably the three large
species from the Coal-measures                of North Staffordshire, which                    I     have
recently described as Elonichthys semistriatns,                      eaudalis, and oblongun*

   Description.         — Flank           scales      about  \       inch       broad,      and usually          a
little higher, exclusive of the articular                                 spine   ;     moderately thick.
Upper margin with prominent articular spine     anterior covered                      ;
area narrow exposed surface
                    ;       brilliantly ganoid, sculptured with
oblique,        sub-parallel,          prominent             ridges,       occasionally            branching,
anastomising, and intercalated, and terminating behind in delicate
denticulations of the posterior margin; about                               7   or    8   of these ridges in
the space of         £      inch.     Under           surface    of       scale with feebly marked
keel   ;   a   narrow area along the posterior margin                             is   obliquely grooved,
the short        grooves       terminating             between         the denticulations                  of the
margin, so as to produce                        a     pectinated appearance.                      Scales    from
apparently the ventral aspect are lower than broad, and with more
produced anterior-superior angles                       ;    others,      from their more regularly
rhomboidal           shape,         and     scanty       development               or     absence      of      the
articular spine, and more prominent keel of the attached surface,
were probably situated more towards the caudal extremity.                                                  In all
cases      the external sculpture                is    similar, and the under surface dis
plays the         same       peculiar pectinated appearance                               at the     posterior
margin.
  Associated with these scales there                            is   on   a   specimen from Carluke
in the collection of              Mr Grossart, of Salsburgh,                       a    small fragment of
the edge of what must have                            been   a   pretty large jaw.                 This frag
ment    is     nearly   1
                        \     inch in length, and displays the stumps of                               5    stout
conical teeth, with traces of smaller ones external to them                                                ;   the
external surface of the bone                     is   beautifully tuberculated.
   Remarks. — Though                 as    yet  I     only know this species from detached
and dislocated scales, often occurring together in masses, and, from
the small        jaw fragment described                     above, there          can be no doubt as
to its distinctness and               novelty as         a   species.         In external            sculpture
these      scales    bear     a     considerable resemblance                      to those    of    Aerolepu
RanMnei (Qyrolepis                    Rankinei,          Ag.), with which,                   on    superficial
examination, they might perhaps                         be    confounded, but from the latter
they may be at once distinguished by the narrowness of the anterior
covered        marginal area, and the grooved pectination of the posterior
margin of the internal aspect.  Of course, until further information
regarding its fins and head be obtained there must be some uncer

large, variously ornamented                     or nearly smooth,             their posterior margins
serrated.              Caudal body prolongation                        slender.     Dorsal      fin placed
rather far back, commencing only very slightly in front of the anal                                                    ;
the principal rays of the pectoral unarticulated                                    till towards their
terminations.                Suspensorium very oblique                     ; gape       very   wide         ;   jaws
armed with              a   row of incurved conical laniaries, outside which there
is   a series          of smaller     teeth.
     I propose          to institute the gonus Rhadinichthys (paoivus, slender, and
l\6vs) for the Pahennisais ornatissimus of Agassiz, and a number of
other species from carboniferous rocks, many of which have hitherto
been undescribed.                    These fishes differ markedly from Palmonkcus
in the structure of                the pectoral and           in    the position cf the dorsal fin,
in    these        respects        approaching           Pygopterus,          from which they are,
however, distinguished                      by their       scales being           proportionally larger
and thicker, the anal                   n not being prolonged backwards in                          a   fringo-
like manner, and the caudal body prolongation being much less
powerful.  Kone of the species of Rhadinichthys attain large dimen
sions    ;       most of them are, indeed,                 fishes of very small size.
     This        genus      is,   so far as    is   yet known, confined to the carboni
ferous formation, and                  is   abundantly represented                 in rocks of that              age
in Great Britain.                    Judging from                the    figures    given, Palaioniscus
Cairnsii of Jackson,                  and some of the other small Pakeoniscidae                                 from

tu PAadinichthys,                  as   is possibly also the case with his Palceoniscus
Alhertii, though               I   regret that          I   have not seen any specimens of the
latter sufficiently perfect to enable me to come to a definite conclu
sion     as to      whether or not it may belong to still another genus —
most certainly, however, it is not a                              " Palceoniscits" in the               sense in
which that term ought now to be restricted.

     "   Paleeon incus" ornatissimus was described                                 by Agassiz from three
specimens,           all of which                 are figured          in    the    "Poissons         Fossiles."
Two of these from Burdiehouse are in the collection of the Royal
Society of Edinburgh                     ;   they are in           a   very bad        state of preserva
tion, nevertheless                 enough          is   seen of their              structure to convince
me that they belong to two different species.                                        The original of                 fig.
5,     tab.    10a       ("   Atlas," vol. ii.), seems to me to be only                          a   peculiarly
crushed        specimen of Elonichthys Robisoni.                               The other, represented
in     fig.    6,   is   of larger dimensions, and though the fins are very
imperfectly shown, yet, from the general                                      form of the body,                  and
from the sculpture of the scales and cranial bones,                                   I    have no hesita
tion in identifying with                     it
                                              a    number of specimens of                  a   fish, which            is
not uncommon in the rocks                           of the calciferous sandstone                        series        of
the      neighbourhood                  of Edinburgh.              The specimen represented                           in
fig.     7   of the same plate of Agassiz's work does not seem to me to
belong to the same species, and, unfortunately, there                                          seems       now        to
be     little hope of tracing the original to its present                                  possessor, as              it
belonged to the late                      Mr Jamieson Torrie,                      whose   collection was,
after his death many years ago, sold by public auction and dispersed.
As type of " ornatissimus"                          we are therefore justified                 in   taking        the
original of fig.          6    of the plate referred to.
      Deter ijd ion. — The length of the type specimen, which                                         is   so   bent
round that the tip of the tail nearly touches the snout,                                         is   5    inches      ;
doubtless,          its original length was greater, previous to the strange
contortion which                   has    thus affected its form.                     It   is,   nevertheless,
small,        the    most      perfect        specimen            in   the    Hugh     Miller Collection

attaining a length of          8 inches,        while another, unfortunately wanting
tne head, would probably have measured no less than 10 inches had
it   been entire.        The head           seems        rather large, and would probably
be    contained        about    \       in the total          ;     the       greatest    depth of            the
body     is at the shoulder, whence                       it gradually             tapers       to the tail
pedicle, which is rather narrow.                         The suspensorium                is very oblique,
the gape extensive         ;   the lower jaw is               of   a    tapering form.               Traces       of
sharp conical teeth are seen in many specimens,                                    and are,          as    usual,
arranged in two sets — internal larger and external                                       smaller.            The
operculum        is large and oblong, with                          acute       anterior-superior and
posterior-inferior angles           ;   the interoperculum is of the usual quadrate
shape.      A    specimen       from AVardie,              obliquely            compressed           upon        its
back, shows on the right side                   a   beautiful series of 15 branchiostegal
rays, along with the anterior                  7    of those of the other side, besides
which      there       is a small median                 lozenge-shaped             plate behind                 the
symphysis of the jaw, the anterior plate of each lateral series being
also much brcader than the others.                                All    the bones       of    the head are
finely and closely striated.
     The scales are rather large                    on    the       front of the              flank.        In     a
Burdiehouse            specimen, which              probably            measured         originally about
 10 inches       in length,             one    of    these         scales       measures         |     inch       in
height by        -fa   in breadth       ;     they get much smaller posteriorly, and
those     situated on the               belly are rather low and                         narrow.            Their
external ornament consists of sharp yet delicate slightly sigmoidally
curved      ridges,       mostly        parallel         with           the    superior and               inferior
 margins.        In    the furrows between                these, numerous punctures may
 be observed,         and very often about the centre of the scale the ridges
 are over   a   small space nearly obsolete, so that the punctures come
 more     prominently          into view.            Proceeding                towards the tail, the
 ridges become less and less prominent, especially in the middle of
 the scale,     so   that the ornament ultimately appears to consist only of
 short furrows and punctures, which                           are most           marked towards the
 anterior and posterior margins.                      The posterior margin of the scale
is     finely denticulated       ;       the    keel      of the under surface                       is    feebly
 marked in the scales of the front of the body, but posteriorly
it   becomes more apparent.
      The paired fins are rather small, the pectoral attaining only about
 one-half the length of the head.                        It       consists      of about 30 rays, of

434                   Proceedings          of the Royal Society
 which     the   principal ones are, as in Pygopterm                  and     Oxygnatfou,
 uuarticulated      till towards their terminations.               The ventrals       are not
 well exhibited in any of the specimens, though in two                      cases portions
of them      are seen    ;  they seem to have been small, with delicate                  rays,
 whose transverse          articulations     are rather distant.         The dorsal       and
anal fins are moderate, the former being placed far back, and arising
only slightly in front of the anal.                Both are acuminate, triangular,
with considerable          concave posterior margins.              The base of the        anal
is slightly more extended than that of the dorsal, and a well-marked
interval occurs        between       its termination and the commencement                   of
 the   caudal.      It  is not possible to ascertain the number of rays in
 those   fins.    They are rather delicate,               and with      their     transverse
joints about twice            as long as       broad— at     least, in the longer rays
 before bifurcation.          When       the rays    are  in situ their       articulations
appear     proportionally still        more distant, owing to the usual imbrica
 tion of the demi-rays.             The anterior rays of the lower lobe of                 the
caudal are stouter than those of the rest of the fin, and have their
transverse     articulations closer, the joints appearing nearly square                      as
seen from the outside;            as the lower lobe passes into the upper                  one
the rays become more delicate,               and their articulations more distant.
The outer surfaces of the rays of the pectoral are nowhere                          seen, but
in the other fins the rays are ganoid externally, and mostly smooth,
though showing here and there, especially towards their proximal
extremities, traces of longitudinal              striation.     The fulcra       are small,
though very distinctly           visible under an ordinary lens.
    Geological Position and Localities.             — The     specimens     which      I have
included under the foregoing description are all from the Calciferous
Sandstone       series of      Midlothian, in which          the species seems to be
widely distributed, though not very abundant as regards number of
specimens.        It  occurs in the Wardie shales,             at Wardie (Museum of
Science and Art and collection of the author)                    ; near Slateford (col
lection of the Geological Survey of Scotland)                    ;  near  Juniper       Green
(Mr John Henderson)               ;   in  the   horizon of the Burdiehouse lime
stone, at Burdiehouse            and at South Queensferry.                Its   occurrence
in strata of similar         age in Fifeshire       is   extremely probable, though
the specimen from Burntisland,                figured as Paiceoniscus        ornatissinms
by Agassiz, seems now to be unfortunately lost.

  Of  this new species there is one tolerably entire example from
'Wardie in the Hugh Miller Collection in the Edinburgh Museum
of Science and Art.                A short     time ago also the Museum acquired                       a
fragment of      the head and anterior part of the body, collected by                          Mr C.
W.    Peach, and quite recently another fragment,                         a   portion of the body,
was     presented     by    Mr David Grieve.                In     the following          description
these    specimens        will   be referred to as Nos. 1, 2, and 3 respectively.
   Description.      —The          specimen        in the Hugh           Miller Collection           has
undergone       a   twist about the middle of the body, and shows, more
over, only       a portion            of the caudal fin, so that it is difficult                       to
estimate      its original         length.      As it       is,   it   measures       J5    inches     in
length, but     it   is   quite evident that when alive                       it   must have been
considerably        longer.
     The    head equals          1J   inch in length, and shows superiorly                     a     cast
of the      greater part of the inner surface of the cranial buckler, with
the lines of        demarcation          between      the     parietal, frontal, squamosal,
and    post-frontal bones.              The opercular bones are not seen, but                          a
portion of the maxilla, and                   the greater part of the mandible are
exhibited, the latter bearing                 sharp conical teeth              of different sizes,
those externally placed being very small, while                                one large      laniary,
    inch in length,           is
                      conspicuous. In specimen                                 No.    2   the impres
sions      are seen of the parietal, squamosal,                        opercular,     praeopercular,
post-temporal, and supra-clavicular bones, and of the posterior part
of the maxilla,        these impressions clearly showing that the external
sculpture of the bones in question was of                         a    highly ornate        character,
 consisting of sharply             defined,    flexuous, branching, anastomising,                    and
interrupted         ridges, tending to pass into tubercles                     at the inner margin
 of   each parietal.
      The    scales are of moderate                size on the flanks,              becoming rather
 small      posteriorly, while on the belly                       they are low and narrow.
 Over the whole body their outer                       surfaces          are highly ornate,           the
 ornamentation         consisting of fine sharply defined                          ridges, forming      a
 pattern which         is   usually, as       it   were, divided          by   a   diagonal passing
 from      the anterior-superior to the posterior-inferior angle of the scale.
 On the anterior-inferior half of the scale the ridges run parallel with
 the anterior and inferior margins, impinging posteriorly on the
 diagonal,     while on the poste rior-superior half they pass obliquely
 downwards           and    backwards,          mostly       parallel         with    the    diagonal,

  ending in the domicuiations of the posterior margin                                ;    in many          cases
 they are interrupted before reaching that margin, and are                                           replaced
 by other shorter ones springing up between                             them.        In        some       cases,
 also,       a few of the ridges            of the upper half,                 near the              anterior-
 superior angle of the scale, likewise                        impinge upon the                      diagonal,
 consequently meeting those of the lower half at acute angles.
      The pectoral fin is well displayed in specimen                           No.       1,    in   which it
 measures rather more than              1    inch in length.              It    is of considerable
 expanse,       and consists of at least 30 rays,              of which the stronger ones,
 the first 15 counting from the lateral margin, are unarticulated till
 towards their terminations, where bifurcation sets in.                                       The ventrals
 are not shown.           Portion of the dorsal is seen in No.                           1,    in which it
 seems to arise opposite             the anterior part of the anal, and its                              entire
contour is exhibited in No.             3.     It    is triangular and acuminate,                          very
high in front       ;   its rays, which cannot be counted,                        are rather deli
cate, and        their transverse        articulations          considerably                  distant.       In
No.      1   the anal is seen to be of large size, and                  of   the same triangular
acuminate        form   as the dorsal.         Its       base is             inch in extent,               and
its longer anterior rays seem to have exceeded                                 that measurement,
though they are cut off at the apex                  ;   the fin    is,   moreover,             badly      pre
served, and its anterior margin somewhat                       distorted and injured.                        In
the same specimen          the origin of the lower lobe of the caudal                                 is   also
shown, consisting of exceedingly closely set deeply imbricating                                           rays,
of which     I   count at least 40 up to where they begin to pass into                                   those
of the upper lobe, but here the tail                     is   unfortunately              truncated           by
the edge of the nodule.                Interspinous bones of great strength                                 are
seen supporting this part of the caudal fin.
     Remarks. — This        is   a    most    distinctly-marked                species,             differing
obviously from R. ornatissimus in the proportions and sculpture of
the scales, and in the large size of the fins.                     I         know of no other
species      with which    it    can at all be confounded.                       The first time            I
saw the most perfect of the three specimens                         described            above,     I      was
struck with the general              resemblance         which     it   bore     to the Permian
genus Pygopterus, but the larger proportional                           size   of the          scales, and
the anal fin not being prolonged                backwards, indicate that its                             place
is   in Ehadinichthys.

    I am     indebted to Dr Paterson, of Leith, and to                            Mr   R. Etheridge,
jun., for     the loan       of two      specimens         of    a    small Rhudinichthys from
Grange Quarry, Burntisland, which                              appears     to    belong to a new
species.          With      these   I   can identify           a detached       tail recently found
by myself in the             same locality.
    Description. — The length of Dr Paterson's                           specimen is 31 inches,
allowing for the extremity of the suoiit, which is deficient.                                           The
depth of the body, midway between the head and the dorsal                                           fin, is
      inch   ; that of the tail pedicle at the commencement of the lower
lobe   of the         caudal is -JT inch.           It   is, however, just possible that                the
anterior part of the fish may be                     a   little shortened up by one of                  the
common forms of distortion,                   as, on the        other hand, the whole shape
of the other          specimen belonging to              Mr Etheridge certainly            is   unnatur
ally attenuated by similar cause. Nevertheless, we have before us
                              a
a small fish of fusiform shape, elegantly tapering posteriorly to very
                        a                                                                           a
narrow tail pedicle, the dorsal                and anal fins being nearly opposite each
other, and        a   well-marked interval occurring between the latter and the
commencement of the caudal, which                          is   rather small and of         a   delicate
appearance.             Nothing      can      be    said       regarding the head,             which     is
hopelessly          crushed.        The scales           are     of   medium       size,    becoming
rapidly smaller posteriorly. Those of the anterior part of the body
have their outer surfaces entirely covered by     delicate sculpture        a
consisting of fine furrows and ridges passing across the scale, and
ending in the denticulations of the posterior margin, those of the
upper and posterior part of the area being more oblique than those
of the lower and anterior. On the posterior part of the fish the
scales are seen only from their inner                            or attached       surfaces.            The
origin of         the pectoral fin       is   seen   in    the second specimen             referred to,
but    it    is    in very     bad      preservation.            Returning to          Dr Paterson        's
specimen,         a   few rays of the ventral are seen, but the real size and
shape       of the fin        are not shown.               The dorsal and anal fins are
moderate,          and of the same                 form, triangular,            concavely cut out
behind, with delicate               rays, whose transverse               joints   are considerably
longer       than       they are broad.              The dorsal commences                   only very
slightly in front of the origin of the                         anal, and an interval, equal to
§   the length of           the base of the anal, occurs                  between its posterior
termination and             the commencement               of   tno lower lobe of the caudal.

The last-named fin is unusually delicate in appearance, the                                    upper
lobe only very slightly exceeding             the lower in length, with a slender
body prolongation.          In    the lower lobe the transverse                      joints of      the
principal    rays are longer than they are broad, except just towards
their terminations.
  Remarks. — In the contour at least of the hinder part of the body
this species strongly resembles R. carinatw, save that the caudal                                   fin
is more delicate    — the     greater apparent            depth of the body in front of
the dorsal fin may be, as already indicated, perhaps accounted                                      for
by post mortem distortion.             The sculpture of the scales, which                            is
very different from what we find in R. carinatus, reminds                                us of R.
ornatisximus, from which, however, the present                             species is obviously
distinguished by the greater delicacy of the rays of the lower                                lobe of
the caudal, with their more distant transverse                            articulations,      as   well
as the   entire aspect of the fin.             It       is,   however,      very possible that
the    imperfect specimen         from Burntisland                   referred    by Agassiz          to
"Palceoniscus" ornatimimus(PoiaBon'a "Fossiles Atlas," vol. ii.pl. 10a,
fig. 7), and in which the tail deficient, may belong to R. leptunu,
                                         is
but his figure being by no means good,                    it    is   impossible to decide,           in
the absence of the original specimen.

                   Rhadinichthys       Geikici,      sp. nov.         Traquair.
  Through the kindness of Professors Ramsay and Geikie                                     I       have
enjoyed the opportunity of examining                     a    number of small           specimens
of FakconiscidsB      collected     by   the Geological Survey from the horizon
of the Wardie        shales    near    Eedhall, among which there                       is   at least
one beautiful      little species of Rliadinichthys
                                                 hitherto] undeseribed.
This  I     have   much pleasure in dedicating to Professor Geikie, to
whom     I   am much indebted for cordial assistance                            in     prosecuting
the study of Scottish Palaeozoic              ichthyology.
  Description. — The          specimens       are rather fragmentary, except two
in which the entire fish       is   shown.         Of    these the larger has undergone
an unfortunate twist, but its length may be estimated                             at    Z\   inches   ;
the other, measuring only             2J   inches,       seems to me to be             a     younger
example      of the same species.              The body              is   fusiform,      the head

                         of Edinburgh, Session 1870-77.                                     439
 rather     large,   being contained about                 4   times    in the total.       The
 cranial    bones are beautifully           ornamented         with delicate wavy ridges,
 running mostly in            a  longitudinal         direction.       The jaws are armed
 with   sharp conical teeth of different sizes.                    The scales are of mode
 rate   size, gradually        diminishing         posteriorly,       though those on the
 flanks   are not of specially large dimensions.                      The flank scales are
 nearly equilateral in          shape  ;   the free surface of each is ornamented
 with   5 or 6 pretty well-marked               oblique ridges, running downwards
 and backwards, and terminating in the denticulations of the pos
 terior margin.         Below there are a few more delicate striae parallel
 with the lower margin.              Along      the back, between           the head and the
 dorsal fin,     the scales are smaller,           and   the ornamentation takes            the
form of a        few sharply-marked            stria:    passing      diagonally across the
 scale between        the    two acute angles.               Posteriorly,      as   the  scales
become smaller, the ridges are fewer, and the ornamentation becomes
more and more feebly marked,                  till  on the tail pedicle the scales are
nearly     smooth,     and     entirely so on          the    caudal    body prolongation,
which     is delicate.       Some amount of individual                  variation occurs in
the   scales of different specimens,               which      I  see   no good      reason   for
referring      to   different      species.         In two        fragments      representing
portions of rather        larger fishes than the rest, the scales                of  the back,
between       the head      and     the dorsal fin, are rather smoother,                 while
those of the flank show a greater number of ridges and denticula
tions of     the   hinder      margin    ;   on    the other hand, in the smallest
specimen of the series, the ridging on the dorsal                        scales is very well
marked, and rather feeble in those of the flanks.
    The   pectoral    fin is shown in one specimen, but not well, being                        a
little obscured by a thin film of the matrix ; the ventralsare visible
in none. The dorsal and anal fins are situated nearly opposite each
other,   the anal commencing only a little                    further back.       The entire
contour of      these    fins is not clearly exhibited, but their rays are
smooth, delicate, and slender, with distant transverse                          articulations.
The   caudal is inequilobate, its rays are likewise delicate and smooth,
and with distant articulations;                   the    caudal      body prolongation        is
slender.
    Remarks.    — In its     general proportions           II. Qfikici     is not so slender
as most species of the genus, and there                      is not the usual         interval
between the anal and caudal fins                ;   in these respects it agrees with

     Description.   — The length of        the most perfect          specimen        in my
collection     is 3A inches     ;    the extremity of the caudal fin is                 not,
however,       preserved.      Another specimen, more                badly    preserved
posteriorly, must have been a little longer, judging from the                        size of
the head and body.          The head is elegantly shaped, with bluntly
pointed muzzle.         The opercular      bones   are rather small ; the jaws
pretty stout    ;   the dentition is not visible.           The bones of the cranial
roof are sculptured, with contorted and rather flattened ruga;                       ; those
of the face are ornamented with sharp and closely set wavy                           ridges,
which, on the operculum, pass obliquely downwards and backwards
over its surface.        The   scales are of moderate,            indeed, rather small
size, and though, of course,          diminishing gradually towards              the tail,
those in the flanks are not marked               by any very special excess                  in
size.    The    flank scales are nearly equilateral          ;    the posterior margin
of   each shows 5 or 6 prominent            oblique   denticulations         ; the     outer
surface shows a few feebly marked, nearly obsolete                        ridges,      pass
ing obliquely        backwards       and a little downwards,            and not         very
regularly placed.        Immediately       behind the clavicle, and above                 the
origin of the pectoral tin, the sculpture             is,   however, more strongly

posteriorly the scales soon become nearly quite smooth.                      The     paired
lins are rather small, the principal rays of the pectoral are                        clearly
seen to be unarticulated            till towards their terminations          ;   the    ven-
trals are situated midway between the pectorals and the origin                               of
the anal, their rays are delicate, and their transverse joints                       appear
at least three times as long as broad.             The dorsal and anal fins               are
large, and situated nearly opposite each other, the former                       commen

have      the    same form, being high and                acuminate in front, and con-
cavely cut out behind; their                rays are rather coarser              than those of
the ventrals, and their             transverse     joints   are considerably longer than
broad.         In no    case is the caudal fin well preserved,                   its rays being
more or       less disjointed and broken up, but                 it  is clear     that the pro
longation of the body in the upper                  lobe was delicate, the rays slender,
and with distant articulations.
    Remarks.       — As       already     indicated,        this     species       agrees     with
It. Geikiei in           the    general   form       of the     body,       and,     along with
it, differs from all          the other species of the genus with which                      I  am
acquainted in the closer approximation of the anal fin to the caudal                                ;
 in both,       also, the     flank    scales    are comparatively small.                 But   the
 action of the scale sculpture                is essentially      different.        In R.   brevis
 such    ridges as are seen on the flank scales have not the same short,
 sharp,      straight, and         parallel    character which           distinguishes       those
 which in R. Geikiei             pass to the denticulations            of the posterior mar
 gin   ;  the rugae ornamenting the cranial roof bones                       are also coarser,
 more flattened,         and less capable of being described                  as

     The    form of the body is slender,                the length of the             head being
 contained about 4f times in the total up to the bifurcation of the
 caudal fin, and equalling the greatest depth of the body at the origin
  of the ventral           fins.     The    head      is very elegantly shaped,             rather
  depressed        above,     but pointed         when seen in profile.                The bones

jaws remarkably slender and delicate                                     ;   the external ornament of            the
 facial bones consists, like that of the cranial shield, of delicate                                           wavy
 ridges.          No    specimen           I       have       as       yet   seen   affords,     however,        the
smallest trace of teeth.                           The paired fins are rather small.                            The
 pectoral         is in no case well preserved, but there is sufficient evidence
that its longer rays were not articulated till towards their                                              termina
tions.           The ventrals are             st   ill   smaller,       and are equidistant in position
between           the pectorals           and the commencement                         of the anal.             The
median fins are, on the contrary, rather large in proportion                                                to the
size of the fish.              The anal commences                            rather in front of           a point
equidistant between the origin of the ventrals and that of the                                              lower
lobe     of the caudal           ;   it is high and acuminate in front, and                                 pretty
deeply cut out behind                 ;    the length of its base is equal to that of                            its
longest rays.            The dorsal                is similar in shape to the anal, and com
mences only slightly in front                            of   the origin of the latter.              The caudal
is pretty large, and                 deeply cleft, the body prolongation along                                   the
upper lobe being, however,                          comparatively delicate.                    The rays of all
these        fins      are     slender,            ganoid,         and smooth          externally;             their
articulations tolerably distant                          ;    the fulcra on their anterior margins
obvious, though minute.
     The scales are remarkable for their large size on the flanks, while
on     the       belly they suddenly became                              very low and narrow               ; they
diminish          rapidly       in size posteriorly, and on the                           tail pedicle           are
rather small.                Externally            they are brilliantly polished and                       nearly
smooth       ;   on the flank scales, however,                           a   few shallow furrows           extend
a little way forwards from the posterior margin, which                                            is,   as usual,
sharply denticulated.
     Remarks. — The original specimen,                                  collected    by Lord Greenock
at Wardie, and figured                    by Agassiz,              is   in the collection of the Eoyal
Society of Edinburgh.                      It      is    very imperfect, showing no fins                       save
the mere origins of the anal and caudal,                                     the former   of which          seems

Andrews,         and which, according to                     Mr Walker,           he characterised              as
closely allied to Pulttonixciu, but differing from it " in wanting the
scaling    or false rays           along the anterior ray of the fins, and also in
the dorsal fin being                opposite        the      anal."*         In this         specimen         the
dorsal     is,   indeed, nearly opposite                 the anal (as in others of the same

posterior margins of the scales are denticulated, their external sur
 faces nearly smooth along the sides of the body and on the tail
 pedicle, but along the back, especially between                                  the dorsal fin and
 the head, they are marked by                     a   few rather prominent oblique ridges                        ;

 The pectoral fin             is   small    ;   the non-articulation              of its stouter rays

     This  paper contains an account       of the cranial structure of Rhizo
 dopsis as far as this can be elucidated by an examination of a suite
 of specimens      from the Coal Measures        of Fenton,   Staffordshire,     in
 the collection of    Mr Ward of Longton,         supplemented    by additional
 specimens    from   various other localities.
     The cranial shield of Rhizodopsis resembles in general form                and
 structure that of the Saurodipterini, though the surface of the             bone
 is elaborately sculptured instead of presenting the smooth glistening
 aspect characteristic of the external plates and scales of the last
 named group.        The posterior part of the shield is composed of two
 elongated    parietals, and having on its outer margin two smaller
 plates, anterior and posterior, which        may' be considered as the post-
frontal and squamosal respectively.          The anterior or fronto-ethmoidal

portion forms          the depressed rounded snout, the front margin of which
above the mouth, is formed by two small dentigerous pfamaxillary
bones entirely differing in form from the bones described                                 as such       by
Messrs Hancock and Atthey.                     The gape is wide, the hyomandibular
bone being slightly inclined                   backwards              ; there    is apparently          no
symplectic.           The form of the maxilla is well known                         ;   the structure
of the mandible is exceedingly complex.                                  Its dentary      element        is
found to correspond with the bone interpreted by Messrs Hancock
and Atthey as " prwmaxilla," but turned in a contrary direction,
i.e.,with its toothed margin upwards instead of downwards                                               as
supposed by them; it bears the anterior laniary tooth and                                              the
outer row of small            teeth.      The laniaries posterior to the front one
are borne on separate internal dentary ossicles, the presence of which
is clearly proved by              a   portion of        a    jaw of        a    large   specimen        of
Rhizodopsis in the Edinburgh Museum.                               The external aspect of the
lower jaw is completed by at least two infra-dentary plates situated
below the inferior margin of the dentary, behind which there is
another covering externally               the articular and angular region of                          the
jaw, and which           is probably       the equivalent               of the angular of other
ganoids.         On the internal aspect of the mandible there                                is,   besides
the internal           dentary        or laniary    ossicles,         a    well-marked         splenial.
The orbit        is   very anteriorly placed        ;       as   in Megidichthys, three plates
cover the       cheek behind           the suborbitals, corresponding to the single
large one in Osteolepis. The author does not find Professor Young's
statements that the jugular plates of Rhizodopsis are " in two pairs,
                                              " no trace of median or
principal and posterior," and that there                           is
of lateral plates," corroborated by the specimens under examination.
On the other hand,                he finds one      pair of             large   principal jugulars
with at    least four lateral ones on each side, as well as very distinct
evidence of the presence of               a   median plate behind the symphysis of
the jaw.         The shoulder girdle               is   provided           with well-developed
infraclavicular         plates.
     The lower jaw of Rhizodus Hibberti                          is   found to have essentially
the same structure            as      that of Rhizodopsis.                The dentary element
is   of the     same form, and bears the                anterior large laniary tooth and
the outer       range    of small       teeth, the posterior laniaries being borne
on separate ossicles, which are sometimes found entirely detached.

    Principal Sir Alexander Grant, Bart., one of the Vice-Pre
sidents of the Society, read the following Opening Address                         : —
    Gentlemen,     — I find it recorded* that in     the year 1662, which was
the first year of the incorporation of the Royal Society of London,
the celebrated      mathematician,    Robert Hooke, drew up           " Proposals
for the good of the Royal Society," the third article of which was                   as
follows       "
          : — That every       member     of the    Society shall be equally
obliged to promote the ends thereof by paying 52s. yearly, and by
doing some one duty that shall be charged on him by the Council
 once a year, or,    if his  occasions   will not permit,      to pay 52s. more
 per   annum."      This  proposed    salutary rule does not seem ever to
 have been enacted by the Royal Society of London, nor do                  I believe
that any analogous article forms part of the statutes of this Society,
 and yet it is in accordance with the spirit of such a rule that                      I
appear before you this evening.
     When    the Council of this Society requested          me, only four weeks
 ago, to open the ensuing session by addressing           you,  I at once, though
            imprudently, resolved      to obey them,      and to do
                                                                         " the    one
 perhaps
 duty charged      upon   me by the     Council."      But in    the meantime         I
 have become more and more conscious            of the fact, that probably no
 length of preparation      would have enabled me to offer you an            address
 worthy of this occasion and of my predecessors in this chair, and that
 it would    be a simple impossibility     to accomplish this within           a few
 weeks at a period of the year when the distractions are so manifold
 that   I can scarcely get a clear morning, not to speak of a clear day.
 I  must therefore ask you to accept for the nonce some discourse                  on
 matters which are a very old story now.               I  know that the Royal
 Society is like those Athenians of whom         it was   said that they "spent
 their time in nothing else, but either to tell or to hear              some new
 thing."     Therefore, an idea to be suitable for the Royal                 Society
 ought to be brand new.          But  I shelter myself     under the     reflection,
 that the topic which has suggested itself to my mind for this              evening
 is one which might perhaps always claim a certain welcome in this
  room.     For  I thought   of whiling away the opening half-hour of             our
    * In Weld's History

                        of Edinburgh, Session 1877-78.                                    473
new session with some remarks upon our connection                        with him whom
I   cannot but regard as our lineal progenitor and virtual founder,
Francis Bacon of Verulam.              In   the Harveian Society,          I   believe that
there is an annual eulogy of the great discoverer of the circulation of
the blood ; and how often in medical societies has the opening address
been given up to a panegyric of Hippocrates, the ancient father of
medicine i        In   societies like this, whose main function is the promo
tion of experimental research, it can never be out of place to do
honour to Lord Bacon, the august herald and prophet of modern
science.  I trust that you will concede me this proposition, and that
you will excuse the introduction of a trite subject on the present
occasion,       and that you will bear with me          if    I    repeat many things
which     are quite familiar to you.
   Principal Forbes, in an excellent address which he delivered in
this place fifteen years ago, traces the origin of the Royal Society of
London to the example of similar societies which sprang up in Italy
during the 16th and 17th centuries, especially the Society of Lincei,
or Lynx-eyed Ones, founded in 1604, of which Galileo was a mem
ber, and the Florentine            Academy of Experiment               (' del cimento          '),
founded in 1657.              This view   was, broadly speaking,           correct   ;   but
                                                                                           I
think that      it   ignores    too much the forces working            within England
itself.     During      the    15th and 16th centuries        there was carried out
the most important revolution (except the introduction of Christi
anity) that ever occurred among the human race — namely, the over
throw of scholasticism,          and the introduction into all departments                     of
knowledge of the modern spirit of inquiry.                   This revolution         was far
greater and more important in its consequences than the downfall of
any dynasty, or the destruction of any empire                     ;   greater    and     more
important than the Renaissance               and the Reformation which jointly
led to    it;   far greater in its scope and results than the much-vaunted
French Revolution, of which, to               the present day,        it   seems so hard
for France       to reap the fruits.        In contributing   to this greatest of all
changes,       in ushering in the new era, Italy may claim to have played
a glorious part.         But    the new spirit    pervaded        all Europe.        Men of
the new        era seemed to spring up everywhere.                Columbus in Spain,
Copernicus and Kepler in Germany, Lionardo da Vinci and Galileo
in Italy, Tycho Brahe in Denmark, Gassendi                            and Descartes            in
France, Harvey and Gilbert in England, — these                     and     many more, as

474                 Proceedings of       the  Royal Society
if inspired by     some special      impulse, had each started on a      separate
road of discovery.       They each shone like separate lights, and            their
united effulgence created the new day.             Countries,   I think,   as well
as individuals, moved independently of one another.               At all   events,
I  think that England        moved     independently of Italy in respect         of
the formation of scientific societies.          In  the eighth volume of your
"Transactions"       there   is a learned     paper contributed by Professor
Macvey Napier fifty-nine years ago, in which he collects from writers
of   the  1 7th  century, evidences of the influence exercised           by Lord
Bacon's works, and of the high esteem in which they were                     held.
Professor Napier's     case   is fully made out, and he not only establishes
the general fact that Bacon made a deep impression on his own age
and the succeeding times, but also he proves, in particular, the imme
diate and direct connection between            Lord  Bacon's writings and the
foundation     of the Royal Society.           The original founders of the
 lioyal Society     had   those    writings   continually   in their   thoughts.
Bacon's    splendid aspirations,      clothed in some ef the stateliest     prose
that the world has ever seen, had struck upon men's minds and
filled them with enthusiasm.            Bacon was not content with setting
forth his views in the abstract,           but in his New Atlantis he exhi
bited in concrete,      but imaginary, form, the benefits          which would
result,   and the state of things which would arise, when the new
philosophy had been thoroughly welcomed, and experimental                 science
had been thoroughly established           among men.       The chief feature in
Bacon's undiscovered        island of the fancy was " Solomon's House,"
in which the employments           of the Fellows are described as follows:     —
" We     have twelve that sail into foreign countries,        who bring in     the
books and patterns of experiments           of all other parts.    These we call
 Merchants of Light.         We    have three    that collect the experiments
which are in all books.         These we call Depredators.        We  have three
that collect experiments        of all mechanical     arts, and also of liberal
sciences,    and  also  of practices      which are not brought into         arts.
These we call Mystery-men.             We have three that try new         experi
ments, such     as themselves       think  good.    These we call Pioneers or
Miners.      We   have   three    that draw the experiments of the        former
four into titles and tablets, to give the better light for the drawing
of observations     and axioms out of them.          These we call Compilers.
We    have three that bind themselves         to looking into the experiments

                      of Edinburgh,      Session 1877-78.                       475
of their fellows,      and   cast about how to draw out of them things of
use and     practice for man's life and knowledge.        These we call Dowry-
men,     or Benefactors.       Then, after divers meetings      and consults of
our whole number,          to consider  of the former labours and collections,
we have three         that take care, out of them, to direct new experi
ments,     of a higher light, more penetrating into nature than the former.
These we call Lamps. We             have three others that do execute the ex
periments      so directed, and report them.         These we call Inoculators.
Lastly,     we have     three   that raise the former discoveries       by experi
ments into       greater observations,    axioms,   and aphorisms.       These we
call Interpreters of Nature."
      Kawley, Lord     Bacon's chaplain and literary executor,        says   in his
preface     to the New Atlantis, which was published in 1627, soon
after Bacon's       death  — " This fable my lord      devised, to the    end that
hee might exhibite therein a modell or description of              a college,    in
 stituted for     the interpreting    of nature, and    the producing of great
and marvellous works for           the  benefit  of men, under the name of
 '
    Solomon's House, or the College of the Six Dayes' Works.'"
      Bacon's imaginative conception,       being   so consonant    as   it was to
 the spirit of the     age,  took root and fructified in the minds of many
 of his countrymen, both those who were passing through the trying
 scenes of the civil war in England, and those who had accompanied
 Charles    II.  into his exile.     The first attempt to realize the concep
 tion   seems to have      been made about       nineteen years after Bacon's
 death, in the year 1645, by the formation in London of                a  scientific
                        "
 society called the Philosophical College," which was also called the
 " Invisible
                College." Dr Wallis, in his autobiography, speaks of this
 society as consisting of "divers worthy persons, inquisitive into natural
 philosophy and other parts of human learning, and particularly of what
 hath been called the New Philosophy, or Experimental Philosophy."
      Several   eminent Oxford         men   who were in London          in   1645,
 owing to the interruption           of university work caused by the civil
                                        " Invisible
 wars, became       members of the                    College;" and in 1649,
 returning     to   their Alma Mater,       they founded the Philosophical
  Society of Oxford, which used to meet in the house of Dr Wilkins,
  then Warden of Wadham College, and afterwards Bishop                of  Chester,
   or in the  apartments     of the Hon. Robert Boyle, who was then re
   siding in Oxford.

  476                 Proceedings of         the  Royal Society
     Ten    years  later, in 1659, the          accomplished      and philanthropic
  Evelyn    addressed to Robert Boyle a letter containing his pro
 posal  for   the erection of " a Philosophic-Mathematic College," which
 letter is full of Baconian inspiration.             In it  he says that,  " since we
 are not to hope for a Solomon's house             in this  sad catalysis (or dissolu
 tion of things), and inter los armorum strepitus, a period so uncharit
 able and perverse, why not might some gentlemen,                    whose   geniuses
 are greatly suitable, and who desire              nothing more than to give a
 good    example,      preserve    science,     and cultivate      themselves,     join
 together    in society, and resolve upon some orders and economy to
 be mutually observed,         such as shall best become           the end of their
 union?"       He then offers cheerfully to devote               his fortune to the
carrying out of this scheme         ;  and he proceeds to say, in the Baconian
manner     :—
               "I   propose     the purchasing of         thirty or forty    acres    of
land in some healthy place not above twenty-five miles from Lon
 don, of which a good part should be tall wood, and the rest upland
pastures     or downs,      sweetly    irrigated.      We would erect upon the
most convenient site of this, near the wood, our building,                   viz., one
handsome       pavilion, containing a refectory,         library, and withdrawing-
room ;" this is the first storey.            The second storey was to contain
"  a  fair lodging-chamber, a pallet-room (i.e. a second-class bed
room), and gallery, all of which should be well and very nobly
furnished, for any worthy              person    that might desire      to stay any
time, and for the reputation of the college."                 There were to    be   six
members of the college, each of whom was to have                     his cell and     a
private garden,
                     " somewhat       after the manner of the Carthusians."
Many details followed as to the mode of life to be pursued in this
institution, " the principal end of which was to be the
                                          "                             " promotion
of experimental knowledge."              Of   course, this dream of Evelyn's was
never carried out;       it  is only mentioned as showing the sort of ideas
which the study of Bacon had engendered                      in men's minds,      and
which finally resulted in the establishment of the Royal Society.
    A  somewhat      similar scheme was published about the same time
when Evelyn's          letter was being written, by the poet Cowley,
under the title of a Proposition          for the Advancement of Experimental
Philosophy.       This    was to be effected       by the creation of     a  Philoso
phical College, with a revenue             of £4000 a year, and a staff of          64
persons, among whom are included                 20 philosophers or professors        ;

                                                                                             —
                          of Edinburgh, Session 1877-78.                                  4  I I
10    young       scholars,      servants     to the     professors   ;    a  chaplain    ;    a
chirurgeon      ;
                   "  2  lungs, or chymical servants,"* and 4 old women to
tend the chambers.             This    college was to examine all existing theories
of nature, and to separate the true coins from those " false moneys
with which the world has been paid and cheated so long." Secondly,
it was to recover the lost inventions of the ancients.                           Thirdly, it
was to improve all arts which we now have, and discover others
which     we yet have not.
     These Baconian imaginings never                    obtained    a   literal fulfilment.
 But in the next         year,    in  1660, immediately after the restoration of
 Charles     II.,  they received a modified realisation in the establishment
 of the Royal        Society.       It  is a point of some      little interest that        the
 chief    agent    in   effecting    this result was     a Scotsman.         This   was the
 good    Sir Robert Moray, who had                accompanied     the king     in  exile, and
 who, at the Restoration, was made a Privy Councillor, and much
 consulted on affairs of State.                He was an ardent naturalist, and on
 the king's return to London               in June 1660, he appears to have joined
 the meetings of the           " Invisible College," at one of which, in Novem
 ber of the same year, the schemes                  for  a  Physico-Mathematical          Col
 lege wers discussed, and             it was resolved by      the members         present     to
 give themselves          a more definite and regular constitution, "according
  to the manner         in other      countries,    where   there were voluntary asso
 ciations of men in academies for the advancement                         of various parts
  of learning,       so they might do something answerable                    here    for the
  promoting        of experimental           philosophy."      Sir Robert Moray             was
  present at this meeting, and in his intercourse                 with the king he took
  occasion     to communicate the               proposal   to His Majesty.          At their
  next meeting, a week later, he was able to state to his friends that
  the king      " did well      approve      of their  design, and would be ready to
  give encouragement            to  it."    The members at once constituted them
  selves    the    " Royal Society," and Sir Robert                           became their
                                                                    Moray
  first president ad interim.               About    a year  and a half later, in         July
  1662,    the      Society received          its charter of incorporation.               Lord
  Brouncker, who was a discoverer in mathematics,                      — " being     the first
  to introduce continual fractions, and to give a series for the quadra
  ture of a portion of the equilateral hyperbola," — was named president
  in the Royal Charter. The king continued to take                           an interest       in
          The " lung" was so called because he blew the fire for
        *
                                                                             his master.

 478                Proceedings of the Royal Society
the    Society, and was often present at their experiments                 in   his
gardens, his parks, or on the Thames ; and he even condescended
to chide them     "on the   slowness    of their proceedings."
    In  1663   he presented    them with their mace.           The charter     and
the mace are the only substantial favours           which Charles   II.   appears
to have conferred      upon the Royal Society, and for a long               period
they worked       on,   by means      of the    genuine enthusiasm of           the
fellows, with no funds at their disposal for scientific purposes. I
think it is amusing to observe that Sir Robert Moray so far con
trived to give a Scottish character        to the Society, that their        mace
was decorated      all over with the thistle, and that St Andrew               was
chosen as their patron saint.
    As  soon as the Royal      Society was established,      its members      con
nected   it with  the name of Bacon.         Bishop Sprat, who published           a
history of the Society in 1667, writes:         — "The Royal Society         was a
work well becoming the largeness of Bacon's wit to devise, and                  the
greatness    of Clarendon's prudence        to establish."      Oldenburg,      the
first secretary of the Society, says          "
                                          :— The enrichment of        the store
house of natural philosophy was a work begun by the single care and
conduct of the excellent Lord Verulam, and now prosecuted by                    the
joint undertakings of the Royal Society." Glanvil, in his work
called Plus Ultra, or the Advancement                of Knowledge since the
                                                                                 —
days    of Aristotle, after alluding       to   the  New    Atlantis,    says :
" This   the great man desired, and formed a society of experimenters
in   a romantic model     ; but he could do no more — his time           was not
ripe for such performances.        These things, therefore, were considered
by later virtuosi, who several of them combined together, and                   set
themselves     to work    upon his grand design."            Professor Napier
quotes    several   other more obscure        authorities, to show the       same
opinion of Lord       Bacon entertained in the minds of Englishmen.
 One    Dr Power, in     1664,  in  a  work on the discoveries      of   Galileo,
Torricelli, and Pascal, calls Bacon "the patriarch of experimental
philosophy."      Another writer, of the same year, with the unfortunate
name of    Mr Havers,    says that
                                      " Lord   Bacon's  way of experiment,       as
now prosecuted       by sundry English      gentlemen,    affords  more proba
bilities of glorious and profitable fruits than the attempts of any            age
or nation whatsoever ;" and Dr Childrey entitled his work on                   the
Natural Rarities       of England, " Britannia Baconica," in            order    to

                         of Edinburgh, Session 1877-78.
indicate       its    connection       with     those     studies which       Bacon      had
originated.         Lastly,    I   may perhaps      be allowed       to quote     the well-
known        lines from the           Ode    to   the    Royal     Society,  by Cowley,
himself       one    of  the    earliest   fellows, in which, after detailing the
 futility of     the early philosophy, he says            : —
              " From these and all long errors of the way,
                    In which our wandering predecessors went,
                 And, like th' old Hebrews, many years did stray
                    In deserts but of small extent,
                 Bacon, like Moses, led us forth at last,
                 The barren wilderness he past,
                 Did on the very border stand
                 Of the blest promised land ,
                 And from the mountain-top of his exalted wit.
                 Saw it himself, and showed us it."
                                                              " epoch-making    "
      Kuno Fischer        says that Bacon was an                                    thinker,
 who put men into a new attitude towards things, and opened a new
  world of possibilities. I think that it would be more strictly true
           that Bacon was an " epoch-marking man, a herald and fugle
                                                             "

  man, created         and sent      forward by his epoch.              He   was     himself
  unconscious of that        ;   he thought of himself as a solitary worker             ; he
  fancied that he derived nothing from others.                     He mentions his own
  case as a source of encouragement,               and says:    —"  Some hope might,        I
  think,    be afforded    by my own example             ;  and   I do not say this for
  the sake of boasting,           but because it may be useful.             If any feel a
  want of confidence,           let them look at         me,    who of all my contem
  poraries have been             most    engaged      in    public affairs,   who am of
  somewhat infirm health (which of itself occasions great loss of time),
  and who in this matter have assuredly been the first explorer,
  neither following in the steps of another, nor communicating with a
  single individual, but who, nevertheless, by entering firmly on the
   right way, and in submitting my mind to things, have, methinks,
                                                                                           to
   some extent advanced these matters."                      It is true that Bacon, in
   solitary meditation, during the intervals of the law courts and State
   affairs, built up the fabric of his philosophy, as a poet builds up an
   epic poem or a drama.             In   1605 he published his Advancement                of
   Learning,      which was meant to be a map of the existing state                        of
   human knowledge in all its various provinces, with a note of the
   facts in which knowledge was deficient, and an exhortation to supply
                                                                               3 s

these deficiencies.          The whole was to be a prelude to his Instauratio
Magna, or entire remodelling                of the sciences,            and   was intended
especially to catch the mind of James                   I.,   who was, however, of too
pedantic an intellect, and too much absorbed in theology, to rise to
the level of Bacon's great argument.               In    1620, when        Lord Chancellor
of England         and Baron          Verulam,      he    brought         out his        Novum
Organum, or new method of the sciences, in two divisions, of which
the first was destructive of scholasticism, and the second constructive
of   a   better way.       The Novum         Organum contained the chief                    pith
of Bacon's       philosophy, but of this only the first or destructive part
was complete.           No   praise can be too high for the manner in                     which
scholasticism      is   for ever annihilated in this treatise.                The trenchant
criticism, the large and luminous good sense, the grand and true
conceptions       of man's relation to nature, the striking metaphors                     — now
as    familiar    as    household words — which pervade                   the first part      of
Bacon's        Organum, have rendered            it    an immortal         work,     from the
point of view of literature as well               as   of philosophy.          But   it   would
be ludicrous        to maintain that, in          writing       it,   Bacon followed         the
footsteps of no one.             There had been     a   host of attacks upon         Aristotle
and      the    Aristotelians.        Ramus, in Paris, as a young man,                      had
sustained the thesis, that
                           " everything which Aristotle had said was
false." Patrizzi, in Venice, had published an assault upon Aristotle
characterised      by the utmost malignity.               Galileo, at Pisa, had roused
the anger of the Aristotelians by demonstrating that Aristotle was in
error when he said that heavy bodies fall faster than light ones.                           The
air in Europe was full of revolt against scholasticism, and yet Bacon
                                                          "
thought that when he laid down, in his brilliant way, that Truth
is   the daughter of Time, and not of authority                   ;"    that the    " ancients
were the children of the world              ;"   and that " the syllogism           is   unequal
to the subtlety         of things,"   be was stating something original, and not
following in the footsteps of any one.                   Bacon, having imbibed, with
the quick apprehension of genius, numberless                          suggestions    from his
 contemporaries         and predecessors, at once kicked down the ladders
on which his mind had risen             ;   he spoke     with the       greatest disdain      of
Ramus and Patrizzi           ;   and he so little appreciated           Galileo that, when
informed of some of the labours upon which Galileo was engaged, he
said to his informant:           —"I    wish you would persuade those Italian
astronomers       to give up amusing us           with their idle         stories, and stick

a little closer to the experience of the senses."                                          It   is a most curious
circumstance that Bacon, with all his great intellect, could not stomach
the Copernican theory.   Indeed, in some things he was even behind
his    age.         He    spoke          slightingly           of Gilbert           as    a mere specialist —
 Gilbert,       whose        discoveries             in       magnetism             have,       I    believe,      been
scarcely superseded at the present day. He accords no just tribute
to Harvey, who had been his own physician.        Harvey, on the
other hand, appears to have set no great store by Bacon.   Harvey
is reported to have said :— " He writes on philosophy like a Lord
Chancellor."              Now that             I     have         begun       with        Bacon's       intellectual
defects,        I   may      as    well finish with                    them.         Bacon was             strikingly
deficient in the power of looking at things historically                                               ;   indeed, it
never seems to have occurred to him to do                                     so.        He treated Aristotle
and Plato    if they were men of his own time, who
                    as                                                                               differed      from
him in opinion. In his work called the Wisdom of                                                     the Ancients,
he undertakes to show that under each of the fables of the Greek
mythology            there        was wrapped                 up and          concealed             some    piece     of
physical, metaphysical,                   or political philosophy.                         His interpretations
of the myths             are rich         in ingenuity, but                at the same time they are
perfectly arbitrary and reckless                          ;   and they ignore the primary ques
tion of all, which                is,   How        are we to conceive                     myths originally to
have been formed                  and established                  in the minds of              a    people?         To
this question the quite                     recent            science of comparative                   mythology
offers some sort of solution.                         Bacon's           view of the myths was very
prosaic    ;    he regarded them                as    didactic stories for the improvement
of child-like            minds.  His view of poetry itself     of the same                      is
character.           He describes    as
                                        "  part of learning," and evidently
                                            it                a
values     it   only so far         as    it   is    useful — that         is     to say, didactic.             It   is
with   a   covert sneer that he says                  :   — " Poesy           was ever thought to have
some participation of divineness,                             because     it      doth raise and erect the
mind, by submitting the shows of things to the desires of the mind                                                    ;
whereas        reason doth buckle and bow the mind unto the nature of
things."        He divides poetry into                             Narrative,            Representative,           and
Allusive.           In speaking of Representative poetry — that                                              is,   the
drama   — he        makes no mention of Shakespeare,                                 whom indeed he did
not appreciate.              He cares most for Allusive poetry, which conveys
truth under the form of allegory.                                 He excluded Lyrical poetry from
the category of poetry altogether.                                He   says   :— "We            exclude      satires,

 482                    Proceedings           of the Royal            Society
elegies, epigrams,           odes, and        the like, from our discourse,                 and class
them with           philosophy and the arts of oratory."                          In short, Bacon,
though he had himself many of the characteristics of a poet, utterly
misconceived the true nature of poetry, and in his theory reduced it
 to the level of prose.
      It    is perhaps      more     excusable        in Bacon that his outlook on the
future of human               knowledge             was,    after all,       quite     limited.        He
admitted that the instauration of the sciences would require some
ages       for its completion         ;    but he thought that, within the compass
of no very long period, that completion would be effected.                                      Bacon
would not have               realized       what was implied                by Goethe's       phrase,
unendliche         Nat nr.     If    you had asked him, he would probably have
prophesied          that,   before        the year    1877, all the mysteries               of nature
would have been cut and dried and garnered.                                      He had     some    dim
notion          of the science       of chemistry           ;    of geology,
                                                                of the sciences
palaeontology,        comparative  philology, and political economy, which
have done so          much to change modern ways of thinking, he had not
an inkling.          Of     the theory of evolution or                of    spectrum      analysis, it
is needless        to speak.         Bacon had not even heard of gravitation,
and     he held to the Ptolemaic                 system         of   the universe.          After all,
men's imagination is restricted to what they have had experience of,
or to some short flights             of analogy beyond               it,   and we cannot in the
least anticipate or set bounds to what our successors                                may be think
ing of some few centuries hence.
  Bacon has been charged with having led the way, by his philo
sophy,          to empiricism, materialism, positivism,                          and sundry other
amiable         " isms." But this                    is   rather unfair          for though, in his
                                           charge                           ;
physical philosophy, he seems to have tended more and more to an
atomistic theory, and though in the interval between                                  his Advance
ment  of Learning and his Novum Organum he seems to have
abandoned  the idea of metaphysics as useful science, still he   a
himself always maintained                    a   great      respect        for   revealed    religion.
Though he, very properly, enjoined that ethics should be studied,
like other        sciences, inductively,            he considered that mind itself                is   an
emanation         from God, and not subject to ths laws of science.                                 He
thus,      as   Kuno Fischer remarks, entertained                    a   dualism not dissimilar
to that of Descartes.               He held that faith should                     go side by side
with science, and that we should "render to Caesar the things                                      tint

                               of Edinburgh,            Session 1877-78.                                        483
are Casar's, and               to God the things that are God's."                                 Therefore,         if
subsequent philosophers have taken                            a   different attitude, the responsi
bility surely         rests with themselves.
     The last reproach against Bacon                          is,   that he made no discoveries
himself, and that he directly led the way to none.                                               Both of these
allegations          are,      in       fact,    undeniable.           Bacon sometimes                       showed
brilliant intuitions into                  for example, in illus
                                            the nature of things             ;
                                   "
trating his method of discovery by   prerogative instances," he
says  —
      : "The phenomenon of colour  discovered most readily, and   is
with      the least          heterogeneous            admixture, in prisms,                       crystals,     and
dew-drops        ;    for these have little or nothing                           in common             with other
coloured bodies, such                     as flowers,     stones,        metals, varieties of wood,
&c.       They are, in this respect, single instances, and from observing
them we easily arrive at the result that colour                                         is   nothing but             a
modification           of the image of the incident and absorbed light                                         ;     in
the former        case         by the different degrees of incidence, in the latter
by    the textures          and various forms of bodies."                             This       paragraph       has
been      said       to     contain             an   anticipation           of    Goethe's               theory of
colours.         But such intuitions                   were       only, like          those of           Aristotle,
the happy thoughts of                       a    powerful intellect.                  Discovery, properly
so called, remains              as      the prerogative            of the specialist             ;    and Bacon,
though he killed himself by the experiment of stuffing                                               a   fowl with
snow, cannot claim any discovery                          as      his own.
     Nor   have discoveries                 been made by following the precepts of the
Baconian method of induction.                            Some          attribute this to the incom
pleteness        of the            second        part of the Novum                     Organum           ;    others
say that        it    is   because         Bacon's method              is    based      on        an     erroneous
view of causation.                      Twenty years ago, Dr Whewell brought out                                     a
Novum           Organum              Renovatum,          to       supply         Bacon's             deficiencies    ;
but    we may safely venture to assert, that Whewell's                                           book will not
be    a   bit    more fertile              in producing             discoveries         than Bacon's has
been.      Logic          is   a    useful part of education,                    and    is   necessary          as   a
part of philosophy                  ;   but every real worker in the world                               seems to
have      an     unconscious logic                   of his         own,     based          on       innumerable
analogies        of    the      class      of facts with which                   he    is   in the habit of
dealing.         The study of deductive logic will never                                     of itself create
powerful reasoning                   in the law courts or the senate                         ;       and let the
logic of inductive method be laid down never so perfectly, still dis

  covery and the advancement of science will go on independently of it
  The true method of studying nature had come into the world before
  Bacon wrote     ;    it had          been    distinctly described,               though in general
 terms, by Lionardo da             Vinci, Tycho Brahe, and Galileo                         ;   and, quite
 independently of Bacon, its adoption had been signalised by several
 of the greatest discoveries ever made by the human race, — some of
 which Bacon even refused to admit.                              Probably no direct connection
 can be established between                   the influence of Bacon and the achieve
 ments     of any separate science.                       But,    as De     Jouffroy       says,
                                                                                                     " Is it
 nothing to have seized, at the critical moment, the idea which would
 open a new era to the sciences  ?  Is it nothing, in the early dawn
 of an immense revolution, to have predicted almost in detail its career ?
 Before Bacon's time no one seems to have had a true sentiment of
 the grandeur     of   nature      ;    this sentiment, conjointly with enthusiasm
 for science, he preached               and spread abroad.                    As    soon       as he had
 written, the genius of observation raised its head, and marched on an
 equality with the genius of thought."
    I   have already given evidence                      of Bacon's general influence upon
 the    minds of men, and it was                         by this general       influence,          on the
 universities, on separate scholars, and on the reading world through
 out Europe, that Bacon assisted                          the    birth of     the    new era.             His
 perceptive mind brought into one focus, beams of light which would
otherwise have remained scattered; like an eagle he soared                                         till   he
caught sight of the unrisen sun                      ;   he told the world what was going
on and what was in store for                  it ;       he made the new era conscious                     of
itself.   In doing this,       he employed the most splendid literary faculty.
No architecture        is,   after its kind, finer than the English prose of
Bacon's Advancement             of Learning.                    Remusat justly . recognises               in
Bacon's writing that quality which                       is   termed "the great manner," and
he envies him that balance of imagination                              with   good     sense, which
he considers     to be     a   specially English characteristic.                      Bacon, in           an
interval of    short-sightedness,               distrusted          the     permanence           of the
English   language     ;   like Dante, and others of                      the great    moderns,           he
undervalued the            worth             vitality of his vernacular
                                        and inherent
tongue; he said         "these modern languages will one day play the
bankrupt with books."                  Therefore, after his first great treatise,                         he
preferred to write upon philosophy in Latin. This we may now
regret from  literary point of view, but
             a                           doubtless extended the   it

                      of Edinburgh, Session 1877-78.                              485
circle of his contemporary         readers, and his     Latin writings, not being
in   classical style, and being full of pregnant thoughts, wise and
witty    sayings, and the happiest metaphors,             are easily translated into
any    language,   and    are a treasure   for all the world.          In conclusion,
it is as   an inspired seer, one of the greatest of men of letters, and
the    prose-poet of modern science, that          I  reverence    Lord Bacon,     and
 have ventured to make him the first topic of the evening.
     Our own Royal Society doubtless borrowed its title and partly its
 idea from    the Royal Society of London.              I  am proud to    think that
 this Society is      an emanation      from the University           of Edinburgh,
 from which it     sprang, on the suggestion         of Principal      Robertson, in
 the latter part of    1782.    Thus, in the same year when the University
 will   celebrate   its tercentenary, this Society will be able, perhaps
  conjointly, to celebrate its hundredth birthday.             But in one essential
  particular   we   differ from the       Royal      Society of London,         whose
  function   was thus defined     in  1663  : — " To improve       the knowledge of
  natural things, and all useful arts, manufactures,            mechanic    practices,
  engines, and inventions, by experiments (not meddling with divinity,
  metaphysics, morals, politics, grammar, rhetoric, or logic)."                  These
  exclusions form no part in our constitution.               On the contrary, from
  the first, the promotion of literature       as  well   as science was the    object
  of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.             I  may say, then, that the name
  of Bacon, as one of the greatest            stars    of literature, has a double
  claim upon our regard.         But it   has been observed         that the literary
  element in our proceedings           has been      gradually dwindling away.
  Principal Forbes, fifteen years ago, spoke of the difficulties under
  which we laboured owing to a change in the manners of society, and
  to our having become less "clubable," or less intellectually sociable,
  than our ancestors used to be a hundred years ago. And he exhorted
  the then fellows to bestir themselves in the production of papers.
  I  have inquired the number of papers, not connected with physical
  science, which have been contributed during the last fifteen years, and
  it appears to be considerably less than forty, or little more than two per
  annum.      And of    these, seven were contributed by Professor Blackie
  on classical or philosophical subjects, four by           Lord   Neaves chiefly on
  philology,   three by    Dr John Muir         on   Indian antiquities,     three   by
   Mr Wyld on metaphysical topics, two by Sir James Simpson
   on archaeological questions, two by Mr Skene on Celtic topography

 486                   Proceedings        of the Royal Society
 aud philology,        and the remaining            twelve       or fourten by             separate
 individuals.       Thus, in the last fifteen years, out of about 370 Ordinary
 Fellows of the Society, only about twenty have come forward to                                  con
 tribute papers other than physical or mathematical.                          During       the last
session not a single paper on any literary subject was read before us.
 No doubt, there is much excuse for this, in the fact that the time of
literary men is often much occupied,                and that they can obtain                a high
remuneration elsewhere              for the produce of their labour.                        It    was
doubtless      owing to this that Sir Walter Scott, who was for twelve
years President of this Society, never appears to have contributed a
single paper to        it,   though he was so full of history and archaeology
and lore of all sorts.
     The day may even come when the general                            public   is   sufficiently
instructed to receive            with    interest, in ordinary             periodicals,           the
physico-mathematical papers, which form the staple commodity of
this Society, and then we shall have done our work.                             In the      mean
time  I     would venture, like Principal Forbes, to advocate "intellectual
clubability."       All      tentative essays, which are not yet ripe to form                       a
book or an article, may fitly be contributed                       to this       Society and
embodied        in its Transactions,          and   I     should       have     thought          that
not   a   single professor of any department in the University                         could go
through the teaching of             a   session,    without coming across at least
some one novel point,             which    it   would      be worth        while to bring
forward.
     In   the course   of    last session, one     of   the three prizes        in   the   gift of
this Society — the Macdougall-Brisbane                    prize, consisting of             a    Gold
Medal and £15, 14s. 7d., was awarded to Mr Buchan, for his paper,
" On the Diurnal Oscillation of the Barometer." This important
contribution       to meteorological science             has been published                in     the
Transactions        of the      Society, and    I       note    here    with pleasure             the
words used in regard to          it   by our President, on presenting the prize                    :
— " That      it   paves     the way for discovering             the complete thermo
dynamic theory           of its subject, and that                Mr Buchan            has        well
followed up his laborious and most                      useful investigations              of     the
meteorology        of Scotland by so valuable             a    discussion of barometric
observations from all parts of the world, collected and arranged
in    the    very best       manner for the immediate application                          of     the
harmonic analysis."

nomical discovery was made on the Continent, which                    almost   took
men's breath away for the moment          in astonishment      and admiration        ;
and which in bringing the name of Le Verrier                for the first time
prominently before the general public, taught them that the                  age  of
intellectual    giants after   the manner of Newton and           La Place,     was
not yet closed.       And thirty-one     years   afterwards,    or on that very
identical day of September        in the present      year  1877, the electric
telegraph    flashed   this other mournful news over an attentive world,
that the same Le Verrier          (without compare the greatest gravita
tional astronomer      of our time) had ceased to exist !
    Death has been indeed too complete, for within a few days of Le
Vomer's own demise, his adored Wife followed him to the tomb,
where one of his sons was already laid       ;  and we thus have the whole
life-lesson of this most eminent scientist ready for impartial historical
treatment,    if at all.
    But who shall prove equal to the task of writing the life of such
a man.      Biographical notices    of him innumerable have been pub
lished, but not the one, full, history which posterity will require                 ;
nor is this the place to attempt anything           of the kind.         But what
has appeared in print already,       sar-abundantly relieves your Council
of the necessity of any attempt on their part at formally justifying
their advice of thirty years ago, to the Society, to enrol the name of

 400                 Proceedings     of the Royal Society
 Le Verrier     amongst its Honorary Members; and they cannot perhaps
 do better     in  the few minutes now accorded       to them, than simply
 to describe something of the general character        of, as well as progress
 of alteration with time in, the public career of the departed.
    The first period of Le Vender's virile existence may be considered to
 extend from his leaving the Polytechnic         School in 1831, to receiv
 ing the appointment of Director of the Observatory of Paris in
 1853  ;  a  joyous, a rising    and expanding existence    to him the whole
 of the time.       Born in 1811 at St Lo, in the Department of Manche,
 (which courts the west wind of the Atlantic along the whole extent
of its coast), and son of a Government official there, the young Le
 Verrier had received his education first in provincial, then in Parisian,
schools,    always manifesting a taste for, and superior power in, pure
 mathematics; but with a further determination also to hold his own
course, and to prosecute his own excelsior ideals therein.           Hence, on
ceasing     to be a college    student in 1831, and beginning his career
as a man, as the       architect too of his own fortunes to be, he seems       to
have    chosen, not a poorly paid, over worked, hard           scientific post,
but the more easily executed, and better paid employment of the
ordinary civil service of his country; selecting such a branch therein
as  should leave him most spare time for the prosecution of his pri
vate reading; and only when, after some years, the further continua
tion of that official employment, the Administration              d/is Tabacs,
would have obliged him to leave the neighbourhood of metropolitan
libraries, — did he seek to support himself by teaching mathematics,
of which      he then became one      of the assistant professors    in his  old
Polytechnic School.
    But  those pedagogic      labours by day, the still youthful Le Verrier
never allowed to interfere        with his own private studies        at night.
He had already comprehended            and fervently accepted    his destiny    ;
viz., to succeed      La Place in   those applications of the higher mathe
matical analysis to celestial mechanics,         which demand as much         of
continued       labour, and     power of abstraction, as of penetration,
genius, and analytical resources.         Hence his earliest paper presented
to the Academy of Sciences        in 1839, attacked no less than the secular
inequalities in the movements         of the principal planets.    His   second
paper took up the orbit of Mercury, and the most exact calculation

                       of Edinburgh,         Session 1877-78.                         491
of the numerical        amounts      of the perturbations it is subject to from
other planets.         His third     paper, presented in 1844, investigated in
the    most    masterly style the           perturbations which          the strangely
deflected Comet of 1770                must   have    experienced     both before and
after that epoch, from the attraction of the planet Jupiter.                          And
his fourth     paper, applied similar mathematical               calculations to the
more modern discovered Comet of 1843.
    But   those Comet papers, though they gained                  Le Verrier a seat
and a pension in the Academy of Sciences, were not altogether                           in
his   destined   line.     In   more immediate       resumption of which, it was,
that in the beginning of 1846, he brought before the Academy his
fine investigation into the orbit of the planet Uranus, his computa
tions of every perturbation it could suffer from every known                        mem
 ber of the solar system,           and   his finding      them    all insufficient to
 account for the difference           between    theory and observation.              And
 then, after that essential         clearing of the ground, he produced                his
 further and most remarkable of all his mathematical                       calculations,
 confessedly and by its very title,           on   "the hitherto       unseen, outside
 planet,    which,     acting from without,           is producing        the   apparent
 irregularities in the movement           of Uranus, from       a distance      of   1500
 millions of miles beyond, and is now in such and such                     a position in
 our sky, and must have such and such an apparent diameter."                       A  note
 of that position       and     size Le    Verrier    sent   to a German observer
 on the 17th of September               in that year, 1846.        That observer, Dr
 Galle by name, looked for it on the                 evening    of   the    23d  of that
 month, and within          a  few minutes, with the powerful and accurately
 mounted equatorial telescope of the Berlin Observatory, he actually
 succeeded     in finding Le Verrier's theoretical              planet,    since    called
  Neptune, in the given direction, at the enormous                     distance    and of
  the indicated size, nearly.
     This  was the discovery, sensational           it  has   been called, but most
  worthy to make         a    sensation    throughout the whole human race,
  which immediately brought in honours of every kind, and from many
  nations to Le Verrier.          Which presently too, wafted him in political
  safety across the abyss which proved fatal to the then king and all
  the royal family of France          ; but gave the astronomer-mathematician
  an eminent place       under the subsequent           republic, and a still more
  eminent one under the Empire which followed.                     But    none   of  those

 402                Proceedings      of the Royal Society
 things, however flatttering personally, not even the powers invested
 in him to reform the Polytechnic School, and to inspect all the uni
 versities of France, nor all the immense astronomical correspondence
 of which he became the European centre, did he allow to interfere
 with   his continued private research         in his own appointed        task.
 Wherefore the Academy was electrified again and again              by further
 of his magnificent planetary papers, in 1849, 1850, and             1853  — as,
 on new methods      of constructing the numerical tables         required for
practically computing the places of the planets           as  subjected to all
perturbations of Newtonian          gravitation origin ; next, on improved
tables of the Sun, as representing the movements           of the earth   ; and
then on still more refined         theoretical considerations touching        the
whole group of planetoids, between Mars and Jupiter, whatever their
teeming numbers       might eventually be found with the telescope.
    All this  time, too, Le Verrier was the most cheerful of beings, the
most admired of all in scientific life, and envied by no one ; for he
had   gained    his successes by genius       and force which were all his
own, which      no one else could attempt to claim or compete with.
And he could      be so   smiling, so gracious, sweet as summer air,        and
full of happy remarks to all he met.           Occasionally even rather      too
much so    ; for we have seen him at that period of his life at        a meet
ing of the Academy, and while the very Perpetual Secretary                  was
reading   out the papers of others, there was M. Le Verrier joyously
walking in, and about, and through all the ranks of seated savants,
nodding to one, discussing with another, laughing with a third, pro
posing    problems to a fourth, and without           the slightest idea     he
could be doing anything wrong.             While his personal      appearance
was in those days a tall      figure, with fine upright carriage, sparkling
eyes unconscious of offence, an immense          dome of a head and abun
dant flaxen hair.       The French called it       "blond:" and      how that
man could have escaped being born an Anglo-Saxon,              was more than
we could then understand.
    So closed   the first period of    Le Terrier's career  : for the  second
and very contrasted      part of it began when Louis Napoleon       appointed
him to the charge of the Imperial Observatory at Paris.
   And why should it have been such a contrast? Was not the
" Observatoire" just the
                                place for such a man ? Not a bit of it I

In      our own Mrs Somerville's autobiography, unfortunately                            not then
published, she pointedly records that when all the world was paying
her honour, immediately after the publication of her most unex
              lady's book on astronomy, entitled
                                                                     " The Mechanism of the
ampled
 Heavens,"         elucidated there by her able expositions of the algebraical
 analysis       of La Place and other                  great       French    mathematicians —
 one of her lady friends               in Burntisland               remarked     so   confidently,
 " Oh      !  Mrs Somerville,         what        a  happy life you must lead, for of
                                                                                                   "
 course you are always gazing                     at   the stars        through a telescope      !
 Whereupon            Mrs Somerville answered to the effect,                     " that   she had
  never looked through            a telescope        in her life, except once          ; and then
 it    was not at a star."          And of       course      !     For if  she had been spend
  ing     her nights in instrumental star-gazing,                    how could she have been
  also getting up by midnight                     oil   the totally        different subject of
  algebraical equations         !
        Very similar too, mutatis             mutandis, was the             case  of Le Verrier.
   Born to excel in astronomical mathematics                            on paper, what had he
   to do with telescopes          !   Why,         the very, and most particular, praise
   which all the world had given him in 1846, was, — " Other astrono
   mers have        occasionally discovered            a   little planet, by finding in the
   sky with their        telescopes      a   diminutive           star, which varies      its place
   slightly from night to night              :   but here, in M. Le Verrier, is              a man
   who has discovered          a planet without              looking through a telescope at
   all; without        even casting        a    single glance at the sky;              he saw    his
   grand planet at the end of his pen                   !
                                                          "
                                                                 If  that praise, then given      so
    freely, was genuine        and honest, why take that man away from his
    glorious pen work,           and make           him       begin mechanical operations
    which he has no taste for: which he has shown he can transcend
    in their     occasional  results by totally different methods                   ?
         But   the imperial   will   had ordained              it ;  and forthwith, from 1853
    to 1870, Le Verrier was known as Director                       of the Observatory of Paris:
     showing too, there,        in many brilliant respects, how much a rigid
     sense   of mere duty may enable                  a man         to perform in almost any
     line.    Though the world at large will be thankful chiefly, that in
     all this second portion of his career, Le Verrier never allowed him
     self to be entirely absorbed              in   the continually increasing circle of
      his official employments         ;   but held         as    closely as ever to his soul's
      private    task,  viz., the mathematical investigations, and then the

  494                Proceedings         of the Royal Society
  practical computations, of every perturbation which the Solar planets
  can suffer.
     In this   manner,     with   an energy, a constancy and an intellectual
  power never combined before in any one individual, Le Verrier                        had.
  by the year 1868, produced new tables of all the inner                          planeu-
  from Mercury to Mars         ;  and in the course of them had demonstrated
  most unexpectedly, that the              hitherto    universally   received quan
 tity for     70  years     past,    of    8 56"    for the   Solar   Parallax,         was
 much too small.          The effect on the astronomical world was magical.
 For   years   there    had been      a   languid idea that the Solar Parallax
 value derived from the then last previous Venus Transit,                         should
 be  improved upon by observations of Mars at opposition                    ;   and the
 Nautical     Almanac had for half a century gone on publishing                         the
 appropriate ephemerides          of Mars and       stars near him for Opposition
 after Opposition.         But few    persons ever observed       them  ;  or    if   they
 did, and also,     like Henderson at          the Cape and Taylor at Madras,
 computed the results        as   well, — they were not attended       to.      But     the
 moment     it was announced that           Le Verrier had found from his               cal
 culations in Physical Astronomy, that the mean Solar Parallax was
 so far from 8-56"      as  to be nearer to 8-95", all Astronomical Associa
tions were shaken to their very bases.                Greenwich ran to court the
 new quantity.        The Nautical Almanac adopted it with fervour                  :  and
half a dozen nations were presently competing with each other in
observing and re-observing Mars' oppositions, and always finding
now that they gave out a quantity very like the Parallax announced
by the great Gravitational Astronomer of France.
    But how went        on things in general          at the Observatoire,      all this
time?
    For  a while, wonderfully well           !   If  Le Verrier had no        practical
experience     himself, he knew where he could obtain it in others.                    So,
the Emperor       always aiding and abetting, the favoured savant                     had
only to propose        schemes of improvement, and the means                   in    both
men and money were always forthcoming to carry them                     out        First,
the whole Greenwich           system was imported bodily, its instruments
imitated, its routine copied,           and observing astronomers          and      com
puters of a like order           procured.      Then came the concentration of
Meteorological Observations by electric telegraph                from all quarters
of Europe, and       the issue     of   a daily Bulletin,    post free to all          the

                           of Edinburgh, Session 1877-78.                             495
  world, by another corps of practical scientists newly incorporated
  into the establishment. Then came the rise of the " Association
  Scientifique        de France,"    a voluntary popular institution          after the
 British       model,     but where all the sciences were taken up, and Le
 Verrier      was President of everything.
     He took       care verbally and      with semi-military hauteur, to appoint
 his Observatory subalterns their             tasks to perform     ;  but when these
 were performed, largely by the native and peculiar, and often most
 exalted, skill of the workers, they were pushed                  into obscurity on
 every great occasion, and Le Verrier took sole ostensible                  authorship
 of all their doings.         Long had they borne, but how much longer were
 they to continue to bear, this peculiarly affronting tyranny?                        To
 perform the most exquisite work in their own lines, but to remain
 unknown,        trodden on, and       see  another, who in his heart despised
 such things, gain all the advantage              and all the credit?         Feelings,
 though silent, were growing more bitter and dangerously                   exasperated
 day by day at the Observatoire.               Something must come of it.             At
length,       not there, but at the Academy, the malcontents found                      a
leader in M. Delaunay             : a younger man, but rising to be              a  still
greater mathematician in gravitational astronomy,                    than Le Verrier
himself     :   and yet at the same time,            was this most        unique and
estimable Delaunay as much distinguished by natural amiability,
by the sympathetic             tendencies    of his disposition, and his earnest
regard for others, as the Director of the Observatoire, Imperial Lord
of the Ascendant, was daily              becoming     more  and more antipathic,
as well as impatient of every            one in the world but himself.
    Now Delaunay's grand mathematically scientific work                        at that
period was       the theory of the Moon ; and           he too had come therein
on certain       equations      whence    he drew a new       value    for the Solar
parallax    ;    making      it however      more    nearly   8-85",     and proving
Le Verrier's         8 95*  quite inadmissible.       So thereupon      the two great
mathematicians crossed swords.                 Their  discussions,     meeting     after
meeting of the Academy, attained                a vigour and an intensity which
drew half Paris          to assist at these re-unions    ; but chiefly to hear Le
Verrier   !     He was indeed rather in the wrong scientifically                 ;  and
had, long afterwards, to modify his 8 .95* to something very close to
Delaunay's          numbers.      But what did the crowd           care for minute
exactitudes       !    They went to     see how a hero fights, how he gains his

successes   ;   and Le Verrier gave them plenty of that.                 Though not
exactly an orator,          he     was clear   in expression, fluent in words,
and ready, aye ready, at a             moment's notice.        Rich too in cutting
sarcasm     and scarifying irony, he taunted the slowness of his oppo
nents    who had         to   go    home    and think over their          replies    and
promise to give them at the next meeting of the                   Academy, — while
he stood      there   having answered,       or at all events     confounded, them
on every       point yet produced         ; he, the man     of peace, who desired
 nothing so much as to finish the war then and there.
     On such occasions Le Verrier seemed to float in positive pleasure
 through the combat, cutting down his enemies with                      ease on every
 side.    A    smile was still on his countenance            ;  but it was now the
 smile which opens            not the lips     ;  a distorting,     disdainful    smile,
 betraying however within, both the consuming fires of egotism, the
 love of conquering, and the voluptuous                rapture of triumph       become
 a necessary      accompaniment of his existence.                Yet   there   was this
 untoward feature about it all the time, that with every successive
 conquest,      Le Verrier was making           a wider and wider void around
  himself;     until,    with    one   dazzling victory more, — there came the
  deadening      news, that every one had left him, and the Director of
  the Observatory reigned over telescopes alone              !
     The    Minister of         the   Interior then had        to step    in  and    give
  such a disorganizing Director his dismissal.                 Le Verrier     answered
  by a passionate         appeal     for an interpellation      by the Senate      :   but
  that body supported the Minister, and the tyrant-mathematician
  had to go.       He fell    ;  and   never had there been such a catastrophe
  known before        throughout the scientific world.            But Delaunay        was
  immediately appointed to the vacant place                  ;  the   observers,     com
  puters   and    artisans      all returned, and    the   public service flowed        on
  once again.
      Time passed      ;  and how heavy a time for France, after that affair
   of the Observatoire in the beginning of 1870.                 The terrific Franco-
   German war began soon afterwards               ; the Germans invaded France
   with  a larger army than the world had ever heard of since the                     days
   of Xerxes, and, though professing to be               " Christians," and       calling
   their country " Hol.^.yet armed with infinitely more terrible means
   for the destruction of human life than his, or Mahomet's either.

                      of Edinburgh, Session 1877-78.                               497
 Every battle went       against   the   French    ; their smaller armies          were
 annihilated,     their   fairest   provinces     rent   away   :   their   revenues
 sacked, their people        (even   innocent and peaceable           men,    women,
 and children) starved to the very bone, their capital city taken.
 And then, after all these destructions from without, poor Paris
 fell into  the hands of her own revolutionary                Communists       ;  who,
 when at length attacked in their turn, by the recovered                    forces    of
 the   nation, — most provokingly         insisted on making the very Obser-
 vatoire of Astronomical Science, one of their chief strategic                   points
of   defence  ;  drawing      down    thereby on the        grand     old building,
from loyal French guns too, an amount of cannon                      shot that rid
dled the Equatorial Domes through and through, and ruined                         much
of the substantial      masonry    below.
    But  the chief part     of the daily service of the Observatory was not
impeded thereby.          For, with remarkable prevision of coming events,
Delaunay had removed           a  division of the working         staff, long before
the siege of Paris began, to a Southern Department.                      There they
gathered     up the      telegraphic     communications       again,     there    they
carried on their collections of all European, with              a  few Asiatic and
some    African    Meteorological observations,         and there also, without
the cessation of      a day, they issued their daily lithographed Bulletin;
contriving still     to give to all nations, and by a free           book-post,     the
earliest information of every scientific event              and   Natural change
and thus to keep up their beloved               France (though bleeding from
unnumbered wounds) an intellectual centre,                a heralder of the way,
for all the learned world.
   That grand       result,  however, came about mainly because it was
Delaunay      who directed, or         rather bound together with cords of
love, all the broken and scattered          elements     of the scientific service
of France.       Under his sympathetic lead, every one put forth his
utmost powers, and with a will and             a devotion which, in immediate
presence of death,       was almost sublime.         And when       at length peace
returned, and the reorganisation of the Observatory of Paris had to
be undertaken,        every report which       M. Delaunay       addressed     to the
Minister of     the   Interior   was as surprising     for its pellucid clearness,
as   for its ably comprehensive          character   :  alike too for including
every department of science, as for insuring the distinct                recognition
of every good worker therein.            A true and happy model Republic

498                    Proceedings     of the Royal Society
was the Observatoire thus becoming under this rare Savant's en
lightened rule, tending to the American perhaps in its almost over
abundance      of personal liberty, but to the Athenian in its perfection
of work and glorious ideals of still higher things to come, — when,
on a day, —alack the day !— one most gusty, stormy, tempestuous
day   ;  when poor       Delaunay,     who had    gone   down to the sea-side
merely for a short visit, essaying to cross the harbour of Cherbourg
in an open boat, a squall came on, the boat capsized in deep water,
and France's first, best, rising, genius was lost for ever.
    All   political and scientific society stood aghast.        There was no
second Delaunay to be had anywhere             ; and even those persons who
had been most           active in bringing     him forward     only two years
before, —could        do nothing    now but tacitly consent,     in their utter
 dismay,    to Le Verrier returning to power again.
    Le Verrier returned accordingly to the Observatoire in 1672, and
 then began      a  third distinctly featured period of his career.
    No longer        the cheerful-looking    Anglo-Saxon man of his earlier
 days   ; nor the tall, stern, conquering figure         of his middle career   ;
 but now, bent and feeble, with a dark, jaundiced hue overspreading
 his countenance        (symptomatic of the disorder of the liver under
 which     he finally     sank), and     with the   muscles   of his face  half
 withered and shrunk down to the bone, so           as to show the real osseous
 foundation of the countenance            and prove    him a born Gaul, after
 all, — Le Verrier in his third       stage pleased both friends and foes less
 than ever.
     With    the latter he did not attempt any actual open war, but there
 was underground work going on all the time ; mining and counter
  mining j torpedo fighting of a very bad kind.             He chafed in spirit
  that he was returned to power only by the accidental death of his
  grand,   faultless, adversary     ;  and they were vexed that their whole
  ranks contained not another man capable                of openly meeting Le
  Verrier.     He, dominating at the Parisian Centre, obtained from the
  Minister (who was now frightened to interfere with him) power to
  revise and curtail as he chose almost all the other scientific Obser
  vatories of the country ; and their Directors were furious, that when
  France was,      as then, a  Republic, they, the scientist portion thereof,
 should have to live under the sway of a more than Emperor, a Czar              ;

                      of Edinburgh,     Session 1877-78.                     499
of   one,    moreover,    who, while indulging      himself in extending his
Observatory even by profuse public expenditure, — sought               to gain a
character      before   the country for economy,        by starving, or even
abolishing,      their's.
     If too,  the claims of    some  of those other astronomers     to patriotic
recognition and govermental          regard were occasionally too great to be
altogether      and   immediately overborne even          by Le Verrier,    — he
undermined,         and laid plans which        must eventually   lead   to their
collapse and removal.           Thus, was there a new Observatory lately
 established in the south of Paris, where           the Savant, who had car
 ried on the Meteorological bulletins during the German war, should
 in future    devote    himself to a new kind of utilitarian        meteorology
 for the    special  benefit of agriculture and the service      of the public
 health   ;
            — or  was there another new Observatory allowed to be built
 in the north of Paris       at Meudon, near Montmartre, for the Savant
 who so nobly risked life and limb by sailing forth in a balloon over
 the heads of the truculent Germans then besieging             Paris, — in order
 that France, even in her agony for very existence,             should still be
 present among the nations at the observation of a total Solar Eclipse
 on   the Northern coast of Africa,       — and  where, in that new Observa
 tory, that patriot and fearless astronomer        should, with no other con
 trol   over him than the Minister of the Interior, seek to carry out his
 own very original inquiries into the Physics of Astronomy, — then
 Le Verrier insisted        on   having additions of new instruments and
 young subaltern observers added to his own Observatory, to accom
 plish   the very same ends, but on a far grander scale.         Or was there   a
 new reflecting      Equatorial ordered for the Observatory of Toulouse,
 — whereto       M. Delaunay, in his short but brilliant career, had sent
 a young astronomer, of genius after his own heart,           as Director,  — Le
  Verrier did not actually interfere with its going          there,  but imme
  diately ordered, at his country's expense, for his own Observatory,
 a    similar reflecting telescope,      one-half   larger,  and with all the
 economical fittings of the other in modest wood, replaced in bis own
 with ne-plue-ultra work in fine        metals.
     And then his mere manner           was sometimes     so intentionally pro
 voking.
     When President Marshal Macmahon, — striving            to entertain nation
  ally, and mentally impress the Shah of Persia, then on his gorgeoun

   500                 Proceedings        of the Royal Society
   visit   to   Paris, — applied to Le Verrier to arrange                 for   a    recep
  tion of the Eastern potentate and his bejewelled and glittering                     suite
  at the grandly restored Observatoire, he only                 received     the follow
  ing short note from the State's chief paid Astronomer                   : —
      Marechal, — La Science, n'illumine pas, les sauvages.
                                                                      Le Verbibr.
      Even in ordinary conversation it was almost terrible to                    see   how
  the    old-man-misanthrope,        in merely         describing the coarse of an
  argument with another scientist, could egregiously clench his                          fist
  and act to the very life as though delivering a regular knock-down
  blow right      between   the   eyes.     Or when the other's        equations      were
  faultless, and no other complaint could be found, he would be stig
  matised in society as       " that man with the
                                                           big ugly mouth."
     All this would       soon   have become           unbearable, but that it was
  accompanied      by two things, even three, which induced wise men                      to
  be  exceptionally tolerant.
     First, for   instance,   they knew that there was still            a   truly  heroic
 spirit in that querulous disposition and decrepit frame.                     When all
 the rest     of educated    society in      Paris    was utterly frightened at the
 sudden      rise of the Red Republic,             and sought only to strike their
 colours,     and disappear      by putting on           the aspect of being more
 canaille than the Red men themselves,                 —  Le Verrier stood out firm
 in his appreciation of hereditary order, historic experience,                  accumu
 lated wisdom, and preservative             rule.     Red-republicans indeed claim
 to be equal to, and on the same                level with, him    !   Let    any Red-
republican of them          all essay on the grandest test of man's intel
lectuality, to tread with him,          if they could, the mathematical founda
tions of the stability of the Solar system                 !  And they couldn't: —
so    were they      to inscribe their wretched            shibboleth of      " Liberte,
                         "
Egalite, Fraternite         over his door        ?   No  ! he would    have none of
that sort of thing.         And    hence, when visitors from distant parts of
the world, even from the very antipodes,                 came to pay their homage
to the first physical Astronomer              of France, and had     been disgusted
on passing through Paris,           to   see   its grandest public buildings,         and
even the most sacred of its churches,               scribbled all over, in fright,      to
pacify the Red men, with those three most falsifying, misleading
words of their political creed and pretences,— such visitors read over

                       of Edinburgh,         Session 1877-78.

word         OB8ERVATOIRE."
    Second, within that respected               building,      in its private dwelling
portion,     there    reigned      the gentle       radiance,      and mild dignity of
Madame Le Verrier.
    In  those    early days of the now passed away French                          Emperor,
when he made            no mistakes,      and had to pay his visit of state to
London during          the     Crimean war, he not only took the Empress
Eugenie with him            ;  but, while M. Le Verrier was one of his suite,
 Madame Le Verrier was one of the ladies of honour in waiting on
the Empress.          One of the most mentally distinguished of them too;
for, after the grandest            West-end reception on that occasion,                   this
saying worthily ran through the elite of London                           society,
                                                                                      " Other
 ladies present       were expensively dressed,              but Madame Le Verrier
  was well dressed."             And   if  there     is any      grim    philosopher who
 doubts whether there is much in that, let him refer to the printed
 discussions on this very matter which took place at the Social Science
 Association's brilliant meeting at Aberdeen only two months ago.
    But M. Le Verrier himself, amid all his wielding                          the   forces   of
 science,    could appreciate the beautiful in art, and even assist at the
 development of some of its forms                 ;   for he fed his soul on music.
 But it   was with a change, as his career progressed.                    When     he visited
 England       first,    in     1847,   and    was      asked       to   write    something
 in  a lady's album at Oxford, and not only composed                        a chanson    then
 and there, but set it to original music, took                  a  ruler, ruled the ortho
 dox number of lines, and then               wrote therein the musical notes with
 the precision of a            copper-plate     engraving, — the whole thing had
 the pleasant aspect             of spring     flowers    ;   primroses and         cowslips,
 daisies and      buttercups in the opening months of the year.                            Bin.
  when, as he felt           impelled occasionally to do,              in the     long after
  years of 1875 or 1876, he armed                 himself with his violin and pro
  ceeded to draw therefrom, as            it  seemed almost in spite of itself, the
  most agonizingly beautiful strains, thrilling tones of dying grace, —
  tones which      a  Paganini might have envied, and ordinary men almost
  have wept that they could do nothing of the kind, — it reminded
  one more     of the dark autumn's one, last,              grand,     garden    flower, the
  Tiger-lily, bowing over its prospective grave in the earth beneath.
     Lastly, in still further mitigation of much of Le Verrier's manner

 502                         Proceedings              of the Royal Society
 daring the final years of his official career and life itself, — all good
 men were aware              that his indefatigable, most original, and innate,
unapproachable genius was again toilsomely engaged on the grand,
self-imposed task of his life               ;    and was even then rapidly and mag
nificently      preparing as full mathematical                          theories      and         accurate
practically-computing               numerical tables of the                 larger, outer planets
of the       Solar System,             as he     had already done               for    the smaller,
inner members               thereof.       His analytical methods                     too       were      the
most      comprehensive             that    had         ever    been attempted          ;       and were
specially distinguished by their capacity to take in and utilise all
good     observations ever made in practical astronomy on the bodies
concerned,          through all time,                 whether     ancient       or modern.               The
work was immense, and it killed him in the end, though not before
he had satisfactorily finished                  it,   even to the last page.
   He had           even the peculiar satisfaction before                   his death of seeing
his most difficult researches, almost in mathematical darkness,                                         as to
the mass      of     the planet Mars— up to that time supposed                                  by all the
world to be          "   moonless       Mars" — suddenly lighted up and                         confirmed
by the     splendid and most unexpected American                                discovery of this
last summer, with their latest erected and largest equatorial telescope
at Washington,             of two moons circulating                    around that planet, and
at rates     of motion which               admirably            bore    out his, Le Verrier's,

of gravitational            attraction.          But     so truly        immense,       as well as
ultra     difficult,       was    the    whole planetary research,                 that not only
(as has been             well said elsewhere)            would     it    have    been considered
 mpossible      for one man to have achieved the whole,                               if Le       Verrier
had not performed                it in our own           times,   — but, only         one man has
been found      fully able        even to describe             the work to others           ;   and that
one man         — -who

ability,   clearness, and method which leave nothing to be desired for
scientific instruction's sake, — but he has thrown into the execution
of his     task   such a plenitude of impartiality,           such generosity of
feeling and      goodness  of  heart, that his account has been enthusiasti
cally   reproduced     in Paris, within the last few weeks, under the title
of"   The genius of Le Verrier appreciated           in England."
    Such then, so far      as  this imperfect account can         go,  was Urbain,

have to record almost the greatest loss
of   the Royal Society of Edinburgh            could have sustained.            When
this   sad event was announced         in December of last year, a universal
note of lamentation was raised             throughout    the   city.     It  was felt
 that   a great   figure  had    been taken away from our ranks            ;  that we
 had lost not only a learned and weighty Judge, but an accomplished
 scholar,   a  distinguished man of letters, a wit and a conversationist
 who contributed salt to all social gatherings,            a racy    Scottish char
 acter, and     " one of the last     links which    connected     the Edinburgh
 of to-day     with the greater Edinburgh          of the past."       But the loss
 which the Royal Society has sustained in Lord Neaves is special
 and peculiar, for he was rarely qualified for              a  literary Fellow of
 this Society,     and as such he bravely played his part and contributed
 his share to our Proceedings, and he has left very few behind who can
 be at all compared with him.        Lord   Neaves possessed not only great in
 tellectual activity and a predilection for scientific research, especially
 into   questions    of philology, but he was" also largely endowed              with
 that quality which has been, on a former occasion,                   referred   to as
 necessary     for the maintenance       of vitality   in a Society like this —
 the quality of "intellectual sociability."           He loved to communicate
 with    others, to tell and to hear, upon topics of literature and science.
  We    can   all call to mind his genial manner, when presiding at
  meetings of the Royal Societj, and the dry humour with which his
  scholarlike papers were interspersed.           An exhibition of the same
  manner at one of the            meetings   of the Social Science           Congress
    vol. ix.                                                              3 x

504                 Proceedings        of the Royal Society
caused     the late Sir    John Bowring to give Lord Neaves the                         nick
 name    of " Wit and Wisdom."
    Lord    Neaves,    who was of Forfarshire               extraction, was born in
 Edinburgh in the year 1800.             He   was educated          at the Edinburgh
 High School,      where    he exhibited        precocious      scholarship,        marked
 intellectual tastes, and that quick, capacious, and retentive memory,
 " wax to receive and marble to retain,"
                                                            by which he was dis
 tinguished to the very end of his life.                  He  was dux         of the High
School in 1814; and then passed through the Edinburgh Univer
sity with distinction,       though it does not appear that he graduated
 — graduation not being          the custom       in   those days.            In  1822 he
 was called    to the bar,      which then included among                  its numbers        a
 brilliant  band of wits and scholars         ;
                                                — the walls of Parliament             House
then resounded        with the talk and the laughter of Lockhart, Pro
fessor    Wilson,    Professor Cheape,        Sir William Hamilton.                 George
 Moir,   Patrick Fraser Tytler,         and Patrick Robertson            :   while among
the    older generation        on    the    Bench     were       Cranstoun,        Jeffrey,
 Murray,     and    Cockburn.         Of    the    spirit    of    those      times     Lord
 Neaves     was the last representative.            In    1841    he was made Advo
cate-Depute        in   1845,     Sheriff    of   Orkney      ;   in   1852,      Solicitor
General; in      1853,    on   the    death    of Lord Cockburn,               he was ap
pointed a Judge in the Court of Session; and in 1858 he                          became      a
 Lord of Justiciary.          The verdict        of Lord        Neaves'       professional
brethren upon his legal qualifications appears to be that he                          was a
great    " case lawyer
                          "—
                               his vast and accurate            memory        giving him
peculiar facilities in referring to precedents,             and that he was highly
distinguished     as a criminal Judge.
    Side by side with the faithful discharge of his professional duties,
Lord Neaves always maintained the part of the man of                                letters.
From the year        1830 onwards he was a constant                  contributor,      both
of prose     and   verse,   to   " Blackwood's Magazine."                   He    was the
author     of a series of articles,          in that periodical,             on Grimm?
"Teutonic       Grammar"        and     Grimm's       "Philological            Magazine,''
which excited much interest at the time, and the republication                             of
which has often been urged.               But his most lasting literary pro
duction will probably be           his volume of " Songs and Verses, social
                                                        '           "
and scientific, by an old contributor to                   Maga,'     which was first
published in 1868.         The motto of this volume might be " Kiden

                         of Edinburgh, Session 1877-78.                               505
tern    dicere verum,      Quid vetat?"        In it playful and kindly satire
appears      in its    best   form, directed against the exaggerations, false
sentiments, or fallacies of the day.              And     the songs themselves         are
so well written          and   so   full of sparkling life        that they may well
continue       to please     many     a  future generation.         His  last published
 work     was   the    " Greek Anthology         for English Headers," and the
 preparation of this was with him indeed a labour of love.                       In it  he
 was able     to combine      his scholarlike fondness for classical antiquity
 with his taste for the witty and the epigrammatic, and it afforded
 him infinite pleasure to labour at reproducing in the most terse and
 elegant English         form   the best flowers out of that garden of happy
 conceits and concinnities bequeathed                 to us    by the Grecian muse.
 This work, though undertaken very                late in life, was highly success
 ful   ; the  renderings were spirited, and they were accompanied                     with
  annotations, in which was much curious learning, very creditable                       to
 one with whom scholarship was not                a business     but   a recreation.
      Lord   Neaves became a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh
  in   1856.     In   1859 he delivered the opening Address of the Session,
  with     a biographical      notice of the venerable          Principal    Lee.      Ten
  years later he gave another opening Address for the Session 1869-70.
   In the same session he read a               paper     on the " Primitive Affinity
  between the Classical and Low German Languages."                         In this   paper
  he argued that the affinities between                old English and Latin must
  have arisen from prehistoric identity or connection, and he pointed
   out   certain   limitations     to which     Grimm's       law of affinities must
  be subjected.         In  1871   he read a communication             "On the Penta-
  tonic and other          Scales   employed      in Scottish Music,"          when airs
  illustrating his views were played               by Mr Bridgman.            In   1872 he
  read a paper on " Some Helps                     to   the    Study of Scoto-Celtic
   Philology," in which           he   pointed out the disguises           which words
  belonging      to the Aryan family of languages assume in passing into
   Gaelic,    and    showed the laws regulating those changes.                      Among
   other points of interest, the paper contained                  a  discussion upon      so
   and do, the Gaelic representatives           of the Sanskrit prefixes            su and
                                                            "
                                                     Sus — well       and " ill."
                                                                    "
   du, which appear in Greek            as tv and
       In   1874    Lord Neaves furnished biographical                  notices    of Lord
    Colonsay, Professor Cosmo Innes, and                  Mr Francis       Deas   ; and in
    1875 he read a paper            "On     some remarkable changes., additions,

506                     Proceedings          of the Royal Society
and omissions of letters                in    certain          cognate     European        words."
This     paper       dealt in a most interesting manner with the transfor
mations of words, and showed                   the identity between many pairs of
words in cognate languages,               where the words themselves                   had grown
to be widely dissimilar.
      In this                                             "
                 place    we may surely say,      Quis desiderio sit pudor aut
modus Tam cari capitis?"                 What he brought to us here from time
to time was part of the stores which                     he was for ever gathering in
his library, where during all leisure hours he would sit, with                               heaps
of volumes           about him, plunged and absorbed                        in books.       In   his
house     many of us have enjoyed his genial hospitality, where, sur
rounded by a bright and intellectual                                                 "
                                                               family, he was himself 3
central   warmth diffusing bliss," ever gay and radiant, a downright
opponent        indeed     of all shams        and       false pretences, but yet with              a
large-hearted          charity for all.        Beneath a laughing                  exterior Lord
Neaves        concealed     steadfast     internal principles ; the writer of this
paper     remembers          the    "   saeva indignatio
                                                          " with
                                                                   which, on one
occasion, he         turned upon a foreign gentleman                      who had uttered         a
flippant and infidel remark.                  In all          the   relations of life      he was
blameless,       and     by his example        he has shown that              it   is possible to
combine        piety, learning, wisdom, and                     hard and successful          work
with kindliness, brightness, laughter and joy.
      By the death of Mr Andrew Coventry, this Society, of which                                 he
had been       for   more than thirty-four years a Fellow, has lost one of the
most amiable and accomplished of its members.                             Both   Mr    Coventry's
father and his grandfather were men of mark.                             His grandfather was
a Congregationalist minister              of some       eminence        near Kelso; his father
was the first Professor of Agriculture in the University                           of Edinburgh,
and is spoken of           in   terms   of admiration in the letters of Niebuhr,
the great       German scholar and historian, who at the beginning                               of
this century was attending classes here.                        Mr Andrew Coventry            was
educated at the        High School of Edinburgh, of which, when he left
it,   he was
                " second dux." He went through course of study at the
                                                                    a
University, and seems to have paid particular attention to chemistry.
In     1823     he was called to the bar, at which he made                         a   good start,
and was apparently rising, when,               in   1   840, he succeeded to the fortune
of his uncle General Cuninghame,                         and relinquished professional

                     of Edinburgh,       Session     1 877-78.                    507
pursuits.    From this time forward he led the life of a dilettante,                 in
the best sense of the word, for he really delighted both in science
and in the fine arts, and         exhibited no mean information in both
these provinces.       The first product of Mr Coventry's leisure, which
has been preserved, consists in        "A   Letter to the Landed Interest of
Scotland," advocating " the         merits of the Association for employing
an agricultural chemist."         This pamphlet, which appeared in 1843,
went through two editions.            Mr Coventry travelled yearly             on the
Continent, taking great interest both in scenery and works of art                      ;
he collected,   to a certain     extent,  both books         and pictures,     and in
 1851 he had     the good fortune to purchase           in Westmoreland         a very
beautiful marble       bust,  which proved to be a genuine              antique,   and
was pronounced by          Mr Burgon of      the   British      Museum to       be the
bust of Antonia Augusta, daughter             of Mark Antony           and   Octavia,
and mother of Germanicus and of Claudius.                        On this discovery
Mr Coventry      read a paper in      1852,   being     his first contribution to
this Society.      It may be mentioned that the bust itself is now the
property of his nephew, Colonel Crighton.                   In  1854 he published
anonymously      a little treatise entitled "The Certainty of Christianity,"
 which he maintained chiefly on historical grounds.                     In   1856   he
delivered the    "Ulbster Hall Lecture," on "          Some of the most curious
Inventions    and     Discoveries of Recent Times."              This lecture gave
evidence   of very extensive reading        and great        fulness of knowledge
as to the results of science, and        the   facts   which it contained         were
set forth in a lively and striking         manner.         In   1857  Mr Coventry
delivered the annual address to the students of the School of Design
under the Board of Manufactures, and in                   so  doing displayed the
feeling and taste of      a connoisseur.     He always took         a great   interest
in the Association for the Promotion of the Fine Arts                   ;  he was for
many years a member of their managing                committee,      and more than
once   presided    at their   annual meeting.          In later life,     becoming    a
director of the Commercial Bank of Scotland, he began to devote
himself to questions       of finance, and in 1870 he read before us his
second    paper, which was entitled         "A   Method for Economizing our
Currency."      The idea was, that by demonetizing the sovereign and
substituting for it notes, which should represent gold hoarded in the
cellars of the Bank of England, a considerable                    saving might be
effected in the wear and tear of gold.           This    idea, though ingeniously

508                    Proceedings of tlie Royal Society
advocated, can hardly be said to have recommended             itself to   practical
financiers.      Of   late, for many months before his death,        Mr  Coventry
suffered from a painful          and excruciating disorder, which he           bore
with manly fortitude and pious resignation.            To the end he continued
to solace himself as far as possible          with his old pursuits.       He    was
one   of  those who take a pride        in always having read and being able
to talk about the       last new book.     His conversation was always genial
and interesting, and his loss has been felt in many circles,                  as    it
must also be in the Royal Society.
    The next name in the obituary for this year is that of Sir Davip
Dundas, Baronet, a gentleman of that class who, without what                     has
been    called a "professional" acquaintance             with    science,   art, or
literature,     are   still acceptable    members   of  a Society    like  this,    if
they show (as they must do by applying for admission) a sympathy
for and interest in our pursuits.           By their admission to be Fellows,
a  mutual compliment is at all events implied.               Sir David     Dundas
was born in 1803.              He was admitted an advocate at the Scottish
bar in 1824, but never practised.             He was a Deputy-Lieutenant          for
Perthshire, and lived the life of an active country gentleman, chiefly
engaged in managing           and improving his beautiful estate of Dunira.
And    he was respected by those who knew him as a most kind and
honourable man.
    By the    death of      Mr John Lothrop Motlet         the Society has lost
one   of  the most celebrated       of its Honorary Fellows.
    Mr Motley       was born at Dorchester, Massachusetts,         on the 15th of
April     1814.       He was educated       at Harvard    Unversity,     where he
graduated      in 1831, at a very early age; after which            he spent two
years in Germany, residing successively           in Gbttingen and Berlin,      and
some additional time          in travel in Italy and other parts of      Southern
Europe.       On his return to America, he studied for the profession              of
the law    ; but, though he was called to the bar in 1837,             he does not
seem     to have      sought for practice.      He had resolved rather          that
literature was his vocation.          In  1839, at the age of five and twenty,
he published        a  novel, called " Morton's Hope, or the Memoirs            of a
Provincial,"      which had little or no success, and is remembered             now
but slightly.        In   1840 he was appointed Secretary       to the American

                      of Edinburgh, Session 1877-78.                             509
Embassy      in Russia    ;  but, after having been for some          time in St
Petersburg, he resigned the appointment.             Thenceforward, for nearly
ten  years, American biographical authorities represent            him     as  living
privately at home, engaged in miscellaneous           studies and contributing
miscellaneously to American periodicals.             A  second novel,      which he
published in 1849, under the           title of " Merry Mount,     a Romance         of
the Massachusetts        Colony," had no better        fortune than the first.
Meanwhile      he had been        finding his true     vein.    The passion         for
history,   apparent     in the title and       conception of this novel,          had
been   manifesting itself more seriously and effectively in occasional
historical   essays.     A review of Tocqueville's         work    on     American
Democracy and a paper on Peter the Great of Russia are mentioned
as having     attracted     especial  notice.    By this   time, indeed,      it  had
became known         among    Mr Motley's friends that       he had fastened on
a great   subject for elaborate        historical treatment    by himself.         No
one had adequately        written the History of the Dutch People and
their Commonwealth;            there  were affinities and attractions recom
mending this subject in a peculiar manner to an American of the
United     States  ;  Mr Motley       had    been   meditating these, and had
determined to make the subject his own.              To qualify himself by the
necessary researches, he came to             Europe again in    1 850,  and lived
for several years at the Hague, and in Dresden and Berlin, im
mersed     in  documents.        The result was the appearance,            in 1856,
when Mr Motley was forty-two years of age,                 of his " Rise of        the
Dutch Republic: A History," in            three volumes.   The work, published
simultaneously in London            and    New York, was eagerly hailed by
readers and reviewers on both sides of the            Atlantic ; translations of
it into  several    European languages         were  at once begun      ;   and   the
author at once took his place among the most eminent writers of his
generation.      Undisturbed        by applauses    and   honours, Mr Motley
persevered in his task.         The volumes      he had published, extending
from the accession        of Philip    II.  of Spain in 1555 to the death of
William the Silent in          1584, had told only the story of the heroic
revolt of the Dutch from the Spanish tyranny and of the triumphant
foundation and beginnings of their little Republic                of the Seven
United     Provinces.       But, in 1860, there       appeared    the     first two
volumes, and     in   1867, the last two, of what was virtually a sequel
in four volumes, though it bore the independent title of            " History of

 510                 Proceedings        of the Royal     Society
 the  United Netherlands from          the Death of     William   the  Silent  to toe
Twelve Years' Truce, 1609."              If  of less riveting interest than the
former work,        these volumes were welcomed as              of high historical
value, and     fully  sustained    the author's reputation.        At the    date of
the   publication of the first two volumes, and also at that of the
publication of the last two, he was domiciled in London,                  — whence
his two prefaces are dated;             but, through nearly six of the inter
mediate years, he had been ambassador               for the United States at the
Court of Vienna, having been appointed to that important post in
November 1861, and removed from it in 1867.                   On the accession of
General Grant to the American presidency in 1869,                  Mr Motley     was
again   in request     for diplomatic service,         and was made American
minister in London.            In  consequence      of some differences    between
him and the American Secretary              of State, he retained the office only
till November      1870.       The rest of his life, which was passed mainly
in England, though with visits to Holland,               was devoted     entirely to
literary labour.      In   1874, under the     title of " The Life and Death of
John of Barneveld, Advocate of Holland,                    with    a  View of     the
Primary Causes and Movements of the Thirty Years' War," he added
two volumes more of Dutch history to his former seven, and brought
his narrative down to the year 1623, when the farther fate of his
 beloved  Dutch      had became       involved in the vast struggle        between
t he opposed forces      of Protestantism and Roman Catholic Absolutism
all over    Europe.       It  had   been his intention to overtake this vast
struggle   too, and,     in the form of an express history of the Thirty
Years' War, to bring the Dutch safely through that great European
entanglement,       on to the Treaty      of Westphalia in     1648, when, in the
general pacification and winding up, the independence                of the United
Provinces      was    at   last formally      declared   and   guaranteed.     This
portion of his projected work he did not live to accomplish.                     He
died,   in an English country-house, on the                 29th of May in       the
present year, at the age        of sixty-three.     Friendships and family      con
nections,   as  well as tastes, had attached him much to England in his
later years.
    Mr Motley      was a man of fine and stately presence, and of gravely
courteous    manners.        Of his private life,    as well as of his services    as
an American public man and diplomatist, accounts                 will probably     be
forthcoming in time.            For  the   world at large,    he lives, and     will

                     of Edinburgh, Sctsion 1877-78.
 live, as the   historian of the Dutch Republic.           It was his distinction
to have     seized the great     subject    in the prime     of his manhood,      to
have clung to it tenaciously through five and twenty years, and lu
have laboured assiduously all that while among archives and original
 authorities for the attainment of the adequate knowledge.                   It Wus
 no less his distinction       to have     infused into his treatment        of the
 subject    the glow and      energy of his own personal convictions, the
 passionate    and eloquent expression        of his sympathies     with the men
and the principles that he believed              to be in the right,       and   his
 detestation of those that he believed to          be in the wrong, on a noted
theatre of human action eight or ten generations                 ago.    So far   as
there are differences        of critical opinion about        his writings, they
 chiefly depend      indeed on the views         that may be taken       as to the
limits of    a  historian's right to interweave his own moral and poli
 tical approbations and censures with his narratives            of the past.     M.
 Guizot, who was an admirer of            Mr Motley, thought that          he went
                                                       "
beyond bounds in this respect, and that his alternations of extreme
                                         "
aversion and strong predilection            were irritating.    The criticism has
been repeated in England since Mr Motley's death.                    He had pro
bably his own theory on the matter,               and  could have defended        it
well.     It  seems to have been an axiom with            him that a historian,
of competent knowledge and power of imagination, may trust him
self to feel   as accurately   about    the persons and transactions       of three
hundred years back         as about    those immediately around him, inas
much     as  there are certain    principles and tendencies of things that
ought to be dear to all humanity, while their opposites                  are into
lerable, — inasmuch      as everywhere      and in all times    a  Philip II. and
all his   belongings    must be execrable, while a        William of Orange or
a Barneveld is to be honoured and revered.               By acting  on this view
of   a historian's duty,     Mr Motley certainly increased the          effect and
popularity of his writings, and it does not appear that he             subtracted
from their permanent        worth.
    Shortly after the appearance of his first historical work,         Mr Motley
was elected a corresponding member of the             Institute of France. He
was also   D.C.L. of Oxford,    and  LL.D. of Cambridge, Leyden, Harvard ,
and other Universities, Continental and American.                 He  was elected
an Honorary Fellow of the Royal              Society of Edinburgh on the 1st
of March 1875.         We   have lost him after a too biief connection.

    The Society has this year to deplore the loss of one of the                           most
eminent of its Honorary Members in the death of Mr                            Talbot.          It
is very rare         indeed     to find a man who attains to anything                  beyond
mediocrity in more than one or two departments                        of knowledge.           Mr
Talbot is       a  remarkable exception to the general                rule.     Seldom       ha.-
tlie world seen          so many-sided       a man.      He attained     to distinction        in
pure mathematics,             in physics, in chemistry, in astronomy, in                archae
ology   ,   and in literature       ;  nor is his name altogether         absent from tiie
records of botanical research.                After studying       at Harrow,    Mr Talbot
graduated        in Cambridge in 1821            ;  and    although his name          appears
on the honour list             in  mathematics,      it  does   not occupy       so    high     a
 position     as    his subsequent        career would       have warranted       us   in    ex
pecting.         In   fact, his early promise was eminence              in classical    litera
 ture,    especially in Greek.            As   an    undergraduate       he obtained         the
 Porson prize for translation into Greek verse of a selected                          passage
 from an English dramatic poet.                    This   was    followed at his gradua
 tion by his obtaining one of the two Chancellor's medals, awarded
 "  to the graduates who show themselves                     the greatest     proficients in
 classical learning."            Linguistic studies, though he never abandoned
 them, had         not that prominence in his after life which might                      have
 been expected            from this beginning.             The year after taking            his
 degree we find him contributing                 to "Gergonne's        Annales"      a paper
 on a mathematical subject,               which was followed up by others in                the
 same serial       ;  and    from that time, for upwards of fifty               years,   there
 emanated         from him an uninterrupted               stream of original papers on
 mathematics,           physics,      astronomy,      chemistry, and       archaeology,       as
 valuable      as    they were varied.         To take even       a  hasty glance      at his
 most      important researches would vastly exceed the                     limits of this
 necessarily       brief sketch.         We must       not, however,     pass by without
 a few     words his great discovery in photography.                     So early    as 1826
  he had      turned his attention to the chemical                action of light          The
 results were communicated                to the   " Edinburgh Journal of          Science
                                                                                                "
 and other periodicals.               In  1833, when       sketching on the shores            of
 Lake Como,            he availed himself of the camera               lucida, and it         oc
 curred to him that images might be fixed on the paper                         by   chemical
 action.       The idea was not altogether novel, but it had not                       as yet
 led   to any definite          result.     On  Mr Talbot's return to England,                he
 commenced           a series of experiments on the decomposition of nitrate

                        of Edinburgh, Session 1877-78.                                513
of    silver by light, which he continued for many years.                    In  1835 he
had      reached the length of producing images on paper by the camera
obscura ; but being anxious to perfect                  his discovery, he contented
himself with issuing brief            notices   of the results        in the " Philoso
                         "
phical Magazine             and the newspapers.          It  was not     until the    31st
of January        1839     that he communicated to the Royal Society the
 first of    the papers on a process which          will  always be associated       with
 his     name.     The     paper   is  entitled "   Some Account          of the Art of
 Photogenic        Drawing,       &c."     This    paper    was     followed up, three
 weeks later, by        a memoir,      describing the process for preparing the
 paper, fixing the image, &c.               The following        year saw    Mr Talbot's
 crowning        discovery — that which         virtually    established     the art as   it
  now exists     — the development of         an invisible image.
      Daguerre in France had been at work at the same subject, using
  metal instead of paper, and his discoveries were given to the world
  almost simultaneously with those of Mr Talbot,                      It is not necessary
  here to refer to the subsequent          history of calotype.          It was beautiful
  at its very birth, and its beauty was recognised                  nowhere    more   fully
  than in Scotland.           Many members of the Society           will  remember how,
  soon after the discovery was made known, the process was employed
  by Dr Adamson and Mr D. O. Hill to the production of life-like
  portraits in a style which has never been excelled.                  The simultaneous
  inventions of the daguerreotype             and    the calotype       naturally created
  jealousies on both sides the Channel.                   Mr Talbot found          a warm
  and able advocate in Sir David Brewster.                   These     controversies   may
   now     be consigned      to oblivion.     If  the   French did injustice to         Mr
   Talbot     in the early days of photography, they made amends                       at a
  later period.       At    the Paris   Exhibition of       1867, the Commissioners
  awarded him the great gold medal                  for his contributions to photo
  graphy, although he was not an exhibitor.
       It  must not    be   inferred from the prominence           given to Mr Talbot's
   connection       with      photography,     that    his    other     contributions     to
   literature and science were unimportant.                  It  is  far otherwise.      In
   the most recent large treatise on the differential and integral calculus,
   that of M. Bertrand, the reader             will find     the name       of Mr Talbot
   associated     with     those   of James Bernoulli,          Fagnani, and       Chasles.
    Mr Talbot       was      one  of the    early promoters          of the    Society     of
   Biblical     Archaeology,     and contributed largely to their Transactions.
    Some    thirty  years ago,    Mr Talbot, Sir Henry Rawlinson, Dr Hinks,

 514                 Proceedings       of the Royal Society
 and M. Appert agreed to decipher independently certain cuneiform
 inscriptions brought from Nineveh, and to compare the results.                 The
 comparison      showed a general harmony amongst             the four  interpreta
 tions, but by no means an identity.                Mr Talbot's genius      was too
 original and of too high an order to fail of recognition.              The Royal
 Society of London conferred            on him both their Royal          and their
 Kumford modal.         It   also assigned     to him the Bakerian Lecture for
  1 856,    the  subject being
                                     " Further    observations    on   the optical
 phenomena        of crystals."      Mr Talbot's contributions to our           own
 Transactions consist for the most part of historical sketches or short
 papers on subjects      lying on the borders        of his early investigations;
 such are the papers on "Format's Theorem," on "Fagnani's               Theorem,"
 &c.     Perhaps an exception to this remark may be found in the              paper
 " On    a new mode    of observing certain spectra," based on experiments
 made in Professor Tait's          laboratory.     In his brief   note  on   "Ano
 malous Spectra" he shows that he long ago anticipated the wonderful
 discovery of Le Roux and Christiansen, but was prevented from pub
 lishing his observations       by the advice of Sir D. Brewster.       In  private
 life Mr Talbot was shy and reserved to strangers, but a lively and ani
 mated talker when in the congenial          society of old friends, such as Sir
 David Brewster, and indeed of some younger men whom he honoured
 with his friendship.         He sat for two years in the first Reformed
 Parliament.       Of this  he was reminded by Lord Palmerston, when in
 1 863    the University     of Edinburgh       conferred     on these two    men,
 so very unlike       each other,     the honorary degree of       LL.D.     Many
 honours from foreign societies were conferred            on  Mr Talbot,   but it is
 not easy to record        them,    from the fact that, with the accustomed
 modesty      of true genius, he shunned to display them.
     He died September        17, 1877, in his 78th year.
     Dr James Bryce          was    born at Killaig,     near   Coleraine, in   the
 north of Ireland, on October 22, 1806.                 He was the    third  son of
 a  Scottish Presbyterian minister, who had settled there three               years
 before,     and obtained the earlier part of his education from his
 parents, who were both, in somewhat             different ways,   persons   of  re
markable intellectual gifts and cultivation.            At the age of fourteen   he
was sent to the University of Glasgow, where his father and              his eldest
brother had been before him, and where he graduated M.A., receiv
ing from it in after life the honorary degree of LL.D.                   There he

                    of Edinburgh,            Session     1877-78.                       515
threw himself, with characteristic               ardour,    into the studies         of the
classes, winning,      among      other distinctions,          the Greek Blackstone
prize, which was then, and appears to be still considered,                        the most
 considerable honour awarded in the linguistic                      classes.     Although
he had    been from childhood fond of nature and all natural objects,
the bent of his mind towards                  science   did not definitely express
itself till he accepted, at the age of twenty, the post of head of the
 mathematical department         in the Belfast Academy, then one of the
 chief foundation       schools     in     Ireland,     and     of   which      his eldest
brother, the Rev. Dr Bryce of Belfast (who is still living) was then
 Principal.     Finding the teaching of geography to belong to his
department, he at once saw what hardly any one had then                                seen,
 how important        a  branch        of    that     subject     physical     geography
constitutes, and perceived that to deal adequately                    with it a know
ledge of geology and mineralogy was necessary.                     From these he was
led on to zoology and botany, and not only threw himself into these
topics himself with characteristic              ardour,   but formed       large     classes
for their study, which were attended                as  well by his own pupils            as
by other young people in the town.                     At   the same time           he had
begun to connect the teaching              of natural philosophy with that of
mathematics, explaining and illustrating                 by experiments          the lead
ing principles of mechanics,            pneumatics,        hydrostatics, electricity,
chemistry,    and    other    cognate       branches      of     inquiry.       We     have
listened to   so many discussions          during the last few years respecting
the necessity of giving to natural science                a   regular and important
place in schools and colleges, and now               see so much       actually done to
effect that object, that    it  is hard to realize the state of opinion                 and
practice in these matters          fifty years ago, when such                educational
reforms were unheard of, and little beyond                     Latin   and    Greek was
taught in all the best schools of the United Kingdom.                        It  needed a
very warm love for science, and              a very elevated        view of the func
tions of education, to lead a young man in those days to introduce, on
his own idea,   so great a change         in the established        method of instruc
tion.   An   able   teacher    perpetuates         himself through his disciples,
and   many eminent scientific workers trace back to Dr Bryce the
first impulse towards,       the    first guidance in, the study of nature
which they received.        His     services      in promoting, by example              and
by argument,     both in Belfast and afterwards              in Glasgow, the intro-

516                 Proceedings of        the  lioyal Society
duction of these subjects         into  a school    course can hardly be over
estimated.       While  inspiring others with his own tastes, he had also
begun to do valuable scientific work on his own account,                     partly in
botany and       mineralogy, but chiefly in geology.             He investigated
and described      certain  interesting fossil plant beds (similar to the
leaf beds of Mull) occurring on the shores of Lough Neagh, and con
                                                  "
tributed to the " Philosophical Magazine            an account of the important
discovery     which he had made of the remains of the Plesiosaurus in
the lias of Antrim,      which conclusively established          its identity with
the lias series of England.         Pursuing his researches into the geology
of the northern counties        of Ireland, he was the first accurately to
examine      and describe      the   structure of the       remarkable         basaltic
 formations    on the coasts, and particularly of the Giant's Causeway.
 A  series of papers      contributed to the Journals          of the Geological
 Societies   of London and Dublin, of which he had become                    a  Fellow
in 1834, attest his activity in observation; while in Belfast itself he
was one of the        most active     members of a local        scientific     society,
which numbered         many men of eminence           among    its members, and
exerted    a   powerful influence      on   the culture of the town, now the
 most prosperous     in Ireland.
    He removed in 1846 to Glasgow, on being appointed                  head of the
mathematical      and geographical        department    in the     High     School     of
that city.      Here, in a larger field, he continued the same enlightened
system of science teaching which             he  hid   started    in Belfast.        He
joined the Philosophical         Society,   was soon     placed    on   its Council,
and was      for three   years    its president,    delivering in that capacity
addresses in which he reviewed          the progress of scientific inquiry, and
discussed some of the main           problems     now lying      before     it with     a
 completeness     and   accuracy which supplies remarkable              evidence of
 the width of his cultivation, as well as the keenness of his observing
and reflective    powers.     There was scarcely a department              of   science
 of whose leading principles and method              he did not       show     himself
 master, a remarkable      achievement      in an   age   when every study           has
 become     so  much    sub-divided.       His   geological   work      during      this
period    lay chiefly but not exclusively in          the   Clyde basin and           its
surrounding mountain groups.             Papers on      the
                                                             " Parallel      Roads of
 Lochaber" and the "Glacial Phenomena of the Lake                         District     of
th,) North of England " were followed
                                                   by a systematic        treatise    on

                        of Edinburgh, Session 1877-78.                                  517
    The Geology       and other Natural Phenomena of Arran,"                    which has
reached a fourth edition,             and   constitutes the         most    complete     and
satisfactory account of that interesting island.
     Latterly     he had     devoted     himself chiefly to the           geology     of the
North-West Highlands — first               to   that    of Skye and Raasay,            after
 wards to the determination of the                age   of those     rocks in Ross and
 Sutherland         which     have    excited so much discussion among our
 leading      geologists.      In  several     expeditions       he    had visited       and
 examined        the  sandstones       of Loch      Torridon      and    the    remarkable
 limestones of Assynt and Durness.                   It  was while on his way north
 ward to complete these investigations that he met, at Inverfarigaig,
 on the shores of Loch Ness, with the accident which closed his life,
 by the fall of      a  pile of loose rocks         which    he was trying         with his
 hammer.
      He  was then      (July   11, 1877) seventy-one           years   of   age,  but still
 in full strength of body            and    mind,     with   his interests       in science
  unabated.        He had come in 1874, on resigning his post at Glasgow,
 to live among       us  in Edinburgh, had been elected to this Society, and
 seemed      likely  to prove one of its most           zealous   and useful members,
  when he fell by         a  heroic death        in the service       of the science        to
  which     his energies and talents had been so long consecrated.
      As    an    observer    Dr Bryce        was     unwearied and          careful,   as   a
  describer and lecturer eminently lucid and                   graphic.       He had also
  the gift of being able to communicate               to others his own enthusiasm,
  and    it   was   in great measure         this, joined      to   a   warm and genial
  manner, that made him so successful                   as  a   teacher.      His   love   for
  nature and her beauties rose to             a passion    rare    even    among      men of
  science; a ramble among woods and mountains was always to him                              a
  pleasure far more intense than any which ambition could promise or
  wealth purchase.           His intellect    was indeed an          imaginative one,       as
  appeared both in the vivid descriptions of scenery which occur here
  and there in his scientific papers, and in his own love for poetry and
  the dramatic aspects of history, branches                of literature to which he
   had been devoted from boyhood
      Although it      is as a man of science that he was chiefly known,                   Dr
   Bryce     took an active       part    in current questions,           especially    those
   relating     to education.       He was one of the first — perhaps              the very
   first — in Scotland      to insist on the necessity        for  a reform     in the con

 518                 Proceedings of (he Royal Society
 stitution of the Scottish Universities, and on the recognition of                    the
 right of     the  graduates      to  a share    in   their    government, and         he
 organised    the  first association     formed for that purpose.             He    held
 strongly that the educational system of Scotland ought to                    preserve
 its distinctive character,     instead of being administered from London
 and assimilated to that of England.             Among        minor reforms which
 he advocated     was that of the introduction            of  a  decimal system         of
 coinage,    weights, and      measures,     on   which      he wrote a short but
 weighty treatise.
    Besides    the   geological     writings   already mentioned, he was              the
 author of several educational           books, such as treatises on algebra,
 geometry,    and the elements of astronomy, and a cyclopaedia of                   geo
 graphy.      Most of these have gone through several editions.
    It  only remains to add that         Dr Bryce's gifts       as a scientific writer
and teacher were not more remarkable than the simplicity and charm
of his character.        He retained into old         age    not only the fire and
freshness     of youth,      but    a   perfect sweetness        of temper, and        an
ungrudging readiness to place his time and knowledge at the service
of others, which advancing years seldom spare.
    His memory      as that of one     of  the   most    lovable of men will          be
long cherished by hundreds of former pupils, with many of whom,
scattered through India and the Colonies, he kept up intimate                      rela
tions,   and by the large circle of scientific friends whom                   he was
accustomed      to meet year after year         at the meetings       of the British
Association and of our own learned societies.
    The liev. David Thomas              Ker    Dkummond, descended            from     a
very old Highland         family of that name, was the youngest                son of
James Drummond            of Strageath, and was           born at Edinburgh          on
25th August 1805.           He  was educated at the        High School       and the
University      of Edinburgh,        with   the   view     of entering     the legal
profession; but he subsequently proceeded                  to Worcester      College,
Oxford, where he took his bachelor's                 degree    in   1830.    He    was
ordained a deacon the same year by the Bishop of Llandaff,                         and
a priest    in  1831    by the Bishop of Gloucester and Bristol.                   For
the first two years         of    his   ministry    he occupied       the   office   of
curate   at Henbury       and Compton, and then came to Edinburgh,
where     he   entered   into    the   incumbency       of St Paul's      Episcopal

                     of Edinburgh,       Session 1877-78.                      519
Episcopal Chapel, Carrubber's           Close.    Having     remained     here  for
six  years, he became joint-minister        of Trinity Chapel, Dean Bridge,
along with the late Mr Coventry, where                he laboured    with    much
acceptability,     until his connection with          the  Scottish    Episcopal
Church     was severed     in 1842.     He then became incumbent of St
Thomas's English        Episcopal Chapel, and remained in the spiritual
oversight    of the congregation       there   for upwards      of thirty years.
During     the  long period of his ministry in Edinburgh,             Mr Drum-
Diond endeared himself to his congregation,            both by his public and
private ministrations.       With    the ministers of other denominations
he was always on the most cordial and friendly terms, and no good
work, having for its object       the    religious or moral improvement of
 the people, ever failed to elicit his co-operation       and sympathy.         By
the general public he was long known at once              as   the zealous advo
cate   and upholder of English        Episcopalianism in Scotland, and           as
an active and valued friend of evangelical movements.              His writings,
also, although not extensive,         served    to   bring his name before        a
considerable section      of the community.          The most noteworthy of
these were, a series of Lectures on the          17th    Chapter of St John's
Gospel,    a Life of Montague Stanley,        and Scenes and Impressions in
Switzerland and the North of Italy.
   Mr Drummond          became a Fellow of the Royal Society            in  1868.
He   was fond of intercourse     with the lovers of literature and science,
and took much pleasure         in the study of natural science, especially
during his    residence in the country, and his visits to the Continent
of Europe.       He was also an excellent photographer,            and executed
some fine views of Scottish scenery.
   Mr Drummond, who           was   not a man of a strong constitution,
resigned his charge with advancing years, in the autumn of 1875,
and only a short time ago he changed his residence from Edinburgh
to Pitlochry.       He was in his usual        spirits on Friday, 8th June,
and went to bed in apparently good health.              Early on the morning
of the 9th, he was seized with sudden illness, and died in a few
minutes, leaving a widow and a widowed only daughter to mourn
his loss.
   He    was   buried in the churchyard overlooking the picturesque
loch at Duddingstone, in the grave where he had laid his only son
forty years before. The service was read by Bishop Beckles, assisted
   vol-. IX.                                                         3 7.

which he had been held.            His funeral    sermon was preached        in  St

burgh in 1867,       and died suddenly at Oban on 26th                July   1877.
He    was   born   at   Peebles    on    22d March       1809,    and   with    the
exception of the first seven         years, all his life-time      was  spent     in
Glasgow.      At the   age of thirteen he entered         a printing    establish
ment, and continued       in it till he was   twenty years of age.       In   1832
he became      sub-editor of the " Scottish Guardian," and contributed
 many valuable scientific articles to that newspaper.                He attended
also scientific classes at the     University of Glasgow        and the Ander-
sonian College.      He   was a  pupil of the Botanical     class  in the former,
 during   the year     1843    when      Dr   Balfour     was    Professor.     He
 ultimately   became    principal    editor of the     " Guardian."      He    was
 connected    with the     paper    for   twenty-seven years.        Mr Keddie
 afterwards    lecturerd    on   Natural     History in the Free Church
 College.    He    made    an   excellent collection of geological             and
 zoological specimens,     which were handed over to the College.               He
 was   elected   Secretary of the Glasgow Philosophical              Society   and
 editor of its Transactions.       He published accounts of his visits            to
 various  Botanic Gardens in Britain,        as  well as to the Bass Rock and
 the Highlands     of Scotland.       His kind and genial manner          and his
 fine flow of spirits made him a most pleasant companion in scientific
 excursions.     His  loss is much felt by the followers of science in
 Glasgow.

                     of Edinburgh, Stsuion 1876-77.                               521
                2.  Report of the Deputation to Upsala.
                       By Alexander Buchan, M.A.
    The Deputation appointed by the Council to represent the Society
on the     occasion   of the 400th anniversary of the founding of the
University      of   Upsala consisted        of Mr Sprague and myself.
Professor      Balfour   and Professor      Sir Wyville       Thomson, who re
presented the Edinburgh University,            also joined the Deputation.
    The    Latin Address from the Society for presentation by                      the
Deputation      having been prepared, was signed in the absence of the
President by the Secretary.           The Address, a copy of which accom
panies the Report, is in its conception and execution,             a  characteristic
specimen of quaint and          exact   Latinity.     It is wholly the work of
Mr   Gordon, the Society's Assistant Librarian.
    The Deputies assembled          by previous arrangement at the Grand
Central     Railway Station, Stockholm, on the afternoon of Tuesday,
September 4, to be conveyed by royal express                    train   to    Upsala.
At    4.15   p.m.  the train left the station amid the cheers and con
gratulations of an immense          assemblage     of  the inhabitants.         About
seven o'clock Upsala was reached,           and the whole of the inhabitants
appeared to have assembled            at the station to do honour to their
guests.      Of this   great  assemblage,    the white caps of the students
filled   the whole central space.         Young Count Hamilton,              in name
of the    students,  welcomed the Deputies, and thereafter the renowned
choir of this University       sang one   of  the Swedish national airs.
    In   the evening a meeting         of all the Deputies was held for the
purpose of deciding on the order of procedure                  to be observed in
presenting the Addresses on the Wednesday.                  Since the number of
 learned bodies represented         amounted to about seventy,            it  was   re
solved that, to save time, the different bodies be grouped                        into
 nationalities, the Deputies choosing their own representative                speaker,
while the Addresses would              be  presented     without     remark.      The
 British     Deputies    chose   Professor Balfour       as their representative
 speaker.      The British Deputies were, in addition to those already
 named, Professor        Humphry for Cambridge University, and they
  were  joined by Dr Curling of London, Fellow of the Royal Society,

    522              Proceedings        of the Royal Society
   the Rev. Ch.    H. H. Wright, Belfast, Bampton Lecturer elect ; and
   the Rev. Mr Metcalfe, Senior Fellow, Lincoln College, Oxford.
      The festivities of the 5th were opened with salvos of cannon
   from the castle and peals of hells from the cathedral, and the               streets
   were early astir with crowds already in evening costume.                   By   nine
   o'clock the side aisles and tribunes of the transept of the cathedral
   were filled to overflowing with gaily dressed ladies.             The   procession
   formed   in the upper hall of the       Carolina Rediviva — the University
   Hall — which is   a handsome       structure built on    a fine site overlooking
  the city.    It then wound its way slowly down ths beautiful avenue
  of limes called Odin's Grove to the cathedral, headed appropriately
  by the     students with     their guests from the other Scandinavian
  Universities, with the appropriate banners             of the thirteen nations
  into which the Upsala students are divided;               followed in order by
  representatives   of the Universities       and learned Societies of Sweden,
  Iceland, Copenhagen, Helsinfors, and Christiania; representatives of
  the   Parliaments,    the officials of the University of Upsala,                  the
  Charter of its foundation        being carried by the Secretary of the
  Academy;      State Councillors        and   Knights of the order of              the
  Seraphim;     and other      civil,    military,    and    Court    functionaries,
 members      of Parliament, and the Honorary Doctors, the rear being
 brought up by the municipal and other authorities of the city, and
 by all the other not included in the above.              When all     were seated,
 Professor Sahlin, the rector, went out to receive the King, Crown
 Prince, and their suite.       The cantata composed for the occasion by
 Mr Charles D.        de  Wirsen      was   a   striking   feature    of  the   day's
 festivities.    A Latin   service    having been performed by Archbishop
 Sundberg, the Rector welcomed             the Deputies in a        Latin    oration,
 and thereafter the Deputies presented             the Addresses    in  the inverse
 order in which they had joined the procession.                A  speech from the
Rector and the concluding part of the cantata brought the ceremony
to an end about 2.30 p.m.
     At  3 p.m. a dinner was given by the University in a large hand
some hall, specially     built for the festivities in the Botanic           Garden.
The King presided, and covers were laid for 450 guests.                  By   far the
best speech on the occasion was the King's, in reply to the toast of
his health, proposed      by the Rector.        He   urged   the advantages      of  a
scientific and classical education to even the poorest of his subjects                ;

                           of Edinburgh,     Session 1877-78.                             523
sketched with a rapid but firm hand the condition of Sweden when
the University was founded, and the salient points of its subse
quent history         ;   and the important part played by the University,                  as
seen in itsbrilliant history during these 400 years ; gave expression
to a fervent prayer that it would continue to maintain and extend
its renown       ;   and concluded a most animated and eloquent speech by
announcing the gift of 40,000 kronors (2000 guineas) from the Crown
to the University for the encouragement of scientific research.
   The town was illuminated                during the evening, and what may be
called the club-houses of the various " nations
                                                "
                                                  were thrown open
by the students, with the view of giving the guests some idea of this
characteristic phase of student life at Upsala.
   The ceremonial            of the Thursday          was the conferring        of degrees,
which statedly takes place in June, at the close of the spring session,
but which was appropriately deferred                    this year so     as   to form part
of the quater-centenary             commemoration.             The festivities of this
day were ushered            in with the same formalities, and fortunately with
the same brilliant weather            as    favoured those of the previous day.
The   doors of the cathedral were thrown open                    at 8.30 a.m., and the
seats set apart for the ladies were rapidly filled, the best places this
day being reserved, not as on the Wednesday in accordance with
social position, but for the friends of those who were to be                             mule
doctors in the four faculties.
   The procession set out from the Carolina Rediviva at 9.15 a.m.,
differing       from the procession        of the day before in the chief place
being assigned to the four Faculties and the doctors elect                        ;   and all
were in due time seated in their places in the cathedral in the same
admirable        order     that marked the whole proceedings.                     The King,
Crown Prince, and their suite              were again present,          being received in
the porch by the Chancellor of the University,                    the Archbishop,          the
Rector, and the four Promoters.                 The cantata for the promotion was
the work of Mr Victor Rydberg,                   a popular poet,         and one of the
eighteen of the Swedish Academy.                      This   cantata,    with   the     music
set to    it,   was, like the cantata      of   the    previous day, of       a   very high
order of merit, and was admirably rendered by the choir.
  The       ceremony        of promotion        occupied     about three        hours,     the
degrees     so conferred being strictly limited                to persons       resident in
Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Finland, the universities                                of these

524                 Proceedings      of the Royal Society
countries being in peculiarly close relationship with that of Upsala.
The new doctors of medicine, law, and philosophy are nominated
by these respective      Faculties of the University        ;  but the doctors of
theology are nominated by the           King from      a list submitted         to him
by the Theological Faculty.
   Among the many quaint traditional               forms with which the cere
monial was conducted may be mentioned the firing off of a piece
of  ordnance    instantly on the crowning of each doctor;               a  gold    ring
put on the finger of each doctor in law, medicine, and philosophy                       ;
the   crowning      of  the  doctors   of philosophy with wreaths of real
laurel; and the recrowning of doctors of fifty years' standing, a con
siderable number of such jubilee doctorates being conferred.                         At
3 p.m. the  promotion dinner was given in the large hall in the Botanic
Garden, covers being laid for 1600.            At dinner and during the rest
of the evening the doctors of philosophy                still wore their laurel
wreaths.
   In  the meantime      the gates  of the Botanic Garden had been             thrown
open to the dense throng of the public which had been waiting                      out
side.   Shortly thereafter      the  King and     rest of the company repaired
to the open portico of the Hall, where speeches in all languages were
delivered to the assembled crowds, first in front of the fine statue of
Linnaeus,   which was crowned with laurel on the occasion, and after
wards from the broad staircase of the building, commanding a fine
view of the dense crowd which filled the broad avenue                     leading to
the Castle.     Among the speakers were Chancellor Count Hamilton,
Donders of Utrecht,        Topelius the popular Scandinavian               poet,   and
Professor Balfour.        The speeches were varied with songs from the
students,  whose white caps filled the middle space of the avenue,
and whose      wild but well-ordered enthusiasm forms                  one     of   the
pleasantest   reminiscences     of the festivities.     As darkness        set  in  the
gardens were      illuminated, and a little later there was a display of
fireworks,   some      of the pieces     being very      fine,   particularly      one
representing     the new buildings of the University            which are in con
templation.      The festivities     of  the   day ended       with   a torchlight
procession   of about 1000 students,        who marched with their banners
to the stirring music of the choir that led the procession                 on to the
Castle, to pay their respects to the King.
   On the     Friday     the  large   hall   of  the   Carolina    Bediviva        was

                      of Edinburgh, Session 1876-77.                                 525
crowded by twelve o'clock with an audience of about 4000, for the
concert given by the celebrated             choir of the students.         The mem
bership of the choir is limited to 500, and           as  all in Sweden are taught
music in the elementary and secondary                   schools,   and   as   it is    re
garded    an object of ambition           to be admitted a member,              there    is
no difficulty     in maintaining        the choir in       a state   of the highest
efficiency.      On    this,  as   on other      high     occasions,   old members
wearing the little rosette of membership              were permitted to        join   the
choir.    It  is enough to say that the concert was a very fine one, and
it  may be added that a degree of excellence               was achieved     which no
existing university choir could rival.               The pieces selected for the
concert were essentially Scandinavian, and were remarkable for the
strong patriotism         and    inextinguishable        love   of freedom         which
breathed through them, and for              a desire  for union among the three
Scandinavian       nations.     In    the  evening the town gave            a   ball, at
which the King, Crown Prince, and suite, and about 7000 guests
were present in the hall        in  the Botanic Garden        — a hall, by    the way,
which    was levelled     with the ground       on the following      day.
    By mid-afternoon of Saturday the             guests had      returned to Stock
holm, and at 6.30        p.m. they met at the pier to be conveyed                 by six
steamers, specially      engaged for the purpose, to Drottningholm               Palace.
Invitations to supper were issued by His Majesty to 700 guests.                      The
magnificent rooms of this the stateliest of the summer palaces about
Stockholm were thrown open to the guests,                     the King freely and
cordially mingling with the company,              as he    did during the whole of
the festivities.      After supper the foreign           deputies    were invited       to
meet    His Majesty in      one of the larger rooms, where, after a graceful
speech,    to which one of the deputies              replied, the     King      touched
glasses, and shook hands           with many of        the deputies,     and bade         a
cordial    good-bye     to all.      The grounds of the palace were finely
illuminated.
    Thus worthily terminated the commemoration                    solemnities of the
400th anniversary of the founding of Upsala University,                       the cele
bration     and festivities being conducted in a manner and with                          a
munificence of which Upsala and Sweden may well be proud.

Deputation, is      as follows : —

 'X   On   a   Method      of Determining         the    Cohesion of Liquids
                          By J. B. Hannay, F.C.S.
                                     (Abstract.
     In this  paper the author concludes that the measurement             of   the
breaking-strain of liquids is the only universally applicable method
of measuring their cohesion        ;  and as dropping is the phenomenon           in
which the breaking-strnin can be most easily measured, he examines
the    work already done in this direction.           Dr Guthrie's theory that*

                       of Edinburgh, Session 1877-78.                               527
 the    increase  in  the size of drop, with         the    increase   in [the rate of
 dropping, is due to the attraction of the solid tearing more of the
 root of the drop in low than in high rates is put to                a crucial test by
 an experiment in which mercury drops                   from a wide glass tube        so
 arranged that the tube only acts as a support for a column of liquid
 from the end of which the drops fall.               In this   case there is no    solid
 to reclaim by adhesion        any of the drop, and yet there is the same
 increase in size    as the rate increases.        The author accounts for the
 increase as    follows : — 1. The rupture of           the neck of a drop is not
 an instantaneous      process, but lasts for a short time, and during that
 time liquid is flowing into the drop through the neck, and the faster
 the   flow the greater is the increment of the drop during rupture.
 2.  When the      rate is high the breaking neck has a longer               life-time,
 as the   stump follows after the full drop as in the beginning of the
 formation of a stream.        Briefly stated, the quicker the rate the larger
 the drop, because more       liquid flows into        the drop after the rupture
 has   commenced,       and the longer        does    that    flow   continue.      The

 author calls a drop when it begins               to break      a  "normal       drop   ;
 and to find its weight he determines               the    decrease of weight with
 decrease of rate, and reduces the latter to zero when the weight of a
normal drop is found.         Apparatus is shown by which experiments
 were carried out, and inaccuracies           eliminated.       The normal drop is
found to weigh 0-4130 grm., and              as the   width of the neck is found
to be 3-395      mm.,    this gives     a  breaking strain of       0- 0456 grm. per
square millimeter for mercury at 16° C.

The results given in this         section       were laid before       the  Society in
 May    1876, but were mislaid,      with other          papers then read.
    (8.) The great desideratum in the application of quaternions to
problems such as those just treated, seems to lie in the discovery of
 the general solution of the equation
                                   Vr     =    0,
 where r is a quaternion.           Unfortunately            this  seems   to  depend
 ultimately   upon Laplace's equation,              treat   it how    we may.     It  is

easily seen to be equivalent to the kinematical problem of                                finding
a    displacement which           shall produce                 no      compression,   but shall
produce     a rotation whose            vector axis itself corresponds                  to a dis
placement      without compression.
     The nature     of the difficulty is            also easily seen in another              way    ;
for, when we try to find the conditions of integrability                               of such an
equation    as
                                        V .\dp.     = dv,
we may, of course, make the assumption
                                          dp. = ipdp
where the coefficients       of   tf>   are functions of p.                  This gives at once
                                   Sad    p.   =   S.
                                                    tp'atlp       ,
so that
                                                        =

whatever constant vector be              a.
     Suppose     this satisfied, we have the farther condition
                                        \.Xtpdp     =       dv,
or

                                  Y.Vtp'(VaX)               =   0
Taken in conjunction with the former condition, this shows that
V    may here be considered         as operating on                   X   only.
     In this very particular      case,       however, we find at once that              X   must
be constant,      and that

  In "Trans. R.S.E." (1864-5) Fox Talbot                                 proved      very simply, by
means     of        a species of co-ordinates            depending on confocal             conies, the
following theorem, at the same time asking for                                a   simple geometrical
proof.
  If two sets           of   three concentric circles, with the same common differ
ence    of radii,       intersect one another            — the chords of          the arcs intercepted
on the mean circle                 of   each     series by the extremes             of   the other are
equal.
  A     properly geometrical                proof may possibly be obtained by show
ing that the middle points of these arcs are equidistant from the
line joining the centres.                   It   is,   of course, quite easy to build up             a
quasi-geometrical             proof, but Talbot's would be much better.
  The following investigation shows the nature of the theorem, and
gives some elegant constructions.
  Let     d        be the common            difference,        b   and   c   the mean radii, and a
the distance           between          the centres.        Then the square of one of the
chords        is   easily seen to be

 centres, give the areas of the quadrilaterals above mentioned.                                                         Or,
 better,        the    triangles whose angular points are the middles                                              of   the
 arcs respectively,               and the centres, have areas equal to                                   half    the sum
 and half the difference of the quadrilaterals.
       The symmetry of these expressions shows that in Talbot's                                                  theorem

 in which       the sounds are reproduced.                           He    stated that he believed           it
 would      soon be possible                to employ the instrument for the study of
 internal changes of form in all bodies, and also that in its construc
 tion    magnets might be entirely dispensed with.                                      He   also stated that
 Mr James Blyth had with                       success substituted                  a   copper plate for the

536                  Proceedings of    the  JRoyal Society
iron disc in the receiving telephone, and had found that even wood,
vulcanised india-rubber, tinfoil, and paper, might be employed           for
the    same purpose    — though not with very good results. In the
transmitting instrument Mr Blyth had managed to employ a block
of iron    8 inches thick.
    Professor Tait also exhibited       a  double mouthpiece,  by means of
which it is easy for two players to produce          chords from a French
horn.

     Some time ago I made some experiments on " Suspension of Clay
in Water, and in Acid and Saline Solutions." These formed the
subject of several communications to the Royal Physical Society of
Edinburgh, and were afterwards published in the "Chemical News."
 I   shall describe some of these experiments as an introduction to this
 paper.
       1st.   Clay in Water.    — A few grains of      fine white clay were stirred
 up with about        a pint of pure water in a glass jar.          The time which
  the water took to clear and the clay to deposit itself in the jar was
  noted, and found        to be about 30 to 36 hours.
       2d.    Clay, Water, and Acid.        — To  a similar quantity of clay and
  water were added         a few drops of acid (various acids were tried, with
  the same result in each case), and the time the liquid took to clear
  again noted.        In   this  case,   the time was from half an hour to one
   hour, according to the quantity of acid used.              So sensitive   was this
   action, that when the water was just touched with              a glass rod dipped
   in sulphuric     acid, the time of clearing      was greatly shortened.
        3d.   Clay, Water, and Salt. — In place of acid, salts of various
   kinds (including       common       salt (NaCl)   ) were added to the clay and
    water, and the effect in every case was to shorten             the time   of pre
   cipitation of the clay and clearing of the water, according                 to the
    kind and quantity of        salt used.     As  bearing on the precipitation of
    salt at the mouths of rivers,         I  may  mention that the water taken
    from the end of Leith pier was about the best mixture for precipi
    tating the clay quickly.
        4th. Clay,     Water, and Alkali. — The alkalis (potash, soda, and
    ammonia)      were next tried with the clay and water, and when added
    in very small quantities instead of hastening the precipitation of the
     clay, like the acids and salts, they retarded         it so that in some    cases
     it was 90 hours before the liquid was clear.              In larger quantities
     they acted like the acids and salts.
        In   endeavouring to ascertain the cause of these phenomena,            I was
     led  to experiment on various solutions, and obtained results which

 538                Proceedings       of the Royal Society
 appear to me very interesting, and to open up a               line of   research
 likely to lead   to important results as to the laws of           solution    and
 chemical   affinity.   The following       are the more important       facts   as
 yet determined     :—
     1. NaCl and HCl. — To           a saturated    solution   of common       salt
 (NaCl)   was added     some strong hydrochloric        acid (HCl).     Salt   was
 rapidly precipitated on each addition of acid.             This action of HCl
 is usually described     by saying that salt is insoluble in hydrochloric
acid, but the mode of action does not seem to have attracted                atten
tion.    The following experiments throw some light on the matter.
    2.  Na2S04 + IOH20 and HCl.— To a saturated solution in
water of sodium sulphate was added strong solution of hydrochloric
acid.    Anhydrous sodium sulphate was quickly precipitated.                 This
precipitate    was    quickly    dissolved on the addition         of a further
quantity of HCl.         In this    case  it cannot be said that anhydrous
sodium sulphate is insoluble            in  hydrochloric acid, because it is
dissolved by it when added after its precipitation.               The action is
exactly analogous to what occurs when ammonia is added to a salt
of zinc  ; the ammonia      first combines with the acid of the zinc salt
throwing     down a precipitate of zinc oxide, then, on a further
quantity of ammonia being added,             the zinc oxide is dissolved.      In
like manner, in the        case  of solution of sodium sulphate the         HCl
first combines with the water and precipitates             the anhydrous salt,
and then, by a further addition of acid, the salt is again dissolved.
This is   made more clear by the next experiment.
    3.  Crystals of Na^SOi + 10H2O and HCL— Strong hydro
chloric acid was poured over some undissolved crystals of sodium
sulphate.     Rapidly    the crystals    were broken up, the water uniting
with the acid, and the anhydrous salt left, which, as in the former
case, was   dissolved by the addition of more acid
                            — To a saturated solution in water of calcium
    4.  CaCl2 and HCl.
chloride was added some strong hydrochloric acid.                No action was
apparent.     As calcium chloride         has a strong affinity    for  water,  I
concluded    that the affinities were balanced       in the two solutions, and
therefore   there was no action.         To upset  this balance, if it existed,
I  added to the hydrochloric         acid solution some fragments       of  solid
calcium    chloride,   which,     as   anticipated,   rapidly   dissolved   with
effervescence,   expelling hydrochloric acid gas copiously.            Further,

                          of Edinburgh, Session 1877-78.                            539
      5. A      weighed    quantity of solid calcium chloride was dissolved in
a measured quantity of              water,   and the rise in temperature        noted.
This        was 15° Fahr.
      6. The       same quantity of calcium chloride was dissolved           in  strong
hydrochloric acid and the rise in temperature                 also noted.    This   was
 6° Fahr., being a difference of 9°, accounted                for, no doubt, by the
 vapourising of the hydrochloric acid gas expelled in the latter case.
       7. NaCl and CaClT — Calcium chloride, both in solution and
 solid,       was added to saturated       solution of common salt, and in both
 cases the sodium salt was precipitated,              the calcium chloride taking
  its place in        the solution.
       8.    HCl     and H2SOv — Strong sulphuric acid was added to strong
  hydrochloric acid, when the latter as gas was expelled with effer
  vescence.
        9.    CaSOJICl       and H2S04. — Strong sulphuric acid was added
   to a       saturated   solution of calcium sulphate in hydrochloric acid,
   when calcium sulphate            was precipitated, and hydrochloric         acid gas
   expelled.
        I next     looked about for two solvents         which would dissolve        the
   same substance, and yet precipitate it when mixed.                    These   results
    I  found with sulphuric         acid, water, and calcium sulphate.
        10.     CaSOv     Water, and JI2SOv — To a saturated               solution   of
    calcium       sulphate   in  water   was added     some strong     sulphuric acid.
    On cooling, the calcium          sulphate   was precipitated.
        11.     CaSOv S2SOi          and   Water. — To     a saturated solution of
    calcium sulphate        in  sulphuric   acid  was  added   water.    As before, on
    cooling, calcium sulphate was precipitated.
         1 2.   Two solutions (saturated) of calcium sulphate, one in water
     and one in sulphuric acid, were mixed when calcium sulphate was
    precipitated on cooling.
         Three experiments         similar to Nos.      10,  11,   and   12   were per
     formed, only substituting clay in suspension             for calcium sulphate in
     solution,      and the results      were   similar.    Clay, in    sulphuric acid
     (strong), was suspended           nearly as long as in pure water,          but on
     mixing the liquid, or on adding sulphuric acid to the water, or water
     to    the sulphuric      acid,   the   precipitation   of the clay was greatly
     accelerated.
         I hope     to extend these experiments       to other substances    than those

phenomena           ;    and         to       determine            the law     of    what     I    may      call
" Solution                                               To know,       for instance,       the      relation
                 Equivalents."
between        the       quantity                 of     calcium     chloride       dissolved       and     the
quantity       of common                  salt           precipitated    or hydrochloric            acid    gas
expelled      from solution,                       and various other points which suggest
themselves       for investigation.
     The experiments,                 however,             so far as they go, seem to               point     to
certain conclusions                  which are interesting and suggestive.
     1st.   There seems to be                regular gradation of cJiemical attraction
                                                   a
from that       exhibited              in the suspension of clay in water up to that
exhibited      in the attraction ofmdphuric acid                           for water     which       we call
chemical affinity.                   The attraction of clay for water is not so strong
as the      attraction of salts which are dissolved in water.                                 Then again,
the attraction of salts is not so strong as that of hydrochloric                                          acid,
which        almost       forms a definite chemical compound with water.
Then, finally, we reach sulphuric acid with the strongest attraction of
all, and forming more than one definite chemical compound                                                 with
water,       and easily              displacing from their combinations with water
hydrochloric             acid    ;    salts         it    does not decompose          and clay in sus
pension.
     2d.     That chemical
                       combination, solution, and suspension diffi
only in degree, and are manifestations of the same force. The few
drops of sulphuric acid added to the water                                   with clay in         suspension
attracts and holds the water                             with   the same force as a salt          in solution
and precipitates                the       clay in the same manner,                    and as the water
is evaporated increases its hold gradually on what remains until it is
strong enough to form definite chemical                                 compounds.
     3d.    The attraction of chemical affinity is not, in all                                cases at any
rate, exhausted when a definite compound   is formed, but hassufficient
power left to form solution or suspension compounds.    Thus calcium
sulphate is a definite chemical compound, but it still possesses
sufficient affinity for sulphuric acid to enter into solution with                                           it.
This        view would explain the                           researches      of M.      Stus on       atomic
weight.        He proved that Prout's law, that the atomic weights of                                       the
elements are simple multiples of that                                   of hydrogen,     is   not    correct,
though very nearly so                     ;       the differences       being very small fractional
If   it   be true       that the attraction of affinity                   is   not entirely exhausted

                                of Edinburgh,       Session 1877-78.                                   541
in a    definite           compound,      but that there is       a   fraction of     it,   so to speak,
to spare, we should only find Prout's law to hold good  we could                         if
analyse only one molecule of any compound, but, as in any analysis
we can make, there must be many molecules, such atom of the
molecules having    fraction of its affinity for the other to spare,
                                   a
these fractions would unite and hold in combination an extra
number of the other atoms, not so firmly, perhaps, but still firmly
enough to make the whole appear      definite compound on analysis,
                                                         a
and         this would affect the calculation for atomic                             weight.         Thus,
suppose         two atoms of            CI   = 71 combine with one atom of Ca = 40
 and still have -i-J^ part of affinity to spare, then 200 atoms of CI
 would take up 101 atoms of Ca, and from this analysis we should
 make the atomic weight of Ca not 40 but 40 '4.
    4th.        If    chemical         combination and solution are due to the same
 force,        then       solution will loosen the combination by spreading                             the
 affinity, and possibly                 there may be     a   re-arrangement           of the soluble
 and solvent analogous                   to what    is   known to take place when two
 salts      are mixed having different acids and bases.                            Hence the power
 ful    effects of solution in promoting chemical                           reaction        and     electric
 conductivity.
       5th.     A         point of practical       importance         may     be    noted     regarding
  analysis.           Many         substances    are added        indefinitely        to solution to
  render insoluble some body held in solution, which quantity                                     is   to be
  estimated.              Now,    if   the way in which one substance renders another
  insoluble          is   by combination with the solvent,               it   is   quite clear that        if
  either too much or too little be added to the solvent, an error may
  be made in the analysis,                   as the whole    of the precipitated body may
  not be thrown down.
       6th.     A further investigation of this subject                            may      throw some
  light on the manner in which the solubility of                            a   solid in    a     liquid   is
  related to the chemical composition of the two.

   6.  On    a  White Sunbow.           By Sir Robert Christison, Bart.
   As   the phenomenon        of a colourless  rainbow, which was    seen here
in the forenoon of Thursday            the  10th January, seems to be very
rare, never     having been witnessed before either by myself or by
any of my friends to whom           I have   mentioned the subject,   I beg   to
offer the   Society the following description : —
   On my way that forenoon            to the Botanic    Garden, and arriving
about    a  quarter-past   eleven at the open view       of  the north at   the
bottom of     Pitt  Street, my attention was arrested by the appearance
of a magnificent white bow, visible in its entire arch from end               to
end in the northern sky.
   The air was frosty, very dry, uncommonly still, and in most quarters
moderately      clear.   The smoke of the Old Town, however, rising
high in the stillness above the ridge of the High Street to the south,
obscured greatly the sun, which           shone through the upper region of

                            of Edinburgh, Session 1877-78.                                543
the      smoky veil without the slightest definition of its disc, white
nevertheless, but            so  shorn of its brightness that           I could easily look
it     in    the  face.       I   was   unable      to detect     anywhere     the slightest
 appearance of          a shower      or rain-cloud.       The sun, my place of obser
 vation,      and the summit of the arch, were in the same vertical plane.
 The      summit of the arch              reached      about    half-way to the zenith.
 The northern sky             on which      it   was formed was somewhat            hazy and
 grey in its lower            region, but blue-grey,        and tolerably clear        in  the
 region of the upper two-thirds of the arch.
      In   form the arch was identical with that of an ordinary rainbow,
  except that        I  thought it considerably broader              ;  and its edges were
  in many places somewhat broken,                   so  that it had exactly the appear
  ance as if the sun had gathered in                an arch a number of       little woolly
  cloudlets.       On minute search            I  could not detect any trace of colour
  from     end to end.         I  asked the opinion on this point of two gentle
  men whom         I   met at the lowest part of the road, at the wall between
  the road and the river, and one of them thought he could detect                             a
  very faint trace of colour over a small space at the extremity of the
   western limb.           As    the absence of colour,         however,    was the main
   phenomenon,         I scanned      the whole curve again and again with great
   attention, but could           see no  coloration anywhere.
       At this lowest point of           the road the edges of the bow were seen
   much more defined and sharp than when                      I  first noticed it.       As   I
   advanced up the gentle slope from Warriston                         bridge towards      the
   Botanic Garden, the summit of the arch began to break up, and to
   present the appearance of irregular flimsy cloudlets ascending in the
  sky    above it.       But before reaching the Garden gate the whole arch
   again formed an unbroken bow, and with both edges sharply defined
   like   those   of    a   common       rainbow.        At the     same time      a  similar
   secondary     arch     had begun       to form below the principal             one, only
   half its width, and much closer to its neighbour than                       I  remember
   to have seen in a double rainbow of the ordinary kind.
       On returning          homeward,        about    fifteen minutes       later,   I   still
    observed, on issuing from the Garden, a sharply-defined colourless
   principal bow, and now a complete secondary one under every part
    of the bow visible from the roadway.                   As   I  proceeded     southward
    every now and          then the upper region            of the bow seemed to be
    breaking    up, and this appearance was very marked when                      I  reached

544                        Proceedings           of the Royal Society
Heriot Row, at the head of Dundas Street, the highest station in
my walk.              As   I went westward             along Heriot Row the breaking-up
appeared          greater     and greater at every interruption                           of the street,
which gave me a view of the northern sky                                   ;    and when         I    reached
the landing-place of my house,                    in Moray Place, from which, however,
only the western half of the region of the bow could be seen, the
whole       appearances            had vanished, and the                       sky was         everywhere
mottled with               thin grey fleecy clouds,                small and of irregular                        ill-
defined         outline.      I    did not again look for                 it,   but I     understand             it
was partly seen by others so late as two                           p.m.
      Various particulars, which                 it    is   unnecessary          to mention, led me
to suppose at the time that this colourless                          bow had some connection
with the smoky column of air through which the sun's rays pene
trated.         But this supposition              was put an end to by learning from
my son that, when at Craigiehall, five miles west from town,                                                in    a
smokeless         atmosphere,             he observed        the    bow distinctly              about one
o'clock.         Its   edges were never sharply defined so long as he noticed
it.     But      it    had no colour.             Another          gentleman           present        thought
there was        a     limited blueness           at one place.                But my      son satisfied
himself that this was owing to                     a   patch of blue sky behind, and he
is    sure that there was no colour at any part of the bow visible                                               to
him.
      A   better explanation has been suggested                       to me by Professor Tait,
to whose         theory    I   subscribe.          But I      leave   it       to himself to explain
his views.
                                          By Professor Tait.
I      was unfortunate             in not     seeing the phenomenon                   till nearly     2     p.m.,
when   I    was on my way from College to the Observatory.                                             It    was
then very faint, but               I       saw at once that           it       differed   in    a     marked
manner from an ordinary rainbow.                             From what          I     could    see,
                                                                                                 I      attri
buted its apparent whiteness                    to the greatly increased effective surface
from which the light                    came.    This       was probably due to reflection
from ice-crystals mixed with the drops of water in the thin strata of
cloud which covered the whole sky.                                 The sun's light             was much
dimmed,         and the edge of its disc was very indistinct,                             as   the clouds
immediately round                 it,   to the distance of at least             a   diameter, appeared
nearly     as   bright      as the      disc itself.    Hence this rainbow was probably
very much less pure, while also much less bright, than the usual one.

This      suggestion          seems     fully   to explain all the appearances which                      I
saw.        It will       be observed that both             Sir R. Christison      and    Mr Buchan
noticed the peculiar brightness of the clouds near the sun,                                 so   that it
is   probable        that this explanation applies to the phenomenon                             as seen
by them also.              The peculiarities noticed in the position of the spuri
ous bows (when seen) are of course dependent                                  on the actual size, as
well      as the greater or less uniformity of size, of the drops which pro
duced the rainbow               ;   and these may well have been exceedingly vari
able      as regards       both time, locality, and height in the atmosphere.
                                             [Added,    April     8.]
 I        find that this nearly colourless rainbow                      is   very easily reproduced
in my       class-room,        when the sunlight employed to form                         a    rainbow
in fine spray         is   made to pass first through             a     large vessel with parallel
glass sides, containing water and                       a   little milk.         This    arrangement
imitates very closely the circumstances                         of the 10th January.
                                        By   J.   Ch rist ison, Esq.
I         saw   it   first at Craigie Hall, five miles west of Edinburgh, about
11.30 or thereby.                   At first   it   did not make much impression,                 as the
house       front runs east and west, and                     I   was standing at the front
door, and consequently only saw                         half of   the bow, and took            it   to be
an accidental arrangement                      of the light clouds that covered most of
the sky.          By      and by the idea           of its being   a     rainbow struck me, and
a    move       out from the house showed the full bow.                           I     noticed     it   off
and on for about an hour.                         Sometimes       it    was indistinct, but gene
rally     it   was evident enough               to attract attention at once.            I     did not,
however,         at any time            see    anything like clear definition of outline.
There was always               a    sort of wavy indistinctness.
     As    to colour,     I    tried hard to convince myself                 I    made    it   out, but
without effect, and am quite satisfied                         there was none at any of the
periods     I     looked at the bow.                    One of the party at Craigie Hall
thought he made out colour, but on his pointing out the part where
he thought           it   was visible    I      was satisfied that        it   was only   a    break     in
the bow, with             a   bit of very light blue sky showing through.                        I     did
not notice        it   after 12.30 or 12.45, as             I   was indoors.
     It   was pretty hard frost all the time.                           The only effect the sun
had was to disperse                 a   little of    the hoar-frost, which was thick and
heavy out there, and to make                        a   few of the flat stones among                   the

 546               Proceedings    of the Royal Society
gravel show damp.       I noticed a thermometer    in the garden standing
at 32.    It was well placed for shelter from the sun ; but   it was within
a few feet   of two brick walls, one of them the end wall of a forcing-
house.      Could that affect the thermometer?        The ground      —grass,
gravel, and earth   — remained hard all     day.   I  noticed neither rain
nor snow.
   The only local peculiarity on the occasion that         I can remember
was that the gardener was burning rubbish, off and on,         all the   fore
noon between us and the bow.          There was no smoke that       I noticed
after eleven, but there    must have been a good deal of heat rising
from the red ashes.      This  was close to the house, say     1 00  yards at
most.    The bow had all the appearance of being distant        ; but had it
not been seen here (and no doubt elsewhere) there might have been
room for suspicion of this appearance being a deception perhaps.
                              By Mr Buchan.
   Tbo rainbow described by Sir Robert Christison at meeting of the
Royal Society was observed by us from the north windows of the
Scottish Meteorological Society.       The above is a rough sketch of it
made at the time.
   The eastern limb of it rested on the tops of the houses of Leith
Street, against what appeared to be a smoke-like cloud, precisely
similar to what often accompanies         the aurora.     It  was    on this
portion only of the phenomenon          that the following     points were
noticed  : —
   1. Spurious Bows. — Two such bows, very distinctly marked, were
seen within the primary bow.        The first spurious bow was separated
from the primary by an intensely black band the width of the
spurious bow itself, while this spurious bow and its black band were
together equal in breadth to the primary bow.         The second spurious

bow was separated from the first spurious bow by an intensely black
band the width of the second spurious bow, and both second spurious
bow with its black band were together the width of the first spurious
bow.
    2.  Colour. — Colours          were    seen   on   the    portion   of   the   limb
described above       as   standing out against the black smoke-like cloud.
The    colours,  though far from being well pronounced, were distinct.
Miss Buchan         stated    she saw the colours as we looked at the bow
through the window, which at the time stood in need of the window-
cleaner    ; but  I  was unable to detect the colours            till the window was
thrown up, when they were distinctly visible.
    In   no   other   part of the bow was any development                     of colour
visible, either when          I   first observed it in St Andrew            Square,   or
afterwards at various times in the office.
    The frost was keen at the time, but it is probable that a S.W.
wind with thaw had then                set in aloft.      I  understand from     Mr J.
Gibson-Thomson,          of York Place, who called              at this office shortly
thereafter, that while driving out to the country in the afternoon
the wind had shifted into S.W., and the tops of the mud-ridges                        on
the road had become soft with the thaw which had set in.
    The width of the primary, or its visible portion, appeared                    to be
about a third narrower than the ordinary coloured rainbow.
     The arrangement         of the colours was that of the ordinary rainbow,
the yellows and yellow-reds being best marked.
    The appearance          of the sun,       as seen   in St Andrew       Square, was
hazy, with light wisps of clouds                and large patches or blurs of mist
in that part of      the sky, giving rise to ill-defined shadows,             so that   I
looked about to        see   if  there were any appearance of halos or mock-
suns visible, but none were             seen.
                                    By Dr Ferguson.
    Dr Ferguson       stated that he had read          in   the Inverness    Advertiser
that a similar phenomenon had been seen at Nairn and neighbour
 hood on the same day from eight in the morning till midday.                           It
 is described    as a pale     blue arch on a white ground, having the out
 line and position of a rainbow, but differing from it in its remarkable
fixity.
    I  saw the rainbow at Edinburgh                 from the middle of the east

 548                         Proceedings                 of the Royal          Society
 division of Queen Street.                           I   think it     was at eleven, but the friend in
whose company                    I   was at the time says                 it   was twelve.              I looked at
the bow attentively, but not critically, as                                    I       was not aware                of the
exceptional             character          of    the phenomenon.                       The day was fine, but
there was a haze in the sky, which gave an indistinct outline to the
masses           of cloud which occupied the northern heaven.                                          It   looked to
me like a cloud rainbow, as its continuity seemed to correspond                                                         to
that of the cloudy mass on which                               it   was seen.            I remember             particu
larly one spot to the west of the middle, where there was                                                   a    partial
break         in      the clouds           and a similar defect in the bow.                             As      regards
colour,          it   wore the appearance                  of a bleached               rainbow, with an in
definite stratification of tints.                          I did      not specially mark each grada
tion of colour from the red to the blue, but                                       I   had a distinct impres
sion of such.                    The colours             were faint, and the perception of the
coloured rainbow effect was as much, or more, due to contrast,                                                       than
to the colours taken individually.

                                 Phonograph' the other day, and though it is very
crude        I   was much             interested.          I   would briefly describe the idea as
follows: —
   " To the            centre of an iron diaphragm                        is attached a metallic point
resting          against a        strip of paper or tinfoil.                       You    speak against               dia
phragm through a mouthpiece,                               at same time the paper being drawn
under the points.                     The vibration of diaphragm                        and point indent the
paper to various                     depths,     making an undulating                      (as    it   were) mark,
&c.          Now,      if    said paper is afterwards                     drawn under the point, the
diaphragm              vibrates         exactly as your voice made                        it     vibrate, and all
the sounds are reproduced                            exactly   as   you said them, making                       a    most
astonishing effect — singing, laughing, and articulate words were all
reproduced.                 Of       course     it    is by no means perfect,                    but    it is very
interesting.                By attaching             a point to one of our strong                       telephones
we could record                      any    messages sent.                Though the phonograph is
purely mechanical                     in its ordinary          use,   I   mention         all this to you, as
you      will probably                soon hear of          it,   and naturally would not believe
it   a   possible           thing.         The above           is   the invention of               Mr Eddison,
who showed              it   to me himself."

In     delivering the Neill Medal to Dr Traquair, the Chairman
                       made the following remarks      : —
    Dr   Ramsay Traquair,       — The Neill prize for  the triennial    period
1874-77       has been awarded     to you  by the Council of this Society,
nominally for your        paper on the structures  and   affinities of  Tridi-
ehopterus alatux (Egerton), communicated to this Society within
the required     period, and published in the 27th volume of the Trans
actions     of the    Society.   The Council    have, however,     also  taken
into    account,    as they are entitled to do by the conditions of the
prize, the many contributions which you have made during some
years past to the knowledge of the structure of recent and fossil
fishes.
    I   may mention as among the more important of these a memoir
 " On    the Asymmetry        of the Pleuronectid:e,  as  elucidated by an
 examination       of the skeleton   in  the Turbot, Halibut,    and Plaice,"
 published     in the Transactions of the Linnean Society of London
 for  the year 1865; a paper     "On the Cranial Osteologyof Polypterus,"
 in  the  Journal of Anatomy and Physiology for the year 1870 : and
 a  work on " The Ganoid Fishes of the British Carboniferous For
 mations," now in course of publication by the Paheontographical
 Society.
    You    have been fortunately placed      during the last few years in     a
 locality remarkably rich in the group of fossils to which you have
 paid special attention, and already three parts of a valuable series
 of papers " On new and little-known Fossil Fishes from the Edin
 burgh District" have appeared in the Proceedings of this Society.
    I  have much pleasure in presenting to you the       Neill   medal in the
 name    of the Council of the Society.

 1.  Chapters on the Mineralogy of Scotland.                     Chapter    III.
                    The Garnets.         By Professor Heddle.
    In this third        chapter    Dr Heddle submits         the   results of his
analyses      of garnets from thirteen localities.
    Notwithstanding         the  great frequency of the occurrence          of the
mineral, it is geneially        so   largely contaminated with quartz that
he was unable to procure,             from many localities, specimens        fit for
examination.
    Three varieties of garnet new to Scotland — one of these                  being
altogether new — have,          however,     been  the   reward of the present
investigation.
    On  a  hill lying north of Balmoral, — Creag Mohr, — two of the new
varieties were found, both in limestone.
    The first, the rarer, was the           water garnet, or colourless    garnet   ;
 he second was the grossular, or gooseberry               garnet, hitherto   found
only in perfection on the         Wilni river in Siberia.
    The cinnamonstone        of Glen Gairn has next been analysed.          This is
finer in colour than the Ceylon mineral, but so flawed as to be use
less for purposes of jewellery.
    Not   so the   pyrope of Elie — the
                                             " Elie rubies,"  as  they used to be
termed.        Dr Heddle     regards these as, weight for weight, the most
valuable of Scottish gems.
    Analyses of common garnet from             Yell in Shetland, Killiecrankie
and Meall Luaidh in Perthshire,             Knockhill in Banff, and Clach-an-
Eoin in Sutherland follow.
    There are, lastly, analyses of a new garnet from five localities             —
four of these in Ross-shire        ;   the other, Ben Resipol,     in Argyll.
    This    is a precious garnet,        containing about fifteen per cent, of
oxide of manganese.           Its formula     places   it intermediate between
the ordinary precious garnet of Bohemia and the manganesian                 garnet
of America.
    This   garnet, in    all the localities where it is found, is of a fine
currant^red colour,      due probably to the manganese.             From Resipol
and the Raven's         Rock,    near Strathpefler, pieces large enough for
cutting might probably be obtained.
    The lime garnets       occur   in certain of the limestone        beds, at the
upper waters        of  the   Don     and   Dee, and not in      others; and     Dr

                       of Edinburgh, Session 1877-78.                           551
Heddle thinks it        probable    that this fact will aid in the tracing out
of    the    individual     beds — far from an easy matter       in that troubled
district.
    The conclusion of the chapter is devoted               to a speculation     upon
the     metamorphism       of these limestones.
      2.   On the Strength of the Currents required to Work                     a
                       Telephone.        By Professor Tait.
                           (Deferred from January 7th.)
    Perhaps the most singular fact connected              with the telephone       is
 the    excessive   feebleness of the currents which suffice to work it.            I
 have had no opportunity of testing any but rough arrangements                    set
 up by present or former students of my own, so that I cannot judge
 how far my results may apply to the instrument as sold.
     1.  A    striking   illustration   of the feebleness     of the currents     re
 quired     is furnished      by using   a  Holtz machine driven very slowly,
 without      condenser, and with its terminals so close that the discharge
 is barely audible, and certainly invisible          except in the dark.      When
 insulated      wires   were    led from these terminals to the telephone
 (placed in      a distant room) the effect was very curious.           The instru
 ment gave a hissing sound, quite comparable in intensity with that
 which      was produced       directly when the terminals of the machine
 were widely separated,         one connected    with the ground and the other
 with     a large    conductor discharging by brushes           into the air, the
 machine being turned rapidly.               The telephone     continued to give
  audible     sounds with slow turning, even when the terminals of the
 machine (somewhat tarnished) were pressed into contact.
    2. To measure roughly the intensity of the current,                   I   placed
 one prong of an unmagnetised              tuning-fork   about half an inch in
 front of     the sending telephone,      and   measured   by  a   microscope    and
 scale    the extent of its vibrations when the note just ceased to be
 audible to a listener at the receiving telephone.            Next    I substituted
 for   the receiving telephone        an exceedingly delicate astatic      galvano
 meter, with very small moment              of inertia, and measured the swing
 produced by one definitely assigned             motion of the prong of the
 tuning-fork.        By  means of a known thermo-electric couple,           I deter
 mined the strength of the current corresponding to the observed

552                          Proceedings of              the   Royal Society
swing.         The result           is,   of course, only       a    very rough approximation.
It   is   that     a   single Grove's cell would produce, in                         a   circuit of some
where      about         a   billion B.A. units            resistance,     a    current sufficient,             if
reversed 500 times per second, to produce                                an audible sound in the
telephone      I       employed.
     3.   Several attempts at explanation of the action of the telephone
have been given here                      and      elsewhere,      and others are promised for
to-night.          For my own              part, I      think there are at least three separate
causes at work in the telephones                         I   have used.
     There can be no doubt that the inventor's own explanation                                            is,   at
least to       a   certain extent, correct.                  For    we can easily dispense                with
the magnet in the receiving telephone,                             using merely          a   thin iron disc
in front of        a     coil.     And Mr Blyth has, believe, found that we may
                                                                I
make the disc, even                in this case, of copper, and yet have transmission
(though very feeble) of intelligible sounds.
   But this cannot be the full explanation.                               For   it    does not attempt
to account             for the peculiar nasality of the transmitted                                    speech.
Without going                more closely into the matter, the difference of quality
between        an        open and         a     closed    pipe suggests         a    certain amount of
constraint          as     the cause.            And     we know that            the     sounds in the
original telephone                of Reiss were produced by molecular motions due
to magnetism               in soft iron.             Mr Blyth       has shown conclusively that
molecular motion in the magnet itself has                            a   large share         in the results,
because he has successfully substituted other metals than iron, and
even non-conductors, for the disc, and                             in   certain cases finds that he
can dispense with the disc altogether.
     Besides        this, however,            it   seems to me that there              is    a   third   cause,
which in certain                 cases     is   more     effective      than either of the others.
This      is      by the fact that (at least with the instruments
               suggested                                                                                        I
have tried) high notes, even of comparatively small intensity, are
much more clearly transmitted than low notes, — indicating that the
rapidity of the molecular change has                               a    great    deal to do with the
result.        In   fact,        in this   respect, the telephone               is   really      a   variety of
the so-called curb-key, giving very sudden reversals.
     These considerations have led me to fancy that                                      rapid       change     of
form in matter,                   whether paramagnetic                  or not, may probably be
capable        of detection               by the telephone,             for the associated             electric
currents may be in certain                      cases    powerful enough to produce audible

sounds.         I am at present engaged        in a series of preliminary experi
ments on this subject
      3.    Experiments with the Telephone.                By James Blyth.
                        Communicated by Professor Tait.
    In    the telephones       used in these experiments the permanent           mag
nets were of the ordinary horse-shoe form, about 4 inches long.                    No
cores of soft iron were attached            to the poles, the insulated wire, No.
26, being wound directly round both, in such                 a way that a current
circulating through it followed the direction of Ampere's currents.
The vibrating disc was the bottom of a shallow can of thin tinned
iron, 21 inches          in diameter, supported       directly above the poles of
the magnet, and almost touching them.                   The receiving instrument
 was    so arranged that any kind of disc could be easily substituted
 for the ordinary vibrating plate, and tested by sound from                 th e same
 transmitting instrument, so as to allow of a comparison                 being made
 between       discs of various       materials.   Having    first ascertained    that
 no sound was audible when no vibrating plate                     was used,    I tried
 discs of the following substances,           and have arranged      the m   approxi
 mately in the order              of distinctness with     which the     sound was
 heard     :—
    Ferrotype plate.                               TinfoiL
     Thin     steel.                               Vulcanite.
     Thin iron.                                    Thin fir   wood.
     Wire     gauze (fine).                        Paper.
           Do.         (a little coarser).          Vulcanised India-rubber.
     Cast-iron plate, f inch thick.                Cast-iron,   6 inches thick.
     Sheet copper.                                  Slice of raw potato.
     Sheet brass.                                   Slice of fresh butter.
     Sheet zinc.
     With      the view of testing what effect would be produced by varying
  the position       of the wire coil on the leg of the magnet,        I const ructed
  a telephone,       so that the coil could be easily slipped up and down
  the    leg,   while     the   sound  was    being sent   from the transmitting
  instrument          Very little difference in the sound was observable            till
  the wire coil was brought near the neutral point of the magnet.                    It

  554                 Proceedings of the Royal Society
 then became very faint.           I   next slipped the wire coil entirely off
 the magnet, and         simply held it touching the pole side-ways.           The
 sounds were       still quite audible, and continued          to be so when the
 coil was removed an inch or more away from the magnet.                    This led
 me to try the effect of dispensing altogether            with   the steel magnet,
 and merely holding the helix of insulated wire opposite the centre
 of the vibrating plate.         With     an iron disc a very faint      sound was
 heard, but     it became more       distinct when a disc of copper was used.
 From this it would seem, that the vibrations producing the sound
 are caused      by the attraction        between    the  currents   in the helix
 and the induced currents         in the copper disc.
    Still using    the same transmitting        instrument,    I  next employed   a
 receiver,   in which a soft iron core, carrying the insulated wire, was
 rigidly attached to the vibrating          plate.   This  was accomplished by
 rivetting the head end of a screw-nail into its centre, and winding
 the wire round it.         The pole of a steel magnet was then fixed, just
 clear of actual contact, opposite         the head of the nail, and, with this
 arrangement,      sounds were distinctly audible, though not so loud as
 when the wire coil surrounded the magnet.
    With     the   view of rendering the telephone            an   instrument   for
 detecting    the existence of very feeble currents,         I  constructed a pair
 with magnets similar to those already described, but with ferrotype
 discs.    These were joined together           by a  strong semicircular spring
in such      a  way that they could be put on, after the manner of
spectacles, and       stick close to the sides of the head, inclosing         both
ears.     India-rubber      rings were provided for the double purpose of
excluding all extraneous         sound, and avoiding any disagreeable         pres
sure on the ear.
    With this      arrangement,    I   proceeded    to test for the existence    of
thermo-electric      currents.    A    copper and iron junction was inserted
in the circuit of the telephone, and attached to              a  spring in such a
way that      it could     be made     to vibrate rapidly out and into a gas
flame.      A distinct grating       noise was heard      in the telephone.      A
very peculiar rasping sound was produced              when the ends of a copper
and    iron wire were rubbed together while hot, and also when one
of the wires was attached           to a file, and the     hot end of the other
drawn rapidly along it.

               4.   On the Theory of the Telephone.                   By
                               Prof. George Forbes.
   The Telephone,        invented by Mr Graham Bell, is an instrument
by means of which any sounds, musical                  notes or spoken sentences,
sounded    into an instrument at the sending end of                a telegraphic     wire
may be reproduced at the receiving end.               The theory of the Telephone
is two-fold.       First,   the mechanical      theory    of the nature of sounds
and of speech     ;  and secondly,     the theory of the action of the instru
ment.     The first part is        well known.          All   sounds    consist     of   a
succession     of waves      propagated      through      the   air,   the   rate     and
intensity of their succession determining the nature of the sound, in
pitch, loudness,       and tone.      If  the same succession         of waves       as a
speaker    makes     in using his voice can be reproduced               in  the air in
contact  with the ear of any other person, by any means whatever,
the latter person      will  hear a fac-simile      of the sound uttered by the
former.      A  theory of the action of the Telephone is distinctly given
by the inventor in the specification of his patent.                    The receiving
and sending instruments are identical.                  Round the end of a bar
magnet     a  coil of fine wire is wound, connected                 with   a telegraph
wire on the one hand and the earth on the other.                    In front of     these
a  thin iron plate is caused to vibrate by the sounds uttered                     in its
neighbourhood.          Consequently, it approaches and recedes from the
pole of the magnet             This  alters   the magnetism        in the neighbour
hood.     In Faraday's        language,
                                           '
                                             the   lines of force are altered           in
                                                        '
position, so as to go across the coil of wire.              In consequence of this,
by the     well-known       laws of electromagnetic           action,   a current       of
electricity is sent in one direction with each approach of the vibrating
plate, and in the opposite direction with              each recession.       This suc
cession of currents       reaches the receiving end with a strength                   pro
portioned to the extent of vibration of the iron plate.                     Here they
circulate through the coil, and        so intensify or diminish the magnetism
of the bar.       Thus, the vibrating plate at the receiving end is more
or less attracted,    according    to the direction of the current.             Hence,
the plate at the receiving end vibrates           to and fro in vibrations which
are synchronus and proportionate to those at the sending                    end   ;   and
so the sounds are reproduced.

   This theory gives      a vera causa   for the action of the instrument      in
its normal form, and probably explains in part                  the  true action
which takes place, but the author believes that this is not the 'whole
of the action.        The fact that the inventor was working           upon  this
theory when he designed the instrument, does not prove the theory
to be correct, as is shown by his having at first employed a powerful
battery   with the instrument, believing it to be necessary, and it was
only after diminishing         the number of cells without impairing          the
action of the Telephone that it occurred           to him to     try it without
a  battery at all, when he found the action to be equally good.
    The author's mistrust of the theory commenced               when he learnt
that a thick iron plate might be used,             whose    vibrations   must be
extremely minute.        And when     he learnt that the instrument might be
used with plates of glass, wood, tinfoil,         or vulcanite, or even with
out any plate at all, he was convinced that the theory was imperfect,
and resolved to propose another theory which seemed more consis
tent with facts.
    This theory is divided into two parts         — the action at the sending
end, and that at the receiving end.         It is very simple, and is founded
upon two well-known experiments.
    The theory of the action at the sending end is founded upon an
experiment by Sir William            Thomson, who finds that iron subject
to magnetic       induction has its magnetism         increased   when slightly
stretche d in the direction of its magnetization,          and we may assume
that it  Is  diminished when compressed.            Now, what happens in the
Telephone     1   Take the simplest    case which has been tried, i.e., where
there if no vibrating       plate.    Sound    waves    (which are capable of
passing through solid bodies as they do through the air) strike the
end of the bar magnet, and are propagated through it.                  Waves of
alternate    compression    and extension pass through the length of the
magnet.       Consequently, the magnet          is alternately increased and
diminished in intensity.           Hence, currents are generated in the coil
of  wire, and transmitted through the telegraph             wire alternately, in
opposite directions, as in the theory hitherto adopted.             The presence
of a vibrating plate of any kind may help this action, by increasing
the intensity       of the waves    transmitted through the bar magnet           ;
and   if  -he   plate be of iron it will undoubtedly help to propagate
these currents.

                     of Edinburgh, Sttsaion 1877-78.                           557
    According to the author's theory, the action at the receiving end
is explained by an experiment ascribed to Page.             If  a bar   of iron bo
surrounded by a coil of wire connected           with a battery, a chink           is
heard when the connection is broken, and a feebler one when the
connection is re-made.          If the connection     be   made,     and   broken
rapidly by attaching one end of the wire to a file and drawing the
other along the file, a series of chinks are heard succeeding                  each
other at the same intervals as the contacts            are made     and broken.
 It  is due to the lengthening of the bar on magnetisation and the
rearrangement       of the molecules     of the iron.     It   takes   place    also
 when the iron remains partially magnetised.            In this case successive
 contacts    increase the magnetism of the bar.         In the Tel phone suc
 cessive currents pass in opposite directions through the cuil.             llcnco
 the bar is lengthened and shortened            alternately,    and   chinks are
 made at intervals corresponding to the intervals between               successive
waves at the sending end.          Hence the sound waves at the sending
 end are reproduced at the receiving end           alike in rapidity       and in
 intensity.      When   a vibrating   plate of any kind is used it increases
 the intensity of the sound, and       if it be of iron    the attraction will
 increase the effect.
    Since    a chink is given off both when the magnetism           is increased
and diminished it might be expected that the note should be heard
an octave higher.       But  since the one is more intense       than the other,
tho combined effect should be to give two notes, a loud one in the
tone    of the speaker, and a feeble one an octave higher.            This might
account for the common remark that a piano sounds wiry through                      a
Telephone, and that a clear lady's voice is squeaky.               But it is not
certain that this effect is produced, for the chink is produced at
least    in part by the lengthening and shortening of the magnet.
Either of these alone will give a chink, but when following each
 other in rapid succession they compress and rarefy the air in con
tact,   in periods exactly   agreeing   with  the compressions      and rarefac
tions originated at the sending end.
    In   confirmation of the supposition that the sound is produced by
successive     chinks of the material of the magnet, it was stated that
in  a very large and massive       pair of Telephones made by            Mr Wm.
Bottomley, jun., when any one is speaking through one of them the
sound is distinctly (though not articulately) heard by every one in the
    VOL. IX.                                                           4 E

558                          Proceedings          of the Royal Society
room where the other is placed, and there Is no doubt that the sound
seems to come           from       the magnet itself.              The same is done in the            case
of   a    compound Telephone with                       25 bar magnets               to one iron plate
exhibited by the author.
  In conclusion, the author considers that the theory now explained
must be taken to supplement that of Mr Graham Bell (1), because
the phenomena               alluded to undoubtedly take place, and (2), because
it   is the only theory which explains the action when the vibrating
plate is not made of iron, or when there is no vibrating plate at all.
                  5.    Some Experiments with the Telephone.
                             By John G. M'Kendrick, M.D.
     During the past two months my attention has been                                         directed to
the telephone,               chiefly   as    an       instrument          which        illustrates   in     a
remarkable way the delicacy of hearing.                                  As    some of these experi
ments are novel, and may possibly assist those who are investigating
the physical phenomena                 of the instrument,                  I   beg     to give a short
account of them to the Society.                         To   save circumlocution              in descrip
tion,      the    term "proximal"                     will   be     applied       to    the    telephone
receiving the           stimulus, and the term                "distal" to the one at                  the
other end of the arrangement.                          Thus, if A talks to B, A will                  use
the proximal, and              B   the distal telephone.
    Transmission oft/ie Sounds of Tuning-Forks.—At an early stage
     1.
of my investigations, finding it convenient to have a constant
source of sound              at the    proximal          telephone,        I    placed     a telephone
opposite     one       of   the limbs of a tuning-fork,                   kept in vibration by an
electro-magnet,             the current being interrupted                      automatically by the
fork itself.           At   the distal telephone             the    sound could be             distinctly
heard.       Then       I    removed        the       disk from the            proximal       telephone,
and allowed the limb of the fork to play in front of the naked end
of the core.            The distal telephone                 then sounded more distinctly
than before.           The next step was to remove the metal disk from the
distal telephone,             and apply disks                made        of vulcanite,         porcelain,
glass, paper, wood, a large piece                     of iron      1|-   inches thick,     a   thick rod
of iron,    8    inches in length by              1   inch in diameter.                Still the sound
of the proximal telephone could be heard, though faintly. There
could be no doubt of the fact.   To ascertain whether the effect
might not be due to the communication                                of mechanical            vibrations

                         of Edinburgh,           Session 1877-78.                               559
   from the tuning-fork          beside      the proximal         telephone,       I found, that
   moving the latter away          3  or   4   inches from the vibrating fork, was
  followed      by silence    of the distal telephone               ;  indeed, to       cause the
  latter to sound, the proximal telephone has to be placed                           as near the
   fork   as possible.
      The following experiment is of interest,                 as  showing the effect of a
  thin metallic disk in connection with the distal telephone :— Remove
  the disk, and apply in its place a plate of glass ; listen, and the
  sound of the proximal telephone                 will    be heard faintly.            Then put
  one of the metal disks on the glass, and                        on listening        again, the
  sound will be found much intensified.                         It    may    be    still further
  intensified by placing a second                disk on the surface               of the first,
  taking care to have a few morsels of paper interposed                          so  as    to pre
  vent them from touching.
      The next step was to ascertain whether or not sounds                              could be
 heard at the distal telephone                 without the         use     of a disk         there.
 There can be no doubt that sounds                         may    be heard       in these cir
 cumstances.        They are very faint, however,                 and have not the same
 quality    as those   heard with       a disk.
     The arrangements         at the distal telephone              were further modified
 in    the   following experiment — The disk
                                           :                     was     removed       from the
 distal    telephone   ;  and    the    base of a glass            cylinder,      8   inches in
 length by       2\ in diameter,     filled with water, and closed at each end
 by a ground glass cover, was placed against                      the core.        Very feeble
 sounds from the proximal telephone were heard, when the ear was
 placed at the other end of the glass cylinder.                         These     sounds were
slightly intensified by slipping in                a    thin metal       plate    between the
base of the cylinder          and    the core        ;  but when        a second      disk was
placed between         the    ear and        the    other end of the cylinder, the
sounds were nearly         as  loud   as  with     the ordinary telephone.                In this
experiment, the two disks were separated by a distance of                              8 inches,
and it is difficult to explain the phenomena                    as   depending merely on
conduction of sound.
     At this   stage it occurred       to me to place opposite               to the      core of
the distal telephone a tuning-fork of tho                   3amo      pitch   as   that oppo
site the proximal telephone.              The result was, that the one tuning-
fork set the other in movement,                 so     that the sound of the distal
tuning-fork could be heard throughout the room.                           As is now known,

 560                  Proceedings        of the Royal Society
the same observation was              made    by  Dr Rontgen, and recorded by
him in " Nature.             It   was   interesting    as being     a  proof   of   the
actual     vibration     of the metallic         substance    at the distal tuning
fork.
    2.   Transmission      of the Sounds of Organ Pipes. — If an organ pipe
sounding loudly be brought into close proximity with a proximal
telephone,     its sound is heard        distinctly at the distal telephone.         If
then    a pipe of the same pitch be placed opposite the distal telephone,
and    it be sounded       feebly, the sound is reinforced when the pipe
at   the    proximal     telephone      is also    sounding    ; but  I  have never
succeeded      in causing       one   pipe actually to initiate       sound in the
other.      Mr Aiken of Falkirk,           however,   has informed me by letter
that he has observed            this phenomenon.          I found also     that there
was no intensifying         effect when either      of the disks was removed.
    3.  Transmission of the Sounds of Vibrating Strings. — succeeded     I
in causing a string to vibrate by means of the telephone as follows : —
Two catgut strings, each having a telephonic disk cemented                     to the
centre of the string, were tuned as accurately               as  possible to a pitch
of about C       ;  one disk was       placed    opposite   a large   and powerful
telephone (the        proximal), made by         Mr William Bottomely, and the
other (the distal), opposite a similar instrument                ; on plucking the
string at the proximal telephone, the string opposite the distal also
sounded,     though feebly.          This experiment holds out the         hope,  that
by suitable arrangements            the sounds of strings might be transmitted
for musical purposes.
   4.    Optical Observations        of the  Movements     of the Disk. —There     can
be no doubt (1 ) that sounds             may be heard even when the disk is
firmly pressed against          the ear, so as to prevent its vibrations          to a
great degree; and (2) that sounds may be heard even without                        any
disk on the distal         telephone.        A disk, or moving metallic body
capable     of magnetic        action,   is always necessary       at the proximal
telephone.         On the other       hand, the existence        of a disk, free to
vibrate, at the distal telephone always intensifies the sound, and,
in particular, it appears to be almost essential for distinct articula
tion of language.          One would        therefore  infer that the disk must
move as a whole.         These movements          I have studied in various ways,
and they     will still   be under observation.

                        of Edinburgh,                 Session             1877-78.                                 561
opposite the proximal                 telephone            ;    a    fine glass rod or filament,                      3
inches in length, was cemented                             to the          centre       of the disk of the
distal telephone         ;    to the other end of this rod two common micro
scopical covering glasses, having                          between              them      a    drop of blood,
were also cemented so                as to be         in   a    horizontal             position.         The drop
of blood thus fixed            to the telephone disk was then brought under a
Hartnack's        Jth inch, magnifying about                                   300      diameters,         and the
coloured blood corpuscles were brought into accurate focus.                                                    A    key
was placed near the distal telephone,                                by which the current might
be transmitted or interrupted                         at pleasure.                On opening the key,
the circular-coloured            corpuscles             at once assumed an oval form, and
were put somewhat              out of focus, plainly the result of lateral move
ment.      Thus, by an application of Lissajoux's method of observing
vibrations optically, the movements                                 of the disk could be seen.                         I
found that the amplitude of the movements                                            of the vibrating fork
(moving     60 vibrations             per       second),             near      the     proximal telephone,
was about        ^;th   of an inch         ;    the     movements                 of    the corpuscles             were
about half their diameter, or about T:,Vjth of an inch.                                                 On stopping
the current by means of the key, the                                      movements           almost immedi
ately ceased.           Again, on taking away the glass rod from the disk,
and applying the ear to the disk, the low booming sound of the
fork could        be heard.           It       is,   therefore,           evident that these                sounds
were      produced by            movements                 of the              disk,    the amplitudes                of
which     were about the ^0'0Tfth of an inch, an interesting example                                                  of
the sensitiveness            of the ear.             The minimum limit of excitation of
the ear has been thus stated                   :— The faintest                  sound perceptible              is   that
caused by    a    ball of pith,         1       milligramme in weight, falling                             1    milli
metre in height upon             a    glass plate, may bo heard                               at   a    distance of
91 millimetres from the ear (ScJtafliautl).
     The telephone           appears to be an instrument which                                     illustrates tho
extreme     sensitiveness            of the ear, even better than the method of
Schafhautl        just       alluded to.              The length of the hair cells in the
cochlea  (which are stated to be tolerably stiff and rigid) about                                          is
the TSTiVo^h of an inch.     One of them could therefore perform
an     excursion         of    the   i     J0   0th        of        an     inch.         If,      as    Helmholtz
states,    the     mechanical          arrangements                       of    the      bones          of the       ear
are such as to diminish                    to one-third                   the excursion of the mem-
brana tympani, and             if    no further reduction took place in the internal

 562                Proceedings        of the Royal Society
 ear itself, the oscillations of the plate         I  observed,    and which       were
 capable of causing      a sensation    of sound, would only amount, when
 they reached the hair cells, to about the lb^00 of an inch, and thus
 cause a movement of the auditory hair through about Jth of its
 possible amplitude of excursion.
    2d Method. — The movements             may also be observed        by throwing
 obliquely a beam      of light   on a reflecting surface         on the    disk, and
 catching the reflected ray on a screen.             I  did not find this method
 so satisfactory as the one     just   described.
    3d  Method. — I    cemented      the disk of the distal telephone to the
thin membrane       of one of Koenig's manometric capsules, then there
 was   no difficulty    in observing the oscillations of the flame                in  a
 rapidly revolving mirror, when          a strongly vibrating tuning-fork          was
 placed   opposite   the    proximal      telephone.       I  failed, however, in
seeing    any movements        produced by speech.             The method, how
ever,   is capable    of more      refined application        than the means at
present at my disposal       will allow.
    Ath Method. — I      have attempted to record the movements                of the
disk graphically by attaching to            it a lever bent at right        angles at
one end,     bringing the point         on    a rapidly    moving     surface.      No
oscillations could be detected.             Such    oscillations    were,   however,
recorded when, instead       of  a  disk,  I   used forks at the proximal          and
distal ends,    as already     described.       The movements         of the distal
fork were then recorded, but it was observed that the sound of the
fork was audible long after all oscillations could be recorded,                 show
ing that the movements        of the fork were too delicate to be recorded
by this method.
    5. A Mode of Intensifying        the Sound     of the Telephone.    — In   study
ing the transmission of sounds of various kinds,                I   had occasion to
use a rapidly      revolving     wheel opposite the proximal              telephone.
The wheel in my possession, which moves with greatest velocity is one
about 4 inches in diameter, having placed transversely on its circum
ference twenty-four rectangular bars           of iron.   The wheel is driven by
two electro-magnets,       and the current employed            was obtained from
twenty of Sir William Thomson's tray cells.                  With this power it
performs about eighty revolutions per second.                When     the proximal
telephono    was   brought near the circumference of the wheel, the
distal telephone sounded        so loudly that a rattling          sound   like that

caused    by the wheel could be heard             quite distinctly all over the
room.     Evidently      the effect of bringing      the horizontal iron bars on
the circumference        of the wheel rapidly in front of the core of the
proximal telephone was to intensify the currents of the telephones.
The currents       were so strong that a disk held in front of the core of
the distal telephone could be felt vibrating by the hand.

       fessor Tait.
                                      (Ahstrad.)
    Last  summer       session,    with the assistance     of Messrs Salvesen,
Connor,      and Stewart,       I  applied tho method of measuring great
differences     of potential, described      in a paper   by   Mr Paton and my
self (Proc. Feb. 19, 1877), to investigate the laws of passage of the
electric spark. The method essentially consists in connecting the
prime conductor of the Holtz machine,                not with the    electrometer
directly,    but    with   an    insulated    spherical   ball.   This ball   acts

  564               Proceedings      of the Royal Society
 inductively    upon another insulated spherical ball which is in con
 nection with the electrometer.
    Before proceeding with the investigation                    proper,   I  tested the
 accuracy   of   the method by applying            it   to determine       how the in
 duced   potential of the ball in connection with the                      electrometer
 depends on the distance between           the centres of the balls.              I found
 that the equation
                               V = 6081 r-1-      42-26,
 whero   V  denotes the induced potential, and              r the distance, between
 the centres    of the balls, satisfies all the observed values of                  V   for
 values  of  r   greater   than twenty-four        centimetres,        but for smaller
values of   r  the function requires to be corrected              by being multiplied
by
                                /(r) = -524    + -02 r.
 Our method,      when applied to measure the difference                   of potential
required to pass a spark through air at the atmospheric pressure
between    parallel metal plates at different distances,                 gave    a result
agreeing well     with that which Sir William Thomson discovered                         to
bo true for small distances.            The function for V, the difference of
potential in terms of       s, the length of the spark is
                            V = 66-94 J(s*      + -205 s]
the   equation of an hyperbole, whose semi-transverse                     axis is -1025
centimetres,     and semi-conjugate         axis    6'8623        centimetre-gramme-
second    units.    Wo    observed,    for lengths of spark, up to            1 -2  centi
metre.
    From the above equation we infer that —
                         R = 66-94      / 1
                                             ;1 + -205

where    R  denotes     the electrostatic force       ;  from which it is evident
that  as s becomes     smaller,   II becomes     greater.         But when the       discs
were heated well, immediately before the taking of the observations,
the curve obtained satisfies the equation —
                               V=  87-04  s-    19-56    8s
a parabola   ;  from which we deduce
                               R = 87-04-19-56          s.

                    of Edinburgh,        Session 1877-78.                       565
This  result, in my opinion, establishes        the truth of Clark-Maxwell's
hypothesis, that the greater         electromotive force         required at the
smaller distances     is due to the existence        of condensed gas on the
surface   of the discs.      Precisely similar results were obtained when
hydrogen was substituted for air.
   The method, when applied to measure the difference                of potential
required to produce      a -5 centimetre     spark at different pressures of
the air, shows    that for the range between the atmospheric               pressure
and twenty mm.,
                         V=-0458        J(p\ + 203p]
where   p  denotes the pressure     in millimetres of     mercury.
   The electric    strengths of several gases were determined by com
paring the differences       of potential required     to pass a -5 centimetre
spark through the gas at 746 mm. pressure.

   1st, The sulphide was prepared                 by dividing      a strong solution        of
trimethyl sulphine         hydrate ([(CH3)3S]HO)               into two equal parts,
saturating one with sulphuretted hydrogen, and then adding the
other.       The    strong aqueous         solution      thus   obtained was placed
under    a  bell jar filled with coal-gas over anhydrous phosphoric acid.
After   a certain      concentration had been attained,              sulphide of methyl
began     to evaporate        along with the water.            When       a solution     pre
pared in this way was sealed up in a glass tube, a very slight rise of
temperature       caused the liquid to separate into two layers, the upper
consisting of sulphide of methyl and the lower of aqueous solution —
                                                 =

   This    aqueous solution has           all  the characters        of an alkaline sul
phide.       It  dissolves     sulphur, forming an orange-coloured                  polysul-
phide,     it  dissolves    sulphide      of antimony,        gives    the characteristic
reaction with nitro-prusside, and, when treated with an acid, gives
off sulphuretted hydrogen,             a salt of trimethyl-sulphine           being left in
solution.      'When exposed to the air, the sulphide is rapidly oxidised,

     In   answer           to your question about                            the alteration           of   surface    in
quartz crystals,                 I        place     the glass or quartz
plate         whose            refractive          index    x *3 to Re
determined                between           two      right-angled flint-

the    angle         6,    at which               total reflection begins
from the             hypothenuse of the first flint-glass
prism     ;    the angle              6     can easily be               calculated
from i,        fi.    the refractive                index      of the             flint-

system of flint-glass prisms, and after                                      passing
through the second                         prism     is     examined by               a     direct vision set of

Of   course one can use flint-glass prisms other than right-angled ones,
and,    in    fact, for measures        of quartz,     I       have     had flint-glass prisms
made by Steinheil                in Munich, in which i              was only a few degrees.

  The differences of tho individual measurements in diiFerent speci
mens   attribute to difference in the properties of the specimens of
       I
quartz themselves.
     In old quartz          surfaces    which have already                   been about twenty
years in my possession, and                 in others which            I      have    found in the

                         of Edinburgh, Session 1877-78                           569
physical collections in Wurtzburg              and  Heidelberg,     the    refractive
index for the Fraunhofer line            D varied  between     1-5141 and 1-5374
for    the ordinary ray, and between         1-5216 and 1-5470 for the extra
ordinary.
    I    allow the first surface       of the quartz to adhere         by capillary
attraction, and my large horizontal circle, by which fi and i are
measured, reads to two seconds.
    Crown glass plates from Steinheil, which had lain ten or twelve
years in a press, and whose refractive index for             D  was l-5245, gave,
by total reflection        at the surface, the refractive index      1 -4903.
    The alteration of the surface appears to me to be due, in quartz                as
 in glass, to       a  chemical change of surface, perhaps to the vapour in
the air forming a hydrate of silicic acid, or          a  hydrate of silic.
    The above measures and arrangements                have    not yet been pub
 lished, but they are entirely at your service           if  you can use them in
 your article on Elasticity.
     I  hoped     to have sent you with the former ones some measures of
 the refractive indices of natural quartz surfaces, but then the obser
 vations have to be made with reflected light, which impairs their
 accuracy; besides, in spite of great trouble,          I  have not been able to
 procure any quartz whose surfaces were flat enough                  and complete
 enough      for this inquiry.        The only crystalline surface           which   I
 could examine seemed to have the same refractive indices as fresh
 polished surfaces.          Besides,  I  am not astonished       to find different
 refractive indices in different quartz crystals, since          I have invariably
 found slight variations in the optical constants even for light trans
 mitted through different specimens of crystals,              for instance, in the
 amount of rotation of the plane of polarisation.                Even    if  one had
 kept the crystal for thousands             of years under the same physical
 conditions, for instance, at the same temperature,               &c., still, accord
 ing to my opinion, the mode in which it was originally                       formed
  would     ail'eet   its final stationary condition.       Crystals, like human
  beings,    and like films of liquid upon heterogeneous            solid or liquid
  surfaces, carry with them during their whole existence                the mark of
  their origin or birth.          Two bodies     can only show properties ex
  tremely alike, never exactly the         same.

 572                  Proceedings of the Royal Society
similar facility, but, on the contrary, much friction                   must now     be
called into play, owing to the extensive resisting surface over                 which
the air-currents are drawn.*             Since friction is much greater           near
the earth's     surface   than it is aloft, it follows that such storms             are
characterised      by greatly retarded surface currents, and rapid              upper
currents.      Looking at the mass of the atmosphere on the outskirts
 and outside the area of the storm as the source whence the incurring
air-currents draw their supply, it is obvious that               as  regards the   true
cyclone the source of supply is easy and copious,                    whereas in     the
case  of our widespread European storms,                  supply is comparatively
scarce, and therefore         defective.    In truth,      as the  lower and denser
air-currents are, owing to the enormous extent of surface they cover,
much retarded by friction, the main source of supply for the inflow
ing currents is chiefly to be found in the rarer, more mobile, and
more rapid upper currents which             flow comparatively free and unim
peded.      This    essential   difference   in the mode of inflow of the air-
currents of these two types of storms                 is considered      to be due to
differences    in the amount of friction, accompanied                 also by a great
difference    in   the introduction      of the important element            of Time.
The difference       in velocity between        the   surface   and upper currents
is often    very great.       Thus Glaisher has shown from his balloon
ascents that the upper currents are sometimes five or six times more
rapid than the surface currents,            while from observations           made at
the top and base of Mount Washington,                  it was shown that on one
occasion    the wind on the summit was blowing with a velocity of
ninety miles an hour at the time that               a calm    prevailed at the base
of the mountain.
    The following illustration will show what is meant in this paper
by   the expression       opening out all round.             Let   a barometric de
pression    be   formed several hundred miles in diameter,                 and let the
stratum    of air resting on the surface be calm, whilst aloft upper
currents flow in upon the centre at the rate of ninety miles an hour.
In this    case the central inflow         will  be carried     out entirely by the
upper currents, and consequently there will result from this mode of
inflow an outward extension or an opening outwards of the area of
 diminished pressure.

Let now DBF represent a vertical section of a barometric minimum
of   a very much larger diameter.                 When it       opens up all round in the
way    described bymeans of rapid upper currents,                     it will be accompanied
by    a lowering       of   the surrounding          gradients      from the upper part
of which         the main source             of supply is derived.             The result is

 that the depression               originally   embracing        a  circular space whose
 diameter was D         F will       widen out, and the diameter extend to G                 E
 Tho inflow          which      in    this way takes          place    along the gradients
bounded by the circle whose diameter                         is  D F,      as shown by the
arrows a and         /, will    now have the effect of lowering the gradients
 BF     and     BD     to   BH       and   B G.     The result of this may be repre
sented     by the removal             of the air comprised           in the spaces G B D
and    H B F.
    When       the air moves more rapidly aloft than                   it  does near the sur
face,   it  may be conceived             as   moving onwards,          not in vertical, but
in inclined columns              ;  and we have endeavoured               to show* that this
mode of inflow            is attended         by "lifting," and          to some extent by
fictitious     pressure, by which is meant that although the                       barometer
indicates       correctly      the     elasticity   of the       air,    still it  no   longer
represents        its real      mass      overhead,     but a pressure          more   or less
diminished         owing     to the mechanical movement                    of the air and to
friction.       The opening out or extension of the area of barometric
minimum, with           D F for its         diameter,    to a wider area, having G           H
for its diameter, is effected by the upper currents, indicated by a and
/ of    fig. 2.      These     upper currents,         which flow in upon            the   low
central depression from              a great distance       all round, have their source
of supply in        the upper        still  atmosphere      around and outside the cir
cular space over which they blow.                    It   is here where outward exten

that in which in the segment A B the N.E. wind blows.                            Clouds
apparently moving from the S.W. are often observed                       in this part
of the storm, where          N.E. wind first       begins   to exhibit itself.        No

general    movement        of  the air, however,       takes   place,   because     it is
here that     it first  commences and continues to be generated                from the
still  atmosphere        ahead,   where   the    curve    of outward propagation
advances      upon it.      This continued      generation    also represents       what
takes place in the clouds.           Their  apparent      movement,      which is due
solely to their additional          formation, is the result of atmospheric
changes which          must   here take place.       Hence occasionally they do
not represent        the force and direction        of the wind.       Similarly     sea
men often observe a gale approaching from some point to leeward.
    It has been supposed         by some writers that the progress of storms
is due to the area of low pressure               being impelled forward by the
high pressure usually found near their rear, aided by the diminished
pressure     in front, which is due to heat and vapour.                   If  this were
the case,      it  is evident that     a derangement         would take        place   as
regards the circular symmetry of the storm and the direction of the
spirally inblowing          winds, owing to the enormous              friction    which
these widespread        storms would encounter          in being pushed         forward
over the earth's surface.          The more evident of these derangements
 would be the steepening of the barometic                gradients   in front of the
storm, a result the reverse of what observation                shows to take place.
 The Rev. Clement Ley has shown that the isobars are widest, and
gradient consequently          lowest in the front of the storm.*              Further,
 if this were the cause of the progress            of storms, areas of depression
 would move more rapidly over the ocean than over the land.                         Pro
fessor   Loomis has shown, however,              that while    the average rate        of

progress of depressions          over  the    ocean      is 19 miles an hour, over
the land the rate is 26 miles              an hour.           It  is also evident      that
if a depression      moves      forward accompanied              by spirally     inflowing
winds, — considered        simply     as   inflowing        air-currents, and       not    as
representing an efficient motive force capable of generating                       forward
movement, — a       derangement        as   regards       their force      and direction
would    take   place, especially       on those     occasions when the onward
march of the storm attains          a speed    of 70 miles an hour.             But in     no
case has such a derangement           been observed.
   Proposed Theory as          to the  Progress of Storm*. — When, however,
the depression      is not being impelled forward in the mode above
described,    but in virtue of an opening                  out in front, and          when
the air-currents,     inflowing      spirally upon the centre,              are   regarded
as an effective    motive force capable of causing                  progressive     motion,
no derangement          can   be   supposed      to     take     place   as   regards     the
force and direction of the air-currents               ;    and no steepening of the
gradients in front will take place, since the change in the position
of the depression is effected with facility by the transference                      of the
air from the front to the rear along the north segment of the depres
sion.
   A  depression advances by means of these spirally inflowing currents,
owing to the difference which exists in their mode of inflow, and conse
quently in their force and direction ; and it is in this way that outward
extension in one direction is carried out                This difference in      the mode
of inflow   is mainly due to the introduction in a much higher degree
of the element of friction into the currents                 of the front segment       ;  in
this way scarcity of supply is produced in this part of the depres
sion, and the effect is intensified by the ascending                    tendency     of the
air in this segment         of the depression.              On the other hand, the
currents which enter in at the rear are much less retarded by fric
tion, because      there    is a descending         tendency         of the air in this
segment,    and,   consequently,       supply is copious.*              The low central
pressure,   by travelling onwards towards the region in front, where
supply is scarce, and whore              opening out takes             place,   practically
overcomes    this scarcity of supply, and thus uniformity of inflow is
practically   restored     by progressive        movement.            If   there   was     no
progress, and     if  the depression        was accompanied             by this want of

uniformity        in    the mode           of inflow, it would then tend to fill up.
Progress is therefore the means by which a depression is maintained.
     Since the difference in the mode of inflow is due to a difference in
the amount of friction called into play, we have here, probably, the
reason why storms               advance          more       rapidly over the land than over
the ocean.          The deflection              of the winds produced                      by the earth's
rotation,      and the irregularity in the amount of pressure at different
points immediately              outside         the area of the depression                       itself, have
doubtless       important bearings on this whole question.
     It   is very generally supposed                  that the spiral inflow to the centre
is supposed         to bo thero carried off by means of a vast ascending
current        from the centre.               This opinion             is,   however,      open to serious
objections,      but which                would be out of place here to discuss.
                                 is, it
     The general result                   that progress          is   regarded as being due to an
irregularity in the direction and force of the spirally inflowing currents,
arising from the different degrees in which the element of friction
is   called into play in the                  different segments of the storm, accom
panied or aided           by high pressure                  on    the right of the direction in
which the depression moves.
     Summary.— When              a    depression           is   formed with         a   narrow diameter,
it   fills up rapidly     if    it    has     a   copious         supply from the surrounding
atmosphere,         and    the       filling up        is   of course attended                  by     a   rapid
rise of the low central                   barometer.             But     if    the    depression           has   a
very large diameter,                 the      element           of friction         must       enter   largely
into the problem.               The retarding influence                       due to       this cause        will
necessarily        be    greatest         in the        denser         currents         near     the   earth's
surface    ;    while     the        light,     rarefied,         and        mobile      upper currents
will      move with       great facility.               Hence         the main          source of supply
will      be    thrown     on        these      freely      flowing           upper currents.                The
rapidity and facility with which they inflow give rise to horizontal
extension        or shallowing             out aloft, and this extension                        would take
place equally all round               if    the inflow            were uniform             in all the seg
ments      of the depression.                   If,   however,         this uniformity             of inflow
does not exist,         but     is   more       copious          in one segment and scarce                       in
another, then extension                   and     shallowing out will take place towards
that particular direction where supply                            is   scarce.       Hence progressive
movement          takes place         in this direction, and                   is    attended by           filling
up in the       rear.     When supply                 is   equally copious              in all directions,

the low central barometer rises rapidly       ;  but when the supply is not
copious and uniform all round, the barometer does not rise, because,
though the depression     fills up in the rear, there is     a corresponding
opening    out in the front, and the central barometer            remains   low
— thus    producing   the   central spiral inflow     which    generates    the
motive force to which the progressive         movement   is due.

 5.   Remarks on the         Phonograph.          By Professor Fleeming
       Jenkin and Mr      J.   A. Ewing.
    Professor Fleeming      Jenkin   and    Mr J. A. Ewing exhibited             a
 phonograph     which   they had constructed, and also            some   curves
 drawn on paper representing the indentions produced             in the tinfoil
 of the instrument by vowel      sounds.
     The phonograph exhibited had been constructed from           a description
 of the instrument invented by Mr Edison, and consisted of             a  barrel
  about four inches diameter       and   four inches long, mounted on           a
  spindle on which     a square-threaded        screw had been cut.         One
  bearing of the spindle was cylindrical, and the other was           a  nut in
  which the screw worked.        A fly-wheel handle turned the spindle
  and barrel, which advanced     during each turn by     a distance    equal to
  the pitch  of the screw.     A helical   groove, about   Js  in. in breadth,
  was cut on the surface of the barrel, having the same axial pitch
  as the screw on the spindlo.
     A smooth strip of tinfoil    was gummed round the barrel, and            in

  580                  Proceedings      of the Royal Society
  dentations produced in this strip by a point attached              to a vibrating
  disc stretched     across a short brass cylinder 2£ in. diameter.
     The same vibrating         disc was used to produce the indentations
  and to reproduce        the sounds.
     The usual ferrotype plate had not been tried as a vibrator, for
  hard metal discs were found to give a disagreeable             resonance      to the
  voice and its reproduction.          A slack tinfoil  disc had been used with
 good results     ;   the marker was attached        firmly to a small disc of
 stiff paper £ in. diameter, gummed to the tinfoil ; a short piece of
 watch spring was also attached to the marker, so as to give the disc
 a  rapid period of vibration.
     A  sentence     reproduced     by this disc was loud enough to be heard
 by many people standing round, and sentences had been heard by
 several persons who understood them without               any previous idea of
 what they were.          This result could not,   however,   always be secured.
 When      the sentence       was known     to the hearers,   it  appeared     to  be
 given back with startling accuracy.             The vowel sounds were more
 distinct    than the consonants,         but the consonants       also   were    dis
 tinctly    to bo heard         The   tinfoil vibrator    gave   more     articulate
sounds when         slack and irregular than when it was neatly strained
over the end      of   the tube.
    An oil-silk disc      had also been tried with no spring, and a simple
marker attached          to a disc of mica, gummed        to the oil-silk.      This
disc gave purer sounds than the tinfoil, but they were not nearly so
loud.     The indentations on the tinfoil were excellent to the                  eye,
and quite as large        as with the tinfoil.
    The oil-silk answered best when irregularly stretched.
    An india-rubber film, with        a similar mica disc and rigidly attached
marker,     had also been tried, and gave beautiful records on the tin
foil strip, but this        disc failed to reproduce    the sounds      accurately,
having a note of its own.
    This latter     disc was used to produce       records which were         subse
quently enlarged and shown on paper in the form of curves.                       The
india-rubber was preferred for this purpose, because the gentle                  and
uniform pressure which it gave did not tend to obliterate the records.
The curves exhibited showed the form of the indentations magnified
about    five hundred times.          This magnification    was effected by two
compound       levers, of which the second was a glass siphon             like that
                                                                                      i

    The authors had not yet had time to analyse             these curves and
compare       them with Helmholtz's theory of vowel sounds.
    The advantage        of recording    the   curves corresponding to tho
several sounds indirectly by means of the tinfoil, instead of directly,
as in the       case of the phonautograph, consists in the fact that with
this    arrangement     the amplitude of the oscillations may be greatly
magnified without introducing any sensible error due to the inertia
of   the    moving parts.      The paper      band and tinfoil    record  were
moved       at   a very   slow speed,     and   their relative advance     was
rendered quite definite by a mechanical          connection between the two
barrels on which they were wound.

          1.    On Thermal Conductivity.           By Professor Tait.
                                   (Abstract.)
    This    paper    contains the results of a laborious series of experi
 ments    and calculations carried out during the last ten years, the
 object being the repetition and extension to other metals than iron
 of Forbes' experiments,      described   to the Society in 1862 and 1865.
    As   a check upon his work, the author first experimented upon the
    VOL.   IX.                                                      4 H

iron bar employed by Forbes, and reproduced,               almost  exactly,
Forbes' results for that metal — the most notable feature of which,
besides   the first really trustworthy     determination of absolute con
ductivity, was the discovery that the thermal conductivity          of   iron
is diminished      by heating, and is very nearly proportional       to the
reciprocal   of the absolute temperature.
    None of the other metals tried by the author, viz., copper (two
specimens, selected as being specially good and specially bad con
ductors of electricity), lead, and German silver, gave at all analogous
results.    Their  absolute  conductivities have been determined      ;  and
the changes     produced    by heat in these conductivities were, where
any, very slight, and uniformly        in the direction of improved con
ductivity at higher temperatures.
    A  second part of the paper      is promised, to contain comparisons
of thermal and electric conductivity in the same substance, with an
investigation of the

 2.  On the Wave Forms of Articulate              Sounds.    By Professor
                Fleenring Jenkin and        Mr J. A. Ewing.
    In this  paper the authors gave a preliminary account of experiments
made with the help of the phonograph exhibited at the last meeting.
The following results have been obtained: —
    1.  The vowel sounds can be produced by maintaining the relative
pitch of the simple tones         of which   they are composed    constant,
although the absolute pitch of those simple tones may vary greatly.
The authors found         that  whether they turned the barrel of the
phonograph at      a greater   speed or at a less speed than that which
had been maintained while the human voice            produced the indenta
tions, the several vowels were given back with equal distinctness.
    This experiment proves        that within certain limits a given wave
 form in the tinfoil     produces    a given vowel independently     of   the
rapidity with     which it passes      the  pricker of the vibrating    disc.
 It proves therefore   that within these limits a given group of partials
 is competent     to produce     a given   vowel effect, whatever be the
 absolute   pitch of the prime tone, and of the relative partials.      This
 result is of much importance, since Willis, Wheatstone, Donders,

                      of Edinburgh,       Session 1877-78.                                 583
and Hclmholtz seem all to consider that                    a certain      absolute    pitch is
characteristic of each vowel.
              — May       24. — Since the above communication was made                        to
     [Note.
the Society, the authors have improved their phonograph, and also
their    apparatus    for enlarging the record embossed                    on the     tinfoil.
For this      reason they have substituted in the figures                    shown better
curves than those which were originally presented                          to the Society.
Subsequent experiments           with the improved instrument also render
it   desirable   to add a few words to the statement                made in the text as
to the effect of altered speed in the quality of the sounds given by
the phonograph.             The original experiment consisted                  in speaking
the set of vowel sounds,           A, E, I, O, U (pronounced in Italian
fashion), to the phonograph,         and then listening to the sound given
when the instrument was run at various rates.                            The vowels wore
observed      to maintain their relative places, so as to form the complete
series    in which each individual             sound       was     by contrast        at least
recognisable     as the    vowel which had been spoken.                   This experiment
has since been frequently repeated with perfect succesa                              Again,     if
a single vowel sound, such as         " oh,"     be sung          to the phonograph at
an ordinarily high pitch, it will be found to remain                         oh through a
considerable range of speeds          ;   but the oh whose                 pitch has been
raised    by quickening the phonograph seems to the authors brighter
than the oh sung by the human voice at a correspondingly high
pitch; that is to say, it resembles "awe" to some extent. Similarly
the spoken  " awe," when accelerated, passes into a sound like ah.
The     change appears to be greater with some vowels than with others,
and also to depend partly on the pitch at which the vowel has been
originally sung.           The instrument       is,   however, even in its present
improved form, not well adapted                for testing any fine gradation of
the quality of sound.            Although      the authors now feel unable                      to
speak with any confidence           as to change of quality                 produced by          a
 change of speed, they consider           it   proved that the vowels,                A,   E, I,
 O, U, remain distinguishable by contrast when all their constituents
 are simultaneously raised         or lowered         to   a    considerable     extent, but
 they do not consider that the phonograph                  is   as yet   sufficiently perfect
 to enable them to judge how far the definition of constant quality
 suggested in     §   3   below would or could be accepted by the ear.]

      The authors' experiments do not prove that a given vowel always
produces            a   definite wave form.
      2.     A    given person pronouncing or singing a vowel sound at                                       a
constant pitch produces                      a wave         form of remarkable constancy.
This         proves          that the relative phases of the simple tones,                        of which
tho compound tone is                    built   up, do not alter, while a single vowel is
being sung or intoned on one note.                                The same person or different
persons            pronouncing          the same vowel on different occasions,                         will
frequently reproduce                  wave forms closely similar, but the experiments
are not yet sufficiently extended to determine whether a given voice
speaking the same vowel at a given pitch will always produce the
same wave form.
      3.     A    given person singing the same vowel throughout an octave,
often produces wave forms of different appearance on different notes,
although he may be endeavouring to keep the quality of his vowel
constant                It   must on this be remarked that up to the present time
there has been no standard or criterion as to constancy                                       of quality    at
different pitches.                  This    has been a mere matter                    of appreciation by
different          ears.      A standard wave might,               indeed, be taken and declared
to be the form which gives a constant quality at all pitches.                                          The
phonograph is sufficiently distinct in its utterance to allow it to be
said        that such         a   standard a or    o   will       be accepted         within   a consider
able        range as the same vowel,                   but it cannot be affirmed that all
hearers would say that the quality                            of the vowel was constant in
their judgment at all pitches.                         It   is,   however, possible that hence
forth constancy of quality may be defined                               as   that given by constancy
of wave form.
      4.    The vowels are heard equally well, or nearly so, whether the
machine            is   run backwards or forwards.                           The authors put in the
saving clause                " nearly   "
                                            everywhere, because the sounds obtained
from the phonograph are not sufficiently                                      clear   to warrant      more
absolute           conclusions.         This reversibility              is
                                                                        a      necessary consequence
of Helmholtz's theory that the ear decomposes the compound tones
into their harmonic constituents, and                              is    indifferent         to the phase
relation of these.
  5.        Not only          the vowels but the consonants                     are substantially          the
same when produced backwards.                           This result           is   novel to the authors,
and        is,   they believe, quite unforeseen.                    There      is   little   to wonder at

                      of Edinburgh,           Session 1877-78.                        585
in the    fact that r, or s, or 6, which are continuous, should sound
alike backwards and forwards, but it               is very remarkable that sounds
like p or k     at the end of the syllable should, when produced                     back
wards, give the same effect           as  p and k at the beginning of         a word.
    The authors tested this singular fact in the following way                  : — They
first  arranged      that a simple           combination,    such     as   "abafa"      or
" afaba,"   should be said to the instrument while one observer was
out of the room.         He then came in, and heard the word backwards.
If the original      word had been " abafa," he was iu all                cases    able to
say that he heard
                        " afaba   "
                                    ;   if  the original word had been         " adaka,"
he heard    " akada."       Inasmuch as he was quite uncertain whether
the word spoken to the instrument was "adaka" or "akada," this
experiment was in itself almost decisive.                  All    the letters      of the
alphabet were tried in this way.                Fearing, however,        that when tli,-
alternative lay between two consonants,                these might be recognised
by    some    other quality than their true sound,                 the    authors next
proceeded    to test the fact by speaking short words, such as                "   amma,"
" abba,"   and so forth, to the instrument.              These were recognised by
an observer       from outside when spoken              backwards.         "Alia"      was
recognised     at once;    "appa"       was called    "abba"; "amma"              was re
                once; "
                                "
cognised    at             atta    was called "adda."
    The greatest difficulty was met with in distinguishing                    s   from  /,
but   the difficulty     was not greater backwards             than      forwards.      It
seems due to the fact         that the instrument used will not record the
high tones which        are obviously present in these sounds.
    When the fact       had been established that a consonantcould be
sounded backwards between                 two vowels, monosyllables were next
tested  :
          "  ba
                 "
                    was reversed and heard as "ab ;" " ka
                                                                       "
                                                                          was reversed,
and heard     as   "ak."
    This is  even more remarkable than the previous results, inasmuch
as the mode of pronouncing             b   or k at the end of    a  word is different
from that employed when it begins                a word.
    Finally,     by    pronouncing           any     word   backwards,         such     as
"  noshaeesossa,"      and    then reversing the instrument,               the original
word (association)       was clearly heard.          With  a little practice,       a sen
tence   might      be spoken backwards,             and then heard          intelligibly
forwards.
    The letter    h was   not in the phonograph to be distinguished from

 586                   Proceedings of       the   Royal Society
eh, and gave a single reversible sound.                 " Ho," when turned          back,
sounded       distinctly
                           " och."
    Since both vowels and consonants                   sound alike backwards          and
forwards, it appears that articulate speech may be divided into                          a
series    of  successive parts, each having a character of its               own,     and
each reversible so far as sensation           is concerned.
    The separate reversible sensations correspond               in the main       to the
letters of our alphabet,         but our letter    i  represents at least  two rever
sible elements, and eh, ng, or th, on the contrary, are single sounds.
Clear, clean sounds, as spoken by educated                  people in  all countries,
seem remarkable         for the small number of the elements               that enter
into each word           An   uneducated     man, speaking a dialect or patois,
will    make each nominal           vowel consist of a large group of simple
reversible sounds running into one another.
     6.   The wave form for the letter           r  has been recorded.        It  agrees
with that obtained by Donders on the phonautograph, and consists
of a series of simple curves, similar to harmonic curves, which gradu
 ally    increase    to  a   maximum, and          then gradually     decrease      to a
 minimum.        The number of waves separating the maximum from the
 minimum intensity of the sound was in the examples                    observed      7 or
 8.     The length of the whole period was therefore 14 or                16.
     7.   The wave forms obtained from the letter                 o in  figs. 4 and 5
 illustrate the difficulty which the ear, even of trained musicians,
 feels    in determining       the octave    in which     a given note is sung.        It
 will   be seen that each period consists of two very nearly equal parts,
 and that the amplitude of the second partial has obviously been
 large as compared with that           of the prime tone.       To  one ear    it might
 seem natural to call the pitch that            of the    second   partial, since this
 was the loudest tone          ;  to another the pitch would be that of the
 prime, because this tone was lowest             in pitch.     Naming a given note
 by the lowest of its component tones, irrespective of the relative
 intensity of the partials, seems to be             a  convenient but conventional
 rule.
     8.   The instrument        as at present   made does not record       all  sounds.
 This      is shown by the fact that its reproduction of the French u is
 very imperfect, and         ee  is only sometimes well heard from it.
     The curves laid before the Society were obtained by multiplying
 the traces on the         tinfoil   some 300 times        by means of a system of

                        of Edinburgh,      Session  1877-78.                  587
lovers.      The lines were drawn on the paper by the plan of friction-
less marking invented by Sir William Thomson, and used in his
Siphon      Ileeorder.      A  rise in the curve (on the page) corresponds       to
a hollow in         the  tinfoil.   The arrow pointing      from right to left,
indicates the direction in which the tinfoil passed under the vibrat
ing pointer       when the sounds were uttered.
    The authors hope soon to be able to communicate              to the Society
the results       obtained    by subjecting the experimentally drawn wave
forms to harmonic analysis.

 3.  On the Action of the Chlorides of Iodine upon Acetylene
               and Ethylene.      By George M'Gowan.
    Before giving the action of ethylene on the chlorides of iodine, I
may shortly describe the method of preparing the latter, which I
found to be the most advantageous      : —
    A weighed   quantity of perfectly dry iodine being introduced     into

                              of Edinburgh, Session 1877-78.                                                        589
bulb A of flask                  1,     perfectly dry chlorine                    gas is passed over                 it,
A       being at the same time heated                               over      a   water-bath            to      about
60° to 80° C.  The IC1„ as                           it     is   formed,      volatilises and condenses
almost entirely in   only           B,             a    small portion escaping                     into flask        2.
Chlorine           is   passed   until       no more iodine remains                  in bulb A.                 If the
heating be omitted, only the outermost layers of iodine are converted
into        the    trichloride,          a    kernel remaining unacted                         on.     (Compare
Glirhiomanos, Berl. Ber. X. No.                             5,   p. 434.)
    The tubes connecting the two flasks are ground into one another
at D, so that no cork or caoutchouc                                fittings are required.                    This    is
absolutely necessary.
    By attaching             a   small CaCl, tube to                E,    no moisture can enter the
apparatus.              The flasks can             be   weighed either together or separately.
When            passing       ethylene or acetylene                       over    either of the                 iodine
chlorides,         I    found    it     best to cleanse and dry flask                     2,   leaving the gas
to act on the chloride in                       1.       In that way any volatilised matter
from     1     was condensed             in   2,   and the loss of weight was very trifling.
    By adding             the required weight of iodine to the IC13, and                                     heating
gently         over      a water-bath (the vessel being corked), IC1                                       is   easily
prepared.          I     invariably got   in the state of long needles.*

Briefly described,    this method is as follows              :   — Into   a   thick       flask of
                                                                  Wash lotties    la

alcoholic solution of     KOH,        and heated over a water-bath to                     100° or
thereabouts,     C2H4Br2,      pure   or diluted      with       alcohol, is slowly          and
regularly dropped from a separating funnel.                       The C2H2      disengaged
passes off through an upright Liebig's condenser,                    also affixed to          the
flask, by which means             most    of the monobrom-ethylene                   (C,H3Br)
formed at first, and carried away along with the C2H2, is                        returned to
the flask.     Some of   it,   however,    escapes undecomposed               from   this flask
into   a   second one, also containing           alcoholic       KOH, and        fitted

an upright condenser, precisely in the same manner as              the first.    In
this second flask it is practically entirely decomposed.               The C2H2
is then passed through alcohol at 0° (to absorb traces of C2H3Br),
then through two Wollf's bottles filled with water, and lastly through
two CaCl2    tubes.    The gas may then be considered           practically pure.
To    test this, I  passed     it for   about   half an hour through the two
 weighed flasks, surrounded by a mixture of ice and salt, but at the
end of that time they had not gained in weight to speak of.

and then decompose this by dilute hydrochloric acid, is an extremely
tedious    and   troublesome       operation,    and offers   very little     corre
sponding advantage.         Sabanjeff discusses the other known methods
for  the preparation of C2H2           very fully in his paper.       I also tried
some of them, but found the above by far the best of all.

    On passing     C2H2   over     pure   dry IC13 at 0°, combination takes
place with great evolution of heat.             I always found more or less
iodine separated out.          My chief object being       to try to prepare the
 compound, C2H2C1I,         I    did not investigate farther the         products
formed.     Probably,    if the IC13 were kept cold in a mixture             of ice
 and salt,   and the C2H.,        diluted with air and passed over it very
 slowly, one might get the compound C2H2Cl;iI.

 The C2H2 was passed as quickly as possible through this ethereal
 solution, to reduce as much as might be the secondary reaction of
 the IC1 on the ether.        It  was absorbed     greedily.
    After saturation     the     ethereal   solution was diluted with water,
 when a heavy liquid settled to the bottom.              This  was washed with
 dilute NaOH solution, and then with water, and dried over CaCl2.

What ether     remained       in the above    liquid     was distilled off at 35° to 40°
in  a  current of C2H2.          Even at this temperature          a   slight decomposi
tion occurred        (iodine separating),          so   I  stopped heating.          It was
found practicable, however, to fractionate the liquid (with very slight
decomposition)         in   a   current     of steam.          Repeated      fractionating

    Sabanjeff states      that    he,   while    preparing the iodide in this
manner, got         at the   same     time   a   large   quantity     of  a  liquid

few drops of a liquid which could at all correspond                 to this second
iodide.      Whether it was the iodide, or          a  product of the action of
the iodine in the alcohol, Sat.,        I cannot say.     The quantity got was
too small.
    The chief object which        I had in view in preparing the preceding
acetylene      compounds (chlor-iodide, iodide, also tetrabromide, &c.),
 was that from        them  I might     be able to obtain the       corresponding
 cyanogen      ones, which,    if  got   and   treated   with   an alkali,   would
 probably have yielded chloro- (or iodo-) acrylic, and fumaric or
 maleic acids.       I have not, however, as yet succeeded in obtaining
 them.
    Whether C2H2 combines with iodide of cyanogen when the latter
 is dissolved in alcohol, I cannot yet say.                It does not with dry
 ICN.
    All   attempts     to obtain the      cyanogen     compounds of C2H„ by

 AgCN, (AgCN          + KCN), H2(C^2),} or with ICN and              a metal, were
 fruitless.
    When H2(CN)2 was used, generally no reaction occurred, and in
 nearly all the other cases ammonium salts were formed in large
 quantity.       I had unfortunately only        a small quantity of the chlor-
 iodide at my disposal.

     A couple of months ago        I  had the honour of submitting to the
 Society a speculation       upon  the metamorphism      of a particular rock
 mass.     To-night   I  again return to metamorphism,        submitting, how
 ever, not     a speculation,    but the closely elaborated     process of  the
 change which has affected another rock.
    It is perhaps natural that the attention of one who approaches
 geology from the chemical        and mineralogical sides should be imme
 diately directed to those rocks which are either aggregates of simple
 minerals,    or which are the products of changes effected upon simple
 minerals   ;  natural also that consideration should be first given to
 those   in which that change        has been more immediately chemical
 than physical.
    To no rock mass does this apply more directly than to serpentine.
 In my wanderings I have visited and closely observed the relation
 ship of — with a single exception — every bit of this rock which is to
 be found between Unst and Tyree on the one hand, — Harris and
 the Black Dog Rock on the other.

the subject recurred                    to   me.     In   order    to bring as much light                to
bear upon           it   as possible,        I greatly extended the           number       of   analyses
which      I   undertook           ; and, as        bearing upon       it,I   have    now       analysed
20 specimens              of    augite and its allomorphs, 15 of hornblende,                           and

chemically the various steps and stages of the                            transmutation, — which
transmutation              will     be       shown and seen to be the                  formation of
serpentine.

                                    Professor Geikie, F.RS.
     In   a   historical introduction                 the author gives        an outline         of    the
progress of research into the history of the                          Old Red Sandstone of             the
British area.             This     system      is   at present regarded as composed             of three
sub-divisions, Lower, Middle, and Upper, each characterised by a dis
tinct suite of organic remains.                        From the absence of unequivocally
marine fossils, and from lithological characters,                            it   has been inferred
by   Mr Godwin Austin, Professor Ramsay, Professor Rupert Jones,
as   well      as    other observers,               and   is   now very generally admitted,
that the Old Red Sandstone, as distinguished from the "Devonian"
rocks, probably originated in inland sheets of water.                                  The object of
the present memoir was to endeavour                               to trace out in that geological
system        of deposits         the changes          of physical geography             which        took
place over Western Europe during the interval                                    between    the       close
of the Upper                   Silurian      and the beginning             of the Carboniferous
period.
     After     a    sketch of the probable conditions of the region previous
to the commencement                       of the Old Red Sandstone,                 the author pro
ceeds to show how the shallowing                           Silurian     sea was      converted here
and there into salinas or inland                          seas, by    a   series    of subterranean
movements,               which have left their indelible traces upon the upturned
Silurian rocks.                  He divides his memoir into two                       parts, the first
dealing with               the Lower           and    the second      with the Upper Old               Red
Sandstone.               The present paper deals only with                   a    portion of the first
of these sections.                 It       limits of the different basins in

    Lake    Orcndie. — After       describing the limits of this basin, and
 giving   a sketch   of the labours of previous observers in the Old Red
 Sandstone tracts of the north of Scotland, the author proceeds                       to
 examine    the evidence for the threefold arrangement               of the Old Red
 Sandstone    proposed by Murchison.              He shows that nowhere are the

three    groups,    Lower, Middle,        and Upper,       found     in  consecutive
order ;    that this so-called       " Middle " division        occurs   only in     the
north of Scotland, where             it  lies   unconformably upon the older
paheozoic rocks, and is itself unconformably overlaid by the Upper
Old Red Sandstone,            thus occupying        a position exactly similar         to
that of the Lower Old Red Sandstone on the southern side of the High
lands.     He further points out that while some species of fishes                   are
common       to the    Old Red Sandstone           on the two sides of the High
land barrier, the lithological differences between the deposits of                  the
two areas     are so great as to make        it evident that the rocks       were laid
down in distinct basins, and consequently                 that the fauna of        each
basin    might be expected         to be more or less peculiar, as in many
analogous      cases   at   the present     day.      As  evidence     that adjacent
areas   in  the time      of the Lower Old Red Sandstone               were strongly
 marked     off from each other in their faunas, reference                is made to
the contrast between the fishes and crustaceans of the                 Welsh    region
and those of Lanarkshire and Forfarshire, not a single species being
 common       to the two countries,         though some of the genera               are.
 Reasons are then given why the argument                used by Murchison from
 the occurrence      of many of the Scottish ichthyolites in Russia              could
 not  bo regarded       as  establishing the existence of a         "Middle"      divi
 sion of the Old Red Sandstone.
    The conclusion arrived at by the author is that the Caithness flags
 or " Middle Old Red Sandstone" are probably the general equiva
 lents of the Lower Old Red Sandstone of other regions, and                        that
 this system consists in Britain of two well-marked divisions only— a
 Lower,     which graduates        in some places into the Upper Silurian
 rocks,   and is separated        by an unconformability from an Upper,
 which in many districts passes up into the base of the Carboniferous
 system.
    The various districts into which the area embraced                      under the
 term    Lake Orcadie may be divided are then described seriatim.
 The detailed structure of Caithness has been worked out by the

    From     the    four lowest sub-divisions          no fossils have      yet been
 obtained.        The flagstones     have     yielded to     Mr C. W. Peach         and
other     observers      many land plants (some of which resemble forms
described by Dawson from the Gaspe sandstones) as well as Estheria
 memhranacea,         Pterygotus, sp., and         many ichthyolites.        Availing
himself of       the list of localities furnished to him by           Mr Peach       (to
whom he cordially acknowledges his obligations), with the species of
fish found at each, the author has constructed               a table  of the vertical
distribution of        the fossil fishes   in Caithness.      Some   of  the species
range through almost the entire               succession    of beds.     Some, how
ever, are either peculiar to or very characteristic of one sub-division.
Thus    Osteolejais arenatus and       Dqilerus     Valeneiennesi     are not noted
except from the           group No.       5.    In  the   Thurso and the higher
flagstones     (Nos. 6, 8, and 9), Acanthoses, Parcxus, Cheiracanthus,
Diplacanthus, Pterichihys, and Tristichopterus — genera absent from
the   Wick      beds — are found in         greater  or less abundance.        These
strata are further marked by peculiar species of genera which occur
among      the older flagstones,       as   Coccosteus pusillits     and Osterilepis
microlej>idotus.
   The Orkney Islands are assigned              to the   higher sub-divisions        of

which rises at Stromness and Gremsa being merely an                         indication
 of the irregular surface         on   which the      deposits of Lake          Orcadie
were accumulated,        and   of the    slow progressive       subsidence of          the
area.     The fossils, for which these islands have long been                   famous,
include most of those of the upper groups of Caithness, with                            the
addition of others which have been regarded                  as distinct.        In    the
determination of these fossils, much skill is required to discriminate
between      the accidental differences      of aspect resulting from the             con
dition of fossilisation.          The Orkney fishes,        for instance,       are    pre
served as black jet-like impressions which, often very perfect                      when
first removed      from the quarry, are apt to scale off, leaving in                  e3ch
cise only an amorphous layer which, though it retains                    the contour
of the fish, shows little or no trace of structure.               On the      shores      of
the    Moray     Firth,   on   the   other hand, the organisms            have       been
inclosed within calcareous            nodules  ;  their    colours are     sometimes
brilliant, and their scales, plates, fins, and bones are often admirably
 preserved      and    remain     unchanged      in the      Museum.         Want         of
 experience     in these different modes of preservation          may have led            to
 a   reduplication     of species,     especially in the     case   of  the Orkney
and Moray Firth fishes.           Among the most interesting Orkney                fossils
is a portion of a Pterygotus (recognised            by   Dr H. Woodward),             now
in the British Museum.            The occurrence there of this characteristi
cally Upper Silurian and Lower Old Red Sandstone genus                         supports
the view contended for          in this  paper as to the true horizon of                the
Orkney      and Caithness flagstones.
     The Shetland Islands contain          a portion of the shore-line of Late
 Orcadie,    with its conglomerates        and sandstones      and the       flagstones
 and shales of deeper          water.     Among      these   strata   the    Caithness
 Edheria occurs, with abundant stems and roots of large calamite-like
 plants with      well marked Sittings, but without              observable       joints.
 Some ichthyolites of the Caithness type are said to have been                      found
 in Bressay.      The general lithological characters          are   quite     those      of
 the sandy parts of the Orkney and Caithness groups.                    On the        west
  side of the mainland of Shetland interesting evidence occurs to                    show
 the existence     of volcanic action contemporaneous             with the      accumu
 lation of the Old Ked Sandstone.             Beds     of amygdaloidal lavas           and
 bands    of tuff occur among the sandstones,           the  whole being         pierced
by masses of pink felsite.

      The south- western      and southern margin of this great northern
basin of the Old Red Sandstone can still he               traced nearly continu
ously from the confines of Caithness to the               borders   of Aberdeen
shire, its position being marked by a zone of littoral conglomerates.
Beyond the edge of that zone, however, there occur some interesting
outliers, which in       some cases may represent      long fjord-like indenta
tions of     the coast-line   ; in  others   may mark what were really inde
pendent basins lying at the base of the Grampian mountains.                    The
author points out that probably most of the difficulty which has
 hitherto been experienced in understanding the sequence of beds
 along the southern shores of the Moray Firth, and their parallelism
 with    those of Caithness and Orkney, is not to be attributed to the
 amount of detritus covering the country, but rather to the fact which
 has not heretofore       been observed,      that the Upper     Old Red Sand
 stone,    with Holoptychius        and    Pterichthys  major,    really  overlaps
 unconformably upon the older nodular clays and conglomerates                  with
  Coccosteiw,     Cheirolepis,    &c.     This relation     can be satisfactorily
 determined in Morayshire, and is now being worked out by                        Mr
 John Home in         the course    of the Geological Survey.          The author
  traces   in   great   detail,  from the Spey into Sutherlandshire,             the
 development of the lower sandstones, conglomerates,             and clays, which
  have been regarded       as  equivalents of the Caithness flagstones.          He
  thinks that in no sense can this comparatively thin group of rocks
  (seldom 1400 feet in depth) be regarded as a mere southward
  attenuation of the great Caithness series, as suggested by Murchison,
  for that neither lithologically nor palseontologically can that view be
  sustained.      He has been led to the conclusion that the whole of these
   rocks from the borders of Sutherlandshire to those of Aberdeenshire
  represent    only the higher portions of the great Caithness series, and
   that they were formed during           a  gradual depression     of the ancient
   high grounds whereby the waters of Lake Orcadie were allowed to
   creep southward over the descending           land.   This   movement    is indi
   cated by the character of the strata, and that        it  took place about the
    time of deposit of the later flagstones of Caithness is shown by the
   recurrence    of the fossils of that division     in the nodules, flags, and
   clays of the Moray      Firth   region,   while those of the Lower division
  are absent.

  otherwise remarkably free from any trace of such action                    except

           3.  On Beats       of Imperfect Harmonies.             By Sir
                               William Thomson.
     According to a usage which has been adopted              from the German
 of Helmholtz by the best English scientific writers on sound, a sound
 is called a
               " simple tone,"* or without qualification a " tone," when
 the variation of pressure of the air in the neighbourhood of the ear
 which is the immediate excitant of the sense is according to a simple
  harmonic function        of the time   ;  that is to say, when the whole
  pressure of the air varies     in simple proportion to the distance, from
 a  fixed plane, of a point moving uniformly in a circle.                Consider
 ing the actual sensibility       of the human ear to musical sounds, we
  must    introduce farther    as a practical restriction that the period of
 the variation of the pressure must be less then           ^   of  a second, and
 greater than 10ooo or ^075^         o^ a second.      The vibrations of the air
 produced     by a simple harmonic vibrator are either simple harmonic,
 or are    in circular or elliptic orbits, resulting from        the composition
 of two      simple harmonic       motions  ;   and the consequent change
 of air-pressure     in the neighbourhood       of the ear follows the simple
 harmonic law, provided the maximum velocity of the vibrator and
 of the air in its neighbourhood be infinitely small in comparison
 with the velocity of sound.         Hence the more nearly this condition
 is fulfilled   the more     nearly a simple tone is the sound heard         ;  but
 it  is far from being fulfilled when the vibrator, though             itself per
  forming simple harmonic motion, has sharp edges round                which the
    * The old musical usage, according to which the word tone denotes an interval
(the major tone or minor tone, or the mean tone of the tempered scale), though
it unfortunately   clashes with this recent scientific use of the word tone,    can
scarcely be abandoned.

                        of Edinburgh, Session 1877-78.                                 603
air  is forced to rush      with  great velocity, or when, as          in   the case of
free-reed     organ pipes or the reeds of a harmonium, the vibrator is
an elastic solid moving to and fro in             a  very narrow aperture.              (In
 the case of      a  slapping reed, as of trumpet stops in an organ, the
motion of the vibrator itself is not simple harmonic, and the sound
is excessively      rich in overtones, giving it its peculiarly rich or harsh
character.)
    A harmony         is any sound of    which       the excitant change of air-
pressure    is strictly    periodic, and is not a simple tone.              According
to Fourier's beautiful analysis* of periodic variations, to which the
name     of the harmonic analysis has been                given, any periodically
varying quantity may be regarded             as the sum      of quantities varying
separately according to the simple harmonic law, in periods respect
ively   equal to the main period,       half the main period,         a  third of the
main period, and so on.             According     to   this analysis we          see  that
the variation of air-pressure constituting a harmony may be regarded
as the sum       of variations constituting simple          tones, one      having its
period equal to the period of the harmony;              a second,    half that of the
 harmony     ; a third, one-third that of the harmony, and so on              ;  in other
 words, we may regard the harmony              as  compounded of these simple
tones.
    Practically,     in musical language the term harmony is not applied
 when the tone of the main period predominates                   in the sensory im
 pression,    and    in this case  the sound is simply           called a note       ;   its
 pitch is reckoned according to the main period                ;  and   the effect        of
 the other tones, now called overtones,           which enter into its composi
tion, are merely felt as giving it its character              or quality of sound.
Thus the name harmony is in musical practice                  restricted to      cases    in
which there is either no tone of the main or fundamental period, or
not enough to produce           a predominating impression, and                 a  sound
compounded of two, three, four, or more simple tones, having com
mensurable periods,          is heard.    In    ordinary      musical     language         a
harmony is not regarded           as having any one pitch, but is thought
of as compounded of its known              constituents.       The true period of

the harmony             is,   however,      in every        case    the least      common         multiple
of the period of its constituent tones.                                The number of times                 that
the period of the harmony contains the period of                                  any one of          its con
stituent tones           is    called the harmonic number of that tone.                                        Thj
                                                                                                                \
expression        is   only applicable to any particular tone when viewed
one constituent of             a    harmony.        Following          the usage      of Lord     Rayleigh
and Professor Everett,                I      shall employ the word                     " frequency          "   to
denote the number of periods                      per unit of time,             — per second,           let     us
say, generally          in     acoustical     reckonings.              Thus the       " frequency               t
a    tone or of    a    harmony means the number of its periods per                                   second.
Similarly the frequency of any set of beats, according to the                                          defini
tions and descriptions below, will mean the number                                         of the        beats
per second, and           in this application of             the term      it   will designate         some
times   a    proper fraction, and sometimes                        a   small whole number with
                                                                                            it                            \
fraction.
     The quality of            a    harmony, when the periods of its several                               con
stituent tones are given, depends upon the amplitudes of the
ferent constituents, and on the relation of their phases.                                       Thus,           for dif
example,         consider       a   harmony of two tones.                 They may be so relat
in    phase that at one of the instants of maximum pressure                                      of   one        of
the constituents there                is   also maximum                pressure    of the other          con
stituent.         The same phase-relation,               if    the harmonic numbers of the
constituent tones be both odd, will give also coincident minimums.
But when one of the harmonic numbers        even and the other odd  is
the phase-relation              of coincident maximums will                       also be such that                       n
there   is   a   coincidence          of minimum pressure due to one tone                                with
maximum pressure                    due to the other         ;     and again there             will    be
opposite     phase        in which          there     will    be coincidence         of minimums,
and in this opposite phase there will also be                             a   coincidence of maxi                         \
mum and minimum.     (To avoid circumlocutions   harmony of wol                   a                      t
odd numbers will be called an odd binary harmony   a harmony of                       ;
even    and odd numbers will be called an even binary harmony.)
Thus we          see   that in an odd binary harmony there                             is  a   phase-rela
tion of coincident maximums and coincident                                  minimums, and again
an opposite            phase-relation of coincident maximum                               minimum and
minimum maximum.                       The former        will      be called the phase-relation
of coincidences,              the   latter the phase-relation of oppositions.                         In       an

maximums, the latter the phase-relation of coincident minimums.
The     annexed     diagrams          illustrate and prove          these assertions.                 The
horizontal line in each may ho either regarded                       as       representing space
at any     one instant in the direction of propagation                         of   the     sound, or
it   may represent        times at which successive               phases of the motion are
perceived by an ear in                a   fixed position.         The long vertical cross
bar in     each case denotes maximum of air-pressure                      ;    the short vertical
cross-bar,      minimum.
     For   lecture illustrations it is convenient to use long slips of wood
with     paper pasted          on one side, and the           short and long cross-bars
marked upon         it,   and to support these slips of wood on                     a     board with
nails to guide them              so   that they may be placed                 in groups of two,
three, or four, one over the other, and                     any of them moved                    in    the
direction of its length to illustrate the different phase-relations                                   of   a
harmony.
     Suppose     now, one note of             a   perfect binary harmony to be very
slightly     sharpened          or flattened      :   so slightly    that during               a     large
number of the periods of the perfect harmony, the phase-relation in
the imperfect harmony experiences but little change.                                 Let       the two
notes      of the   imperfect          harmony be sustained               long enough                with
perfect uniformity             as to pitch and intensity       :  — the       effect    will    be that
of perfect harmony, modified by                   a    slow change of its phase-relation
through      a   cycle   ;    which       in the case of an even binary harmony                            is
from coincident maximums gradually to coincident minimums, and
thence     gradually round again to coincident minimums                             ;     and   in    the
case    of an odd binary harmony                 is   from oppositions to coincidences,
and round to oppositions again               ;    and so on in cycles.              In favourable
circumstances,      and with careful attention,               a   variation of the quality
of the sound recurring periodically in these successive cycles                                  is    dis
tinctly    heard, even by an unpractised ear, unless the duration of the
cycle    be too     long or too short to suit its sensibility.                            It    is   this
variation which          is   called the "beat" on the imperfect harmony.
     The period of the beat — that               is   to say, the duration             of the cycle
described above     —     is   most easily found by taking the reciprocal of its
frequency, calculated by the following rule                   :   — The frequency of                  the

beat is equal to the error           of frequency of one note multiplied by the
harmonic number of the               other.    When in a harmony of three or
four notes all arc perfect except one, the beats due to the imperfec
tion of the false one are to be reckoned just               as  if the    harmony        were
binary, according to the following rule              : —

one whose period is the period of their harmony.                        Take this         as  if
it were one tone           of an approximate binary harmony, the false                    note
of the       given     harmony       being    the   other.      Example        : Let        the
frequencies of the three notes be 257, 320, and 384                       :  the common
period of the two last-mentioned is              ^ of    a second, and we have to
calculate     the beats on two notes whose frequencies                are 64 and          257.
The harmonic           numbers of the          harmonies to which             these     notes
approximate are          1  and 4, and the error in frequency of the higher
note    is   1   per second      ;  hence   the beats are at the rate            of    1   per
second.        When     there    is error in two or more notes of a multiple
harmony, two or more sets of beats in periods not commensurable
with    one another are heard          ; but the general      effect is apt to be          too
confused       to allow any one of the sets to be distinctly              counted.         On
a  multiple       harmony       with only      one  note    false   the beats        are in
general      exceedingly distinct, more            so in general       than in binary
harmonies.
   Sometimes,        as for distance     in reckoning the beats in the imperfect
harmonies of         a tempered       musical scale, it is convenient to             regard
the two notes of           an imperfect harmony as         in error from two          notes
of   a perfect harmony differing but little from them                   ;   then the     rule
for calculating the frequency of the beats is to take the difference                        of
the products of the errors of the two notes, each multiplied                      into    the
harmonic number of the other.                Thus, let n and n' be the harmonic
numbers of the perfect harmony to which the given notes approxi
mate, and let       e and    e' be the excesses of the vibrational frequencies
of the two actual notes above two in perfect harmony nearly                           agree
ing with        them.      The frequency of the beat of the actual                 notes is
n'e  - Tie'.
    For   example,     take the following table of numbers of vibrations in
a perfect     diatonic scale, with 256 vibrations per second for C,                  and in
the corresponding scale            of equal temperament (founded on 12                 equal
semitones,       in each of which the interval ratio is 2^) :—

succession        of major and minor thirds of pianoforte notes.                                               It   is,   no
doubt, to the slowing of the beats by the superposition of                                                     a    third

    It   is   not generally known how easily beats on approximations to
other harmonies than unison are heard, even when the constituent
notes      are     simple       tones.        Through              the        kindness              of     Professor

varied combinations,                 by   aid of   a     series of excellent tuning-forks                                 of

manner of Marloye.                   For     such      experiments Koenig's tuning-forks
are much superior to Marloye's, because of the greater                                                   quantity of
metal in each fork, in virtue of which                             it     gives         a    louder and more
enduring         sound.         The sound proceeding                          from          such     a     source         is
essentially      a   simple tone, or very nearly                     so.   I        have          tested       that in
every     case the       number of beats counted                     is    the smallest                  that could
be according to the preceding theory                        ;      for   it   is   to be remarked that
the theory only gives                 the whole period of the                               phenomenon, but
does not answer the question — Does the ear perceive                                          a    gradual varia
tion of quality through the whole period, or does                                            it   fail to distin
guish the difference of quality between                                  two halves of the period,
or between three-thirds of                  it,   and so on?               My experiments                      demon
strate that in every case the ear does distinguish the two halves of
the period of each beat.                     Thus, for example,                         in    the    beat on an
approximation to the harmony                        (1 :   2)   in which the variation of air-
pressure on the ear            is    represented           by the preceding curves for four
instants of the period noted,                I      find that the ear distinguishes the
quality       of the sound represented                      by the              sharp-topped               and flat-
hollowed curve from that represented                            by the flat-topped                       and    sharp-
hollowed curve.               In   the one case the pressure of air close to the ear
rises very suddenly to, and falls very suddenly from, its maximum,
and (as in cases of tides in which there       long hanging on low   is    a
water) there      comparatively slow variation of pressure for
                   is    a                                     few                                              a
ten-thousandths of            a    second on each side of the instant of minimum

  610                   Proceedings         of tlie Royal Society
  pressure; in the opposite phase-relation there is a slow change                       before
  and after the time of maximum pressure, and a rapid change                            before
  and after the time of minimum pressure.                          In the former     case the
  difference of maximum from mean exceeds the difference of mini
  mum from mean            ;  in  the latter the difference        of the minimum         from
  mean exceeds         the difference       of maximum from             mean.     If  the ear
 could not distinguish between two such sounds, but could distinguish
  between either        of    them and the sounds represented               by the first    and
  third quarter-period curves, the number of beats would be twice                            the
  error of frequency of the higher note.                    But   I find   that the number
  of beats is quite distinctly equal to the error of frequency of                            the
  higher note.        I  have found that the beats on the               1 : 2  harmony       are
  most easily perceived           when the intensity of the higher note is                com
 paratively faint,         as   would be the        case   if they were explained             by
  Ilelmboltz's theory that they are the beats on the approximation                             to
 unison which there is between the higher note and the first overtone
 of the lower note.             But   the simple-harmonic character             of the     two
 constituent tones at the entrance of the ear precludes the acceptance
 of this theory unless extended,              as  it   has actually been by its author,
 to the interior mechanism              of the   ear.
     Whatever       may be the          physiological theory by which the               beats
 are to be explained,            it is an interesting         fact that the ear does dis
 tinguish, as     it   were, between        push and pull on the tympanum in
 the    manner     illustrated       by the preceding           curves,  not only for      the
 caso    of approximation to the harmony                 1 : 2,  but for every other     even
 binary harmony.              I  have   heard    distinctly the beats on approxima
 tions to each of the harmonies                  2:3, 3:4, 4:5, 5:6, 6:7, 7:8,
 1 : 3,   and   3 : 5.       The two last mentioned,              though sometimes        less
 easily heard than the beats on most of the others, are unmistakably
 distinct    ; and by counting the numbers of them in ten seconds or in
 twenty seconds,         I    have ascertained        that they, as do all the others,
 fulfil   the condition of having the whole period                   of the   imperfection,
 and not any sub-multiple                of it for their period of audible              beat
 They are interesting           as being   cases  of odd binary harmonies.           Before
 making the experiments,              I  thought it possible that what is heard               in
 the beat might not make distinction                    between     the configuration       II.
and     IV. (first quarter       phase and third quarter phase)          :  but a revolving
character which          I   perceive in the beat seems to me distinct enough
to prove that the ear docs distinguish betwaen                      those configurations,

which       are one            of    them         the same as the other taken in the reverse
order of time.
      In every instance                     except the octave, the beat on the approximation
to   a    binary harmony is less distinct than thebeatonanapproximation                                                      to
a ternary or higher multiple harmony with only                                                 one note false.          It   is
not because of the comparative slowness of the                                                 beat on the multiple
harmony             ;    for by taking alternately beats with one note slightly
false in        a       binary harmony, and the same note made more false in                                                 a
ternary or multiple harmony to such a degree                                                   as to     give the same
number of beats,                    I    have always found the beats                               in   the latter case
much more prominent than in the former.                                                  Thus by taking first the
perfect harmony C                        E G       (4, 5,        6),   and the three binary harmonies
C
G          (2
            :   3),      C    E     (4  :   5),   E    G    (5  :   6),   and flattening slightly any one
of       the three notes by screwing on                             a     small mass of brass to either or
to each prong of the tuning-fork producing                                               it,
                                                                                           it   is   easy after    a   little
practice to count the beats on each of the binary harmonies.                                                         Thus,
for      example             (supposing           E    to designate             a     note of        a   slightly lower
pitch than E), after                     a    little practice             it   is   easy to count the beats on
C    E,    and on the               E,      G, and to verify that their frequencies are, the
first of them four times, and the second of them six times the error
of frequency of the                         E,,    and then to verify that the much louder
beats on the ternary harmony                                           G, are of half the frequency of the
                                                           C
                                                           E,
former, and of one-third of the frequency of the latter, and to verify
absolutely that they are of twice the frequency of the error of E,.
     If    when the approximate harmony                                        C    E,    is   being sounded,            the
faintest sound of                       G    is    produced             by     a    very gentle              excitation of
the fork by the bow, instantly                                  a   loud beat at half speed                     is   heard.
The phenomenon                       is     rendered        very striking                 by alternately touching
the top of the   fork by the bow so as to stop its vibrations,
                                G
and then drawing the bow very gently for fraction of  second *                           a                     a
along one side                  to       re-excite         them.           It       is    marvellous how small
an intensity of the sound                              G   is   required to give               a   smooth unbroken
loud beat               in   the double period.                  I        have found           it    difficult to excite
     *
     In every case, to obtain regular beats, each tuning-fork, after being set
in vibration by the bow, must be left to itself. The sound       sensibly graver                        is
as long as the bow     applied to augment or sustain the vibration than when
                                is
the fork    left free. Thus,
             is                 two tuning-forks nearly, but not quite, in uni
                                                  if
son, are alternately acted on by the bow and left free, the beats are less rapid
during the time the bow      applied to the higher fork, and more rapid while to
                                            is
the lower, than when both forks are vibrating freely.

the    G gently             enough       to give the gradual transition                     from,    let us
say for example,              four uniform beats per second, through                           the   case of
four beats per second with every alternate                            beat somewhat louder, to
the case of only every second                        beat perceptible, or,            in all, two      beats
per second        ;   but it can be done, and the result is an interesting                              and
instructive illustration of the slowing down from the quick beat                                          of
the binary harmony to                    half    speed, or to one-third speed,                 or to    one-
fifth speed,           as    the    case    may       be, by the          introduction        of    a third
note.      In     the several            cases   I     have   foundthat           I    can, by      making
the     added         note       faint     enough,      produce       a    succession        of beats      of
which every second, or every                         third, or every fifth,           as   the case may
be, is louder than the others, and that, as the intensity of the added
note is gradually increased,                     the fainter beats become                  imperceptible,
and a regular unbroken slow beat is heard distinctly                                       alone, always
in the theoretical time of the whole imperfection of the harmony.
I    have verified this distinctly               in    the cases     of   1, 2,   3; 2, 3,    4 ; 3, 4,   5;
4, 5, 6 (as stated above) ; 5, 6, 7 ; and 6, 7, 8.                            I have       not succeeded
in hearing the beats on the approximations to the harmonies                                            8 : i'
and    9:10.           But       the        9, 10 (with vibrational
                                        slow beat on the 8,
frequencies 256, 288, 320), with any one of  the three notes slightly
flattened,        is very remarkable.                  The sound is like that of                   a wheel
going round with decided                     roughness of motion in every part of its
revolution, but much rougher in one part than another, with a loudly
perceptible periodic return of the roughness in the theoretical                                      period
of the approximate harmony.

very perceptible             :   untrained ears hear them                  instantly the first time
without      any education,                and the beat is heard                  almost to the very
end     of the sound               if    three    of Koenig's forks, one of them,                       the

screwed      to       it,   be caused       to sound.         The sound dies beating, the
beats being distinctly heard                     all through     a    large room as long as the
faintest breath of the sound                     is   perceptible.         The     smooth melodious
periodic moaning of the beat                     is   particularly beautiful when the                  beat
is slow (at the rate, for instance, of one beat in two seconds or
thereabouts), being, in fact, sometimes the very last sound heard
when the intensities of the three notes chance                                        at the end to be
suitably proportioned.

3.   Preliminary Note on a Method of Detecting Fire-Damp in
            Coal Mines.       By Professor George Forbes.
   The author exhibited two instruments, both founded upon the
same principles, for measuring    the quantity of fire-damp     present in a
coal mine.   The first instrument consists of    a  tuning-fork fixed above
the open end of    a resonating tube, whose other end is closed by           a
piston whose position (read off on a scale) regulates         the length of
the resonating  tube.    The length of the tube, which resounds to the
definite pitch of the tuning-fork, depends         upon the nature      of the
gas with which it is filled.    The more fire-damp,      the longer is the
tube.     Barometric   pressure  has   no  effect   upon this    instrument.

 meter attached          thereto,    of dimensions determined by actual                    experi
 ment.        The only source of error to which the instrument                               seems
 liable is the counteracting influence of dense carbonic acid                              gas in
 choke -damp.            But it is found that              the   presence    of   choke-damp
 destroys      the explosive character of fire-damp                ;  and, so    far  as experi
 ments go,        it  seems certain       that, in all      cases   when the presence             of
 choke-damp          prevents the instrument from indicating the presence of
 fire-damp,       the fire-damp is denuded             of its explosive character.
     The second         instrument is          a  combination       of  a  harmonium          reed
 and     an organ       pipe,    through which           the   air is driven.         They     are
 arranged       so as to     sound    the      same note when pure           air is used,       so
 that when there is           a  lighter gas present           the   organ   pipe sounds          a
 higher note, thus producing beats.
     So far as the experiments have gone hitherto, the first form is by
 far the most accurate, being capable of detecting the presence of                                1
 or   2  per cent, of fire-damp.
      4.   Note on Electrolytic Conduction.                       By Professor Tait.
     It  is commonly said that             there is a resistance        to a current at the
surface of contact of a solid conductor and an electrolyte.                                Some
good authorities, however, say that we have as yet no proof of this,
as the       effects observed may be due to polarisation.                      It   is obvious
that,     if the reverse       electromotive force due to polarisation contain
a   term      directly     proportional         to the    strength of the current,            the
ordinary        methods of measurement                 would not enable          us to distin
guish this from the surface resistance above mentioned.                            For, in    the
expression

if  the numerator contain               a   term of the form           - el,  it  may be ex
punged,       provided     e  be added to the denominator.
    To clear up this point            I  have      recently made a number of experi
ments.         These have led me to some curious results bearing on                           the
theory of electrolysis,          which     I   propose to bring before the Society on
a  future occasion.            At   present       I refer to them merely so far             as to
say that they establish             fully    the existence      of the surface       resistance
above mentioned.              Thus    I   was led to see that        if a slip of platinum

bo inserted       between    the electrodes    of    a decomposing       cell it ought,
except in extreme           cases,   to produce       almost precisely the same
result as a similar       and equal slip of glass or mica.            This   was easily
verified.       Here we have the singular result of              a   marked     diminu
tion of      the current by the insertion         into the electrolyte of a sub
stance which is in itself          a much   superior conductor.            Even when
the platinum completely closes the path                 from   one electrode     to the
other,     so as to form  two decomposing       cells instead of one, a compara
tively small hole made in it at once                  changes   its function       from
that of common electrode to each of two               decomposing       cells into that
of    a mere obst ruction    in one cell.    It  is an interesting experimental
inquiry      to trace the intermediate    stages between these two states, as
a pinhole       in the platinum is gradually enlarged.               Whatever, then,
be the behaviour of the particles              of an electrolyte,        they do     not
behave like little pieces of platinum.

 Sir    C.  WYVILLE THOMSON, Vice-President,                           in the Chair.
      The following Communications                 were read       :—
   1.  On the Indications of Molecular Action in the Telephone.
                           By R. M. Ferguson,           Ph.D.
      The accepted theory of the telephone             represents     that the vibra
 tions of the sending plate to and from the pole of the magnet before
 which it is fixed is the origin of the currents generated in the pole
 bobbin of wire, and that these currents transmitted to the receiving
 telephone produce        corresponding to-and-fro excursions of its plate.
 This theory, which is that of the inventor, may be shortly desig
 nated, in the happy       words of Sir William Thomson for                  a kindred
  action, the push-and-pull theory.          We have had        in this session of
  the Society two communications of a practical nature,                   which seem
  directly    confirmatory of this view.           I  refer  to the     lucid exposi
  tion of Gott's telephone      experiment     in the island of St Pierre, and

0I0                   Proceedings of         the     lioyal Society
the beautiful       amI    successful     demonstration of the             action     uf
phonograph, both by Professor Fleeming Jenkin.                         In tbo font-        r
these, as we learned, one end             of  a    thread was attached        to   the    one
side  of  the light suspended          coil of a Thomson ink recorder, and                 the
other to the paper disc of an ordinary mechanical                     telephone. This
was done      at the two communicating stations.                   When the sending
disc was     agitated by the voice, the coil to which it was attached
twisted round in the powerful and uniform magnetic field                         in  which
it was placed, and         dispatched corresponding electric current                 waves
to the receiving instrument, the coil of which was                       thereby    moved
similarly in its field, and transferred its motion to its paper                        disc.
A   more     beautiful      manipulation        of an     exquisitely     designed      and
executed     apparatus      it  is not easy to conceive.          In the phonograph
we have as      it were a mechanical         telephone,     with the string connect
ing the discs cut, and nothing left of it but the two ends                      stiffened
into pricking       pins.      Instead of the sending disc dealing directly
with the receiving one, its energy                  is employed in imprinting,           by
means of the pricker, its vibrations on the tinfoil, and this imprint,
when again vivified by the energy of the rotating drum, reproduces
the vibrations which originally stamped it.
   After two      such demonstrations,          it  may be held as proved that the
electric   telephone      is equivalent to        a mechanical      telephone with       an
electro-magnetic      intervening action instead of a mechanical                one.      It
seems therefore       a hopeless       task to seek for indications of molecular
action   where     mechanical       action declares itself so manifestly.             The
mechanical     action of the voice and of the membrane of the tympanum
of the ear is above question, and that mechanical vibrations are                     dealt
to the sending instrument, and emitted by the receiving one, is equally
undoubted; but the intervening electric agency, how generated in
the one and how transformed in the other, is a fair field for discus
sion.    The action is novel, and it is surely a likely inquiry to                 inves
tigate whether its explanation             by the first principle that         comes    to
hand,    viz., the push-and-pull           of    the discs,  fully    covers   the   case.
The question may be raised, for instance,                 whether the mere        impact
of the waves        of air on the iron disc may not affect its                 magnetic
condition by internal change or vibration,* so                 as   to excite   currents
without     vibrations       of    the   push-and-pull       kind,      or whether      in
            *
               Something like this was suggested by Professor Forbes.

tlie    receiving           disc the       particles may           not set up              an       action     on
their own account, independently of the                                 displacement caused by
the poles of the adjoining magnet. In                                  a       mechanical telephone,
we do not find that it is made to sound only                                             by     the      normal
push or pull of the thread, the faintest rubbing                                           on    the irregu
larities of its             surface,     either on the disc or the tube to which it is
attached, makes              a    sound loud enough to             be heard,         and we can easily
admit that if               an internal vibratory disturbance                       be set up            in any
direction in          it,   the same would be audible enough.                             In    a   discussion
 as to      mechanical           and molecular sounds,            it    may be safely admitted,
 where electricity or magnetism                      is   concerned,       that any action that                 is
 clearly      traceable          to   disturbance within          a    body       is   molecular in its
 origin.       It will,      moreover, be granted              that the mere smallness of any
 vibration          does not necessarily             give any clue to its origin.                         Infini
 tesimal vibrations are not necessarily                        molecular,        nor are vibrations of
 molecular source free from external motion                                ;   and we can only say
 that   a    vibration comes from molecules                     if   we can assign to               it   no out
 side      cause.     It    may, however,            be to the point that              a   vibration          may
 be assumed to              be    molecular because of the difficulty in suppressing
 it,   a    vibration        springing from within                being more             independent of
 direction than one produced                     from without from one quarter.
   I    propose in this communication to raise such questions                                         in regard
 to the telephone,               and though the results obtained may not be de
 cisive, they may                be some      little contribution          to the discussion.
  I        would begin with               a   case   where internal              action       seems wholly
 absent.       I      refer to the action of               a   tuning-fork          on the          telephone.
  It   has been         mentioned in more                 than one communication                         to    the
 Society, that         a    tuning-fork acts best without the disc.                            We find        that
 the loudest sounds are sent to the listener at the receiving telephone,
 when one prong                  is   brought with its flat vibrating end in front of
 the core or pole pin, and next to that when the                                    prongs,     if     they are
 not too far apart, are laid with their flat                           sides vertical at an equal
 distance on each side of the pin.                         When the handle of the fork                          is
  laid on the core, and held upright, the resonance                                      of the          wooden
  frame of the telephone                 and the table on which                it   rests becomes loud,
  but only      a    faint trace of this          is   sent    to the distant hearer.                     If   we
  magnetise two like forks, one which we may call                                   A,   to be like       a    bar
  magnet having the end                   of the handle           as    one pole, and               the other

618                         Proceedings           of the Royal Society
pole split in two in the two prongs                      ;   and another fork B, the two
prongs of which are made                     like the poles of            a   horse-shoe magnet,
with the handle              an excrescence          between,          we find     that while tlit
fork A         produces     sounds alike with both prongs when held                         near the
core, the two prongs of the fork                    B show         a   marked difference.        The
like pole to that of the core sounds much weaker                                   than the other.
All this        is indicative of the ordinary magneto-electric                        induction        at
work.
   If    we        detach    the   coil from the magnet,                 we have      still further
illustrations of the same.                 Both forks, A and B, sound loudest when
placed with one prong on its flat side over the hollow at the centre
(fig.    1),   and both continue to sound, but with diminished                              force,    as
they are withdrawn             in    the     same position             from the middle to         the
margin of the coil.                When laid with the plane of the prongs hori
zontal (fig. 2), they act differently.                       The   A    fork has its best sound
ing position when each prong lies symmetrically to the hollow axis,
and     it   has   a   position of silence at        a   point between             the middle and
the outside, whilst the             B   fork in these positions acts in the opposite
way.         There are two positions that the forks may occupy                                at the
side     of the coils,        where        their similar and             dissimilar    actions   are
again shown.              The first     is   when the plane of the fork               is   perpendi
cular to the axis (fig. 3), where both forks transmit no sound when
held in the middle of the coil, but are heard when vibrating                                     on
cither side. The second     when the plane   is  parallel to                  is                 the

                       of Edinburgh, Session 1877-78.                                        619
axis    (fig.  4),   where       A is silent when its prongs are equidistant
from     the   middle of the coil, and the fork B loudest.                              All   this
is,   as   we     have      said,    simply       an   illustration       of    a    well-known
action,     and at the same time                 a   beautiful       demonstration        of   the
way in which           a   tuning-fork       vibrates.        The coils       I   used   were    of
fine copper        wire,    \\   inch diameter         and     \   thick, but smaller coils
would      do equally well, and the forks were                       the ordinary small          A
and    C forks sold by the musicsellers.                        It   is perhaps       worthy of
note     that   a  coil,  a magnetised          fork, and      a telephone        form a handy
combination for testing the completeness                      of   a  circuit,    as  the sound
of the fork coming directly                  to    the ear is immensely below that
 heard in the telephone            in the operator's hand.             When       the telephone
does not sound, there is a break                   in the circuit.          In     these various
 performances of the fork, we have evidence                         enough      to prove that
 the cause assigned by Bell for the sending action of the telephone
 covers at least the greater part             of that     action.      At   the same time,       it
 must be borne          in mind that           the vibrations         of the fork, and the
 sounds produced         by them, are immensely greater than any connected
 with   the telephonic effect          of  the voice, and that           it  is possible     that
 the conditions of iron vibrating                 under the energy treasured               up in
 it may be different from what they may be when the iron is beaten
 by the air.
    But     even    this tuning-fork          performance is not quite free from
ambiguity.          To find whether there might not be some change of
 magnetic condition            due to      internal
vibration,     able    to generate        currents,
 I  cemented       two coils (fig. 5.) to the
 vibrating ends of a large tuning-fork.
 It  was    a  C (256         vibrations),       with
 prongs upwards           of    6   inches      long,
 £ broad,     and    more      in average than
£ thick.       The distance          between       the
prongs at the end inside was £ inch.
The coils weighed ^ oz. ; they were
 | inch     diameter,       1   inch    long,     and
were      of   -007      inch      copper       wire.
They reduced          the pitch       from C        to
A.     The cement         was     the hard        and    tough black tarry compound

 020                  Proceedings of          the Royal Society
used    by    electricians.       On    connecting         one    of the coils      with     a
telephone      and   making      the fork vibrate,          I  was astonished to hear
the   sound     in the    telephone       astonishingly         loud.    I  found,     how
ever,   that this      arose   from     the    connecting wires, which              though
loose were able mechanically to transmit the vibrations                       of the   fork.
This was shown by leaving only one wire in the connection, when
the sound of the fork was            still   heard.      It   is well known       that   the
thread   of   a mechanical        telephone      delivers its message to the first
fixed obstacle      it meets and no further, and                in this case, when       the
lines were held in the fingers, a mere residuum of sound was heard,
which could only be properly estimated in                   a  distant room away from
the direct sound of the fork.              In this,     as  in all subsequent experi
ments,   I  took the utmost care that no mechanical                    transmission     was
possible,   and the telephone        used at the operating station was put out
of circuit each time         a sound      was made         for investigation.         Loud
tapping was made in every conceivable                       place to ascertain     if  such
could   be   transmitted in a mechanical            way.        The circuit was about
 150 ft. of wire     with   a gas    pipe return, and the two stations were in
different buildings.        The results obtained from this fork were not
of any value other than illustrating               the difficulty      of insulating     for
transmission what may be looked upon                      as an    internal and not       an
external   vibration.       They were these.            The sound of the fork           was
heard much less loud than           if  the prong had          been vibrating in front
of the coils, but was louder than what was got when it vibrated                           at
a distance    equal to that of the prong on which the coil was not fixed.
When the two coils were joined up consecutively, one way of joining
gave a maximum, the other a minimum sound.                           In another   arrange
ment the coil was attached to              a  hollow prism of thin brass            | inch
inside, which in its turn was attached                    to the prong.        The sound
given by this coil was less than when                  it  was attached      immediately
to the prong,      but was louder than when the other prong vibrated
freely at the same distance.               When      I    mounted the fork in this
way, one prong was feebly magnetised,                      and the other scarcely         if
at all.
   A  perfect maze of reasons may turn up to account                     for the currents
dispatched      by these fixed coils.          One might be their motion in the
magnetic     field of the earth, which is not likely, for earth-induced
currents   proceed from the rotation            of a coil,     and the faint approach

                      of Edinburgh, Session 1877-78.                                  621
to rotation in this        case  can hardly     be looked upon           as   such.      To
exclude     this    cause,   I   put   the   coils    in    the   best     position for
generating     such    currents, and connected           them    with a moderately
sensitive    reflecting galvanometer.            I   inserted     a  piece      of wood
between     the   prongs,     and wedge-like drove them                suddenly       out,
and allowed        them     to   return,    keeping       time    with     the    known
pendulum-like       oscillation of the mirror         so   as  to accumulate        effect,
but   no result was got.        Again    it might     be    that the      coils,  tightly
as they were wound, were yielding,                 and we had         only a      case    of
shaking    a  coil in front of a magnet, instead of a magnet in front of
it    That this    was not the case was proved by cementing                  the coils to
the sides of the prongs at right angles to the direction of motion, and
though the forks vibrated almost unmusically with such protube
rances, yet what sound they emitted was telegraphed                    to the listener.
The    most  likely   cause was that the coils were fixed as regarded                   the
prongs on which they were stuck, but were affected by the distant
 prong which vibrated in front of them.                 The sounds of the vibrat
ing coils   were louder than when the coils were fixed, and                     the other
prongs vibrated at the same distance           ;   but that might be accounted
 for by the fact that the prong to which the coil was fixed was an
active agent in propagating the vibrations of its companion prong
to its own coil.        The only chance of anything like internal action
being heard       here    rests on    the   possibility      that   this     last is not
sufficient, and that is certainly a slender enough basis to build                          a
theory upon.
    In pursuit of      the same internal      sending action,        I cemented        two
coils, one to the end, the           other to the middle of             a  bar magnet.
 Both transmitted telephonic currents when                the magnet        was struck,
 the end one much louder than the other.                  Again, an unmagnetised
tuning-fork     was made to vibrate above a coil, and its note was feebly
yet distinctly heard        at the listening end.           To test whether it and
the other objects afterwards mentioned were magnetised,                        I brought
them     near   a small active       magnet   about an inch          in     length, and
before another much heavier,           9 inches    in length, and watched to            see
if  repulsion or even indifference was shown to any part of them                           ;
and lastly,    I  made them vibrate in front           of the coil    connected      with
 the reflecting galvanometer         in  the position in which           their sending
 action was afterwards tested.          These tests cannot be alleged to prove

complete absence of magnetism,                but they go far beyond the practical
application of the word unmagnetic.                   The fork in question answered
perfectly all these tests.              I   next tried to get sounds            out of  soft
iron plates      kept      fixed above        the    coil,    and found      no difficulty
in getting     them       to sound when laid             on     a table   in a horizontal
position and beaten             with   a   small hard wooden mallet, or with
something that would produce with them a sharp tap.                             When     the
plates    were     held      approximately         in   the     plane   of the magnetic
meridian there was             more difficulty in getting the distant listener
to hear,    but even          in it they did not cease to sound under blows
sharp and hard enough.               They also sounded             when the coils      were
cemented      to them, but the hearer               had his powers         taxed to catch
the effect.       Soft iron pins placed in the hollow                    axis of the    coil
also  sounded      under similar treatment.               I    could not succeed,     how
ever,  in getting       a   soft iron pin perfectly to answer the galvano
meter    test, ordinary nails          and     similar     iron pins always caused a
slight deflection,       which became more marked by pendulum accumu
lation.    Even      a  soft iron pin,     as  pure    as   I  could get, after being ex
posed for half an hour to a white heat, on being made to move at
right angles to the dipping needle, at least                   so nearly as this position
could be given to it by the hand, indicated through its coil faint
traces of magnetism.             I had some difficulty in getting taps out of it
for the listening        station, but I succeeded at last by using another
similar pin held in the same line                 as a mallet.        Iron thus softened
seems to lose its telephonic              power more by absence of elasticity
than by being less magnetic,               for the said pin seldom           failed in any
position before being annealed, and so far                    as tests  went it was not   a
bit more magnetic.             A somewhat       curious result was got by cementing
a  small coil to a strip of ferrotype plate quite near to the edge, and
making that edge strike on the teeth of                        a  syren   wheel, made to
revolve on     a  turning table, when the screeching                  note thus produced
 was distinctly      telephoned.        When        there     was any slight indication
 of magnetism,       such as was given by the spot                 of light shifting  even
 a millimetre      for one quick          motion, the taps were rendered              with
 great certainty.        The soft     iron pins just mentioned,             when put on
 the pole    of   a magnet,         and very gently tapped                with  a common
 pencil, made       themselves       distinctly      heard.       This   can  be   done in
 the case  of any      telephone     on removing the disc.

     J^ow, it may be asked, are all such                   sound-exciting          currents     to
be      traced    to the shifting       of magnetic       matter in a magnetic             field   ?
or    is there not ground for believing that a blow for the instant
disturbs        the   magnetic      condition of      a magnet,     and magnetises           soft
iron,      in consequence       of a disturbance of the molecules, enough to
excite telephonic currents?                And    may not such           magnetic      changes
act      without      the    displacement        in    the    field     that generally or
perhaps necessarily accompanies them, and heightens their effect '
 Wiedemann has shown that blows alone given at right angles to
 the      magnetic      needle,     and   consequently apart             from the earth's
 magnetism, produce permanent                 magnetic      changes, and that torsion
 and      change     of external conformation may                 do     the     same.       The
 permanent         effect also of blows in lessening the powers of a magnet,
 or of giving         to iron     under induction          a   magnetic         set,  has long
 been known.            Now, may not the telephone               reveal      to us that they
 in    every case produce         a  momentary effect of an intensity in some
  degree proportionate to the magnetisation                 of the iron       1
      The following telephonic arrangement,               which is'ditferent from that
  of Bell's,     may possibly have some bearing in the view just suggested                        ;
  but knowing,          from the      instances      discussed,     the      ambiguity       that
  attends      a departure    from the push-and-pull theory,                I   quote   it  more
  as   a    problem    for push-and-pull solution, than             as    a   proof of blow-
  induced effects.         The apparatus         (fig.   6), consists       of   a   horse-shoe
  magnet       rather more      than    5  inches     long,   with    a  pin on each pole
  standing at right angles to the plane of the magnet.                           The pins are
  provided each with          a  coil of fine copper wire, the two being joined
  up   as   in  an electro-magnet.        The pole pins are           1
                                                                        J   inch apart,      and
  a  stiff    disc  (No.    28), 3 inches      diameter       of untempered            steel,   is
  screwed to them by large-headed             screws.       Such   a disc,     when aided by
  a wooden       or non-metallic resonating        box, can both convey and receive
  an articulate message, indistinctly               certainly, but still it does it.
   When it      is joined    up with     the galvanometer,           and tapped          with    a
   pencil     on any part,       taking     care    of course      not to combine             the

 624                Proceedings       of the Royal Society
 striking and lifting motions, no visible              deflection    is got, though
 the same      taps on the disc of a        Bell telephone make deflections              of
 from   5 to 10 mm.     of the scale.        When the disc is taken off,                we
 may ascertain     the efficacy of vibrations in the line of the plate                   to
 generate currents.      Taking a small thin iron rod and giving                 it small
 vertical excursions,    I  found that when these were made               in the line
 of the plate no effect whatever was got when the rod                         was held
 equatorially to the line of poles, but that as the rod was brought                      to
 either pole an increasingly slight effect was              seen.     This might        be
 due in part or perhaps          wholly to      the want of parallelism of             the
 motion to the pins, for the slightest side or horizontal motion pro
 duced    a marked effect.        That even this stiff plate vibrates              when
 spoken to there can be little doubt, but the vibrations cannot,                  on  the
 ordinary push-and-pull        principle,     push and pull at right angles to
 themselves.      The action of the disc may be due to the blow                 it  gives
 to the pole pins as an ordinary resonator, and possibly also the action
 of blows just hinted at may be present.                   The aerial blows          may
 directly induce currents, or they may do so in altering the shape of
 the plate by vibration.          However this may be, the problem may
 safely   crave a solution      from the push-and-pull          theorists.        When
the plate is not screwed down, but laid or gently pressed on the pins,
and    more especially    if it  be made the bottom of a shallow                tin box
 with a hole on the top, its performance            almost rivals that of Bell's
 telephone.      The improved effect is no doubt due to facility of vibra
 tion which is as necessary to the sounding power of vibrations of
 molecular origin    as to those    produced mechanically.
    I made an attempt also to see whether                the   coil itself had any
sounding action.       If   a blow can make soft iron induce                 a current,
possibly    a closed  coil, the electric      analogue of soft iron, may do            so
under the same treatment.           I   first tried this by hitting       the side of
a  coil by a small wooden        hammer,      then  as the frame      of it  gave way
under this usage,    I cemented      it  to a piece of  board and     hit the    board   ;
but as again the whole coil split up under the blows,                   I   lastly tied
it to  a strip of wood, and used it           as the head    of a hammer against
the end of     a wooden rod.       In   each case    I  succeeded     once or twice
in telephoning the taps, but most              unaccountably, for       I   might tap
ever so hard and so often afterwards without being again so fortunate.
How     the   sounds were     sent  in   these cases   I cannot     say.      The coils

could    send   with   a  brisk turn of the hand        a current induced by the
earth,    may    have    been so excited,       but there was next to nothing
rotational in the blow they got or gave.
    It   may be well believed that many of the sounds                 thus produced
in    the telephone       were     very faint, and required        a  sharp    ear and
undivided attention.             I  have   mentioned only these results           which
have been repeatedly           got.    Possibly some of them may be wrong              as
regards comparative           loudness, but    I  had   in almost    every     case   the
 impression      of different listeners.        The listener was provided with
two     telephones     of the following kind.          One pole      of  a horse-shoe
 magnet (fig. 7),        carried     the  bobbin pin and       a brass     arm    for an
 adjusting     screw.     To the other
an iron stage was fixed, to which
 was screwed      a  box   3 \  inches in
 diameter and      \ inch deep, with a
 hole in the top     f inch    wide, pro
 vided with     a short tube for inser
 tion into    the ear.      The bottom
 of this box      was of untempered
 steel plate (No. 28), and its distance from the pin could be adjusted
 by the screw. Such an instrument told faint tuning-fork sounds,
 which     the ordinary one pole ferrotype plate            telephone    I  had passed
 over.
     Leaving      now the        sending station,      we proceed      in   our search
 for molecular action to           the receiving instrument,        and we examine
 the sounds       emitted by its electric         and magnetic       parts.      Instead
 of having       a   person     performing     the   irksome task of talking            or
 singing at the sending end, let us lay aside the distant telephone,
 and put       in   its place      and   that of    the    spsaker    a   Bunsen      cell
 charged     with watsr and         a  mercury break.       Such  a  cell would have
 no effect on the telephone without              the break,   for it is only momen
 tary currents that affect the instrument.                The break thus furnishes
 us with an intermittent            or discontinuous current,      and    is in fact an
 untiring and uniform speaker, uttering             a series  of ticks or taps which
  are very audible to the distant telephone             hearer.    Now let      us begin
  with   the coil which is the         "fountain and source" of all action in
  the receiver.       Let  us   detach it from the core, and hold it up to the

626                     Proceedings of the Royal Society
ear.     By attentive listening            a   faint ticking is heard, and                 if    we wish
to hear it without          strain we must add another cell or two to                                       the
battery.      The sounds emitted by the coil are very faint, and cannot
be excited by the voice or even a tuning-fork.                             With small                battery
power the coil may be made to sound, but with                               a   strong battery it
may be heard at some distance                   from the      ear.        Thus the coil which
we thrashed almost to death to send a message receives one without
demur.       We now insert in the coil                   a piece   of soft iron, and we                    have
a duet     of two undistinguishable ticks, the principal part being per
formed      by the iron.           Here again the receiving action is immensely
better than the sending, and leads us to suspect that our rough efforts
to send were mere bungling, due to our ignorance                                of the right way
to do it.        If   now we bring a magnet and place the soft iron pin                                      on
its pole, or screw it into the pole,                 a sudden         bound is made in                      the
loudness     of the sound, and with the one cell water current we                                          can
hear a few inches           off.     'Whatever vibrations                 were     effected           in    the
pin by itself now grow immensely more pronounced when it is                                           made
magnetic.             We   may      now        replace     the coil in its              core         in     the
telephone, for our arrangement                  is nothing else than a telephone                      with
out a disc.           The sending and receiving powers are now more nearly
on a par, for we found that                the gentle tap of a pencil can now be
sent.      Let   us now,     in imitation of Professor Tait                      and      Mr Blyth's
experiments,           put a piece of glass or pasteboard,                       or wood or other
non-conducting substance,                on the core.          The sound           waxes thereby
louder,     as was     explained by the plate acting as an ordinary resonator.
Lift    any one of these the smallest thing from the core, and                                  it   acts    as
a dead wall to stop the sound of the core.                           In   place of       these, let us
take    a series        of conducting metal               plates    of lead, German silver,
copper, and           silver, all equally thick            and as nearly as possible                         of
the same temper.             When        we place one of these on the core we hear
the same resonance            as    in   the non-conductor, but we also perceive
what appears to be           a   new and separate action set up by the plate on
its own account,           and as we change from disc to disc we find                                      that
the sound grows with the conductivity                          of the plate             till   we reach
silver, which is very audible.                    When now           we put an iron disc of
similar size and temper, a sound is heard                          which completely eclipses
the loudest       of the others.          All    these discs when held slightly away
from the core sound louder than when touching                                     it,   and the            cul

minating receiving        action,    where sending and receiving are on a par,
is the disc of iron in front of         the pole, almost but not quite touching
it— in   fact,  the disc of Bell's telephone.
    Let   us now     retrace     our steps,         and go over the ground more
minutely, beginning again with the coil.                   The coils     I used consisted
of from     30 to 100 ohms            of copper wire '007 inches, and were of
various sizes and shapes.            For  such fine wire coils, as already stated,
one cell will suffice      if the  listener be sharp and attentive, but two or
three must be used             for easy hearing.           The     intermittent current
given off by an ordinary medical electro-magnetic                      machine      produces
very audible sounds           in such coils.          The electric       wave     of such     a
 machine is peculiarly adapted to excite telephonic sounds.                           It  is a
 double wave of opposite name, with                a sharp   beginning and an equally
 sharp termination.          For thick wire coils           a more      powerful electro
 motor is required.        With five fully        charged Bunsen cells,          I  managed
 to get every coil     I  could lay hands on to render               the ticking       of the
 break, whether they had iron cores or not.                     The sounds were per
 fect telephonic performances           ; for it     mattered    not whether the wire
 was thick or thin, covered with silk or wool or cotton, the tick was
 not at all musical, but simply the reproduction of the sound                          of  the
 break.    We should         be inclined        at   once to    call such      a   rendering
 molecular, did we not know that in this era of mechanical telephones
 and phonographs,         discs   of tinfoil, oiled silk, paper, potato,               butter,
 and other unlikely substances, can reproduce the tones of the human
 voice without peculiar accent.              Coil ticking      or tapping is familiar
 to any one who has dealt with a powerful induction coil.                           The sole
 of the instrument       resounds     with     the primary       coil rendering of the
 break outside the instrument.
    Now,    whence      comes     this sound in a coil           ?    Wiedemann,          who
gives De la Rive the credit of first noting the sound, attributes
it to the clashing of           the various convolutions             against each other,
 due to the known            action that wires conveying                 currents     in   the
same     direction     attract      each      other.      With      a   view     to   answer
 this  question,     I    wound       up     15    feet  of   -04     copper     wire     into
a spiral    f   of an      inch    in   diameter,       and    sent     the intermittent
current     of   a five-celled       fully     charged     Bunsen       battery through
it.    On    holding      the end of the spiral to the ear,                  I   heard     the
tapping     distinctly.        On drawing out the spiral, so that no two

628                         Proceedings            of the Royal Society
convolutions were in contact,                       I failed      to hear any sound ;              but   when
I   put two or three convolutions together and held them to the                                               ear,
the sound was again                      heard.     I   now isolated one convolution,                        and
tied the thread of a paper telephone to                                     it,   and, although             there
was no neighbouring                       convolution        in    contact,       I   heard, by          means
of the telephone,                   the ticking       distinctly, and, when the spiral                        was
drawn out into              a   plain wire, the same sound continued.                              The        cur
rent, as indicated by                    a   tangent galvanometer of                  a   single    hoop        of
stout copper rod, produced                     a   deflection of 54° for the unbroken cur
rent, and of 41° for the intermittent                             one.      The cell resistance               was
under two ohms,                 and the exterior resistance under one ohm.                                   The
nitric acid was old, and had been frequently used.                                       Removing the
•04      wire from the circuit, and substituting                            a     short length of -024
copper wire, the current interruptions were heard                                    still better in          the
paper telephone.                I    suspected mechanical                transmission of the sound,
but that could scarcely be, the wires being led from the open air by
a    fixed course under the floor.                          When all mechanical connection
was broken through mercury troughs, there was no alteration                                            ;     and
when       a   loop of          2    inches of '024 wire was held firmly in                        a   vice    it
did not        cease    to sound.         I       need not, however, have been                 so scepti
cal, for sounds of              a    similar origin had been got as early as 1845                              by
Beatson,        De     la   Rive, and other observers.                      They may not, without
the aid      of   the mechanical              telephone,       have got         in   the wires the same
clearly rendered                series       of ticks that we hear by its aid                          De      la
Rive's description of them, however,                              is   both definite and graphic.*

He      details his experiments,       and, unlike other observers,         extended
h is    researches   to other metals besides iron.           He  stretched    wires of
various      metals on a sonometer      with a helix of wire round them,             so
that     he could excite sounds by the simple passage of the current in
the     wire, or by the magnetising action on        it of the helix.     He used   an
electromotor of five Grove's cells.         He tells us that the sounds emitted
from iron      and other metals, by the direct passage through them                  of
a discontinuous         current,    were   in no      way different from those
obtained       by magnetisation       when the same current was made to
pass through the helix surrounding the wire.                   This was especially
 observable in the         case  of iron.     Ho states also loosely         that the
loudness of the sounds emitted with the same strength                      of current
 was in proportion to the resistances            offered   by the wires, and that
 possibly this sounding action had the same conditions                 as heat  in the
galvanic circuit, so far at least          as  resistance was concerned.           He,
moreover,      states that iron stood quite exceptionally among the metals
 in its    power to give out such sounds.
     The exact way in which Do la Rive obtained these sounds appears
 to have been lost, for no subsequent               observer    accords    with him.
 Wiedemann, for instance,          in his "Electro-Magnetismus,"          in keeping
 with     the investigations of Wertheim,          states that iron alone        emits
 sounds under the above conditions, and he quotes                      De la Rive's
 remarks on        other   metals    within   parentheses.       Now,     the simple
 device     of attaching the string of         a  mechanical      telephone    to the
 wires when the intermittent current circulates,             enables us to observe
 these     sounding effects with perfect          ease   and    certainty.      When
 attached     to a copper wire (-007 inches diameter) the sound is very
 marked; and when to an iron wire (-008) the telephone sounds
 many feet off, the current being that from the five-cell                     Bunsen
 battery.*       Indeed, for the iron wire        a telephono      is not necessary,
 for the ticking can be heard when the wire is held in the teeth,
 or when it is doubled on tho finger and inserted                     in the passage
 of the     ear.   There is only one objection to the last mode of pro
 cedure, viz., that the wire is almost too hot to be comfortable.                 It  is
 not, however,      necessary to insert the wire itself into the ear, for a
  cotton thread, tied to the wire and placed in the ear, sounds nearly

       This was distinctly heard in the auditorium of the Society when the paper

addition        to that of the mere twisting              round in a magnetic field;
for   if only     the coil be left without a field, or even           if only    one con

the distant break worked by the hand of an operator, a loud sound was
heard when the dipper of the break entered the mercury,                      and   another
equally loud, but not louder, when it was lifted out                         In   this    case
the break was two rooms off from the listener,                    at a distance of from
30 to 40 feet, and when the operator                   was made to say    "in," "out,"       at
each motion, short as the distance                 was, the wire sounded before the
voice.        The sounds thus given had a clear metallic ring about                   them.
 This, however,          disappeared     when the wire was coiled tightly round
 the finger.        The mechanical telephone enables us to hear such sounds
in all portions of the wire without any interruption.                      We   can hear,
 for instance, the half musical sound in                 a straight wire, the dull        un
 musical sound when the wire is tightly coiled, and the increase                            of
 this when several            convolutions of a covered wire are kept tightly
 together.        In   the single wire, although the sound is loudest when it
 is tense, yet      it  is distinctly heard when perfectly loose.             De la Rive
 tells   us that the          resistance   in   the sounding wire must be          greater
 than that of the remaining circuit, battery included.                     I have found
 that this is not necessary, for            I can hear      distinctly the sound of          a
 thin iron wire when the current is the weak one furnished by                                a
 single Bunsen cell charged with water.                   The Bunsen cells mentioned
  hore have an active medium surface                   of 40 square     inches.     Again,
  with   a   small magneto-electric         machine      for medical   purposes, almost
 any experiment can be demonstrated.
     With      reference to the strengths of current necessary to excite                  the
  wires,    the characteristic        of the telephone        mentioned by Professor
  Tait,    in his communication              on    the   " Strength of     a  Telephonic
  Current," must           be   borne   in mind, viz., that the telephonic             effect
  does not depend            so   much on the actual          strength of the sounding
  current      as  on    the rapidity       with which        changes   in the    strength
 are effected.          The break       used     in   these   experiments     made      from
 five   to six interruptions           in the second, that certainly was not             very

sudden.           Then, in   a    mercury break, the spark that ensues on the
separation of         the dipper from the surface of the                       mercury is con
ducting, and it may only be                    the break of the              attenuated          current
when the spark ceases that                     has       telephonic power.             This would
bring     us down       to a low         scale      of effective         action,   when working
with     a   water    cell interrupted             six times       per second.          It       cannot,
however, be with certainty alleged                        that this kind of interruption
is strictly       single, as there      may        be    pulses    in it preceding the final
stoppage.
      Tho relation of resistance              to    sound can be shown by an experi-
 meut like the         following :— I          measured off a yard of iron, German
                       fry fry fry &
      7
 silver, copper, and silver wire, of diameters respectively                         of -008, -0086,
 •007,    and      -006 of an inch.            The resistance            of each yard was re
 spectively 3, 8-7,        '7,   and   1*4 ohms (the         silver alloy was exceptionally
 hard).      From these again          I     cut off a foot and soldered              them end to
 end in      a   successive chain, and stretched                  them    out (fig.    8)   in   a    line,
 with their junctions firmly clumped to prevent the sound of the one
 running into the other.               I     then attached          four similar mechanical
 telephones        to them, and found, at least so far as the ear could judge,
 that the sounds emitted by each, when the same broken current
 passed through all, were proportionate to the resistance such offered,
 in   the case of the last three metals, whilst                     the sound given out by
 the iron distanced        all the others.              The German silver here was much
 louder than the silver, which again was, one could fancy, twice as
 loud    as the copper.          This   seems to clash            with what        we have stated
 with reference         to the conducting               discs on or near the core                of     the
 magnet of the telephone.                It may         be somewhat        hazardous to venture
 an explanation, but there              is   one that turns up so readily at the first
 consideration of the matter that                  I    may mention it.             In the       case    of
 the wires the same current passed through all, but                                in the   discs the
 currents        induced would be,       as    is   generally received, relatively in pro

632                     Proceedings      of the Royal Society
portion to the conductivity of each.                If   it now    be accepted that        the
sounding action be like heat                proportionate to the square of                the
current strength, the apparent discrepancy is accounted for.                       Suppose
the conductivity of silver to be ten times greater than that                    of  German
silver, then in the silver plate             a tenfold greater current would                be
induced, and would have in consequence                       one hundredfold         greater
sounding power than that of the German silver in the same resistance;
but as the resistance         of the German silver is ten times              greater than
that of the silver, there would still be              %   tenfold louder sound in          the
silver than in the German silver, quite                a  sufficient margin to remove
the discrepancy.            In addition     to the action within          the plates here
discussed,      there    may of course also be the external push-and-pull,
as   with      the    iron disc.      In wires     the     length involved       has    little
effect     on the       sound  ;   for though       a   long     stretch   of   wire     does
sound louder than a short one, the difference                        is by no means in
 keeping with the respective               lengths.        In thick wires     no sound is
got.      I  tried in vain with the strongest current              I  could conveniently
 use to get a sound out of a No. 14 copper wire.
    Now here at least it will be admitted that we have                        a molecular
 action.      It  may be     replied that the earth's magnetism has something
 to do    with   it.    To show that it has not, we may try the somewhat
 inelegant feat of holding the end of the thin iron wire in the teeth,
 and     turning it in every possible          direction, when we shall find that
 the    loudness       of the ticking     has no relation to direction.              Again,
 when the string of the telephone              is tied to the wire and made to              go
 round it in      a circle,   we shall find no maximum or minimum points.
 This then is        a telephonic action absolutely free from external push
  and pull, proceeding         undoubtedly from molecular disturbance in                  the
  wire.      That the action is magnetic in some way is evident from                      the
  exceptional position of iron in the series of metals.                  De la Rive held
  that the sounding action of an iron wire, when the seat of                           a  dis
  continuous current was almost identical with, and must be tracealb
  to the same ultimate cause as, that                 it displays when         placed in     a
  magnetising        helix excited by        a  similar current           The parallelism
  between       the    wire telephone       and   the     ordinary     electric   telephone
  is so     striking     that no theory of the latter can be held                      to be
  complete      without it includes the former.                It  seems to suggest that
  the sounds         we hear    in  plates   and rods        under sudden        electric or

magnetic changes is partially at least due to the molecular                      distur
bances sot up by induced momentary                   currents.    Be that    as it may,
surely no one would be inclined                  to say that the ticking of a Bell
telephone under         a series  of momentary currents is wholly mechanical,
and that of         a  wire telephone        under the same conditions wholly
molecular.
    After observing these sounds,               my next inquiry was to ascertain
how they comported themselves                    in  a   helix capable     of motion.
With this view I coiled            about ten feet of fine iron wire ('017 3 inch
diameter) into a spiral about £ inch in diameter.                      I  suspended   it
(tig. 9) by a thick wire held on a stand, and
                                                                           Fig. 9.
arranged that its lower end should dip into                a
vessel   of mercury.          Such    a spiral is exceed
ingly   delicate, and the up and down motion
of its  slender convolutions is most easily ex
cited.     When left free to itself, and there is
no interruption         in the mercury         below, that
is, no spark reaction, the motion produced by
a discontinuous current of rive Bunsen cells
is very slight;        but  if  a f-inch soft iron rod
be introduced so as to be clear of the sides of
the spiral, the mechanical           excitement      of the
spiral is more marked,             but still not much.
But if      I   hold down        the    lower end, and
it  so  happen        that the tension       and    number
of    convolutions        be    sufficient,     the    helix
divides itself into two             very    active   ventral   segments with    a  node
in   the   middle.        The    motion,      especially    at the   middle of each
segment,      is now very considerable.               But if it     does not vibrate
thus    symmetrically,         by shifting the fingers a little, a point is
easily found by          which    at least one very active ventral segment is
secured.       If  now to    a point of maximum motion            I  solder a very fine
copper     wire, to serve      as the thread      of a mechanical      telephone    and
make    it  come out at right angles to the motion of the spiral, it does
not interfere with it.          By this contrivance I secure the advantage of
listening to what goes          on in the wire without interfering with any
mechanical magnetic effect.             Profiting by the experience of the fork,       I
found that      a fine  wire could hang loosely, and yet convey vibrations to

634                 Proceedings      of the Royal Society
the telephone.      Fine iron wire    answers very well, but      in this   case it is
inapplicable, as it sets up a clearly audible action on its own account.
When the ear is now applied to the telephone the ticking that jou
would hear in the wire,        if it  were straight, is heard      distinctly,     and
is the only     distinct sound, for the up and down motion of                       the
convolution      only produces      a  slight jingling      in   the    connecting
wire, and    possibly also in the coil.       When     the   convolution is       held
tight in the fingers the ticking goes on         if anything more distinotiy
than before.       Whether     the   mechanical motion by the increased
fixity of the helix is converted        into louder ticking,        could not        be
decided    by the difference.        Hero we have         two vibrations quite
distinct from one another,          the   ticking in the wire and the              me
chanical motion due to the mutual electro-magnetic               action between
the rod and the coil.         If   this last were quick enough            it   would
also be telephoned,      but the rate of vibration being below                that of
musical frequency it is nothing             but inaudible motion.           In    this
helix action     I  would submit        we   have   a   dissected     view of       all
receiving telephonic action — a vibration            in   the body clearly of
molecular origin, and another of the body of a push-and-pull kind.
The latter may be stopped or nearly so, but not the former. From
its internal origin it is bound to make itself good, and when                      the
body is held in the grasp of the most rigid substance it only propa
gates in  it  the minute vibrations       which no elastic     matter can       stop.
In  the vibrations     of coils,  cores, or plates,    the   same    thing     holds.
Molecular vibration is present in them all, and how far mechanical
vibration    chimes in in unison depends           entirely on the      ease    with
which such can be produced.
   There is apparently     a marked     difference  between these two vibra
tions.   The one can make itself good acoustically by one impulse,
the   other not.      I  have    tried   in vain, while       holding     taut the
thread of    a mechanical telephone       without letting the fingers slip,         to
produce,   by a sudden pull or let go, the tick that resounds in iron
or a conductor when a current suddenly begin or ends, and                   I could
only do so by letting the string slip the slightest degree, so            as to set
up a short series of vibrations.         Each galvanic or magnetic tick            or
tap   may    not, in the first instance, be more than a simple               shock;
but so sudden is it that the particles concerned               do not recover      at
once, but continue vibrating          for an infinitesimal      time, and     hence

                       of Edinburgh,       Session 1877-78.                         635
the pitch or musical sound that generally                  accompanies      it.   When,
however,       a  prolonged vibration is difficult, and the impulses brace
each other up by frequent repetition, we have possibly in the first
case a very short series, and          in  the other only one vibration.            Such
vibrations       are as capable of rendering all complex acoustic               combina
 tions    as vibrations of the push-and-pull           kind.
     It  would be     a matter of mere speculation to guess how the condi
tions of     the vibrating helix are transferred to vibrating rods or discs
of iron in      an intermittent     magnetic    field.     I   would only say that
 the same double vibration             is clearly traceable in them.            To illus
 trate this in the case of rods,        I took   a small coil of No. 20 wire,            2
inches in diameter and about an inch high with                        a  hollow axis of
 § inch,     and sent the interrupted current of a five              Bunsen cell bat
 tery through it.        Inside the axis     I put   a  soft iron pin     2  inches long
 and    \  inch square (fig. 10).        To the upper end a fine copper              wire
 was soldered to act        as the    thread of    a    telephone.      When rightly
 placed the pin supported itself in the hollow, and kept dancing up
 and down symmetrically             without    much friction        against the inside
 of the bobbin hollow.               Here the mechanical motion was not                so
 clearly eliminated as in        the case of the helix       ;  yet the ticking       was
 heard, and it alone, when the motion of the pin was stopped by the
 hand.       The impossibility        of stopping the ticking           of the pin was
                                  Fig.  10.
  shown by securing its ends between the jaws of a vice and making it
  as  tight   as  possible, when the vice itself took up the tale of electric
  interruption, and       made     itself heard    all round.        A curious    change
  was observed       in long iron    rods when this coil was placed round the
  middle of them and when shifted to the end.                    In  the former posi
  tion the sound was         a stuccato    rendering of the longitudinal note of
  the rod, and in the latter this sound was lost in               a dull tapping.      In

 636                  Proceedings          of the Royal Society
 the   latter position there            was a pronounced tendency to push and
 pull.
     I adopted     a  similar arrangement           with the vibrating        disc of      the
 telephone.       To the middle of one             T cemented      an indin-rnbber       tnbe
 to act as a yielding handle, and the paper                   telephone    wire     was sol
 dered near the middle.              The disc was made to move in front of                    a
 telephone      core excited by the coil           just   named.     The movements of
 the disc were very violent, and made                   in all directions, making          the
 connecting string jingle             loudly, so that the isolation of the ticking
 sound was not so satisfactory as in the two previous cases.                         Still it
 was heard, and when the motions                 of  the disc were kept      in one direc
 tion its loudness did not grow with the extent of the motion.                         With
 a fine  coil and      a   water cell the ticks were distinct enough             ;  but   the
 mechanical      displacement was too small to yield the required                       com
 parison.     The impossibility             of stopping this ticking was illustrated
 in the   following way :— A ferrotype                plate was held    tightly    between
 two thin pieces of plate glass, the space between                      being filled up
 with sealing wax so that the whole was a solid mass of glass and
 wax.     This    was brought near a core excited by a water cell, when
 the sound was           loudly     rendered.       Another illustration to the same
 effect was that      of cementing by sealing wax              the ferrotype plate      of   a
 telephone     to a disc of thick             microscopic glass, and putting this in
 the telephone       with the glass side to the ear or mouth.               Its  articulate
 functions, though much impaired, still continued.
     Lastly, to test whether the tick in a coil was due to electric con
 duction,   I screwed       a  pin into the core of the telephone          so as to act as
 a  prolongation of the core            ;   round this    I  placed a coil of fine wire,
to which the string           of a   paper telephone       was attached.       There     was
 no ticking      heard      so  long as the circuit of the coil was broken; but
 the moment        it  was closed         the  ticking     began.     The   coil    was,  of
 course,   clear    of the core.            At  the same time, however,         there was
 mechanical      action between          the coil and core, illustrating           the dif
ficulty in such cases of determining by direct observation whether
the single mechanical pull may not also make itself heard.
    In conclusion,        I would     say, by way       of summing up       the evidence
of this paper, that at the sending station the evidence of molecular
action, though suggestive,             is by no means conclusive         ;  while    at the
receiving station          the    existence     of molecular      as well as mechanical

action amounts to demonstration.                           How    the   actual    performance of
the receiving instrument                      is to he apportioned between                these,   it   is,
of    course,     difficult       to say.        Taking into account Professor Tait's
calculations          as    to the     infinitesimal       strength of     a     current that can
make        a   telephone       tick, and assuming           that that tick       is   purely mole
cular, as we have done, molecular action must be there not the less
considerable.

        a medium resisting as the Square of the Velocity, and of
        the Application of these Tables to Gunnery. By Edward
        Sang.
     The motion of            a   body in       a   medium whose         resistance       is    propor
tional to the square of the velocity, has been the subject of many
inquiries.            Its intimate connection with               the theory and           practice      of
gunnery has produced for                   it   the attention of almost every cultivator
of the higher analysis; but, like several other seemingly elementary
problems in mechanics,     has hitherto received no complete solution.

     If nothing        else     than the fluid's resistance              influence the. motion
the investigation               is   comparatively easy       ;      thus, taking the time as
the    primary             variable,    the
speed       has       its own square
for its derivative, and                    so
must        be    proportional             to
the first inverse              power of
the time, and consequently
the     distance passed                over
must        be    proportional             to
the logarithm of that time.
Hence,      if    the present posi
tion, the velocity and the
coefficient of resistance                  be                             „

at previous times.                   But   since     the   velocities are inversely propor
tional to the times elapsed                     from some fixed epoch,           it   follows that,

at that epoch, the velocity must have been infinite, so                          that     although
the body may have come from an                              infinite   distance, setting           out
therefrom with an infinite velocity, it must have begun that motion
a  finite time        ago.
    If we     represent       time by distances measured               along   OF, one of           the
asymptotes         of   a  hyperbola, the ordinates, such as Pp, drawn parallel
to    the     other asymptote,             are     proportional       to the corresponding
velocities.         Thus the present velocity being Pp, that at the future
time     OA will         be Aa, while that           at the former date         OB had           been
Bb   ;   and the areas HbpP,                 VpaA        represent     the   distances        passed
over during           the    intervals      of time        BP and PA.            The       distance
corresponding to the finite previous time OP is thus infinite, and
so also must have been the velocity of projection at the date O.
    When        the motion is affected              by some influence other than the
resistance,       the investigation becomes more intricate.                      The case of           a
constant gravitation               in  a fixed direction          is the simplest of these
complications, and the simplest case of this is when the directions
of  the motion and of gravitation coincide.
    If a    stone be thrown straight upwards, its motion is impeded both
by its weight and by               the air's resistance        ; in the    subsequent       descent
the     motion is accelerated              by gravity, but retarded             by the air        ; so
that, for the ascent, the soliciting                   influence takes the form g + ei-,
and for the descent becomes                  g - cv2.       Now    the change     in  the sign of
the velocity from +              v  in the      ascent     to  -v    in the    descent,       is not
accompanied            by any change           in  the    sign of    v2,  and therefore         both
parts of the motion cannot be represented                             by any one         algebraic
formula.         Accordingly          we    find     the upward         motion to be repre
sented       by circular functions            ;  the downward          motion by the           corre
sponding catenarian              ones.
    In     fig.   2,    the left       hand row         of dots      represents     the    upward
motion graduated               to    equal   intervals of time.            The    stone      is first
shown at        A    as  having come from some indefinite                     distance below           ;
its speed, rapidly diminished, is altogether extinguished                              at   N.       In
order to avoid confusion, the descent is shown on the adjoining                                 right
hand column of dots.
    In   descending,         the acceleration          due to gravity becomes             less    and
less   ;  it would       cease    altogether if      the velocity could become so great
as to cause a resistance                equal     to the weight;         the  tendency, there

fore, is to reach a definite terminal velocity, and the stone ultimately
moves       almost     uniformly.         If    it   had     been
thrown       downwards at        a rate   greater than this                  e•  " •
terminal velocity, its motion would have been                                N
retarded, but less and less         so as  it approximated                 %   %
to the same limit of uniform motion.
    We    may study the ascent by tracing it back
wards from the highest point, fancying the air                          ^  *         \5
to have        then   the   quality     of hastening           the         •
motion.        In this   case    the velocity        would in
crease     to   become     infinite  ;   but this infinite
velocity      would be acquired          in   a    finite time.
In   fact, the time      being     represented        by a cir-            •
cular arc, the velocity would              be proportional
                                                                                   1,0

corresponding to       a  whole quadrant, the velocity

finite    time    determined       by the      coefficient       of
resistance.
   Each particular        body has its own terminal
velocity depending on the weight and on the
extent and peculiarities of the surface exposed                                    1,5

exactly the same law,         so  that one diagram may
serve    for all, the units of comparison                   alone
needing to be changed.
   Also, one table of the positions and velocities
may be made           to  do    for all     cases.       In    the
arrangement       of such    a   table we have          to seek
for the most convenient system of units                  ;  now,

is the only standard with which we can com
pare the velocities at the various parts                   of the path, wherefore     wo
adopt this terminal velocity as the tabular unit of speed.

640                  Proceedings        of the Royal Society
   This terminal velocity          has to be considered along with the inten
sity ot gravitation, which intensity,            if acting  alone, would generate
velocities proportional         to the times     ; wherefore the time in which
the heavy body, falling          freely, would acquire      the terminal velocity,
presents itself as the proper tabular           unit of time,   and, as a necessary
accompaniment,          the tabular unit        of distance    must be that      over
which the body would pass with its uniform                    terminal velocity in
the time during which            that terminal velocity was acquired          ; or, in
other words, must be double the height of the free fall needed for
the acquisition of the final velocity.

velocity   3 -60210,    as  at  A in     fig. 2, it will   reach its highest point
in the time     1*3, the   height to which it will rise being              1 '31  804,   as
shown in the third column.                The subsequent        fall is shown in the
fourth column, and there we find that the same level is reached just
before the     time    2-0; the whole time of flight being somewhat                    less
than   3 3.
   To   translate    this into ordinary measures, let us suppose                  a body
whose terminal velocity is 320 feet per second                 ;  the time      in which
this velocity is acquired in tree fall is 10 seconds, and therefore all
the tabular times must be multiplied                by 10, the tabular velocities
by 320, and the linear distances              by 3200.      Hence      if such a body
were    thrown upwards with           a  velocity of 1152        feet   per    second,    it
would rise in 13 seconds to          a  height of 4230 feet, and would thence
descend in 19 93 seconds, striking              the ground with        the velocity of
 308 feet per second.
    This  table enables us to interpret easily the results of experiments
made on falling bodies.          Thus, if the height and the time of descent
be accurately      observed,    we may thence deduce the terminal velocity;
from which, again, knowing             the weight and the extent of surface,
we may discover the           constant    of the coefficient      of resistance.         In
order to facilitate the computations for this class of experiments,                     we
may annex another column to our table, namely, one containing the
ratio of the time of free fall to the actual             time of fall.         Thus the
fall through the distance 1 '32500, which is done in the                         time 2-0
with resistance, would be accomplished in T62788 if there                         were no
resistance due to velocity, and the ratio,            as   shown in the annexed
column, is -81394.
    Suppose now that        a  body has been dropped from             a  height of 400
feet, and that the observed            time of the fall is     6 seconds ; the time
 of falling freely from this height is known                 to be    5   seconds, and
therefore the ratio is -83333.            The table    shows      that this ratio be
longs to the tabular time 1-8271,                 and  that,     consequently,      3-284
seconds    is the time in which          the   terminal velocity is acquired              in
falling freely    ;  that terminal velocity, therefore,            must    be    105 feet
 per second.
    In  experiments of this kind, the disengagement                 at the beginning
 and the stroke at the end          of the fall may be made, by help of the

   642                   Proceedings     of the Royal Society
   electro-magnet,      to record themselves       alongside of the records of          the
   heats of a clock, and thus very great precision may be obtained.
      When the stone is thrown            obliquely, its path is curved           ;  were
  there    no air, that path would         be the      well-known      parabola, which
  forms    the    first ideal approximation.           With     speeds   very small in
  comparison       with the terminal velocity, the deviation from the                para
  bolic curve is slight       ;  but the deviation becomes excessive              in   the
  ordinary practice of gunnery.
      Beginning with the case of            a   body thrown obliquely upwards,
  we observe that its upward motion is resisted                  both by the air      and
  by gravity    ;   when it has reached       its highest point and is         descend
  ing, the downward          motion is less rapidly accelerated          than the up
  ward motion had been retarded,              so that      the culminating      point is
 reached earlier than the half-time of flight.               On the other hand,        the
 horizontal transference         is retarded   all  along, wherefore     the vertex of
 the    curve is beyond the middle of            the horizontal range,      as   is  seen
 in fig.    3, which shows the positions of            a  projectile at equal inter
 vals of time.

      After having      passed the highest point at         V,   the projectile bends
its motion more and more                downwards, until ultimately the              path
almost      coincides    with   the plumb-line ; the speed, at the same time,
gradually approximates to the terminal velocity, and thus the                       curve
 in that direction is limited by a vertical asymptote.
     Reckoning backwards on the other side of the culminating                     point,
the speed is rapidly augmented,            and would become infinite within               a
definite time       ; the inclination    of the curve       also tends to a definite
limit, wherefore        this branch, too, has     a  rectilineal asymptote     ; so that
the whole curve is continued in the angle formed by the two asymp
totes as represented in fig. 4.            Thus the branch          VB, unlimited        in

length, is limited in the time of its description          ;  while the branch
VC,   also unlimited in length, is unlimited as to time, but is limited
as to the extent of its horizontal range.

   The intensity of gravitation being known           ; if   the terminal velo
city, the direction, and the velocity at any point be given, we can
compute the position, the velocity, and the direction at any pro
posed instant.      These   three data serve to determine the curve, and
in  general any three     data are sufficient, as, say, the inclination, the
range, and the time of llight.      The direct computation from the first-
named three       arguments     is very operose;   in the other      cases    it is
much more so, because we can only proceed by the method of suc
cessive   trials, or, what comes to the same thing, we must have
recourse to tabulated results.
   My object at present is to describe       the arrangement       of tables of
this kind, and to explain their uses.
   If   we launch two masses at the same angle                with speeds pro
portional to the terminal velocities, the paths          are similar in shape
though on different scales and performed in different times.                 This
circumstance is the first and principal       guide in the arrangement           of
the tables, because the computations for the one trajectory are easily
made to serve for the other.        We naturally   select for tabulation that
one in which the terminal velocity is unit.
   These ballistic curves differ in character as well as in size.              The
characteristic of the shape may be taken           as   the angle    A   (fig. 4),
made by the two asymptotes,         or we may adopt       the velocity at some
definite direction, say the velocity at the summit         V.    The former is
general in its application, it includes the    cases  of projection obliquely

 644               Proceedings of       the   Royal Society
downwards, even to the limit of projection in the direction of gravity;
hut the latter has the advantage of more ready reference to             practice,
and lies more to hand in the calculations.
   In  the subjoined example of a table, the velocity at the summit
is assumed to be    just  equal to the terminal velocity, and the details
are given for intervals of one-tenth part of the tabular unit of time.
For  actual use these intervals must be made much smaller, and the
tables should    be arranged      for values   of the characteristic velocity,
differing slightly from each other        ; the former table may be regarded
as the  beginning of the series with the title       V = 0.
   Since the curves extend indefinitely both ways, such tables               must
always   be incomplete    ;   we can do no more        than carry them to     the
limits of probable utility.
   The first part of the table contains the details of the rise         ;  thus  a
body shot off at the instant       - -50,   with the velocity 2*18, and     at an

column, and reaches         the summit at the instant -00, having there         a

consulting the column marked Fall, we find that the original                        level
is reached between the instants + -60 and + -70, by interpolation at
•611, so that the whole time of its flight            has    been 1*111.        Also, in
the columns marked Hor. Distance, we find -6984                    for that covered
during the rise, and -4726         for that passed          over    during    the    fall,
making the total horizontal range 1-1710.                The velocity with which
the ball strikes the ground is seen to be -7777, while the impact is
at an angle of 39° "19'.       The squares of the initial and final velo
cities are nearly in the ratio of 55 to          7 ; that is to say, of the work
done by the gunpowder         in putting      the   ball in motion,       48 parts are
spent on the air, and     7  parts only remain to represent                the destruc
tive effort.
    Thus we can readily compute            the   range, the      time of flight, and
the incidence of the ball.         A table of these, such          as the    following,
forms a convenient adjunct to the fundamental table                   :—

     In order to apply these results to business,            we must ascertain        the
 values of the tabular units in terms of the actual units of time and
 distance.    This is   easily done     if the terminal velocity            bo known.
 As   an example,   let us take a bullet whose            terminal velocity is 800
 feet per second, in which        case    the   tabular velocities must all be
 multiplied   by 800.      A   heavy body falling          freely acquires      velocity
 at the rate of 32 feet per second         for each second of time, and would
 acquire this velocity of 800 in 25 seconds, wherefore                  all the tabular
 times must be multiplied          by 25.        Lastly,     the unit      of distance
 is described with      the   unit   velocity     in the unit of time,            where
 fore 800 x 25 = 20000 feet              is   the actual linear unit             of   the
 tables as applied to this          particular      projectile.      The     above    ex

     If the same ball be shot from the same gun, but at another inclina
  tion, the shape of the path is changed and the details thereof must
 be sought      for in another table.           We    search    among   the    various
 tables for that one in which the given              initial velocity is found        op
 posite the proposed      angle of elevation      ; if   the tables   be constructed
 for values of     V sufficiently     close, we shall find this either directly
 or by an easy interpolation        ;   and then, proceeding       as above, we can
 get all the desired information.
     Similarly,   if the initial velocity    and the horizontal range be given,
 we convert these into the corresponding tabular numbers, and search
 among the various tables for that one in which                these two are found
 together   ; the angle     of inclination, the time of flight, and all the
 other quaesita of the problem are then to hand.
     It has been stated      that three data suffice to determine           the path.
 When     the terminal velocity is one of these, the solution is obtained
 by simple inspection      ;  but when that velocity is one of the            quaesita,
 the operation becomes indirect.
     Suppose    that the velocity communicated              to a given shot by a
 specific charge of gunpowder has been ascertained,              say, by help of the
 ballistic   pendulum, we may discover the terminal velocity of that
 shot   by observing the angle of elevation and the horizontal                  range.
 For this   purpose we assume some terminal velocity, thence                 compute
 the corresponding tabular initial velocity, and thereby obtain                     the
corresponding horizontal          range.      If  this come out too much,            we
must reduce       the assumed     terminal velocity, and continue our            trials
until   the computed      agree  with     the measured      distance.    If  the time
of flight have also been carefully noted,               we get a corroboration        of
the accuracy of the result.
    Not only     so, we  may dispense        altogether with the ballistic        pen-

tlulum, and determine       both the initial velocity and the resistance by
accurate observations      of the angle, the range, and the time of flight.
For  the purpose of facilitating the solutions of the various problems
which   may arise in practice,        auxiliary tables may be derived from
the fundamental ones.
   When     a shot is fired   in   a steady   breeze,   the  direction in which
the ball meets the air is not the apparent           direction of the gun, it is
that of the resultant of the two motions, and the computations have
to be made    as  for that resultant.
   Thus    if AZ (fig. 5) represent the horizontal direction of the
gun, and    AB the initial velocity of the ball projected on the hori
zontal plane, while bJi represents         the velocity of the wind,      Ab will
be the horizontal direction         in which the ball meets the air.        Since
the vertical motion is not affected, the tangent of the elevation of
the gun must     be changed      in the ratio of Ab to      AB in    order to get
the tangent of the true angle of elevation in relation to the air, and
Ab multiplied by       the   secant    of that elevation is the true initial
velocity.
   If we  now, using these corrected           arguments,    compute     the  hori
zontal distances     corresponding to equal        intervals   of time,  measure
those along the prolongation of Ab and from the successive                 points
draw parallels cC, tZD, &c., multiples             of 6B, we shall have the

648                Proceedings       of the Royal Society
horizontal projection of the ball's path,           that path being a line         of
double curvature.
    As  an example    of the variety and completeness of the information
conveyed by such tables, we may cite the path detailed in the                    pre
ceding table and represented        by fig.  3.
    The ball is projected     from    A with     the velocity   of 2-18, and       at
once encounters     a resistance   4J  times    greater than its weight.         Ths
speed is rapidly lessened, and the path is deflected to              become hori
zontal at V, where, in the present           instance,   the   resistance    is just
equal to the weight.        On account      of this resistance      the speed       is
still  slackened,   but gravity now comes            to accelerate    the    motion
downwards, and, at about the fifth interval from               V,  has overcome
the   retardation, thereafter     the   velocity slowly increases, and         tends
ultimately to reach the limit       1 -00.
    Those cases in which         the   characteristic    angle   A of     fig.  4 is
obtuse have little or no application         to gunnery    ; in them the        path
is never horizontal, but is inclined downwards all along.
    The analysis of these motions is complex, and the calculations
thereon    following are tedious, but the results, when tabulated,                are
of   easy application.     The theory would         be uninteresting       to those
engaged     in the actual business, just as the mode of construction               of
trigonometric and logarithmic tables is scarcely ever thought of by
the navigator or surveyor.         What     we have at present to consider is
 the advantage     to be gained by the compilation of a series of tables
 such as those sketched out.
 3.  On some Physical Experiments relating to the Function                         of
      the Kidney.        By David Newman, Glasgow.                     Communi
      cated by Professor M'Kendrick.
                                    (Abstract.)
    This paper treats of the physical influences           which     promote      the
 secretion   of urine, as far as can be demonstrated             by experiments
 upon animal membranes         and the kidneys of animals recently killed.
 Before going on to consider the subject I may be permitted simply
to mention the theory held regarding the means
                                                                  by which the

                       of Edinburgh, Session 1877-78.                                   G49
kidney performs its function, and also say a word or two in connec
tion with the structure of that organ.                  As    regards its histology the
kidney may be said to bo composed of two elements — (1) the blood
vessels, and
                  (2) the tubuli uriniferi.        (This is leaving out of account
the lymphatic         arrangement.)        The kidney           receives   its supply of
blood from the renal artery, which,               as   it   passes into the substance
of     the    kidney,    penetrates      the    cortical       portion    and    gives    off
branches.         The uriniferous       tubules      in this part of          the   kidney
end      in globular dilatations called             the      capsules,    or  Malpighian
bodies ; it is into these that the                 branches         of the renal artery
 pass     to   form    convoluted       coils,   the     glomeruli.        The branches
 of   the renal artery which         pass into      the      glomeruli    are called     the
 afferent vessels, and the vessels that are formed by the                      reunion of
 the branches of the glomeruli are called the efferent                    vessels.    After
 the efferent vessels emerge from the capsule of the Malpighian body
 they again subdivide to form true capillaries, most of which go to
 form     a closely meshed     network round the tubuli uriniferi.                     They
 finally unite to form the radicals of the renal vein.
     To make use of the description of Mr Bowman, " it would                         be  dif
 ficult to conceive      a disposition of parts           more     calculated    to favour
 the escape of water from the blood                 than that of the Malpighian
 body.       A  large artery breaks       up in     a    very direct manner into            a
 number of minute branches,             each of which suddenly             opens    up into
 an assemblage       of  vessels of far greater aggregate capacity              than itself,
 and from which there is one narrow exit.                      Hence must arise a very
 abrupt retardation to the velocity of the current of blood."                            But
 besides     this arrangement,        by which         a    large   volume of blood is
  exposed to circumstances         the most conducive to free filtration              of its
  fluid constituents, we have         a  condition, namely, the secondary capil
  lary system on the distal side of the glomerulus, which, by its resist
  ance to the onward flow of the blood, subjects the blood inside the
  Malpighian       body to considerable pressure.               It is now generally sup
  posed that the excretion        of urine     takes place by filtration of a dilute
  solution of the soluble constituents of the urine through the glome
 rulus into the capsule of the Malpighian body.                       This   weak solution
 then passes along the tubuli uriniferi, where it comes into close con
  tact  with   the blood   it has  just left.     It is   then supposed that an inter
 change takes place between            the blood      in   the capillaries surrounding

 650                  Proceedings of        the   Royal Society
 the tubules and the fluid inside by which                a  certain amount of          the
 water passes again into the blood, and so leaves the urine in                     a more
 concentrated      state than   it  was when      it first  passed from      the    glome
 rulus into the dilated end of the urine tubes (Ludwig).                 It is believed,
 however,     that the epithelium, which lines the convoluted tubes,                   per
 forms certain functions in connection with the secretion of the                      solid
 constituents.
    The rapidity of the secretion of urine may be said to depend                      upon
 the  following factors: — (1) The relationship which exists                     between
 the pressure of the blood in the glomerulus of vessels and the urine
 in the capsule of the Malpighian           body and in the tubuli             uriniferi    ;
 (2) the state of the blood pressure in the venous                 system of the kid
ney; (3) the pressure upon the lymphatics; (4) the quality of the blood
in the artery of the Malpighian tuft ; (5) the state of the walls of the
artery    constituting     the Malpighian        tuft, and of the capsule itself,
these being regarded as the filter through which the fluids and soluble
constituents of the blood have to pass.               The influence of vaso-motor
nerves upon secretion        must not, however,          be forgotten    ; not only      do
they exert an influence upon the quantity and quality of the                         secre
tion by dilating       or contracting      the    arterioles,    but their     influence
upon     the chemical processes,         by    reason    of their communications
with the secreting cells (Pfliiger), must be remembered                  ;  (6) activity
of tubular epithelium.
    In  the experiments      I  have endeavoured         to imitate the conditions
found in the Malpighian            body of the kidney.              I  have    not been
able, however, to represent          the lymphatic arrangement.
    The apparatus,      a  drawing of which, kindly executed                 for me by
my friend      Dr Robert Moffatt, is shown in           the following woodcut             It
consists of a piece       of rabbit's bowel      A2 enclosed      in  a glass tube B2.
To each end of the bowel a small glass T-tube is attached.                        One of
those    tubes    is connected      with   a pressure-bottle        A, and      a mano
meter     A1.    The pressure       exercised    upon the fluid inside the bowel
by the pressure-bottle        and indicated by the          manometer      A1    will    be
designated      the afferent   pressure.      The tube       attached    to   the other
side of the bowel conveys          the fluid that passes along the             bowel     to
the vessel B, and the         pressure    exercised      upon the fluid which it
contains,    called the efferent resistance, is indicated by the manometer
B1.    Through a cork at the right hand side of the large tube, another

                        of Edinburgh, Session 1877-78.                             651
T-tube    communicates,        on the one hand, with the inside of the large
glass tube containing the bowel, and, on the other, the vessel                   E  and
manometer        C1.     The vessel   E will     therefore contain the fluid that
filters through the membrane           A2.
    The    index      in  the   manometer      A1  will  therefore    represent      the
afferent pressure,       and correspond      to the arterial tension     of  the renal
artery;     B1  will indicate the     efferent resistance (when applied to the
 kidney,     the venous resistance),      while the manometer          C1   will  show
the resistance offered by the fluid in the               tube B2 to the transuda
 tion   of the fluid inside the bowel, and therefore             correspond to the
tension of the urine in the capsule of the Malpighian body.
     In  the    first series of experiments water was              passed     into the
bowel under an afferent           pressure of from 10 to 50 mm. of mercury,
 the efferent      resistance   being the same in each experiment as the
 afferent    pressure, so that no water passed            along the bowel to B.
 The amount of fluid which transuded through                 the bowel was found
 to increase in accordance          with the pressure       used.     It  was    shown
 that   for every 10 mm. increase in the pressure,              there was '533 c.c.
 more water filtered through the bowel per minute.                     Thus under       a
 pressure     of 10 mm.       2-133 c.c.   transuded in    a minute, and when           a
 pressure of 50 mm. was applied 4-266 c.c. passed in the same time.
 From    these results     we would therefore conclude that the amount of
fluid which       transudes    through an animal membrane            is increased     ac
cording to the tension of the fluid inside.                In relation     to this ex
periment, take the following : — Instead of             an animal membrane           the
kidney of        a recently     killed   horse   was  employed     ;  in this    case   a
 three-quarters per cent, salt solution was used instead of water, as                  it

652                    Proceedings of        the  Royal Society
was found       that when water is passed into the vessels                  it  almost
immediately        passes through       the walls      and causes oedema of          the
tissue,    and the onward         flow of the fluid       is prevented.      The    salt
solution     seems, however,         not to pass        through the walls       of  the
vessels into the lymphatic           spaces    so readily    if the kidney is quite
fresh, hut     still it passes from the glomeruli           into the dilated end of
the   tubuli    uriniferi.    I   found it very difficult        to get this   experi
ment to work satisfactorily, as the kidney requires to he used imme
diately after the death of the animal, and a number of precautions
need to be taken which          it is not    necessary to mention here.
    In  the experiments alluded to the salt solution was passed                    into
the   artery under various            pressures,    the venous resistance        being
equal to 20 mm. in all except the first, in which case no resistance
was offered      to the exit of the fluid         by the vein.      In  the first ex
periment the solution seemed simply to pass from the arterial into
the venous system, very little being pressed into the urine tubules.
When, however, the efferent              resistance   is raised to 20 mm., and at
the same time the afferent pressure advanced                to 40 mm., the increase
in the amount of fluid pressed into the ureter is obvious.                     In   the
other experiments upon the kidneys of animals, the results of which
I  will not give in detail,     a somewhat       similar plan was adopted.         The
following     are the results      : — (1.) When the fluid contained in the
ureter    is subjected to pressure,           the quantity of fluid       that passes
from the vein is diminished               in relation to the pressure employed,
and so also is the amount of fluid              that transudes     from the glome
rulus into the capsule of the Malpighian                 body.    (2.) The quantity
of fluid that passes from] the vein depends                    upon the amount of
afferent pressure ; the greatest increase takes place between 40 and
50 mm.        (3.) The temperature of the fluid affects the rapidity of
the flow through the vessels and the quantity that transudes into
the tubuli uriniferi.        The higher the temperature            the greater is the
amount of fluid passed from the ureter, and the more rapid the cir
culation through the vessels.              (4.) When the fluid is pressed into
the artery, it finds its way readily into the vein, but when injected
into the vein, it does not escape by the artery.                 There must, there
fore,   be some arrangement            in the kidney,        probably   in the Mal
pighian body, by which regurgitation of the fluid is prevented.
    The results of the experiments with the bowel show (1.) that

                          of Edinburgh, Session 1877-78.                                       653
the amount of fluid that                transudes     is   in  accordance        with the pres
sure upon the fluid inside.                  (2.)   For   every 10 mm. increase in the
afferent pressure           '275 c.c. more fluid         transudes      per minute, and the
flow along       the bowel is increased           ;  whereas, when the efferent resist
ance is increased, the amount of fluid that transudes is augmented
by     '31 c.c.    in the        same    time, and the flow along the bowel is
diminished.             Therefore       the afferent        pressure      may be     said    to be
expended in two ways — increasing                      the amount of fluid             that tran
sudes, and the quantity that passes along the                       bowel — but      the efferent
 resistance exerts its whole force in pressing                       the   fluid through the
 membrane, therefore,              10 mm.      increase in the efferent           resistance has
 more effect than the same increase                   in   the afferent      pressure,     and for
 the same reason we would suppose                        that     a  given increase         in   the
 venous resistance would conduce                    more      to rapid secretion         of urine
 than the same increase                in   the    arterial pressure, unless           when the
 venous resistance             is extreme       when other factors            come into       play.
 (3.) The addition of urea slightly retards the transudation of water
 through the membrane.                  The filtrate contains the same percentage,
 whatever pressure             may be employed, as the original                  solution.      (4.)
 Albumen        also retards the transudation of water, but it differs from
 urea    in this    respect,      that the percentage of albumen in the filtrate
 is in relation        to the     pressure.      The higher the pressure               the   larger
 the quantity of albumen               in  a given amount of the filtrate.               (5.) The
 presence      of urea in        a  solution of albumen assists               the filtration of
 the albumen at the expense of the urea.                        The following table shows
  the   results : —

  the transudation           of the fluid.        Thus, when water was passed into

the temperature           alone was raised              to 34'2°     C,    197 c.c. transuded in
the same time.
  At the beginning of this                 paper       I referred   to   Ludwig's theory      regard
ing the secretion of urine, namely, that the blood is subjected to a high
pressure inside the glomeruli, a free filtration into the dilated end of
the    tubuli uriniferi        takes place, and this filtrate, which is at first very
dilute, gradually parts with                a   portion of the water that holds it in           solu
tion.       This   is believed to take place by a process                    of diffusion   between
the fluid in the         tubuli uriniferi          and the blood         in the veins   surrounding
them on all sides.              Now,       if it      were not that albumen retards to                 a
certain extent the passage of crystalloids (salts and urea) through an
animal membrane, then the fluid in the inside of the urine tubules
would be of the same concentration (in crystalloids) as the blood.
But it has been shown that when a solution of albumen and urea
are filtered through an animal membrane                             under pressure, the filtrate
is less concentrated           than the original solution, particularly as                   regards
the amount of albumen, but also to a slight extent the urea.                                    This
is more especially            the   case     when the pressure is not great                   If   the
blood contained nothing but crystalloids (urea and salts) then the
fluid inside the tubuli uriniferi would be the same as the fluid cir
culating in the vessels, and no diffusion would take place during                                  the
passage of the urine from the glomerulus to the pelvis                            of the    kidney.
This     is,   however,       not the      case   ;    the blood circulating in the          vessels
contains       a   large quantity of albumen, and,                  if   the theory above stated
be correct,        more urea than the fluid                  in   the tubules, so that, putting
aside any special function                 the epithelium            may have, diffusion must
result, and        a   portion of the water in the tubules pass back again into
the blood.             This diffusion will            take   place as the urine         passes along
the tubuli uriniferi either                till   it   becomes      of the same concentration
as the      blood outside, or makes its escape into the common ducts                            that
convey      it     to the pelvis of the kidney.                     Therefore, the longer          the
urine remains            in   the  tubuli uriniferi, other things being                   equal, the
more concentrated              will itbe.

                          a
                   of Colour. By John G. M'Kendrick, M.D.
  There are several well-known                         methods      of mixing    colours,    such   as
the superposition             of two spectra or of different parts of the                      same

                       of Edinburgh, Session 1877-78.                                  655
 spectrum — the       method of        reflection, Czermak's             modification     of
 Scheiner's experiment, the use of rotating disks                       having coloured
 sectors,    and   the  direct mixture of coloured powders or coloured
 liquids.     In all of   these cases the        effect may be seen with one eye,
 and is due to the action of light on              a  definite portion of one retina.
 But    may    sensations     of mixed colours be produced by binocular
 vision of the components?             Regarding         this question various well-
 known observers have arrived at completely opposite results.                        Thus,
 as  mentioned by Helmholtz in his " Optique Physiologiquo,"                       p. 976,
 H. Meyer, Volkmann,           Meissner, Funke, and he himself fail in ob
 taining the sensation of the resulting colour, whilst Dove, Kegnault,
 Briicke,    Ludwig, Panum,         and     Heriug state the reverse.              In his
 great    work,    Helmholtz      describes        various    methods      by which      he
 investigated the question, and his opinion amounts to this, that we
 have no true binocular         perception of colour.            According to him we
 may have a resultant sensation            of    a  particular    kind, different from
 that of the two components,           but also unlike          the    sensation    of  the
 mixed colour obtained by methods appealing to one eye only.
    In studying this subject I lately devised the following simple
arrangement : — Take two No. 3 eye-pieces of Hartnack's microscope,
or any similar eye-pieces of considerable focal length, and place one
before each eye.        If  they be somewhat           diverged, two luminous fields
will   be seen, and by adjustment, the edge of the one luminous field
may be caused to touch the edge of the other.                        In    these  circum
stances    a  definite area of each retina is illuminated.                   By  converg
ing   the eye-pieces, the two fields may then be partially overlapped,
and when the axes of the two                  eye-  pieces   are parallel, both fields
coincide.      It will  then    be found       that the overlapped          portion is in
tensely luminous, whilst the other portions become less luminous,
as  if cast into shadow.         By  increasing       or diminishing      the amount of
convergence      of the eye-pieces, the extent of the luminous field may
be varied at      pleasure,    and the       two fields coincide when the two
images fall on the         two yellow         spots.     If, then,   a   small piece     of
coloured glass be inserted into each eye-piece,                 say red into one and
blue into the other, on repeating the experiment                 as above    mentioned,
I  find that the overlapping portion of the two fields gives                     a sensa
tion of the resultant colour.           I  have      repeated   the experiment with
various coloured media, such              as   coloured gelatine         paper, coloured

056                     Proceedings             of the Royal Society
paper rendered          translucent by oil, &c.                       In    showing    the         experiment
to others,         I have    found that certain people do not see the                                resultant
eolour, whilst others              do so readily.                  The cause of this and of                  the
opposite statements of the observers                               above alluded       to,     I    believe   to
be this    :   The sensation resulting from the fusion in the brain of                                       the
two impressions, one coming from each eye, appears                                         to be       capable
of decomposition by a mental effort.                                  Thus, the purple               produced
by red and blue appears                  as   such to my eye                so   long as   I   simply       look
at   it without any           conscious         effort     ;   but     if    I   wish to analyse            it,
                                                                                                              I
then find that the two colours, red and blue, seem to be superposed
on each other, and the one appears to shine through the other.                                               On
ceasing        to make        any effort,            they again             fuse together as before.
Again, by thinking of the colour opposite the right eye, say red,                                           the
field ceases to be purple and has                              a   decided tinge of red, and                  on
thinking of          the colour before the                 left      eye, say blue, the prevailing
tone of the field           is   blue.        Apparently, then,             if   corresponding points
of two retinae be simultaneously stimulated by two different colours,
the impressions             are fused in consciousness                     into the resultant colour              ;
but the resulting sensation                    may be decomposed                   by an act of         atten
tion.      The decomposition                   is    effected        partly      by strongly         directing
the attention          to     one eye, and less                    strongly to the other,            and    the
result    is   a   sensation      corresponding to the colour placed                               before   the
eye to which the attention                    is    most       strongly directed.              Some of the
same facts may be studied                     with    the aid of the stereoscope.

       1.    On the Genus Rhizodus.                   By Dr R. II. Traquair.
                                        (Abstract.)
   In this       paper the author first       sketches     the     history of Rhizodus,
from its discovery by Ure of Rutherglen                   to the most recent             papers
on the subject.
  Placed         by Agassiz among           the   " Coelacanthi         "
                                                                            (i.e.,   cycliferous
Crossopterygia of modern nomenclature) it was classified by Professor
Huxley in the cycliferous division of his family Glyptodipterini,
along with           Holoptychius,     Glyptolepis, Dendrodus.                The discovery
by the author, in 1875, of its subacutely lobate pectoral fin revealed
the fact that it was much more closely allied to Rhizodopsis than to
Holoptychius, and that it ought, along with the former genus, to be
classed     in   a    family (Cyclodipterini)       distinct from the acutely lobate
Holoptychiidae.             The    author    does     not consider the identity               of
Leidy's genus Apcpodus with Rhizodus                   as proved.
   M'Coy admitted two species of Rhizodus — R. Hibberti, Agassiz,
and R. gracilis, M'Coy, merging with the former of these the Holopt-
tychius Portlockii of Agassiz.  An examination of the types of
Holoptychius            Portlockii,   preserved      in the     Museum           of Practical
Geology,     shows, however,          that this species is not only specifically
but also generically distinct from Rhizodus Hibberti,                        as the teeth are
devoid of the cutting edges characteristic of Rhizodus, and in this
particular,   well as in the minute striation of the surface, they
                 as
closely resemble those of Hancock and Atthey's genus ArcJiichlhys,
to which the author proposes to transfer                 it,   at least     provisionally.
  An investigation of             the large store of Rhizodus remains from the
Gilmerton ironstone, belonging to the Edinburgh Museum of Science
and   Art,   shows the presence of two well-marked species of Rhizodus,
differing in the bulk to which they attained respectively, as well as
in the relative thickness of the scales, the shape of many of the

658                  Proceedings      of the Royal Society
bones, and the external sculpture as well              of the bones as of the
scales.    For   the larger    of these two species, there can        be no doubt
of the propriety of retaining the specific              name      Hibberti,  as  it is
clear that its enormous        laniary teeth, as occurring in the limestone
of Burdiehouse, and at first considered by Hibbert to be reptilian,
originally    suggested      the  name    Megalichthys       Hibberti    to  Agassiz,
which he afterwards altered           to Holoptychius       Hibberti,    after elimi
nating the Saurodipterine remains previously confounded with them,
and to which latter he then limited            the term      Megalichthys, rather
unfortunately,      as   "Megalichthys" is        the   smaller fish     !  M' Coy's
R. gracilis    is certainly      a synonym      of R.    Hibberti,    the apparent
greater   slenderness       of the dentary bone        being due to the infra-
dentary plates (not known to M'Coy) being, as is often the case,
a wanting in the specimen ; and as regards the greater slenderness of
the anterior laniary, a large        series  of  teeth   from     Gilmerton    shows
every possible amount of gradation in that respect.                  For the smaller
species,   whose      remains    have   hitherto    been    confounded      with R.
Hibberti, the author proposes the name of R. ornatus.
                         1.   Rhizodus Hibberti, Ag. sp.
    This species must have attained a gigantic size, a detached                  den-
t;iry bone in the Edinburgh            Museum measuring           no  less than    25
inches in length.        Externally the cranial       bones are ornamented by
a rather   fine tuberculation, the tubercles more or less confluent             with
tortuous ridges.        The mandible displays the same structure as in
Rhizodopsis,      the dentary element         being narrow, pointed          behind,
thick in front, where it carries         the anterior or symphyseal laniary
tooth, the three other laniaries behind            being borne upon separate
internal dentary pieces.          Below the dentary, and forming the lower
margin of the jaw, are three infra-dentary plates, while posteriorly
the articular     region     is covered    by a large plate representing the
angular element.         Other determinable bones described            in this paper
are the     maxilla, which,      as in Rhizodopsis, only       bears    small teeth,
the   principal jugular, the operculum,           the   clavicle,  the   infra-clavi
cular ; there are others also whose place in the skeleton is not easily
determinable.         The clavicle and infra-clavicular are not tuberculated
like the cranial bones, but ornamented with delicate reticulating
ridges and pits     ;  the   posterior superior angle of the infra-clavicular

                    of Edinburgh, Session 1877-78.                                 659
is produced upwards and backwards in                a long slender process.        The
scales are comparatively thin and very              large, sometimes,      as  noticed
by Hibbert, attaining         a diameter of 5 inches       ; usually they occur in
a broken condition.          Their   attached surface      is marked by a central
boss and concentric lines of growth.              The outer surface, very rarely
seen,    is ornamented        by closely set granules,          which    towards the
posterior border of the exposed            area are confluent into wavy ridges
terminating in the margin.            These seem certainly to be the scales
attributed    to   R. Hibberti      by M'Coy, but not by Young              ; they are
                                                       '                               '
probably also the same as the undescribed Phyllolepsis tenuissimus
of  Agassiz.
   R. Hibberti    occurs throughout the Cementstone               and Carboniferous
Limestone series of Scotland, the most noted locality being Gilmerton,
near Edinburgh.
                      2.   R. ornatus,     sp.  nov. Traquair.
   To this species, which seems never to have attained anything like
the dimensions of R. Hibberti, belong the specimen                      showing the
pectoral fin described by the author in 1875, the head described                    by
Mr L. C. Miall,      and     in fact nearly all the specimens in which any
portion of    a  fish with bones or scales in situ is shown.                The orna
ment of the cranial bones is somewhat               similar    in character    to that
in R. Hibberti, but       very much coarser       ;  the   same is the      case with
the bones of the shoulder.           Of   the bones the       following    have   been
recognised    by the     author — dentary,       operculum,      principal jugular,
clavicle, infra-clavicular ; there are also others whose determination
is still somewhat doubtful.           The clavicle differs somewhat in form
from that of R. Hibberti,            its lower portion being narrower from
before backwards.         The expanded         portion of the infra-clavicular       is
also shorter than in the larger species, but the same slender                  process
is sent backwards and upwards from its posterior superior angle.
The pectoral fin is subacutely lobate.              The scales are thicker than
those of R. Hibberti.          The exposed area of the external surface              is
marked with short,          interrupted, wavy, reticulating           ridges,   whose
direction is mainly parallel with           the posterior border of the scale          ;
in the interval between         these, more delicate     ridges are seen radiating
from the centre.       It  is apparently on a scale of this species that            Dr
Young has founded his description of those of R. Hibberti.

                           By D. Milne Home, Esq.
    Since the last Report was drawn out and laid before the Society,
the Convener has had an opportunity              of inspecting a considerable
number of boulders not mentioned                in previous Reports.        Some
of these are      interesting, on account not only of size, but also of
shape,     marks on them,         and position.     The Committee        consider
that      advantage     will result from     a   special  description of these,
and from woodcuts of          a few.
    The cases have been arranged,         as  in previous Reports, according
to counties, to indicate         the geographical position     of the boulders,
and     enable   persons desirous of inspecting them, to know           where to
find them.

                         of Edinburgh,       Session 1877-78.                         661
      His   Grace the Duke of       Argyll, at     the meeting     of the British As
sociation in Glasgow in 1876, was pleased                to allude  in complimentary
terms to the researches of the Committee,               and to express a hope that
a condensed abstract of all the boulders reported on, might ultimately
be framed.           The suggestion will receive the consideration of the
Committee.
                                     ARGY LLSHIRE.
      1.   Glenelg. — Blocks of    grey and red granite occur            in  the    drift-
beds through which the river Elg has cut.                    The rocks of this dis
trict     are not granite, but clay schists.
      On the right     side of the valley of the       Elg, immediately      above the
road,       about    2i miles east of Glenelg, there is a grey granite
boulder, 21x18x10 feet, as shown on figs. 1 and 2, Plate I.
 The sharp end points X.N.W. Its height above the road is 1020
feet, above the        sea 1120 feet.
      It  goes by the name of the Macrae Boulder,               in  consequence      of  a
 prophecy by a Mackenzie of Kintail, that some day, when one of
 the clan Macrae is travelling           on the road        below, it will fall and
 crush him.
     The boulder is on the very edge of a shelf of the hill, and pro
jects beyond it about         6 feet, as  shown in figs.      1  and 2, Plate    I.
      The rocks on which it lies are clay-stone schists.                The boulder
 must therefore have been brought                to its present      position.      It  is
 said that on a       hill some distance to the west there is a granite rock
 similar to that of the boulder.                By what       means,   and how the
 boulder was deposited in its present precarious position, it is difficult
  to explain.       Possibly, when deposited, there was no steep cliff, at the
  edge    of which it now projects.            The whole valley may have been
  filled with     detritus up to the level of 1100 feet, and thereafter
  scooped out by the river, as the sea,               in falling from one level to
  another, gave to the river more              cutting power.        This process of
  scooping might have continued for such length of time, that the
   cliff thereby formed at length reached the boulder.
       2. In  Glen Rossdale    (about   8  miles from Glenelg), at         a height of
  about 900 feet above          the  sea,   there    is a boulder of coarse red
   granite, 5 x   4J  x 3 feet, on the top of a narrow ridge of hypersthene
   rock, as shown on fig. 3, Plate        II.,  on the left side of valley.
       vol. ix.                                                            4 s

 662                     Proceedings       of the Royal Society
     Its position        also is precarious,      and suggests         a doubt      whether,
 when brought here, it could have been deposited                            on the      precise
 point where         it now      stands.     There was nothing             to indicate       the
 direction from which the boulder had come.
     3.  There is another boulder on the right side of the valley,                       about
 820 feet above the sea, 12 x 15 x 7 feet, fig. 4, Plate                    L
     It  lies on a shelf near the ridge of a               hill, and      close to a slope
 of the       hill which        rises   up   from    the   boulder,       and facing          the
 N.W.        The     spot    suggested     the idea      that the boulder had              been
 brought from            the N.W., and that this             hill   stopped      its further
 progress.       There is towards the N.W. an opening among the hills
 through which it might have been floated towards its present site.
     4. A little       lower down the valley (Rossdale), and on the                       same
 side, at a height        of about     630 feet above       the   sea, there     is a rocky
 knoll     somewhat        flat on the top, and presenting an area of about
 8 or 9 yards       in    diameter,    on which are five or six boulders lying
 pretty close together,          as  shown on fig.    5,  Plate I.       The boulders         are
 granite, the     knoll is     mica schist.
    5.  At    a still lower part of        the glen there is a steep           hill sloping
 down to the river.            Near the top of this hill, and on the very edge
 overhanging the river,              a boulder rests at a height              of    300     feet
 above     the river.         The     boulder is of granite, about              20     feet    in
diameter.        It   rests on mica slate rocks, which form a smooth surface
sloping down towards the river at an angle of about 30°.                             Its  posi
tion indicates transport from the north,                   as the     land there is low
enough       to have allowed it to be floated over, whilst high hills to
the south exclude that direction.
    In  the valleys where these boulders lie, there are some remark
able    terraces.         They      were   made     known      to    the     Convener         by
Captain Burke,            RE.,      two years    ago, when        he was       still at      the
head of the Scotch Ordnance Survey.                      The surveyors employed in
drawing the contour lines for the maps were struck by the hori-
zontality      and      continuity     of   the   terraces.       Captain      Burke       was
so   obliging     as    to draw on the Convener's map                   lines to indicate
their position.          As   these terraces    suggest     important views bearing
on the position           of the boulders, and their            mode      of transport, it
seems not irrelevant to record the notes               supplied by Captain Burke
and give a copy of the map, to show where the terraces are.

                              of Edinburgh, Session 1877-78.                                              663
     Before, however, describing these higher terraces, it may be right to
refer to certain flats at the mouths of the valleys near the                                      sea.
     The town and village of Glenelg are situated on a flat which
prevails all along the Scotch coasts, about                                 11 or 12 feet above          high-
water        mark.            Between             Glenelg and Glenbeg                   the base of some
high rocky cliffs                 is at the same level.
     Mr Fraser, schoolmaster                         at Glenelg,            having      learned that the
Convener was desirous                           of seeing examples               of flat land, conducted
him      to the following spots                     :—
   (1.) At Glenbernera, about half a mile to the north of Glenelg,
there is a well-defined flat, about 44 or 45 feet above high water.
A    corresponding flat occurs at many other parts of the coast.
  (2.) Behind and above the new schoolhouse at Glenelg, there is a
considerable extent of flat land, at a height of 72 feet above high
water.           On the opposite, i.e., the south side of the valley, which is
half      a mile distant,                   there    is a flat at exactly               the same height,
judging          by the spirit-level.                    The river has cut through this                   flat.
Its original formation cannot                        be ascribed        to river action.
     Beyond           the     manse         and church, there               is    another extensive flat,
88 feet above the                  sea.
     In     a higher part of the valley, there                              are terraces on a smaller
scale.          If    they slope with the river,                   as   they seem to do, they pro
bably had been formed by the river, when it ran at                                         a   higher level,
that      is,   when the           sea also stood at          a   higher level than now.
     Near the mouth of Glenbeg, about                                   a   mile from the         sea,   there
is   a    great       mass        of detritus, through which                      the river    Beg has cut
its channel.               There       is   a   flat here also on each side of the river, the
level of which               is   about 120 feet above high water.
     Fig.       6,   Plate
                     (from memory)
                             I.   is  plan of this valley. The parts
                                                              a
marked a, a, &c., are patches of detritus, the tops of which are all
on the same level, or very nearly so, viz., 50 feet above tho sea.
     The whole valley apparently had been filled with detritus, when
the sea stood at least                    150 or 200          feet above its present level.                As
the sea retired, channels were cut in the                                   detritus, not only by the
main stream now occupying the valley, but by the numerous and
rapid side streams from the steep mountains which enclose the valley
on both sides.
     At about          3   miles from the                sea, the place          in   Glen Beg   is   reached,

664                  Proceedings of the Royal Society
where Captain Burke          states he noticed a horizontal terrace on both
sides of the river, at a height of 330             feet above the         sea.     It    is
marked (A) on plan, fig. 7, Plate II.
    The Convener recognised a terrace on the right bank at 338 feet, bot
he could see none on the opposite or left bank.              At    a little   distance
farther up, there are on the left bank gravel knolls at a somewhat
higher level.       At this place, the channel of the river is about 40              feet
below the terrace, and is of rock, which has of course                     prevented
any deeper cutting of the drift beds.
    At  the  junction   between     Glen Beg and Glen Rossdale (B) in                 the
plan, there are very large knolls of detritus with flattened tops.
    From the highest of these knolls, the Convener, on looking                   across
the valley    in a direction by compass        E. by N.,   descried a terrace, con
tinuous for about 80 yards, and apparently horizontal.                  Its  position
is indicated on the plan by five small vertical strokes. When the spirit-
level was turned in a direction about E. by S., it struck on another
horizontal terrace, about half a mile distant.              All  those flats are at
one height, viz., 528 feet above the sea.
    Higher     up Glen Rossdale on the left bank, and at a spot about
 1h   mile from (B), there is an extensive flat, which had been marked
by Captain Burke.           He   states  it   at 750   feet above the sea.          The
Convener made it 760 feet.             When a person      is on the terrace, it         is
not distinctly traceable for more than 300 or 400 yards                 ;  but   when
viewed from the opposite           side of the valley, at a distance of about
a  quarter of mile, it can be distinctly traced for more than                   a mile
continuously     ;  and at its east end it is seen to cross the ridge which
divides Glen Beg from Glen Rosadale.
    In  a higher part of Glen         Rossdale, and still on the left side of
 the glen, the Convener observed traces of a shelf at 853 feet, with                     a
 steep slope or bank below         it of about    30 feet  in height       The Ord
 nance surveyors observed         traces of a horizontal terrace       still   higher,
 viz., at  1 500   feet above     the  sea.    The Convener, looking in            that
 direction, observed,     at a distance     of about   3  miles, something like          a
 horizontal line running for nearly a mile continuously at what might
 be  about that height
     On the plan, Captain Burke indicates as existing in adjoining
glens, traces of the 330 feet terrace          by the cypher 0.         These glens
the Convener had not time to visit.

    He   has also put a      X at the     head  of three     several glens to indicate
that   at these places, and at a height of 750 feet, there are gravel heaps.
    Some quotations may be made from Captain Burke's letter, dated
25th August        1876     :—
    "  I was up Glenelg yesterday.            There is evidence of the              sea  having
stood    at more than one height, considerably above its present                           level.
    " The only     terrace     of any   consequence      is in Glen Rossdale.                It  is
about    300 yards      in length.       It has nothing        in the      least resembling
Glen Roy.
       I
    " will now answer your questions : —
           1. — Height      above the sea —
              (1)  Principal      terrace, about                       750 feet.
              (2) Another, very doubtful,              .         .     520       „
              (3) Some rather more apparent,                     .     330       ,,
 " This   terrace, at the head of Glen Beg, affords strong evidence                           of  a
beach, such as now exists in all                sea   lochs hereabouts.                Beds of
gravel at 330 feet are cut through by the stream running through
the valley.
    " On     crossing     the high       neck,   450      feet     above       the    sea,    and
descending into Glenmore, similar beds were found at the head of
 that valley, at the same altitude.
    "The spot marked in my sketch lint at 530 feet is very doubtful.
    " The 750 feet terrace is visible in patches in Glenbeg and Glen
 Rossdale.      I  tried to trace it down Glenmore, for                   I  have no doubt
the land between these glens was once an island.                           But, although          I
fancied    I found     a  mound sometimes,        it can't be traced.
    " The longest     vestige of a terrace      which      I saw,     is in Glen Rossdale,
 viz., about 300 yards         ; for the rest, there is only           a  mound here and
 there on the     hill   side.
    " As   to the width of the terraces, the greatest                    I  saw is about 30
 yards.
    " You ask how high up             these  hills is  sand and gravel found                ?     I
 saw appearance       of gravel at over 1200 feet.              There are gravel heaps
 at 750 feet at the heads of the valleys marked X, at the spots                               one
 would expect to find them, and also at ©, apparently washed when
 the country was under water, and since cut through by the streams
 in the valleys.         In    fact, all  the  appearance          is  as   if  these valleys

 666                 Proceedings       of the Royal Society
 were once sea       lochs,  just  as are Lochs         Nevis and       Honrn at       the
 present day.       These marks are frequent throughout the Highlands.
 I  have seen similar gravel-beds         along streams in several other glens.
     " Whether it will      be decided to survey the shelf,              I cannot     say.
 But there is nothing definite except the bit in Glen Eossdale                     ;  and
 a surveyor would not find         it   easy, when on the          hillside, to   know
 what mounds he should show, unless he                       had previously run           a
 contour at the required height.
     " I have made two sketches, one of Glenbeg looking east, another
 of Glen Rossdale looking          west, which        I  shall be happy to show
 you."
     With   reference to these last remarks by Captain Burke,                 it occurs
 to the Committee to express            an opinion      that, when the Ordnance
 surveyors    discover on the     hill  sides terraces of the       kind referred      to,
 there   should be some record given of them on the maps, accom
 panied by a contour line at the same level along the adjoining hills,
 so   that it might be seen whether there are separate patches of
gravel elsewhere at the same height.               It is also desirable that when
the officer at the head of the Survey verifies what the surveyors have
found, and makes sketches of the terraces, these sketches should                       be
given    with   the maps when published.
    In walking down Glen Rossdale valley, on the right bank,                         the
 Convener fell in with a large mass of detritus, cut up into a series
 of knolls by the action of streams and rain.           The height of these knolls
above the sea was on an average                858 feet —agreeing pretty nearly
with the level of the shelf already noticed               as  existing on the oppo
site side of tho valley.
    These remains of gravel in Glen Rossdale and the adjoining glens,
looking    to the     height and the form in which                they occur,     seem
conclusive     as to the  occupation of these valleys by the sea           ; and they
confirm the inference derived from the position of the boulders, that
the boulders were probably floated into these positions.
    The Convener was at first puzzled to account for the circumstance
that most of the large boulders which he saw in these valleys were
not upon drift, but upon bare rock            ;  and  in many other parts of         the
country, the same thing occurs.             If   these boulders were floated by
ice and thrown down, they must most generally have fallen upon the
detrital beds      then forming        the   sea-bottom,      and not upon        bare

                           of Edinburgh, Session 1877-78.                           667
rocks.         When       the sea retired, the boulders would then be on the
drift,     or buried in it.           But when    the streams      from the   hill sides
began       to flow and to remove the drift, the boulders would sink               until
rock      was reached          by them,    where,   of  course,   they  would remain.
The       denudation of the old sea-bottoms has beeu everywliere so exten
 sive, that very probably             most of the boulders now existing are not
 in   precisely the exact positions which they occupied when originally
 deposited.
      6.   In    the  Pass of Brander, whore the Rivor Awe flows out of
 the lake of the same name, there are several boulders deserving
  notice.
      On    the right       bank of the river, near the spot where           there  is   a
  pier for the small lake steamer, there are two terraces on drift.
  Both terraces have boulders on them.                   The boulders are of reddish
  granite.        The rocks in the Pass are a slaty schistose                 rock like
  greywacke.            The boulders have apparently come from some distant
  region,    as the     granite of tho Loch Etive hills is not red, but almost
  entirely grey in colour.
      The height of Loch Awe               above the sea is (by Ordnance Survey)
   110 feet.         The lowest terrace       is 68 feet, the higher terrace about
   1 20 feet above the loch.
       Both terraces         appear    to be horizontal.     They can be traced for
   nearly    a  mile continuously.
       On the opposite or left bank of tho river                     no  corresponding
   terraces     are distinguishable.         That    side  of the valley consists       of
   nearly bare rock, and is almost vortical,                 so that there cannot be
   expected to be on           it any  trace of a beach line.
       Have these        terraces in   the Pass of Brander been formed by a lake
   or by the sea?          In   a lower part of the valley there is a large amount
    of detritus, and        it  reaches at some places to a higher level than the
    terraces.      The volley in that lower part is narrow, so that there
    might    have      been      a blockage for a      lake.     On the other hand,
    how can the granite boulders be accounted                   for which are on the
    terraces   1    If,   as seems most       probable, they have come from the
    north,    they must have been floated by ice on a current flowing
    from the      N.N.W.
       7.  Inveraray. — His         Grace   tho  Duke of Argyll (Nov. 1876)          con
    ducted the Convener to a             small hill, about 1000 feet above the        sea,

  668                Proceedings     of the Royal Society
 at a place     called   " Brae Leckan,"      7 miles west of Inveraray,            well
 covered    with angular boulders.          The boulders were          of   the    same
 nature as the rocks of the          hill — a dark    grey  porphyry.         But the
 boulders had evidently been transported to the             hill from some other
 place,   there   being no cliff from which            they could have           fallen.
 The Duke thought they had been floated from the eastward, and                         in
 that direction      certainly   the land was       lower than       in any       other
 direction.      But the Convener      observed    that towards the west there
 was an opening among the           hills low   enough     and wide enough for
 a current to have flowed to and over the           hill on which the boulders
 rested.
    8.  A few miles to       the north    of Inveraray     there   are some       huge
 boulders of a coarse conglomerate,           quite distinct from any          of the
 rocks in the immediate neighbourhood.              The rock of these boulders
 is a greenish or grey      coloured Silurian     rock full of quartz pebbles.
 One   of  these conglomerate      boulders, weighing about 60 tons, is on
 flat ground about 800 feet above the             sea,  and resting on gravel.
 Another,     10 x     x 7h feet    (weighing about 48 tons),           is on      the
 left bank of the River Arey, and about 180 feet above the                 sea.
    The gamekeeper,       who pointed out these boulders, said that there
 was no rock     of  the  kind composing      them, except at a place about 6
 miles due west.        Between that spot and the sites of the boulders
 there were several ranges      of hills  and valleys.
    When     the subject was mentioned to the        Duke of Argyll, he corro
 borated    the gamekeeper's      statement.     He informed the Convener,
 that there is conglomerate        rock, of the same character           as that of
 the boulders, on the         summit or      ridge between       Loch    Awe      and
 Loch Fine, which lies to the north-west of the boulders.
    On the tops of several of the hills to the north-west of Inveraray,
about 700 feet above the sea, boulders were noticed where                     it  was
 manifest,    from their peculiar position, that they could have got into
it only by coming from the         west.    Sketches of these were taken.
    9.  Oban    and Neighbourhood.      — (1.) At Dunolly,       close to the sea
shore, there is a grey granite boulder           12x8x6       feet.   It   is about
 20 feet above      high water, and rests on           an  old sea beach.          Its
longer diameter points W. by N.
    The nearest rocks of grey granite are in Loch Etive, situated to
the eastward.       There are ranges    of hills between Loch       Etive and     the

                        of Edinburgh, Session 1877-78.                       660
site of       the   boulder.    Moreover, the boulder is close       to  the foot
of    a high rocky cliff, which being on the east side of the boulder,
must have prevented the boulder reaching its site, except by trans
port from the westward, — probably the north-west, as the island
of Kerrera        is situated to the west and south-west,        and would   pre
 vent the boulder coming from that direction.
     The Convener was accompanied by a gentleman resident in                  the
 neighbourhood         (Mr Clerk), well acquainted with         the  Loch Etive
 granite, who expressed doubts whether the granite of this boulder
 was of a similar composition.
      (2.) The north part of Kerrera Island is strewed with numerous
 grey granite boulders, all well rounded.            Most of them are on the
  beach, and on the old terraces adjoining the beach.             There are some
  also, on Ballimore Farm, at heights of from 357 to 437 feet above the
  sea, on short terraces or flats of detritus facing the east and north-east.
       In  these cases there would be less obstruction to a transport from
  Loch Etive than in         the case   of the Dunolly boulder, but the range
  of hills    near Glenlonan, reaching heights of from 500 to 1500 feet,
  still   presents a difficulty.
       If  the  Dunolly boulder    came from a northern source, the Kerrera
  boulders probably came from the same quarter.
       (3.) On the hills to the east and north-east of Oban, there are
  numerous        boulders, chiefly of granite, whose position does not
   suggest one direction more than any other.
       The rocks of these hills being clay slate, the boulders on them
   must have been transported from some distant quarter.
       The granite is grey of different varieties,     and very like the Loch
   Etive granite.       But   there are others, with   large  crystals of quartz
   and felspar,     which betoken some other source.
       One of this    kind is on   a  hill to the south of the old public road
   between      Oban and Loch Etive, at a height of 530 feet above the
   sea.     It  is extremely angular, and rests on      a bare  rock of the hill.
   This position would most easily have been obtained by floating ice.
        Besides these granite boulders there are some of dark porphyry
    and of quartzite, which most probably come from the north.
        This conclusion is somewhat         strengthened by the circumstance
    that in this district, where      the rocks are smoothed and striated, the
    surface    of the rocks slopes down towards and faces the north, and

road before-mentioned.
   (4.) An angular boulder of grey granite, 11J x 1\ x 7 feet, occurs
at Inverlievern, on Loch Etive, above Bonawe Ferry.    This boulder
rests on three         or four smaller granite boulders, and these again                          on
bare granite rock.                 There is no         hill from which it could                 have
fallen.        It   must have been transported.                A   sketch was taken.
     It    rests on the 40          feet old sea-margin,           which is visible round
the greater part of Loch Etive.
   (5.) The Convener was informed of two very large boulders in the
district between Loch Etive and Glen Lonan, at places called Auch-
nacoshen and Duntarnichan.                       But   he was unable to reach them.
     10.    Fasnacloich on Loch Creran. — Captain Bedford,                         R.N.,      wrote
to the Convener, calling               his attention to a large boulder which he
had seen when surveying for the Admiralty.                           He   sent a description
of   it,   and mentioned that its average girth was 30 feet.
     The Convener            discovered the boulder.                It   had recently been
blown up into four or five fragments, with                          a    view to being used
for building          a   bridge.      But they         were     found unsuited          for     the
purpose,       being too hard for masons' tools.                   The rock consisted of           a
dark porphyry, with which the Convener was unacquainted.
     Mr Hall, the tenant of the farm of Fasnacloich,                      on which Captain
Bedford's boulder was situated, conducted the Convener to                                 a    spot,
about      a   mile higher up the glen, where there were multitudes of much
larger boulders of the same species of rock.                       The spot proved to be           a
mass       of detritus, consisting of water-borne gravel, forming a sort of
terrace abutting against the                hill, which forms the north-east side                 of
Glen Creran.              This   terrace   is   covered by numerous boulders, some of
very large size.            A    view of one of them        is   given in fig.     8,   Plate   I.
     This boulder           has the    Celtic name of " Fas-na-cloich," or " Fa*-
na-clach," which means                 " stone with growth," —
                                                               referring to three
trees growing on             it,
                              two on the top being firs (each about feet                  15
high), — one          at the side,  stunted oak.

occupied by           Mr Hall, and of       the residence of the proprietor, Captain
Stewart,        is   Fasnacloich, so-called, most probably, after the boulder.
     The boulder with the three trees on                  itis   about 25 yards in girth          ;
its length       is   23 feet, its width         15, and its height,      in   so far as visible
above ground,          is   15 feet.

                           of Edinburgh, Session 1877-78.                           671
     Another boulder,           a few hundred yards to the south, measured
(above ground)           18 x 18 x 12 feet.
      It   deserves notice that the sharpest end of each boulder points in
the       same     direction  — viz., about S.W.      (magn.)  — i.e., towards       the
mouth of Loch Creran.
      The     terrace on which these boulders lie, is about 290 feet above
 the     sea.
      Hall mantioned that, in             a  higher   part of Glen       Creran, the
 boulders are more numerous, and some of them larger than the two
 examined.
       All  the boulders appeared to be of the same species of rock.               Hall,
  who evidently had some practical knowledge of rocks, called it a
  black granite, and affirmed that there was no granite like it in all
  that district.        The rocks of the mountain on the opposite, or south
  side, of Loch Creran, rising steeply to          a height of above 2000 feet, he
  knew were         a  grey granite.    The Loch Etive granite, about four miles
  to the south, and the Durra granite, about eight miles to the east,
  being of a light grey colour, he had always wondered where these
   dark coloured boulders could have come from.
       The rocks in Loch Creran, and in the hills immediately adjoining,
   are a blue schistose        clay slate, with  a rapid dip.
       One     or two other points may here be noted,            communicated by
   Hall :—
       A small river runs into Loch Creran,           at its head, flowing out of a
   small fresh-water        lake, which is separated from the       sea  by a spit of
   gravel and sand, crossing         the valley, and cut through by the river.
   The sand, Hall stated, is full of sea-shells, and so is the bed of the
   lake, and even the channel of the river before reaching the lake.                    In
   this last-mentioned river, the shells are in         a bed of fine  clay — whitish
   in   colour, which is used as a manure for arable           land.      In  fact,  it  is
   this bed of shell clay which            originated the name
                                                                     " Crer-an,"      i.e.,
    " Clay," or " Chalk River."
        These     facts   indicate, of course,   a  period when the      sea   stood     at
    a  higher level — to the extent of        at least 20 feet, which is about the
    height of the shelly bed above             mentioned.      When     the sea   fell   to
    its present       level, a blockage of drift,       now between       the   sea   and
    the lake, caused        the lake to be formed, with an overflow by the
    river, which runs out of the lake into the sea.               There are several

672                         Proceedings of tlie Royal Society
other places           in the West Highlands                        where there are fresh-water
lakes close to the              sea,   formed in like manner.
     With       regard to the boulders,                    it occurred        to the      C on vener, judging
from their locality and their position, that they had probably                                                   been
floated up Loch Creran, and been then stopped                                        in their further             pro
gress by the contraction of the valley and the higher                                          level of the land
     But if they        were floated              up Loch Creran, from what quarter                                i.i 1
they come        ?     It   was natural to look to places facing the                                    mouth          of
Loch Creran,           if   in    these places there were mountains                                 composed           of
rocks similar in composition to the boulders.                                       The island of Mull,
situated to the         W.S.W. of Loch Creran,                            seemed therefore to be one
locality which might have supplied the boulders,                                          as   from    Mr Judd's
instructive paper on Mull,* describing numerous                                           varieties of granite
in the mountains of that island,                              it   appeared          likely that rocks of
the same character               as the Fasnacloich boulders existed there.                                     With
the view          of testing this                idea,      the    Convener sent                    specimens of
the       boulders to Professor                   Judd, who           he heard             had,       during the
past      autumn,       spent three months                         among        the        Mull mountains,
and asked him to state whether he recognised                                         the rock composing
these boulders as being identical with, or at                                       all    events     similar     to,
any of the       Mull rocks        1        Professor       Judd     was so obliging as to respond
to the application.
     With       the Fasnacloich              specimens,           there    went to Professor                   Judd
specimens         of   the rock composing two very large                                       boulders on the
shore      at   Appin, which rock                     the    Convener found on examination
to be the same as that of the Fasnacloich                                  boulders.               These Appin
boulders lie on upturned blue clay slate rocks.                                           Their      shape indi
cated that they had undergone great                                friction,         in consequence              pro
bably of being rolled over the sea-bottom by icebergs floating through
what was then               a    sea    strait, but now the Liunhe Loch,                                  and the
chain of lakes forming the Caledonian                                 Canal.              Sketches of these
Appin boulders              were taken.               The largest        is   15x11x10                feet.     Both
boulders are well rounded at the angles.
     Professor Judd's Report                     is   in   the following        terms          :—
     "Appin Boulders, No.                   1.— This rock           is    not   a   granite, but        a     rock of
basic composition.                It   appears to be           a   gabbro       with       some black mica.
It   is   very similar in character to the gabbro of Skye, Rum, Ardna-

there is          no room to doubt               it   was derived from one of these localities

Mull.             These rocks are of              a    striking       character,     and differ from any
which         I   know of on the mainland.                         I    think it is certain, they                 were
derived from the Western Isles."
   Professor Judd, in his paper                               on the ancient volcanoes of                     Mull,
Skye, and              Ardnamurchan,                  refers    to proofs that            these      volcanoes
reached           a    greater         height         above     the      sea-level      than any of the
 existing Scotch mountains, perhaps even to the height of 14,500
 feet,* and that " denudation
                              "
                                had acted to an enormous extent in
 breaking             up the old           volcanic           rocks and          lowering      their height.
 Professor             Judd      does    not particularly                specify the          nature         of    the
 denuding agent which he supposed produced                                       this effect.     But if           the
 sea with ice floating in                  it,   at   a   height of say 2000 or 3000 feet above
 the present               level, be allowed to be                 a    denuding agent,
                                                                                                it

 see       how the boulders of Appin and Fasnacloich,                              if   derived from Mull
 or Ardnamurchan, might have reached their present positions.
       The distance              of Appin and Fasnacloich                       from Mull and Ardna
 murchan              is   about 30 miles.                   The       intervening      sea    has       in    some
 places       a   depth of 100 fathoms.                        The island of Lismore, which                         is
 in this part of the Linnhe Loch, at one spot only reaches                                             a      height
 of 420 feet.               A    sea   current flowing across               Mull     and Ardnamurchan,
 towards and through what                         is   now known           as
                                                                                 " Glen   na   Albin," with
 mountains             on each side of the Glen reaching to 2000 feet above the
 present sea-level, might, by floating ice, have                                   carried     boulders and
 lodged them in lateral valleys, such as Loch Creran.
       11.    Crinan Canal. — At the summit level, about half-way between
 the two extremes,                 there     is   a    large    accumulation of boulders, chiefly
 angular          in   shape.          On the west side of the canal at the                          "   locks,"     a
 body         of rock        stands      up, whose             surfaces     facing the north present
 marks of abrasion as                   if   caused by some body or bodies passing over
 from the north.                  On the south side of this rocky knoll, lie                             a     num
 ber of boulders which,                    if    they came from the north on floating ice,
 may have been projected over the                                knoll by its intercepting                 the ice

the largest of the boulders is                     lying with its longer axis N. and                         S.,
or parallel          with       the    general       axis of the valley at this point.

from 140 to 150 feet above the present                                level.     On both            sides     of
the valley here there                 are horizontal            lines traceable        at that       height,

     12.    Island of May. — The Convener, in August 1877, paid a                                          visit
to this island, for the purpose chiefly of examining the famed raised
sea beaches on           the adjoining           island of Jura, and also               of inspecting
some boulders of which notice had been sent                               to him.
     (1.) On the farm of Lossit, about three miles south of Port Askaig,
there are four or five boulders of large size.    Only two were seen.
     One of these, 13 x                8   x   8   feet,    is   a   composite        rock      containing
crystals       of    quartz,      augite,        and hornblende.                The      stone       is ex
tremely hard         ;    it   was     with much difficulty that                 a    small specimen
was detached.              The boulder was resting on                    a     bed of bright yellow
clay, apparently          a    sediment of deep water.                  The rocks of the district
are   a     slaty schist.         On inquiry,          it    was      surmised that rock of                   a
similar kind existed near Kildalton, about 20 miles to the                                                S.E.
But doubt exists on this point.
     The other boulder, scarcely                   so large as the        foregoing, resembled                a
compact        Silurian rock, containing numerous crystals of                                   a   whitish
felspar.
     There was nothing to indicate how or from what                                      quarter these
boulders came.              Their height           above the sea was about 300 feet.
  (2.) On the farm of Arnahoo, about three miles north of Port
Askaig, and 228 feet above the sea, boulder stands conspicuously
                                                             a
on     the    summit of          a     hill in     a   position most precarious (fig.                         8,
Plate       III.).    The rock composing the boulder                           is a    hard porphyry,
quite different from the rocks of the hill on which                                             rests.      Its
                                                                                        is it
height above the sea                  is   228   feet, and the          hill itself             about      300
yards from the sea, towards which                          it   slopes very steeply.
     The boulder           is   not absolutely on the highest peak of the hill,
but   a     few feet below the peak, and on the slope which faces north
by east (magn.).                  The only          way in           which      the    boulder           could
have       stuck on this slope was by its coming right against                                       it,   and
being let down on               it    gently, i.e., without falling from                a    height.         It

                        of Edinburgh, Session 1877-78.                                      675
must have           come   in  a  direction     from N. by E.                If    floating ice
brought it — and          no other way is here conceivable              — from the south,
the boulder could not            have reached its present position.                   It  would
have stuck on the south side of the MIl.                   It   could not have reached
its position by          a  somersault      over    the  hill     top,     for the impetus
acquired by its fall would have projected it down the hill altogether.
      As bearing     on the direction from which this boulder may have come,
 it is   proper to add that towards the north-west there is                  a range    of hills,
 apparently much higher than 300 feet, whilst towards the north and
 north-east it is open        sea, and the     island of    Mull is in that direction.
      (3.) On the      farm of Persibus (occupied by Mr Rounsfell), about
 three miles S.W. of Port Askaig, four or five boulders, well rounded,
  occur,     and were seen.         They    are    all of   a   hard porphyritic           rock,
  differing from any of the            May    rocks.     Their height           above the sea
  was found to be about 228 feet.
      With     regard   to the probable line of transport to their positions,
  it   may be noticed that towards              N. by E.       there     is an opening          or
  depressed part of the country, through which                       the    boulders might
  have been floated to their sites.
      Mr Rounsfell pointed out            a very large boulder situated on                 a hill
  slope to the        north, about two miles distant, which, however, the
  Convener was unable to visit.                 But Mr Ballingall,              factor on the
  Islay    estate, has had the kindness             to examine         the boulder, at the
  request of the Convener, and he reports as             follows : — "Girth,           33£ feet    ;
   height,    11 feet ;  length,   12 feet ; breadth, 18 feet.          It   lies on clay slate
   rocks, and is all exposed to view.              Its  thickest end faces           S.W.      Its
   height above the        sea is   410 feet."      Mr Ballingall has            sent  with his
   letter   a small chip of the boulder.            It proves to be an           igneous rock,
   with much hornblende.              It has probably come from some northern
   region.      The weight of the boulder         Mr Ballingal        estimates at 25 tons.
       (4.) On the south side of the high road                   between        Bridgend and
   Port Helen a boulder rests at the foot of                    a   low hill which faces
   about due north.          The boulder is tolerably well rounded, and about
    7 feet   in  diameter.     It  is a stranger to this district.             Most probably
   it  came from the north          like  the rest, and was in its farther progress
   intercepted by the       hill  at the base of which        it  lies.     Its height     above
    the sea is about 50 feet.          (See fig. 10, Plate III.)
        (5.) On the west coast of Islay, in the parish of Kilcheran,

 676                   Proceedings         of the Royal       Society
 there are porphyritic          boulders lying on the blue slate rocks,               and so
 situated     as to make     it  clear, that they have been          brought     and  lodged
 there by some agency from the               N.W.
     Below the old parish church of Kilcheran                      a  small   stream joins
 the sea through a valley               in a direction       W.N.W.         (magn.).      The
 rocks on       the   south      bank of the        stream     are    ground down          and
 striated     in such     a   way    as   to show      that some        force   has    passed
 obliquely across the valley from             N.W.
     In   regard    to these Islay boulders, it is very apparent                   that   they
 have     all come      from the north — some of            them very       probably from
 Mull.       It  is also rather remarkable that the largest                should occupy
 sites very nearly on the same level, viz., 228                      feet above the        sea,
 a circumstance       suggesting      the same means of transport.               As  bearing
 on this last point,       it may     be observed,      that on various parts of            the
 Scotch coasts there are traces of old sea-beaches, at heights between
 250 and 500 feet above the present sea-level.
     13. On the Peninsula             situated between the        Firth of Clyde     (on     the
 east    side),   and Loch       Striven    (on the west       side),   there are several
 boulders of some interest.
     (1.)   At Dunoon          and    Kirn    there    are boulders       of  a micaceous
 sandstone      rock, all well rounded, lying             on the      edges of the blue
 slate rocks which          form the beach.           One has had painted              on     it
 the words       "Jim     Crow," being 15 x        8 x 6    feet; another, the words
 "John Bull," 15x12x6                 feet.
     It  was stated to the Convener by a local correspondent, that rock
 of the same nature           as   in these boulders occurs in the Holy Loch,
 situated     about   a  mile to the north-west
     Two of the boulders on this part of the beach are so fixed                         as to
 indicate from what quarter they must have come into their present
 position, viz., from the North.               Sketches of these were taken.
     (2.)   Along the shore towards Innellan there are numerous boulders
 differing from the rocks on which they lie.                       Some    of  these rocks
 show surfaces smoothed              and striated, the       striae   running    north-east
 and    south-west — a direction parallel with              the general line of coast
 Some local agency has, therefore,              probably been at work here.
     (3.) On the east shore of Loch Striven lies the large, well-rounded
boulder, called " Craig na Calleach," or "Stone of the Witch" — the
legend       being that in former times,              the witches inhabiting both

                      of Edinburgh,      Session   1877-78.                       677
banks of the loch, threw         these great stones    at one another.         It     is
said that on the west          bank of the loch, near Strome Point, and
almost immediately opposite to " Craig na Calleach,"                   there     is    a
boulder of about the same         size — which, however, the Convener             was
unable to go in search of.         "Craig na Calleach" is a compact           schist
of   a light   grey   colour, with thick nodules of quartz in it.                The
rocks of the beach on which the boulder lies are              a slaty schist of        a
greenish blue colour.         A sketch   was taken.
    (4.) On the farm of Ach-na-foud, situated about a mile from
" Craig     na Calleach," there is on the slope of a hill an angular
boulder.      It  is at a height of 222 feet above the          sea, and    on the
edge     or verge    of   a  precipitous bank.      It  rests partly     on    rock,
and is in a very critical position.        If the bank be now in the same
condition as when the boulder was deposited,             it must    have been let
down very gently or gradually, to avoid receiving an impetus which
 would have caused it to roll down the bank.              A sketch was taken.

    In  the parish of Dunse the boulder clay has lately been cut through
for   some hundred yards to make a new road, and to a depth of 8 or
 10 feet below the surface of the boulder clay.             Beds of gravel and
 sand lie over the boulder clay, in some places to the thickness of 12
 feet.    On an inspection by the Convener (November 1877), in com
 pany with Mr Stevenson, Dunse, boulders in the clay were recog
 nised as having all come from the west, chiefly W. by N.                         The
 Kyles Hill     and Dirrington Hills porphyries were among these               ;   the
 former    is  three    miles  W. by N., the latter six miles W.N.W.
There      were    also   sandstones    with fossils, which Mr Stevenson
 knew to have come from          a sandstone   rock   a few    hundred yards to
the westward,       and   which he pointed out to the Convener.                   The
fossils were      the   ordinary   plants of the     coal   formation,     and       an
annelid.

    1.  Loch Lomond.— The, large Mica schist boulder reported                to the
Committee by        Mr Jack,    and mentioned in the Committee's Second
Report     (Roy. Soc. Proc. for 1872-73,        p.  152), was visited by the
 Convener, in company with          Mr Smollett of Cameron House.                   Its
    vol. ix.                                                           4 u

678                   Proceedings      of the Royal Society
provincial name is
                          " Kerstone GaUoch" it is situated on the            farm of
Callendoon, and is about 150 feet above the                sea.   Its length     is 2 s
feet ; width 19 feet;         depth 12 feet
   It  is shown on fig. 11, Plate          III.,  with Mr M'Arthur,         tenant of
the farm, standing on it.
    Originally,     the boulder had been in a somewhat             higher    position.
A small    stream running past the boulder at its east side              had  washed
away part of the gravel bed on which             it had  been   resting, — so   allow
ing it  to sink.
   With    reference     to the quarter from which this boulder            was trans
ported,   Mr Jack      suggested that    if it came from the west,      it must   have
come over      hills from   1000 to 1200 feet     high; and therefore he thought
it more probable that        it had  been floated south down the valley now
occupied     by Loch Lomond, and then floated west up Glen Fruin.
    It appeared to the Convener, that the line of transport                was more
likely from      the westward.       The land towards          W. by N. (true),       is
on about the same level as the land to the north-east,                as shown       by
the contour lines on the            Ordnance maps of the district.             If   the
boulder came from the westward, there would be no obstruction to
its progress      in  a  direct line  ; whereas,     if it   came from the north
end of Loch Lomond valley, as suggested by                  Mr Jack, it must have
changed     its course to reach Callendoon.
    2. On a moor, about half a mile to the north east of the above
boulder, there are several          smaller boulders of mica schist, of the
shapes and sizes shown on fig. 12, Plate             III.
    It will   be observed that they      all occupy similar positions in respect
of their longer axis, and        their sharpest end.        Their height above the
sea is  about 250 feet.         The rocks of this district are Old Red Sand
stone.    There is much probability that these boulders had been left
here by floating ice, in a current flowing from the                  westward;     and
 that they acquired their bearings from the action of the current.
    3.  On the west side of Loch Lomond                 there   is at Arden a low
 valley, which runs up from the Loch in               a westerly direction.        The
summit level of this valley towards the west is about 150 feet above
 the sea.
    Along    the south side of this valley a number of bouldeis, chiefly
of primitive        rocks, have     been   deposited.      They    are at a height
of about 94 feet above the         sea.   As usual, the most frequent position

is here,     as  elsewhere,     N.W. and S.E. for       the longer axis, and the
sharpest      end towards the west.
      4.  In  the policy    of Cameron House       a boulder    of gneiss, 6 \x5   x 5
feet, is lying on gravel, and at a height of about 55 feet above the
lake, or 80 feet above the sea. Its longer axis is N.W. and S.E.
      5. There is a hill called " Caer-man," about 3 miles to the S.W.
of the south       end of Loch Lomond.           Its height    above the sea is 720
feet.       From its top,      a good   view is obtained of Helensburgh and
Greenock towards the S.W.
      The rocks      on the top of this     hill are a coarse porphyry.         Huge
fragments have been strewed in great abundance                    down the side of
the hill sloping        eastward,   and especially    S.E.    The unmoved rocks
 present their west surfaces rounded and smooth, their east surfaces
 angular and rough.
      On examining the separate blocks where heaped upon one another,
 it   was apparent that the uppermost blocks, to obtain their positions,
 must have been projected on the others from the westward.

      Linton.  — On      the farm of   Dry law,   a greenstone      boulder, 5£ x 3^
   x  3 feet, was   found in cutting     a deep trench through the boulder clay.
 The N.W. end was the most rounded.                    The longer diameter was
  N.N.W.      (magn).       There were no striae on the top, but there were
 horizontal striae on the two sides fronting              the  N.E. and     the S.W.
 These two sides met          in  an angle towards the     N.W.      H  a current had
  flowed from      W. by N. the current would divide at            the angle; and    if
  ice floated   in  the current, tho strife on the two sides might have been
  produced      by hard pebbles from the westward             pushed against them.
  The smoothing and striation on the north were greater than on the
  south side.       Close to the boulder there were pebbles             of limestone
  shale, sandstone,       and coal, which most probably came from the west
  ward.      The nearest greenstone rocks are on the Garlton hills, situated
  about 6 miles to       W. by N.      The boulder, therefore,        most probably
   came   from these hills.
      About half a mile to south, there are rocks (viz., in Linton vil
   lage,  and in   a  railway    cutting to the west), presenting smoothings
   and stria tions,     made    by some agent moving over them from W.
   by N.

   2.  In  Bogward Den     (Mr White Melville's property), 3 miles              west
of St Andrews, there is a boulder of conglomerate                rock.    Probably
it came from Drum Carro Craig, which is said to be same species of
rock, and situated some miles to           N.W.        The legend is, that        the
devil    threw it from that hill, when the first Protestant                  church
was being erected at     St Andrews.
   3.  At Kincraig, Fife,      there is on the beach          a granite    boulder,
with girth of 23 feet and height of              4  feet.      The lower half       is
angular, the upper half rounded.             Has this boulder been floated
from    westward,    and been       stranded    on    the   rocks at     Kincraig!
Stirling Castle, which      is visible, bears    W.    £   N.    But it probably

Kincraig rock     (a trap tuff), have      been carried eastward,        and   were
found in the cuttings made for the railway                 2 miles   distant from

   The Convener having been informed by the officers of the Ord
nance    Survey    that some remarkable horizontal terraces had                been
discovered    by them in Glendoe, a valley branching off from Glen
Morriston, on the north side of the Caledonian Canal, he took                    the
opportunity, when paying a visit to        Mr Ellice of Invergarry, of        going
to Glendoe.
   Under     the guidance of two gamekeepers             on the property of Mr
Grant of Invermorrison,        who reside      at  the    foot of Glendoe,       the
Convener proceeded to the head of Glendoe, the place                 indicated     in
his map by the Ordnance Surveyors.
   Unfortunately,     a heavy     fall of snow had (17th October 1877)
occurred    during   the  night preceding this visit, and it continued
during the expedition.

                      of Edinburgh, Session 1877-78.                            681
    There was at first some difficulty in making the gamekeepers com
prehend     the spot      wished to be reached; and it was not till the
party had gone some miles               up the valley of the Doe, that the
gamekeepers      began      to   see   what was sought       for  at the head of
the glen.     This   was brought about by the Convener drawing atten
tion,  as he proceeded       up the     valley, to two lines of   a terrace  or flat
noticed by him on        a  hill on the opposite      side of the river.    On his
asking the keepers, whether there were similar lines at the head of
the glen,   — still  about 6 miles       distant,  as they alleged, — the answer
was, that there were such terraces, and so remarkable,                that on one
occasion, when accompanying a shooting party, some of the gentle
men remarked,       that marks were there of Noah's flood           !
    The Convener was encouraged by this information, and in spite of
snow and wind continued his progress up the glen.
    The keepers stated that the marks to which they referred were on
" English Hill;    "
                       and that though this hill was rocky on some parts,
there was    a great deal    of sand and gravel near the top.
    Following up     the river Doe, a point was reached where             the river
divided into two branches,           and called by a Celtic       word meaning
"Tongue of the Burus."           The portion of the stream towards the right
has the name     of " Carriscreuch,"        or   " Middle Corry   ;
                                                                    "
                                                                       and it was
along that stream, flowing through what the keepers                   called " The
Long Glen," that " English           Hill"   could best be reached.        But  the
snow was here so deep, that no track was visible, and walking be
came dangerous,       at least to a stranger.
   At this point     a consultation was held.          The height above the      sea
reached was only about 850 feet, whereas the highest terrace marked
by the Ordnance Surveyors was 1280 feet, and apparently still about
2 miles further up the glen.
   The gamekeepers' advice was to abandon any hope of reaching the
terrace, and to be satisfied with a distant view of tho placo, which
could be obtained from a low hill in front.
   This low hill accordingly was ascended, and with satisfactory re
sults.   The hill itself was found to consist, as shown by numerous
scaurs,   of fine gravel and sand          ; and   on its flat top, the aneroid
showed    a height above the sea of 1190 feet.
   This gravel knoll       was as   it were   in  an amphitheatre of hills, on
several of which, towards the west, horizontal terraces were observed,

 682                Proceedings        of the Royal Society
at a somewhat      lower level.       These appeared to run continuously              for
about a mile.        On the opposite        side,   the   hill bearing about east
showed a short line at the same level.               Looking towards " English
 Hill"  on the   N.E.    no terraces were discernible;          the snow, owing         to
the direction of the wind (which was west), was so                thick on the slope
of the hill facing the knoll, that inequalities,              if any existed,       were
undiscoverable.        But   one   of the  keepers pointed in the       direction       of
the part of the     hill for the    terraces he had before        spoken of.         The
part so pointed out seemed to be about 2 miles distant,                   and at       an
elevation    of about 100 feet above the knoll on which the              party      were
then standing.
    The Ordnance Surveyors had marked on the Convener's map two
lines of terrace, one at 1280 and the other at 1140, as existing on a
hill  on the left side       of the Doe water.         Though, from the circum-
tances above     stated,    it  was impossible to make           out these terraces,
there   was enough       discovered     to show a line at the lowest         of these
levels   on the other       hills adjoining — and        the existence   of detritus
quite capable of being formed into a terrace at a much higher level.
One    of the keepers       stated   that on a hill towards the         N.W. there
were    beds of gravel and sand to the very top, and without                       any
covering of turf.        He pointed in        the direction of Ben Doe,        which
has an elevation of 2000 feet above the sea.
    The Convener having on his way up Glen Doe observed several
large boulders on the slope           of a  hill   above him on the       left hand,
resolved    to visit  them     on his way back.          So, accompanied      by    one
of the keepers, he ascended the hill, and in looking across the valley,
he discovered      four horizontal terraces on the opposite           hill, and    con
 tinuous for about half         a mile.    They were apparently on detritus,
for at one spot, where a rock projected,             there was an interruption.
    The uppermost terrace the aneroid showed to be about 985 feet
above the sea, the lowest about 895.
    The first of the boulders visited was 919 feet above the                sea.     Its
dimensions, roughly measured, were              14 J   x   11J   x 7 feet.    It   was
a coarse   reddish granite,       and very angular.        It could not have been
rolled or pushed.        It   seemed to bave been carried from its             parent
rock, wherever that was, without undergoing any change                      of   form.
It  was resting on gravel and sand.
    The next boulder reached was at a height of                1 204 feet above     the

                    of Edinburgh,         Session 1877-78.                         683
8ea.    It also  was a coarse red granite.        It was about 30 yards      in girth,
and 14 or 15 feet in height.            It  is known as    " The Glen Morrison
Stone," probably because of being the largest boulder in the glen.
   This boulder is        on a flat,    and in looking across the valley,              a
terrace is seen which corresponds            in level with  the boulder.
   In   several parts of the    hill  the boulders were     in  clusters  or groups,
piled over one another.
   It  deserves notice that all these boulders were resting on gravel
and sand    ;  and that the hills on both sides of the valley were thickly
covered    with detritus.
   The gamekeepers spoke of a very large boulder at Clachnaharry,
about    16 feet  high, on the south side of Loch Clunie, which is two
or three miles to the west          of Glen       Doe.   The Convener          saw    it
through his glass.
   It   may be added here,         that    Mr Ellice of Invergarry informed
the Convener of       a large bed    of pure white sand, which he could not
distinguish     from   sea   sand, existing on a property belonging to him
in that district,   at a height of about 1000 feet above the sea.
                                  MID-LOTHIAN.
   1.  In  September 1877 the Convener visited excavations on the
north side of Craiglockhart Hill, about two miles S.W. of Edinburgh.
His attention was drawn to them by Mr Hutchison of Carlowrie.
   These excavations wore           in    the    boulder  clay.     A number of
boulders had been          exposed,     and were still undisturbed          in their
original positions.
   The largest was angular, the smaller boulders were comparatively
round. The greatest number were of blue whinstone rock.                  Among the
smaller boulders, there were some of sandstone.                The contractor for
a large new      building about       to be erected being present,          had     his
attention     drawn to the       sandstone      boulders, and was asked          if he
knew any rock of tho same kind which was in sufficient quantity to
be quarried    1   He  said that the sandstone        of Hailes Quarry and Red-
hall Quarry was the same rock            as   that of the boulders.       On being
asked to point out the direction of these quarries from where the
boulder lay, he pointed in a direction which was                  N.W. (by        com
pass).*
     *                  are about a mile distant from the site of the boulders.
       These quarries

 684                         Proceedings of the Royal Society
         The height of these boulders above the sea is about 340                                      feet.
         2.   At Granton' Harbour (on west                        side) a very large              blue whin-
stone boulder lies on the beach                           at high-water           mark, part of which
only is visible, the rest being covered and concealed by the sea wall
which protects              the road.           On the upper surface                    of this        boulder,
there          are innumerable             striae, the         direction       of which is          W.    3° S.
(magn).
         About      100 yards to              the eastward,           there is another              whinstone
boulder having an iron ring in                           it,   by which boats or vessels may                   be
moored.             There are        striae    on   it   running in the same direction.
         Between these two boulders there are some strata of hard sand
stone rock, portions of which                            have    been      ground down and show
striations running also as above.
         3.   In   the New Docks, situated to the eastward                              of   Leith, there      is
an immense bed of boulder                           clay, which         continues along the coast
eastwards            for some miles.
         This boulder        clay at the Docks                  is   covered     by   a     muddy sand in
horizontal beds about                  8      or 10 feet thick.            On the surface               of    the
boulder clay there               is   a    bed of oyster shells, of large size.                      There     is
as       usual on the surface of the boulder clay                          a    great     accumulation of
boulders, these having remained                                when the upper portion of the
boulder            clay    bed       was      washed       away by the               sea.        Most of the
boulders are well rounded.                          The largest      I   saw,    a   light coloured       blue
whinstone, measured                   10x8x6             feet, and was estimated                 to weigh 18
tons.          About nine-tenths of                  the boulders are whinstones, but there
are also some of quartz,                      limestone,        sandstone,       silurian, granite, and
black ironstone concretions from beds                                  of shale.            These boulders
have          evidently come from the westward.                           On     a    great      many, there
are       ruts or striae      .all   maintaining the same direction, viz.,                         W. by N.
(magn.)             Those which are longer than they are broad, have their
longer axis          in    the same direction.
     Among           the    boulders, there were                     two metallic in composition,
which deserve special notice.*
      One, nearly spherical, measures                      7
                                                           J     inches in circumference, and

          The Committee       have to thank           Mr Hugh Campbell, who                 is   professionally
engaged in the formation of these new docks, for bringing to them the two
remarkable  balls here referred to, as well as for affording to the Convener
opportunities for seeing the excavations.

                        of Edinburgh,        Session     1877-78.                       685
weighs      24*oz.     It  was found       about    i\  feet   down in the boulder
clay,     among the large boulders.
      The other ball     was   even more spherical, its least girth being 30
inches,     and its greatest 31 inches.           Its weight      was 54 lbs.        It  was
found      10 feet below the top of the boulder clay.
      Professor    Crum Brown           (Edinburgh      University)       was so obliging
as to examine          both of these balls for specific gravity and composi
 tion.      He reports     that the smallest        ball is marcasite or white iron
 pyrites, and that its specific gravity is           4 -03.     It  is entirely     of  pure
 ore, being apparently unmixed with any other substance.
      With    regard to the larger ball, the Professor has sent the follow
  ing report : —
      " The fragment of the         large round stone which           I  took for exami
  nation had      a specific  gravity of 3'36.        It  consisted      of a mixture of
  silica (not obviously crystalline) and iron pyrites, in the following
  proportions :—
       " Calculating from these numbers and the                            it is plain that
                                                               sp. gr.,
   the pyrites must be in the ' marcasite ' form,                  '           '
                                                               as    pyritc      would give
   a  considerably higher sp. gr.
       " The   sp. gr. of the whole stone, i.e., the mean sp. gr., was found
   to be 3 -28.     It  cannot, therefore,      be a uniform mixture."
       Mr Murray having kindly              offered   to examine, microscopically,
   this large stone ball, has sent the following report                : —

       " Dear Sir,    — The microscopic        section    of the boulder is made up
    of crystalline particles of quartz and marcasite.                 The marcasite fills
    the interstices between       the grains     of quartz; and among the quartz
    there are pieces    of  mica.                 (Signed)           John Murray."
       The Convener paid two visits to the excavations in the boulder
    clay at  Leith  to examine       the spot where      these two remarkable balls
    were   found.     He saw the superintendent, who was directing the
    excavations,   and also the       "navvy" who found          the larger ball.        The
    latter pointed to a whinstone boulder, and                said the       " big bullet   "
    was close to   this boulder.

   686                     Proceedings       of the Royal Society
       There can         be  no    doubt     that both balls       had come with           the
  boulders, and had been deposited                 with them in the           great   bed of
  clay which covers the rocks in this district.                    This bed extends         for
  fully half       a   mile on each side of the Water of Lcith at its mouth,
  and reaches to a depth             in  some places of nearly 100 feet.
       The black ironstone concretions found in this boulder clay                          bed
  show marks of friction.                There are strata of shale containing such
  concretions,        two or three miles to the westward.             These concretions,
  as    well    as    the   boulders      of granite and       quartz,     clearly indicate
 transport on          a large scale    from the westward.
       The Convener learns from              Mr Robertson, C.E., Albany Street,
  Edinburgh          (who planned both the Albert Docks at Leith, exe
 cuted some years ago, and                the new docks now being constructed),
 that similar metallic balls were found in the Albert Docks excava
  tions.       But he has no specimens of them.*
      *
        Since the foregoing     was written, the Convener has received from Mr Charles
 W. Peach,        of 30 Haddington Place, Edinburgh, a letter regarding marcasite
 nodules,      from which letter, with Mr Peach's permission,                 the following
 extracts arc made :—
      "In   the  Falkirk and Slamannan district a band of these          nodules,   known    as
  '
    Speckled    Bull Ironstones,' occurs.      It occupies a horizon a   few fathoms above
 that of the ' Slaty Band Ironstone,' the base of the Coal measures.
      " The direction of the stria: on the rocks and the carry of the boulders and
 boulder     clay is towards the east, and varies from E. 10° N. to E. 15' N.
      " Near Kilsyth, and about 2 miles to the west of that place, the tributaries
 of the Corrie burn cross an area of blue shales, with several courses of
 ironstone      nodules.     Some of these are of iron pyrites (marcasite),           and aie
 known among the mining population as 'brassy balls.'                       They occupy a
 horizon between the Hosie and Hurlet limestones, near the base of the
carboniferous       limestone   series.
     "The direction of        the striae and carry     of the boulders    in this district    is
 E. or E. 5° N.
     "  Either of these sources could supply balls at Leith, as they are right in
the direction of the ice-flow.
     "  As to conrrctionary balls in sandstone, — there is on the coast of East Lothian
near Cockburnspath, to the north of Cove, a cliff of calciferous sand*tone
full of spheroidal concretions, which weather out on the wasting of the cliff by
the sea, and being harder than the matrix, they lie piled up in great numliers
at the base of the cliff.        Many of them are of very large size.
     "Similar concretionary balls occur in sandstone rocks at Grange Quarry
near Burntisland, from whence, no doubt, the ball found lately at Leith was
carried.                                              (Signed)
                                                                       " C. W. Peach."
     This    information in regard to marcasite brassy balls, the Committee
deems highly interesting.             If the marcasite ball found in the boulder clay
at Leith, was transported          from any part of the district situated to the north

                            of Edinburgh,        Session 1877-78.                        687
      4.  At Alnwick Hill,           near Liberton Church, at an elevation of about
350 feet          above     the sea, extensive      excavations      have    been made in
the boulder           clay for the new Edinburgh            water-works.      The boulders
consist chiefly of fragments of rocks, which are known to be in situ
situated in districts of the country to the west and north-west. The
great majority of              the boulders are of hard red sandstone             rock, such
as occurs           at Grange and         Merchiston, to the west of Edinburgh,
though         these places         are at a lower level.         There are boulders of
 marine limestone,               similar to rocks of that description in Linlith
 gowshire.            There is an immense           quantity of blue-coloured          green
 stones and dark-coloured basalts,                  and also buff-coloured felspathic
 rocks.        There are some small boulders of pure quartz, which pro
 bably hail from the Silurian rocks to the north-west of Callendar
 and Doune.
       Many of        the boulders occupy positions,           present    shapes, and bear
 marks of some interest.
       The largest seen by the Convener were about                      7   feet long by 4
  feet wide, and          2A    thick or deep.
       The boulders were all well rounded and smooth, but more                            par
  ticularly      so on     what had been the upper and the under sides.
       Mr Black,        the superintendent of the excavations,               being aware of
  the interest        attaching to the position of the boulders and the strue
  on them, had,            with     a compass,     ascertained     that the long-shaped
   boulders,        before    being moved,      generally were lying in directions
   varying       between       W.N.W.      and   N.W.     ;  that the   striae,  when such
   existed, were         almost     always   parallel with       the longer axis of the
   boulder     ;   and that there were striae, sometimes              only on the upper
   side, sometimes          only on the lower side, sometimes               on   both sides.
   In   one   of the boulders,         well rutted on the under side, he had                re
   marked that the ruts were              deepest     at the east end of the boulder,
   and that they gradually diminished in depth and numbers towards
    the west.        This    feature might be accounted           for on the supposition
    that the boulder, whilst             being pushed forward, encountered               hard
    obstacles     which       produced    deep ruts on the boulder when the               first
     of Glasgow,     as suggested by Mr Peach, what was the transporting agent to
     suit those    localities f A glacier moving from west to east by the action of
     gravity would be hardly conceivable.         The levels preclude that agent.        A sea
     current, loaded with floating ice,      seems  a  more  probable conjecture.

contact        took place, afterwards the boulder                        would       rise    over these
obstacles,         and in consequence                 the striae produced by them would
diminish in depth.
      5. Tynecastle,       near Edinburgh.            —A         basalt boulder,     4i x    4 x   2 feet,
was discovered,             striated on both upper and under side, but the ruts
were much deeper                 on the          under side.          The under side ruts had
begun to be formed at the east end of boulder, — the striae on the
upper side begun                 at    the      west end.            This might            be accounted
for by supposing that the boulder                                 had been pushed towards                the
east over          hard rocks,            and     that      floating ice        from the westward
had         pushed stones         over the upper surface.                      The    smallest end of
boulder pointed towards west.                             The sides of the boulder were well
rounded.
      This boulder lay in             a   hill of muddy            sand containing many pebbles
of all kinds, hard and soft, such as quartz,                            shale, and coal.        Height

      At    the east end of the town of Peebles there is a boulder                             of white
quartz, about 3 feet long, 21 feet broad, and with a girth                                   of about     7
feet.        It   is now    built into       a wall.             Previously to its being thus dis
posed of, the stone stood from time immemorial in an adjoining low
hill, which in consequence                      had   obtained the popular name                    of   the
" White Stone Knowe."                        It    is alluded        to as a   boundary stone in a
title deed dated in 1436.                    Mr Richardson,             the Secretary       of the Edin
burgh Geological Society, who was the first to take public notice of
this boulder, says that " the nearest beds of quartz are about 80 miles
to the       N.W."         The boulder on its surface is smoothed and polished.
It    is,   like many other boulders, rudely pointed at one end, whilst the
other extremity            is   more      broad and heavy.                The height above the
sea    is   550 feet.—      Ed.       Geol. Soc. Trans., vol. ii.              p.   397.

     Loch Tay. — On the farm of Morenish, situated on the north
      1.
bank of the lake, and about miles from the village of Killin, there
                                                 2
are several boulders worthy of notice.
     Figs.    13, 14, 15,       Plate     II.,    are intended to show the positions and
specialties        of these boulders.                They were at        a   height of about       1    400
feet above the sea, assuming Loch Tay to be 300 feet.

     These boulders had all come from the westward, viz., down the
valley,     as   shown by the way in which they were fixed.
     If   the question be, whether                                they were         brought            by glacier or
by floating          ice,      the      answer              is,   that there          is     not much evidence
either way.              It   may however be remarked,                             that    if   they were pushed
forward by           a   heavy glacier,                it   is    odd that the boulders should not
have been carried further down the valley, and that the obstructions
on their         east side, against which they have stuck, should not have
yielded under the pressure                             of   a     ponderous           glacier.         The boulders
in    figs. 13 and 14 were resting on detritus, and                                              pressing     against
detritus         only on their east sides.                               The boulders in fig.                 15    was
pressing against              a   hard rocky stratum of clay slate on its                                 east side.
     In   several parts of the hill, smoothed                                 rocks of mica schist occur,
with knobs of quartz standing up                                   above the general surface.                     Being
harder than the mass of rock, they had resisted the friction                                                  better   ;
these knobs were smoothed,                             the smooth             parts      being always on the
west sides.
     Fig.     16, Plate           III.,      shows          a     rock with joints.                 The projecting
angles      facing the west have been smoothed                                         by some abrading and
grinding force.
     2.   Glen Dochart. — There are many boulders of considerable size,
resting on detritus, and chiefly on the south side of the valley.
     One near an old toll-bar measured,                                  in   so far as above the ground,
 13 x 12 x       8   feet, at      a    height of 630 feet above the                            sea.
     At     the small farm- house of Wester                                 Lix,    at   a   height of 660 feet
above the sea, there                   is   a   flat    or terrace, partly rock, partly detritus,
on which           there       are      several         large          well-rounded boulders, two of
 them     a   coarse granite,               probably from Ben Cruachan.
     On ascending              the      hill towards                   the south,        a   boulder,     12x9x5
feet, was met with, at                      a     height of 1116 feet above                            the sea.     Its
 longer     axis bore             E.   h     S., which             is   also the         direction of the axis
 of the valley           in this        place.          There being no rocky hill near, from
 which this boulder could have come,                                     it   has certainly been brought
 to the spot where             it      now lies, by some transporting agent.
     At   the height of 1250 feet there                            is   a   mass of rock on the same side
 of the valley, and nearer the top                                of   the ridge,        which has on        it    some
 noteworthy marks.                     The rock stands out prominently, and forms                                      a
 nearly vertical cliff, as shown                            in     fig. 17, Plate            III.       On the side

690                    Proceedings        of  the   Royal Society
facing the west, there are horizontal groovings, apparently                      formed
by some force,        which, acting on the whole mass, has worn down
certain   portions more than others,               these portions     being less    com
pact, and so more capable           of abrasion.
    Such abrasion might have been effected by a body of water passing
from the westward         ;  and more readily, than by the solid               ice  of   a
great glacier.
    On the top of the ridge forming the south bank of this valley
  (GlenDochart),      a  cairn stands at        a  height of 1500      feet above the
sea.    A boulder of considerable            size lies on the top of     this ridge,   on
the east side of a projecting knoll.               Has the boulder been stranded
on what was the lee side of the             knoll   ?
                                        UOSS-SHIHE.
    At Auclinasheen        (Dingwall and Strome Ferry Railway,) there is a
boulder about 15        feet in girth, which stands on a flat of detritus
about 610 feet above the sea.
    In this district,     there    are several      other detrital flats, in sight of
this one, all nearly on the same level.                 There can be no doubt that
these flats have been originally one continuous plateau, which formed
a sea-bottom.      It  has been cut through by several streams, the banks
of which, about 18 feet high, show an enormous                       accumulation       of
gravel and     sand; — sand,       below (deposited probably when the water
was deep)    ;  gravel,     above (deposited when the water was shallower
and more subject to currents).
    The annexed diagram represents              a portion of these remarkable flats,
— cut through by         several streams, the principal of which flows from
Loch Rosque, — situated            to the north of the boulder.             The knobs
on the woodcut are intended to represent                  knolls of gravel or sand —
remnants      of  a  greater      mass     of these      materials.    The boulder      is
well rounded, and it has evidently come from                    a distant quarter.
                                                                            * that the
    Professor Nicol of Aberdeen has expressed an opinion
 formation of these Auchnasheen terraces is due to the action of a
 great river flowing from the west.               I   regret to differ on this point
from   a geological     friend;     but  I  can see no grounds for that opinion.
    To the east of Auchnasheen, close to the railway, there are several
spots of rock evidently rounded by                friction — whether by      ice or by
                         *

is about 780 feet.       On the hills, on each side of the railway, there
are traces of horizontal lines on the detritus, which deserve bet ter
observation than could      be  given from the railway carriage.

    1. On Slicriffnniir,  3 miles from Bridge    of Allan,  near Blackford,
 there is said to be a large boulder, called Wallace's     Putting  Stone.
                              NORTHUMBERLAND.
    It was   intended that only Scotch boulders should be inquired
 after by the Committee ; but it is not irrelevant to notice a
 boulder which, though now in England, was probably transpoited
 from a Scotch mountain.
    In Chillingham Park,      the  seat of the   Earl of Tankerville, near
 Alnwick,   there are several small boulders of granite.       The rocks of
 the immediate    neighbourhood are carboniferous sandstones and lime
 stones.   The nearest point for granite is the " Big Cheviot," eight
 miles to the   W.N.W., and reaching       a height   of about    1800   feet
 above the sea.    The largest boulder is      3 feet  2 in   length, 2 feet

 6*92                  Proceedings       of the Royal Society
 4  in width, and     2 feet   high.      It   is round in shape, and about 400
 feet above the sea.
     Several valleys and ridges of           hills lie   between   Chillingham     and
 the Big Cheviot, across which the boulder must                    have been trans
 ported to reach its present site.
 Remarks         by David       Milne       Home,       LL.D., Convener of         the
        Society's Boulder Committee, on presenting                      the Commit
        tee's    Fourth    Report at         a   Meeting of the Society, 20th
        May 1878.
     1.  In  presenting   a Fourth Report from the Society's Committee              on
 Boulders,     I  may be allowed,      first,    to refer  to the   main object for
which the Committee          was appointed.
    It  was to collect data which might help towards               a  solution of the
problem,      by what agency boulders in Scotland had been transported
from the parent rocks to the positions they now occupy.
    The Transactions of the Society contain                   numerous     papers   by
eminent geologists on this question.
    At    a very early period,        Sir James Hall, when           he drew atten
tion    to many large boulders,           and also to the remarkable appear
                                    "
ances called "crag and tail             in the midland districts of Scotland,
ascribed both sets of phenomena                to the    agency of great bodies of
water, which had passed over the country from west to east.
    At    a  later period      (about     the     year   1842),   Agassiz and      Dr
Buckland started        the   idea,    that     as  in  Switzerland,     glaciers had
been the means of carrying masses of rock from the                   Alps   across the
valley of Geneva to the Jura mountains,                  so there  might in former
days have been glaciers in Scotland producing similar effects.
    More recently     a  third theory was started,         — that if   the sea stood
several hundred feet above its present level, floating ice might have
been    the means      of transporting the boulders,            and   carrying them
great distances.
    2.  There being thus three            different theories     of transport, each
supported      by eminent geologists, the Committee has endeavoured                 to
gather     facts  to ascertain    which       theory is the      most    probable, or
whether any better can be suggested.
   I do    not presume to say that the information contained in this and

                              of Edinburgh, Session 1877-78.                                                 693
the previous Reports will                       yet allow the problem                         to be solved.
But       at all events it may be conceded that some new facts have been
ascertained,            which throw considerable                light on the question.
     I    venture        to    indicate what appear to me                          to    be     several      con
clusions         warranted,          though in          doing         so    I    offer     only my own
opinion.            Perhaps the           Committee,            after        more        information            has
been obtained,                may    be induced to consider                  whether they will pro
nounce on the                  various questions            of interest            which the              subject
presents.
     I    confine       myself this evening to only                        a few points,           and chiefly
to illustrate what occurs in our last Report.
     3.       The boulders referred to in the Report may be divided into two
classes.
     First, There         are boulders which, from the nature of the rock com
posing         them, are so      soft and friable, that they could have been trans
ported only              short      distances   — such      as        sandstone,          coal, and shale.
In    the Report, examples are given of such boulders,                                     from Berwick
shire and Mid-Lothian.
     The second class of boulders, namely,                                  such    as     are ascertained
to have          come from remote               quarters,       are    composed            of rocks, hard,
compact,          and homogeneous               in composition;                 such as basalt,            green
stone, granite,           felspar, quartz, greywacke,                  and old conglomerate.
     Boulders of these rocks have been found even                                   as    far   as 80 or 100
miles from the parent                  rocks; and, generally speaking, they are well
rounded, presenting evidence of enormous friction undergone whilst in
transitu; and even in some                      cases   acquiring almost                 a spherical       shape.
     Specimens           of small spherical             boulders           are now on the Society's
table.
     There are, however,               exceptions        to the rule that boulders of hard
compact           rocks are generally well rounded.                             Cases      of boulders of
these hard          rocks occur          extremely        angular in shape.                     Examples        are
 shown in this Report, by the lithographs appended                                            to    it,   and    in
 previous         Reports.          These angular boulders are almost invariably at
 Iti'lh levels, on the sides of mountains or near their tops.                                          The well
 rounded          boulders       are generally at low                 levels, and most frequently
 imbedded           in boulder clay.
         4.   It will   be asked, whether the Committee                          has in any case ascer
 tained the parent               rock from which            a   boulder has come.

    The answer is, that the Committee can in no case point out                                               the
particular rock from which a boulder had originally been broken                                              off.
All they          can affirm             is,   that in several cases they have ascertain^                     i
the district or quarter from which the boulder must have come.
     (1.)   For        example, in Berwickshire,                   as   will   be seen from           this   last
Report and the second                              Report, particular hills are specified from
which        boulders must have come.                             The direction             in which         they
came, and the number of miles traversed, are therefore in these                                             cases
matter of certainty.                    In     every case over the whole county                 of Berwick,
from its lowest to its highest level, the direction of transport                                                 is
from points between W. and N.W. (magn.)
     The same           is   the case in            Mid-Lothian.          The sandstone boulders                 at
Craiglockhart                are shown to have most probably                             come    from rocks
situated      a    few miles to the                 N.W.        The quartz      and other hard rock
boulders at the same place, as also at Liberton and at Leith, in like
manner probably came from points between                                       W.    and    N.W.
     (2.)    The two remarkable                      spherical balls of marcasite, found in the
boulder clay at Leith and mentioned in this Report, must in like
manner            have       come       from the           westward         A       presumption to that
effect arises, from the mere fact that they are                                     in   the same         bed of
clay which             contains granite and other Highland rocks.                                    But   there
is    more than presumption.                              Mr Peach having indicated                        where
pyrites balls might                     be found in situ, viz., at Campsie                     and Kilsyth,
I    went to Campsie last week, and on inquiry was shown some thin
strata of coal, abounding                      in nodules of pyrites,           several of the nodules
so large          as to      weigh half              a   cwt.    The coal      is   worked for burning
limestone.             It    is   too   full of sulphur for          domestic        use.     Specimens of
th   is   coal,    with      the pyrites nodules which                    I     obtained on the spot,
are now on the table of the Society.
     Kilsyth       I         did        not visit,         because      the overseer            at    Campsie
told me that he had worked at Kilsyth, and that there were pyrites
nodules in the coal strata there, similar to those at Campsie, but
of rather smaller size.
     Some         of   the nodules which              I     obtained at Campsie            I   submitted to
Professor Crum Brown, that he might examine them to see whether
they contained " marcasite."                              He    has reported to me as follows                :—
"These nodules                     have        a4-12, and consist of

Deducting         the coaly matter,                the iron and sulphur                           would bo in the
                  in which they are generally found in                                       '
proportions                                                                                      marcasite,' viz.,
                        " Iron, 45-61; and Sulphur, 54-29."
As    regards      chemical compositions,                                  therefore,       the small         metallic
boulder may be considered                          as        exactly agreeing                    with   the   nodules
found in the Campsie coal strata.                                      This       agreement in composition
affords     a strong ground                   for inferring                  that the boulder had been
transported from Campsie,                          or from                 Kilsyth,     as       suggested     by      Mr
Peach.
     With      regard    to the     larger spherical ball found in the same bed of
boulder clay at Leith,               I   am now able also to indicate the part of the
country from which it was probably transported.                                                     Mr Hutchison
of Carlowrie, happening to                      see         this stone ball, informed me of two
quarries       in Linlithgowshire                          where       concretions resembling it were
in abundance.             These          quarries are near                         Humbie           and Dalmeny,
situated       from nine to ten miles due west from Edinburgh.                                                         Mr
Hutchison         having sent to me several                                   of these           concretions,    I    was
induced to visit Dalmeny Quarry.                                       I    found in the sandstone                    rock
there,     numerous           concretions of all sizes up to nearly                                       4   feet      in
diameter.         Humbie Quarry                    I       did not visit,          as the        working of it had
been      given up,           and it was                    full of         water.          A concretion from
this last mentioned quarry, sent to me by                                         Mr Hutchison, Professor
Crum       Brown         has       examined,                 with           the   following  result : — " It
weighs      17|   lbs.        It   consists        externally of a thin shell of sandstone,
and      internally      of a mixture of quartz and marcasite,                                           closely re
sembling        the substance                of the large                  ball from Leith.               The mean
 specific gravity of the ball was 3-49."
     There is thus        a   sufficient similarity of composition in regard to the
 stone ball and the Humbie concretions,                                      to make         it exceedingly           pro
 bable that these             H umbie          sandstone               rocks supplied the stone ball.
 I do    not    say that Humbie Quarry was                                    the exact spot from which
 the stone ball found at                     Leith actually                 came.       The sandstone            strata
 which occur at Humbie         Dalmeny of course crop out elsewhere
                                             and
 in the district near South Queensferry ; all that can be said  that                                            is,

696                         Proceedings          of the Royal Society
the stone ball may have come, and most                            probably came, from some
part of that district.               Mr Peach mentions in his letters, quoted in
the Report of the Committee,                     that similar concretionary balls occur
in sandstone rocks near Burntisland, and suggests that the ball in
question came from that quarter.     In that case, the direction of
transport would            be   from about due N.                If   the stone came from near
South Queensferry,               the direction would be from                         W.N.W., which
last would be more in accordance                      with   the evidence              of direction        in
dicated by many other data.
      Assuming, then,           as   most probable,          that the large stone                  ball,    as
well       as the small     metallic ball found in the Leith boulder clay, came
from parent rocks, situated to the westward, the next question                                         will
be,    by what agency were they transported                           ?
      Mr    Peach, in his letter, apparently assumes, as matter                                  of course,
that these balls were transported   by the agency of                                 ice.       But " ice "
in what form ? — land-ice, or sea-ice ?
      If   the    metallic boulder came from Campsie,                             the distance over
which it travelled to Leith could not have been less than 30 miles                                              ;
and as the Campsie               coal strata       are only about               150 feet above             the
present sea-level, there would not be gradient sufficient for a glacier
either to carry on its surface, or to push before                                it,   debris of rocks
from Campsie              to Leith.        Moreover, Leith                is   not at or near          the
mouth of any valley which could create or guide                                  a   glacier from the
west of Scotland.
      But there          are in the Campsie            and       Kilsyth districts marks                    of
various kinds, indicating the action                        of   a    deep-sea current               These
marks        it   is   proper   to notice,       as   having an important bearing                          on
the general question of boulder transport.
   Mr John Young of Glasgow, in the year 1868, wrote an in
structive paper in the "Transactions of the Glasgow Geological
Society," on the       of Campsie.
                           geology   He says (page  — " There                               i)
                                                                                            1
are few       localities in the central            district of Scotland, where such                        an
extent of polished and striated rock surface                               is   to be seen, as along
the flat summits of the                  south    hill of    Campsie.             The       striae vary in
their direction from                 a   few points north of west to south of                        west,
according         to the deflection        of the ground         ;— many         tracts of the sand
stone rock,            still showing       the    channelled markings in great perfec
tion," at about           GOO feet above the sea.

                    of Edinburgh, Session 1877-78.                                      697
    Mr Young then        refers    to     the   Strathblane       Valley,      which     lies
between the north and south          hills of Campsie, and to the appearances
indicating that it had been
                                       " swept by powerful currents
                                                                                  of water,
which have helped to produce those inequalities                       of surface        seen
along the outer margin of the tracts now occupied                         by the rivers
Kelvin and Glazert.         It  was during         the period      when Scotland sat
several hundred feet lower         in     the sea than       it  does at present, and
when the valley of the Kelvin existed as a deep sound connecting the
 German and Atlantic Oceans, that those great beds of stratified
sand and gravel were deposited which                   we now see        filling up      the
 Strath (as near the village of Torrance) to more than 100 feet above
the level of the river.          At other points along its course, similar
deposits exist to more than              100    feet    below the present         sea-level.
This shows that      a very deep sound             or valley must have originally
extended across Scotland, previous             to the   glacial period, in this parti
 cular direction.     A  depression        of the land to the extent of 350 feet
 would produce      the   following        results   : — The German and Atlantic
 Oceans would be       united by the valley of the Kelvin, also by the
 valley of the Leven, Loch Lomond, and onwards by the low ground
 near Kippen to the Forth at Stirling.                 A narrow sound         through     the
 Campsie valley would connect               the two seas,       as  the water-shed         at
 Ballagan    Bridge is only 330 feet.               The (Jampsie       and Kilpatrick
 hills  would thenfonn      two islands, and the valleys of the Carron and
 the   Endrick would      be   estuaries or arms          of the   sea.     It  is only by
 assuming conditions such as these, that we can hope to explain the
 superficial sedimentary       deposits" (page 16).
    In  the year 1871,     in company         with Mr Young,           I  had an oppor
 tunity of visiting the Campsie district, and from my note-book                              I
 make the following extracts         : —
    a. On Craigend moor, at about 450 feet above                     the sea, situated
 two miles west of Strathblane,             I  found the sandstone rock present
 ing extensive sheets of smoothed horizontal surface, evidently ground
 down by friction, and presenting occasional striae, running in a
 direction S.E. by S.        The rock had in some places imbedded in it
 quartz    pebbles,   standing up above              the   general    surface.        Being
 harder than the sandstone              rock, these pebbles         had     been able       to
 withstand the friction      ;  but some of them showed marks of rubbing
 on their north-west sides.

     0.    At this             place,     looking       towards the                 X.TY.      — viz.,         in    the
direction            of Loch         Lomond       — an opening              between         the Mils, wtk-i
are apparently about 1000 feet high, was discernible ;                                              this   opening
being about               1J mile       wide.
     c.    At four other                places     on Craigend moor,                     from       500 to 600
feet above the sea, two to three miles apart, there were striations on
the rocks,             pointing repectively S.E. by S., S.E.                              i S.,      S.E       by S.,
and S.S.E.
     At all          these      places     the direction was seen to pass through the
opening between                      the hills above            referred to, indicating that                         the
agent, whatever                 it   was, which         produced the striations might have
come, and probably came, by that opening.
     d. On this same moor                       (forming an extensive plateau of about                                 6
miles long by about 3 miles wide)                               I   had pointed out to me by Mr
Young several boulders in different places.
     Two were of trap, from the Kilpatrick hills, situated some miles
to the          W.N.W.,          and at a height of 570 feet above the sea.                                    In    cir
cumference,               each boulder            measured           27     feet,    and,      so   far     as       not
buried in the drift on which they were lying, the height of one                                                     was
4£ feet, of the other 6 feet.
     Another boulder, well rounded, 500 feet above the sea, was of
grey granite,              weighing about           2     cwt., which           Mr Young             considered,
from the size of its felspar crystals, to have                                      come       from Ben Awe,
a    mountain situated to the N.W., and distant about 50 miles.
      There were                several     smaller boulders                  of old conglomerate —
transported,              no     doubt, from the well-known                             band of        that         rock
which, running from Dumbarton, crosses Loch Lomond in a N.E.
direction towards Aberfoyle.
     e.    In       the    valley        of the Blane               there    are        deep    beds       of sand
formed,             most       probably, whilst           the        sea    occupied the valley, and
numerous well-rounded boulders of all descriptions.                                            At Strathblane
Railway Station there was                        a deep   cutting of a sandbank, with several
boulders            in the sand, and one in such a position as to indicate that
it       had fallen from some raft which had been conveying                                         it,   as   it   was
sticking with its narrowest point downmost*
/          It    was remarked to me by                      Mr Young, that whilst                         boulders,

gravel, and       beds of sand are abundant in the valleys of Strathblane
and Campsie,         he had never found any marks of grinding or striation
on the     rocks in these valleys.               These     effects   seemed        to have        been
produced at levels higher than 400 feet above the sea.
     On another occasion, when geologising on the Campsie                                        hills,
above       Glorat,    situated         3   miles     to the    east of Campsie,              and at    a
 height of        800     feet     above      the    sea,   I  found the sandstone                rock
 striated, in a direction due E. and W.                       On the Kilsyth hills, a few
 miles     still farther      east, and at a height           of   1200 feet above the sea,
 the striations on the rocks were                  seen   to be  E.  and W.
      g.  One other        fact observed           was    the immense           accumulation of
 boulders of all kinds at Croyhill,                     a  knoll of       trap,   at the summit
  level betweeen        the     firths of Clyde and Forth — viz.,                 about 160 feet
  above sea-level.          As some of these                 boulders were of " old                 con
  glomerate?       they afford            additional      evidence     of an agency              which
  brought them from the westward.*
      h.  In addition          to     these    facts,     notice may          be   taken of two
   boulders reported          to the Committee by               Mr Jack of the Geological
   Survey.        One    is of mica          slate,    weighing about           6   tons,      on    the
   Kilsyth hills, at           1260       feet   above      the   sea,     the    parent       rock of
   which Mr Jack             supposes        to be situated about 15 miles to the
   north.       The    other       is of     conglomerate,       weighing         about 7         tons,
   on the north       hill of       Campsie,      at 1803     feet above the sea,              with its
   longer axis     W.   20° N.           Its parent rock is        supposed by          Mr Jack        to
   be to   N.W.       (First Report of Committee,                p. 51.)
       Now what do all these facts prove                    1   They prove          that an agent
    of some kind or other moved                   over this district, having               a  depth of
    at least  1800     feet, and covering a great breadth of country;                               and
    that, whilst    this agent was moving, the rocks over which it passed
    were ground        down and rutted and striated                     ;   large    boulders,      at a
    high   level, were         carried      forward, and         boulders at          a     low    level
    were pushed      in a similar direction.
       There    is an additional            fact    deserving notice.              The valley at
    Lennoxtown, where               the    pyrites coal strata are worked, seems to
    have at one time been             filled up by these strata.              These       strata now,
    however, exist only on each side of the valley.                  Some agent has scooped
    them away,     whereby the present                 valley was      excavated        ;    and   it   is
                                 *  "  Estuary of the Forth," p.       95.

possible   that the balls found in the Leith boulder                 clay form       a
portion of the debris of these pyrites strata so broken up.
    What   agent     can fit into     all these conditions so well, as a          sea
current loaded with ice       1
    On this theory, it is intelligible         why the rocks along the moors
of Craigend        and   Craigmaddie, stretching for         5  or 6   miles   in     a
direction S.E. and 8.8.E., at         a  level of from 500 to 700 feet above
the sea, should show more effects of grinding and striation than the
rocks at a lower level.        Had a glacier been the agent, the grinding
would have been chiefly at the lowest, not at the highest levels.
    The subjoined plan and section of Campsie hills and valley will
make    the foregoing explanations           more   intelligible.   The plan        is

 kindly drawn for         me by      Mr John Young of Glasgow,             who     is
 thoroughly well acquainted with the geology of the district.                In  his
 letter sending the section,       Mr Young says — " The Campsie          coal and
 limestone   is at present worked on the flank of the north hill,           as well
 as  in the mine which you saw in the                  south hill.     The   valley

Geological Survey (by Professor Geikie) you will find on the south
hill of Campsie the outcrop of the coal and limestone.  This sheet
shows, quite as distinctly as my sketch,                            the valley running             between
the         south and           north hills, and           the great        denudation of the coal

                                                    and earth.
     These explanations go far to show                           how the small marcasite                 ball
found in the Leith boulder clay probably came from                                      Campsie.              A
geological             study of that district indicates the agency of deep-sea
currents loaded with ice, which flowed upon the Campsie hills from
the      W.N.W.,           scooping          out the valley which now occurs there, and
breaking up to a large extent the                            coal   strata    in   that valley.          The
debris of these strata would be swept                               along    to the eastward;            and
some of the nodules                  forming part of these strata would                   be   buried in
the boulder clay now existing at Leith.
       4.     The      cases    which    I   have   just     been    describing are of boulders,
large and small,                which have come from remote places, now separated
by       an intervening            tract of dry land from the present sites of these
boulders.
   (1.) But there are cases of boulders which to reach their present
sites must have crossed arms of the sea, even now of considerable
depth and extent.                     In such       cases,     the theory of local glaciers                   is,
of     course, scarcely conceivable.
       Thus on the Island of                 I slay, the Committee's            last Report refers to
several          large boulders          of rock,       differing from         any    rock     known in

 the   island.       At    least,    such was the opinion          I  formed     after   a
 week's     ramble,     and after inquiring        among    intelligent   persons well
 acquainted      with the rocks of the island.
    So also     in the Island          of Kerrera, opposite      to   Oban, there      are
 numerous      blocks of grey granite, though no rocks of any kind                      of
 granite occur in the island.
    On the small island of Staffa, consisting entirely of basalt and
 greenstone,      I  found boulders of red            granite and       gneiss,    which
 probably      came      from     the   Mull mountains, situated to the N.E.
 (Committee's       2d Rep., p. 157).
    (2.)   In Nairnshire        there are many conglomerate          boulders   of  huge
 size, and angular in form, which must have been transported                      across
 what is now the Cromarty Firth from Ross-shire.                       They are at       a
 height of from 400 to 600 feet above the                sea.   (First Rep. of Com
 mittee, p. 42.)
    Other examples           are afforded     by the black granite boulders             at
 Appin     and in     Loch Creran.         Specimens     of these are now on the
 table.     As   the    present     Report gives a full explanation regarding
 these boulders,      I   do not require to       repeat   how, when these        speci
 mens were submitted to Professor              Judd of London, who has             made
 the   igneous     rocks of        the   West   Highlands      a special   study,      he
 gave his opinion that there was no rock of the same description                       on
 the mainland, and           that it was to be found only in Mull.                From
 that island, theref ore, these boulders must have been transported, and
 across   a sea, which         even    now has at one place a depth of 100
 fathoms,     but which transportation           probably took place at a period
 when the        sea   stood     hundreds or even thousands            of feet    above
 its present     level,    or when the land sat that much lower in the
 ocean.
    (3.)   If  Professor Judd's opinion of the Loch Creran and Appin
 boulders be correct, it goes far beyond an explanation of the boulders
in these localities.         For   example,   the Island of Lismore, whose rocks
 are entirely limestone,         has    on it many boulders of granite, which
probably also came            from Mull, inasmuch as Lismore lies between
 Mull and Appin (Com. 2d Rep., p. 157).                   In Lochaber there is the
hill called Craig Dim, about 2000 feet in height, so called,                 I believe,
from the great number of black granite boulders resting on and near
its top.      These boulders, on account of their peculiar colour as well

as position, attracted         the notice of Professor      Nicol  and  Mr Jamieson        ;
and      they are mentioned in both of my recent papers                         " On   the
Parallel Roads."          (See also Committee's         First Report,    p. 39.)
     In   these papers    I   had   occasion   to point out how the position of
the boulders both in Glen Roy and Glen                    Spean  indicated that they
had come — not down these glens, but up                  the glens.    If   the boulders
at Loch Creran were rafted on ice from                      Mull by     a    sea   current
flowing      eastward,     the position     of the boulders in Glen Roy                and
 Glen     Spean could be explained         in the same way.
     (4.) There    is another fact connected         with the position of boulders
 in the West Highlands, and indeed                over   Scotland generally, which
 receives explanation from Professor Judd's paper " On the Ancient
 Volcanoes of the Hebrides,"            I mean the high position of many large
 boulders.
      In the  Committee's Second Report notice is taken of                 a remark     by
  the Ordnance Surveyors (p. 157), that in the Stratherriek                       district,
  where the highest hills are about                2900 feet above         the sea,    the
  boulders on the        sides     of these hills extend down to              a  level of
  about 2250 feet, but not lower.
      In Fortingall parish (Perthshire)          a gneiss   boulder, weighing above
  400 tons, is lying on clay slate rocks at            a  height of -2500 feet, being
  very near     the ridge of clay slate         hills.     The gneiss      hills form     a
  range about 20 miles to the north and                  north-west.      (Committee's
  First Report,     p. 49.)
      On the Fannoch Mountains (Ross-shire) a gneiss boulder of about
   130 tons weight lies on a water-shed at a height of 2000 feet above
  the sea.     (Committee's First Report, p. 49.)
       On Schehallion (Perthshire) blocks of grey granite are seen at                     a
  height of 3000 feet.           (Committee's Second Report, p. 173.)
       On the top of a     hill in Lochaber,      exceeding 3000 feet above the
   sea, there are   granite boulders.         (Paper on Parallel         Roads, Tr. of
   Soc. vol.  xxvii.   p. 740.)
       Now where are there at present in Scotland               ranges of mountains
   from which fragments          could have been transported to such heights             as
   those above named        ?   There are now none such.         Isolated peaks there
   are, but none exceeding         4300 feet  ; and    of these there is but one, in
   the West      Highlands      (Ben Nevis), though it is from the westward
   that the great bulk of the boulders which overspread Scotland have

come.       Professor   Jud J's  paper, giving reasons for         believing that there
were      in Pliocene times mountains in Skye, Mull, Ardnamurchan,
and     even    in Rum, some of which             reached to a      height of at least
14,000 feet, solves        the  difficulty, and explains many other curious
facts besides.
     For    example,    there   is a series      of granite boulders           containing
unusually large crystals of quartz, felspar, and mica, which occupy
the straths between         Fort-William and Kingussie.                  A boulder    near
Fort- William        is  1500   feet   above    the     sea,  and   from     its position
appears to have necessarily          alighted on the hill from the westward
(Committee's 2d Report, p. 161-2).                  If the sea stood at 2000 feet
or more above the present level, the valleys of Lochaber and the
Spey would be occupied            by  sea,  and through them a current could
flow from the ocean on the west to the ocean on the east.                             The
summit level now between               Lochaber and Strathspey is 850 feet
above the sea, so that         if  the climate at that time was such as to
allow of glaciers among           the mountains and of floating ice on the
sea, there     would be means of transporting                 boulders from      Mull    to
 Lochaber and Strathspey.
     5.   There    are several    other instructive         features    connected with
boulders brought out in this           as  well as in previous Reports,
     (1.)   The different shapes of boulders.
     The Appin boulders are round shaped,                    whilst   the   Loch Creran
boulders are angular, though the rock composing them is the same.
The former are known in the district             as
                                                     "  the round stones of      Appin."
     These    Appin boulders        are   on the shore         of  the    Linnhe Loch,
through        which in     former times        there     must always         have   been
a   rapid current flowing, between            the high mountains, forming             the
Glen-na-Albin        or Great Glen of Scotland.
     If   icebergs   then floated     on the sea, these boulders must have
undergone        much pushing and rolling             ;  whereas     the   Loch Creran
boulders, being in what would               then be only an arm or inlet from
the main channel, would be exposed to no such friction.
     In   reference to    the  Kyle or     sea   strait, in what       is now the line
 of the Caledonian          Canal, the grinding to which the rocks on the
sides of the valley have           been subjected,        is well seen at Cullochy
on the north side, and at Inverfarrignig                   on the south side       of  the
c,n nal.

                              of Edinburgh, Session 1877-78.                                    705
      (2.) Another           common        feature      presented      by    boulders in Scot
land       is,    that when        they    are     longer    than      they     are    broad,    the
longer axis is parallel with                  the    direction in which the boulder had
been        transported.         Very frequently           also,    when one end is sharp
and the other             end broad,        the   former points towards the direction
from which             the boulder has come.              On the theory of icebergs             and
 floating        ice this feature       is   intelligible;      on any glacier or ice sheet
 theory it         is not.
      (3.) The existence of striae                  on boulders, and          the   circumstance
 that these stria.' are sometimes                deeper at one edge than on the rest
 of the       surface, is a new fact brought out                   in this last Report (page
  688).
       6.  In   several parts of the Report allusion is made to the evidence
 which boulders             seem to afford,         of  the enormous         denudation which
  there must have              been    in the district         where       these    boulders are
  situated (pp. 662-667).
       7. Notice is also taken in two districts of the West Highlands
  of horizontal terraces on the sides of hills, up to                        a   height of 1800
  feet above the sea.
       If   these      are to be ascribed to sea              action,     as suggested       in the
   Report, they would only show that Scotland                              possesses the      same
  features        in this respect as Norway,               Sweden, and America, where
   there are horizontal            terraces     to even      greater     heights.       It is only
   reasonable         to expect     that in the north            of Scotland such records
   of the ocean should be discernible, considering                         the enormous        beds
   of sand and          gravel   found at great heights in many of the moun
   tains.      On Schehallion          (Com. 2d Rep.,           p.   173) there      is gravel up
   to a   height of at least 3000            feet.
        In   reference to the suggestion,              that these terraces on the sides of
    mountains         in the Highlands           are marine,       it  is not unimportant to
    observe,     that similar horizontal terraces              at high levels occur also in
    lowland        districts.     Mr James Geikie, in his " Great Ice Age,"
    refers    to    a   series  of " high level terraces              of gravel     and sand at
    Eaglesham,"         about   12 miles      S.W. of Glasgow,          the highest being 800
    feet above the sea.
                                  "  I have also traced them," he adds (page 248),
    "on    the Moorfoots, up to              1050 or 1100 feet; and              these, like the
     Eaglesham         beds,   seem equally to           require     the    agency     of the   sea.
     Still farther south, high level shelves                of gravel and sand have been

706                  Proceedings of the Royal Society
detected by my colleague,     Mr  Skae, in Nithsdale, at a      height of  1250
feet above the sea."
   8.   Lastly, may    I be permitted, as there     is still a wide field for
farther investigation, to express a hope that the Boulder Committee
may be re-appointed,      and with   additional labourers to carry on         the
work.      I will be happy to be allowed to remain on the Committee,
but   I  wish to resign the honour of being Convener.           I begin  to find
that    I am now not able     for the hill-climbing     and   trudging    across
Highland moors and morasses, which boulder-hunting requires.

   At   a Meeting held this day, the Council re-appointed the Boulder
Committee,      with   the  addition   of Dr Andrew         Fleming,    M.D.     ;

son, Secretary    of the Edinburgh     Geological Society     ;  and agreed to
express a hope,     that Mr Milne Home would continue Convener of
the Committee.
   The Council further agreed, that the " Remarks by

    The following Communications were read :—
1.   On the Splitting up of Electric                      Currents,      as   detected     hy
        the Telephone, and the founding thereon of a Sounder to
        call attention from one Telephone                      to another.       By R. H.
        Bow, C.E.
    The    telephone      is of no      use as a       "  far- speaker,"     without    some
means     of calling        the attention of the attendant at the distant
station.      Nothing      could well be better than the " electric-bell call,"
and the sounder which             I  am about        to describe        makes   no preten
sions of competing with the bell, except on the points of simplicity,
cheapness,       and facility      of use     ;  and although its employment is
limited      to short length lines,          it  may be assumed           that it is upon
short length lines that the telephone                 will    be most     frequently used.
I  have had this sounder in experimental                      use   for more than three
months,       and    have    shown it to many persons                 as  a  very obvious
expedient.        However,      as  it  does not appear           to have been      referred
to in any publication,          I venture to bring            it as   a  Note before      the
Society    ;  it is of too trifling      a nature     to be made         the   subject of    a
formal paper.
    In any of       the sounders       I   have    seen described,         the battery, or
other source         of electrical excitement, has been placed                   in simple
circuit with        the  pair of telephones,          or put into circuit with the
distant one.         In the proposed         method      of sounding, by means of            a
galvanic      battery, the battery is kept separate, and, when used, the
short wire from the one electrode                is rested against one of the wires
of the telephone,         while the wire from the other electrode is slid
with   a very gentle vibrating touch upon the other wire leading from
the telephone.          On the well-known            principle of derived          currents,
 we  know that the greater portion of the electricity will pass through
 the shorter or less resisting circuit of the nearer telephone,                     and   yet
 that there    will  be a not inconsiderable portion diverted to travel round
 by the   distant one     ;   and this,   if   the distance      be not very great, and

708                             Proceedings            of   the      Royal Society
the    telephones be               of suitable construction,                            will suffice       to elicit
sufficient noise at the distant station to call the attention                                           of any      one
in    the same or even                 an       adjoining apartment                 ;   the noise given out
by the distant telephone                        will not       be altogether due to                this     diverted
current, but will owe part of its volume of sound to telephonic
sympathy with the great agitation                                    produced in the one near the
operator.
     Before          entering into              any details          as    to the construction         of tele
                                                                                        " call," and for short
phones best suited for this mode of sounding a
distances,           permit me to describe                     two experiments upon the detec
tion of derived currents by means of the telephone.
                                                        Fig.    1.
     Fig.   1    represents       a wire of about 320 feet in length, bent so as to
bring the middle of its length near to the telephone T, to which                                                     its
extremities are attached                    ;    G is    a battery of one cell, and                        A   and B
the wires from its electrodes                          ; one    of these, A, is fixed to the long
wire at a        ;    the other, B, is movable at                         /,,   the point     b   being taken         at
different distances              from       a.        When      the length of             a-b     is   taken equal
to from          3     to   4    feet, the noise             emitted by the telephone                          might
be sufficient to act as                a    call, although only about                     1    per cent        of    the
current from the battery can then pass through the telephone                                                           ;
when the length of a-b                           is   reduced        to     1    foot, the     sound from the
telephone            may     yet be heard several feet away, and as the distance
of a-b       is       decreased,       the       telephone must be brought nearer and
nearer to the ear in order to hear the crepitating                                            sound    ;   with a-b
equal       to   3     inches,    it    may be heard                  3     inches off; and when                     the
telephone            is   held against the ear the distance of a-b may usually                                        be
reduced          to less than       a   quarter of an inch before                          the sound           is   lost
Now, when the length of a-b                            is   one quarter of an inch, the strength
of the diverted current passing through the telephone                                                  used would
only amount to the one twenty-thousandth (..al0!i) of that circulat
ing through the battery. But     have now to note     very puzzling
                                                       I                                      a
circumstance.  Sometimes, under conditions     have not been able                 I

                         of Edinburgh, Session 1877-78.                                  709
 to deterrainp,       the crepitating sound was found not to                  cease     even
 when    b   and    a were brought together,           but continued to be heard
 when the one wire, B, was moved                  upon the other A, at           c.     Here
 there  can be no dynamic current produced                     in the long wire.             I
 shall not detain you with my speculations                   on   the subject      ;  but    I
 should mention that the wire was very imperfectly insulated.
    The second experiment gives an interesting practical example of
 the interference       of one pair of telephones with another pair, duo to
 the splitting up of currents.          The rough diagram, fig.            2,  will    serve
 to explain the arrangement.           A   and     A' constitute     one pair of telo-
  P

phones,    the single connecting wire measuring               60 feet  ;  B and B'       are
another pair of telephones         — these     are connected        by   a copper       wire
270 feet long      ;   for the return currents the        gas   pipes    and    earth    are
employed.        The gas pipes     are  indicated by dotted lines          ;  M    and   M'
are gas metres belonging to different houses               ;  and   P  and     P'   are the
gas mains in different streets, and at a direct distance apart of about
400 feet.       It will    be observed      that the gas pipe from C to               M    is
common      to the two circuits.       Now, it was soon noticed that when
the battery-sounder was made use of at                A, it   caused a sounding not
only in A',     as   intended, but also in B, sufficiently loud to be heard
several   yards off if attentively listened for.                 This   noise     was,    of
course, due to a derived current splitting off at C, and making the
long circuit round by B, B', M', possibly to the gas main P', and
thence to     P  and back by      M,   where      it rejoins   the principal current
on its way to A.           And using     the battery at any one of the tele
phones causes more or less noise              in all the four.         But     the small
amount of sound produced by such straying currents is not likely
to cause confusion.

parative failure would result from the very great resistance                                                           offered

      I       find that the mode of arranging the parts of the telephone                                                   has
a great             influence on the efficiency,                           and the construction                       I   have
found up to the present time to be the best is as follows                                                       :   — Taking
a    3-inch horse-shoe                        magnet,       I   break off about half an inch from                          one
leg       ;   the nick         made            to indicate the north end                          is usually at about
this distance from the extremity, and the breaking of it there is                                                           an
easy operation.                       I     then round the unbroken end on a grindstone,
and next gum                      a   strip of thin paper round that leg, and upon the
paper coil the desired                          length of silk-covered wire.                    Taking next                   a
piece of wood                  4x4            inches or 4 x 5 inches,                 and half an inch thick,                 a
hole 2 inches in diameter                              is cut cleanly through                     it,   and crossing the
hole          is   fixed, in letter             T   fashion, another piece of wood                          4x3      inches   ;
on this latter piece the magnet                                   is   laid with its south or coil-covered
end projecting centrally into the hole, and                                           it     is   fixed down by one
screw passing through                           a   small cross piece of wood placed                                above it.
This admits of after-adjustments being very readily                                                          made.        The
ferrotype plate,                      2}-     inches       in diameter,          is   laid as          a   cover over the
outer aspect of the 2-inch hole, and secured                                            there by the usual ring
of wood which constitutes the ear or mouth piece.
     With            such      an instrument                    placed at       A,    fig.    2,   and another tele
phone              at A',     I       have      experimented on the length of coil needed.
Four or                five   feet of wire gave very satisfactory results, speaking
being heard                   distinctly, and with sufficient loudness.                                    I   then tried
shorter and shorter lengths, and found the volume of sound to
become              reduced           certainly, but in                a   surprisingly small degree                  ;   and
at last       I     carried the shortening so far, that only                                      4£    inches remained
as    a        coil,     and though the sound with                                this fragment was much
reduced,               giving the voice                a        far-away character,               conversation could
still         be carried on.              I     did not think              it   necessary to push the reduc
tion further, having become convinced that no very great length of
wire was needed for the coil to secure distinct hearing, at least for
short lines, say of quarter of                              a     mile or less.              And for the present          I
have adopted                  a   length of            9   feet of No. 28 wire (weighing                        6     grains
per foot length) as                       a   satisfactory coil, presenting                   a    resistance        of only

one-third of      an ohm, in place of the twenty or                thirty   ohms when the
coil   is made up of 180 feet of the much finer wire.
     I  have   had no opportunity of satisfactorily testing the limits to
which      the sounder is restricted,          but it would probably work well
enough when          the resistance     did not exceed ten or fifteen ohms per
Daniell     cell.     A  marked advantage           is usually found          to attend   the
sending of      the currrent    in that direction, which             increased    the power
of the magnets of the telephones. And in using                        the sounder a little
skill will elicit a considerably augmented effect.
     The principle of split currents may               be   applied to other purposes         ;
 it  might offer     a ready  method      of communicating with two adjoining
 stations on      a  railway from any intermediate point — that is to say,
 at any point       between   the two extreme          telephones       we could attach a
 battery or    a telephone     for sounding to, or communicating with, the
 attendants at the extreme telephones             ;  or,   if   a battery be permanently
 included anywhere in the circuit, a wire alone, at any point on the
 line, offers the means of sounding the telephones                        at both stations,
 the    wire being so used           as   to form       an      intermittent     connection
 between the earth and the telephone                 line    ;  and this might perhaps
 be practicable even from a train in motion, the engine                            and  rails
 taking part in the earth connection.
    2.  An Account of some Experiments on the Telephone and
                     Microphone.         By James Blyth, M.A.
     Dn M'Kendhick           stated,    that by applying             the    microphone     or
 carbon-interrupter of Hughes to the membrane                       of  a  phonograph, he
 had    succeeded      in using the        latter   as    a    transmitting instrument.
 With such        an   arrangement,      speech      could be heard in the distant
 telephone even after it had become inaudible near the phonograph.
 He    also mentioned that a tambour of Marey, used                       in physiological
 experiments, spoke distinctly when the fine point                      at the end   of the
 lever was applied to the marks on the tinfoil of the phonograph.
 When      a  tube was      carried from        the    tambour to the ear, distinct
 speech could be obtained from phonographic tracings on copper foil,
 which were scarcely perceptible to the eye.                        This   method   also got
 rid of the difficulty of having the tinfoil impressions quickly rubbed
 out, as happened        when the stillette of the              phonographic membrane

  712                  Proceedings       of the Royal Society
  was employed.        He    also   introduced     to the Society a phonograph
  made    by Messrs Macgillivray and Scobie of Glasgow, which,                       for
  loudness,    was superior to any one he had yet heard.

                               R. M. Morrison, D.Sc.
     Following out      a suggestion       made    by    Mr Seabrook in Nature         of
  May 30th,     I mounted the three carbon blocks of Professor Hughes'
 microphone on, not as          Mr Seabrook      recommends,       a plate of 3 inches
 diameter,     but on  a  ferrotype plate about         6  inches by    4.  This   plate
 formed part of the       top of   a box, thus —
                                      Plate
 This form      I  found to be extremely sensitive, as              a piece   of cotton
 wool   \  inch in diameter falling through            1  inch made a loud sound
 in the telephone.       When      the plate was     lightly brushed by       a camel's
 hair brush the sound produced in the telephone could be heard                         a
yard away.        A  small clock placed on any part of the table on which
the microphone stood could be heard                distinctly    ;  also a tap on the
 table, or even walking         on the    floor, each step producing a clang in
the telephone.        On speaking into the open part of the box the
 words spoken were distinctly            and loudly        heard   in the telephone,
 notwithstanding      the difficulty of hearing words spoken by one's self
at the same time.

    In   the   former paper       on   this subject, the authors stated            that
when hyposulphite           (thiosulphate) of trimethyl-sulphine             is heated
 to about 135° C.,     it  loses sulphide of methyl to the extent of 23-58
per cent., the salt at the same time fusing to a clear colourless
liquid.      On cooling, this solidifies to a hard, very hygroscopic crys
talline   mass.

action of sulphurous acid on the hydrate.  It crystallises well, but
there is some difficulty in preparing a perfectly normal salt                                 The
salt,   as    nearly normal   as possible,       does not, like the hyposulphite, give
up its       water of crystallisation       in   the cold over anhydrous phosphoric
acid;        at 140° C., however,      it   becomes anhydrous.                 Heated to 175°
C. it gives        off sulphide of methyl — 8'3              grammes     lost 2'32 grammes,

forming        a   hard, very hygroscopic crystalline mass.                    This    substance
was so deliquescent that no analysis of it was made.                             The mode of

             Fleeming Jenkin, F.R.S., and             J.  A. Ewing, B.Sc.
                                     (Abstract.)
     By   the help of the phonograph we have continued                 the investiga
tion described       in a previous Communication (Proc. R.S.E., p. 582),
and have       now   obtained about two hundred magnified traces of the
phonographic records          of vowel sounds spoken and sung by various
voices, and of these sixty-five          have     been already subjected        to har
 monic analysis, extending as far as the sixth partial tone.                   In  each
case the results have        been accepted       as  satisfactory only when, after
the magnified trace had been obtained, the record on the                     tinfoil of
the     phonograph still gave        the     vowel sound satisfactorily.           Our
attention has hitherto been almost exclusively directed to the vowels
u (the vowel sound in
                               " food,") and o               " oh,") both of which
                                                     (as in
are well spoken by the phonograph.                    The results, which are still
incomplete, are briefly       as follow   : —
    When       a  vowel sound is continuously             sung   without   change of
pitch or quality, the wave-form         produced       is of remarkable constancy,
showing that the compound sound does not contain any, or at least
any important, constituent which is inharmonic to the prime tone.
    A naturally high       man's voice, with the comparatively small range
/  to  /'  saying   u at any  pitch throughout its range, produced a wave
form which was substantially            a    simple harmonic curve         of length
corresponding to the pitch.          The upper partials, when present at all,
were present        only very feebly.          Thus u sung on lb gave a prime
whose amplitude was 25 (in the unit of measurement                 used), the second
partial was only 0'8, the third             Tl,   and    the  others  inappreciably
small.
    When       the  same voice    spoke     o   anywhere throughout         the same
range,     it produced   a trace  which in every         case consisted  of   a strong
prime and a strong second          partial (that is to say, the octave of the
prime),      the higher partials being feeble or absent.            Experiments on
this part of the scale with various voices proved that the proportion
which the amplitude of the prime bore to the amplitude of the

second partial might vary greatly at any one pitch, although the sounds
were all sung or spoken as o, and received by the ear as (generically)
that vowel.              For    example,        on b one voice gave the ratio of prime
to     second     as 1 to      0'87, while another voice on the same note gave
the ratio 1 to 1 '8. In any one                     voice there is not very much changs                       in
the ratio in passing from note                      to note.         When         the pitch is as high
as d' or higher,            the      ratio of prime to second                     is decidedly greater
than on the lower notes of this range. It is probable that the ratio
is a minimum for any one voice about the pitch         but this                             bh,              is   a
point requiring further investigation.  We have not yet got any
satisfactory o's above               /'.
       When,      however,          the investigation           was carried lower in the scale
 by help of        voices of        a   wider range, several              much less simple pheno
 mena presented             themselves.             Voices capable of singing bass, when
 singing      u   down the scale gave the usual simple harmonic from above
 a   ;    but, at or near that note                 a     remarkable change suddenly took
 place in the wave-form given by the vowel sound                                      u.          At that point
 it      became   a     duplex wave, with                 a   very small prime, which corre
 sponded to the pitch, and an immensely strong second                                               partial, the
 ratio of amplitudes being somewhere                                 about       1   to     4.      This   form
 continued        as the voice          went down the scale               ;   but in addition to the
 very strong            second       partial    a   weak third            appeared,          which became
 pretty strong on              c.       We cannot             say that      we have               got   true and
 articulate       m's   at any lower pitch.
         The voice of small range mentioned at the beginning of this paper
 continued to give the single simple harmonic form for u down to
/,       below    which    it       could not       go.       Two other voices experimented
 with agreed in making the change at or near                                a.
         The excessive         weakness         of the prime in the lower, or what we
  call the duplex, form                 of   u shows how weak                 a      prime tone may be
  as compared           with its upper partials,               and yet fix the musical pitch.
  It     also shows      how small even the prime may be when not reinforced
  by oral resonance.                    The primes of the                  duplex          m's,     even   when
  loudly uttered, were absolutely                     as      well   as    relatively much weaker
  than those of the o's already described.
         The experiments with u seem to point                             to the conclusion that so
  long as the simple form                  is   given the mouth cavity                 is     adjusted     so as
  to reinforce the prime exclusively, whatever be the                                        pitch.        When

710                   Proceedings     of the Royal Society
the duplex form is reached the cavity must be               suddenly changed so
as  to be     approximately if not exactly in unison with the second
partial.      A voice singing u up the scale may sometimes carry the
 duplex form      as high as bb,   but the vowel quality of an u so spoken
is apt to approach o.       When      attempts    were made      to slur either   up
or down, past the place at which           the change occurred,       one or other
of two things        took place   — either    the   sound     died   away    almost
completely while the critical point was being passed, or the vowel
quality changed form u to        o  for an instant.     This   has been observed
both directly and by examination of the magnified phonographic
record, in which      either an almost blank space or the well known
wave-   form of   o  might be  seen.
   An examination of       the sound o through the lower regions             of  the
scale, and by the help of several bass voices, did not show any such
sudden change as took place in u, but the number of partials con
spicuously present became more and more numerous                 as the pitch fell.
The third partial       began   to appear      about   /,  and on d and       e the
prime second and third were all strongly present, the prime being
the weakest      of the three, and the second the strongest               On  c the
fourth partial was moderately strong, the third stronger,              the second
stronger still, and the prime weaker than any.                The first four par
tials were all conspicuous on B.               On \Vj the      fourth was much
stronger     than any of the others, and the prime was the weakest of
the   lower ones.      The   same description       applies to A.        On G   the
fourth was still much the strongest,           and the fifth appeared weakly.
The lower ones were weak.            On  F  the fifth was much the strongest,
but the prime, second, third, and fourth were all distinctly present.
We    have not got any trace good enough for analysis below               F.    We
reserve the numerical result for more detailed publication.
   The      bearing    of our    experiments       on    the   theory   of   vowel
sounds     is very important.        For  a considerable       range   it will   be
seen that the constituents of o and u might be simply described,
with no reference whatever to absolute              pitch — the u always being
a  simple tone, and       the   o   a compound        of two simple tones        an
octave apart.
   When, however, certain limits             are passed,     phenomena appear
which are evidently connected          in some way with an absolute pitch.
It seems, however, that this connection is rather due               to the neces

                          of Edinburgh, Session 1877-78.                                 717
sities of     the mouth than to the requirements               of the ear  ;  for, as stated
above, one voice will give               a   simple harmonic curve for u, while
another       gives (at the same pitch) a double curve for a sound which is
intended for the same letter in the same language, and which is                      at least
generically        the same vowel.            This   fact   suggests    that the mouth,
being      unable to shape itself so as to continue the simple form of the
letter, adapts itself in some way so               as to   produce what may perhaps
be termed         an imitation.        It   is by no means impossible that this
imitation        may   in some cases be produced              by   a recurrence      to the
form     used for the same letter at a higher pitch.                  If this   be so,  then
 the hypothesis of         a constant      cavity for a given vowel sound would
 be true for the letter          u when pronounced on notes an octave or                    a
 twelfth apart, although not for intermediate notes.
     When      we examine the sound o we find less necessity                  for insisting
 on recurrence or any tuning of the mouth cavity.                        A fair    approach
 to the phenomena observed might be obtained by assuming                         a constant
 mouth cavity, having a pitch of maximum resonance                             near b'b,   as
 stated by Helmholtz,             and   reinforcing tones over a large range of
 nearly two       octaves — from /"        to  /,  or thereabouts.        There are, how
 ever, some peculiarities in the constituents which suggest that the o
 cavity may also be adjustable.                   Our results      are not inconsistent
 with the assumption that the cavity is slightly altered or tuned so
 as to bring the maximum resonance                  approximately into unison with
  that upper partial of the prime sung which lies nearest to                     b\     This
 hypothesis would allow us to diminish                   the very large range of rein
  forcement      which the constant cavity theory requires, although even
  an adjustable       cavity must       still reinforce     tones   over   a considerable
 range.       Further     experiments are required to determine how the
 mouth actually produces the results                  obtained, but is clear that the
 idea     of    relation     between      the   constituents        must be combined
 with that of absolute             pitch in    any    complete     vowel theory.         The
 relation may,         however,     depend      for some vowels,          though hardly
 for    u,    on    the    simple      range      over    which      the    reinforcement
 acts.       The pitch of         maximum        resonance     in the    o   cavity given
 by Helmholtz          is  b'b,  and    this, on either hypothesis, agrees well
  with our results.         It  is either the pitch of maximum resonance of
  the constant      cavity, or the pitch near which the upper and strongest
  resonance      is to be found, where            the cavity is tuned.           It may be

      The method of experiment by which the following results have
been obtained has been described in the abstract of Part     pub                                I.,

                Proceedings   February 1877.
 were performed            on dogs.         In    the previous abstract                the effects    of    29
 different substances were briefly stated                          :—
      30.   Dilute nitro-hydrochloric acid                     is   a   hepatic stimulant of consi
 derable power.
      31. Jaborandi           is
                              a      very feeble hepatic stimulant.
      32. Calabar bean stimulates the liver, but not powerfully,                                     unless
it    be given       in very       large doses.
      33.   Atropia sulphate            antagonises            the effect of Calabar bean on
 the liver, and thus reduces                 the hypersecretion of bile produced by
 that substance.              It   does not, however, arrest                 the   biliary secretion         ;
 and when given alone, does not notably affect it.

Parilla,      does not      stimulate the liver.        It slightly    stimulates the
intestinal      glands.
      35.   "Baptisin," a resinous           matter   derived from the        Baptimi
tinctoria, is a hepatic and also             an intestinal stimulant of consider
able power.
      36.  " Phytolaccin,"       a resinous    matter prepared      from the Phyto
lacca decandra, is          a  hepatic stimulant       of considerable power.         It
also slightly stimulates the intestinal glands.
      37.  Sodium Benzoate          is a powerful     stimulant     of the liver.     It
does not stimulate the intestinal glands.
      38. Ammonium           Benzoate     stimulates the liver, but not quite so
 powerfully       as the   sodium salt of benzoic acid.        It  does not stimulate
 the intestinal      glands.
      39.   Benzoic acid       stimulates the liver, but owing to its insolu
 bility, its action is      less rapid and much less powerful             than that of
 its   salts.
      40.   Sodium Salicylate is         a  powerful hepatic stimulant.         It does
 not notably stimulate the intestinal glands.
      41. Ammonium           Phosphate is     a moderately powerful stimulant of
  the liver.      It  is not an intestinal stimulant.
       42. Tannic acid does not affect the          biliary  secretion.
       43.  Hyosciamus does not notably affect the biliary secretion, and
  does not prevent such a stimulant               as   sodium salicylate from aug
   menting it.
       44.  Morphia      does not     affect the   biliary  secretion,   and  does not
   prevent the stimulating           effect of such a substance        as  sodium sali
  cylate.
       45.   Pure diluted alcohol does not affect the biliary secretion.
       46.   Potassium iodide does not affect the biliary secretion.
       47.  Veratrum viride has no notable effect on the biliary secretion.
       48. Manganesium sulphate is not a hepatic stimulant.                  It  power
   fully stimulates       the intestinal glands,      and like other purely purga
   tive agents, such as magnesium            sulphate and gamboge, it indirectly
   lowers the biliary secretion.
       49.   Ailanthus     glandulosus is an intestinal         but not an hepatic
   stimulant.
       50. Acetate of lead         somewhat     diminishes the biliary        secretion,
    probably by      a  direct action on the liver.

  720                      Proceedings of the Royal Society
     51.     " Hydrastin,"      a resinous     matter, prepared    from    the  root  of
 the     Hydrastis       canadensis,    is a hepatic stimulant        of  considerable
 power.         It  also slightly stimulates the intestinal glands.
     52.     " Juglandin,"       a  resinous matter, prepared       from    the root  of
 the    Juglans      cinerea, is a hepatic stimulant        of considerable      power.
 It   also slightly stimulates the intestinal glands.
     Thus, by means of a new and precise                 experimental method,        the
 physiological pharmacology of one of the most important                      organs   of
 the body has been in this research worked out as far as at present it
 appears       desirable     to proceed,    and knowledge that is definite           and
 reliable, because obtained by              a   method of accurate      measurement,
 after the elimination of disturbing factors, has by this research been
 substituted for the vague traditions of the past.
     The effects of fifty-two medicinal agents upon the liver have been
 investigated, and the vast majority of the conclusions are in complete
 harmony with the results of clinical               observation.     Very many new
 facts are, however,          given to the physician, and even as regards well-
 known substances,             our knowledge of their effects on the liver is
 now of a character very different from that which previously                        ob
 tained.
     All    the experiments relate to the bile-secreting         and not to the bile-
 expelling      mechanism.         The authors do not intend to investigate the
 effects of medicinal agents on the latter,               as  this point appears to
 them one of very minor               importance compared       with the subject of
 the above research.
     The following          remarks indicate the position in pharmacology of
 the above         results.     Of   necessity,  the influence   of  a  drug upon      a
 diseased state is the ultimatum of pharmacology,              and every experiment
 upon     a  healthy bodily system, whether of man or animal, is merely
ancillary to experiments with the drug in disease.                Having discovered
 that this or that drug stimulates the healthy liver of a dog, we do
 not infer that it must also stimulate the human liver in health, and
 still less do we conclude that it must also have this action in disease.
The experiments on the healthy liver of the dog, on the normal and
on the abnormal human liver, are three                 sets of experiments closely
related, but        still distinct.      The facts derived from any one of the
three sets cannot be substituted for those               of the other two.        Each
set of facts has its own proper place.              The above research, therefore,

leaves it to the clinical       observer   to experiment on man with such
substances as sodium benzoate, sodium salicylate, baptisin, euonymin,
sanguiuarin,      &c., and thereby to ascertain         whether or not these
substances also stimulate the human liver; and of necessity it is also
left    to  him to ascertain in what diseased state the employment of
 this   or of that   substance   is most advantageous.

    Ordinary paraffin-oil, when used         as a dielectric, exhibits the same
 phenomena       as  oil of turpentine.      Gas is liberated    by the passage
 of the spark, and          at the  same time     carbon is deposited.     Once
 produced, the gas bubbles make the passage of the spark more easy
 through bringing the electrified surfaces nearer to one another; hence,

 722                 Proceedings        of  the  Royal Society
in taking   a series of observations,          it is   necessary      to get  rid of   the
bubbles after the passage of each spark.                 They     were attracted gene
rally to the positive surface, but sometimes                  to the negative.       The
attraction was more marked when no jars were attached to the
Holtz ; it was not so powerful as in oil of turpentine, and was gene
rally in the opposite direction.
    The electrostatic     force required to pass a spark               through a layer
of paraffin oil or of turpentine is constant, whereas                  it is variable in
the case    of air and other        gases.     For   the     observed    differences     of
potential plotted with          respect    to the     thickness of layer give             a
straight line through the origin, while in the                 case   of the gases the
curve is concave.
    The electric strength of the paraffin oil used was found to be 4,
of the turpentine     3 -7 ;  air being unity.
    To investigate   the effect      upon the electric          spark of heating the
electrodes, we constructed electrodes            of thick platinum wires placed
at right   angles   to one    another — a       suggestion      we   owe to Professor
Clerk    Maxwell.      When      one of the wires was heated               by a current
from a battery of four Bunsen elements, the electrometer                       deflection
was    diminished     by     about one-fourth          of its amount, and            that
whether the      wire heated         was    positive      or negative.        A   similar
diminution was observed when the deflection for continued                          sparks
was taken.      This diminution of         the difference       of potential must be
due to change at the surface           of the wire      ;   for the air between the
wires (the shortest      distance    between      the wires being 4 millimetres)
 cannot be so much rarefied by the heating of the wire as to produce
the effect.
    We   have  also investigated the effect upon the electric spark                      of
 heating the air round the discs, the pressure                   being kept constant.
 We    have   observed       the    deflections      of    the    electrometer     for    a
constant   spark for temperatures            from 20° C. to 280° C., and find
that they indicate       a   curve,    which      slopes down        gradually    as the
 temperature   is increased,     while the deflections during cooling give                a
 curve which is somewhat          lower at the lower temperatures.
    It  appeared     an    important       matter     to     ascertain    whether      the
 electrometer   used in all these observations gives deflections strictly
proportional to the inducing charge.                 To calibrate it by means of
cells would have required a very large number ; hence the following

                          of Edinburgh, Session 1877-78.                                                 723
method suggested               by Professor Tait            was     adopted.          A    charge was
put upon         the     inducing        ball of the            pair on       the stand,        and      the
deflection read        ; the     charge was then divided by bringing an equal
ball into      contact    with    the inducing ball, the deflection read,                        and      so
on.        The deflections       were so nearly halved each time, that                          we may
infer that they are strictly proportional to the charge on the inducing
ball. We had arranged to verify our former observations in this
matter last Thursday forenoon (27th June) ; but as the deflection
on the scale always fell in the negative direction, and went to a
great distance beyond the proper zero when the dividing                                         ball was
brought into contact, wc gave it up.                       This    effect was, doubtless,                due
to a strong negative electrification of the air; for the thunderstorm
came on immediately.
2.    On the Wave Forms of the Vowel Sounds produced by the
           Apparatus           exhibited       by Professor Cram                      Brown.             By
           Professor Fleeming Jenkin, F.R.S., and                             J.   A. Ewing, B.Sc.
      At   a recent    meeting of the Society,                  Dr Crum Brown exhibited                    a
gutta percha           bottle of irregular form, which, when applied as                                    a
resonance cavity to reeds of various pitches,                           gave       very good imita
tions of certain vowel sounds.                      By closing certain             apertures      in     the
side of the bottle         it could      be made to say            A ("father"), A ("awe"),
O     ("oh"),    and     I (" machine").             When         the   cavity was          kept con
stant, and the pitch of the reed was                       altered,     the        same vowel con
tinued to be given.              Dr Crum Brown              was good enough                to    lend us
the apparatus,         in order that       we might investigate the sounds                           given
by the       bottle in    the same way as we have been investigating certain
human vowel sounds, by obtaining and                              magnifying           phonographic
traces, and then subjecting them to harmonic analysis                                 as   far      as   the
sixth partial tone.              Of   the vowels which the bottle speaks,                       0    is the
only one which we have fully examined in this way when spoken
by the human voice, and we have confined our attention to it among
the artificial vowels also.
      By using reeds of various pitches we have obtained curves or traces
of the artificial O's sufficiently good for harmonic analysis on the
following pitches          — e,
                           :          JTk g,   b,   c,   o'b,    and    e'.    The pitch was in
 each case determined by measuring the length of the                                   traces.           The

 724                     Proceedings     of the Royal Society
 vowel quality       of the sounds,      as   repeated      by the phonograph,            was
exceedingly good, even better that the original sound, as the jarring
 noise of the reed was lost.          The sounds          were    thoroughly recognis
able as O, of perhaps a         somewhat bright species.              The table below
shows the amplitude of the successive                 partial tones, along with their
absolute     pitch to the nearest semitone.

    It  cannot     be said that these        figures     show any specially           strong
 resonance on or close to h\\, which Helmholtz                   gives as the        proper
tone of O, but they do show a wide range of resonance, extending                             a
 long way above and below that pitch.                  There is distinct         reinforce
 ment as high as g", or even g§", and as low as e,                  if not lower,         and
 partial tones falling anywhere between these limits are more or less
reinforced.
    The above analysis appears to show that                a strong resonance         on or
near bV is not essential to         0, and that this vowel         effect may be satis
factorily produced by other joint resonances                   above and below           that
pitch.
    In  a  previous communication we pointed out that                    if   the view     be
 adopted that the constituents of the O's, sung at various pitches by                        a
human voice, are due to the reinforcement caused by                       a  constant oral
cavity, the results of our analyses showed that this cavity not only
has the property of strongly reinforcing tones close to                     IV, but must
also be capable       of strengthening, more or less, tones widely distant
from that pitch, and extending over               a large range.        The analysis of
the artificial O's now shows that a constant cavity may possess                           the
latter property in quite a sufficient degree.

    In   order, however, to test this        still further,  we made the following
experiment.         A   tube consisting of a piece of cane           of   the same size
as one of the reeds was put into the neck of the bottle in place of
the    reed, and the side apertures          of the bottle were closed            so as to
arrange the cavity for the vowel sound O.                  The end of the tube was
then inserted in the ear, so that the whole apparatus                          acted   as  a
resonator to sounds from outside.                  Then, striking       the keys of a
piano     in   succession,     we    observed     what notes gave the peculiar
humming effect due to reinforcement by the resonator.                         On working
down the scale the resonance            first became      appreciable        on           It
then got stronger and stronger down to               f"   and e", which were both
intensely and nearly equally strong.               tV and   d" were     a  little weaker,
but still very       strong, and on            the resonance      again     became     very
 intense,      c" was a little     weaker,    but also very strong.            The reson
ance     continued as the pitch fell, being sometimes                      stronger and
sometimes       weaker,     g and fjjf were both strong, — decidedly stronger
than could be accounted for by the reinforcement of their second
partials g" and /,*".        f  was weaker,      — so  much so that the resonance
observed on       it might   be due to the second partial.
    The presence of the upper partials in the notes struck made this
method of testing the resonant qualities of the cavity inapplicable
to pitches below those named.               But   the above      cases,   in which the
reinforcement was distinctly of the prime, sufficed to show that the
cavity would strengthen any tones                 between           and ./$', at least,
some more and some less strongly, while they left                   it  an open ques
tion whether there was not resonance down to                   a  lower limit of abso
lute pitch.       Of   course,  it is to    be observed       that the bottle, when
 applied to the        ear in    the   manner      described,    might differ        in its
 resonant peculiarities from the same bottle applied to                   a reed,   but its
 range is probably as great in the former case.
    When     the bottle was arranged          for the vowel sound A, and tested
in   the same way, the resonance was perceptible as high as e'", and
 the highest maximum occurred              on c'".    In this     case also there was
  reinforcement over        a range   of at least an octave.

 paper    will  be given along with those            of other O's when the full
 account of our work is printed.

3.   Notes on the Fungus Disease affecting Salmon.                       By A. B.
        Stirling, Assistant Conservator of the Anatomical Museum
        in the University of Edinburgh.                Communicated by Pro
        fessor Turner.
    It   is widely known that a destructive epidemic has this spring
appeared      among     the  salmon    of the rivers Eden,         Esk, and Nith.
The mortality among the fish has been so great as to cause consider
able alarm among             proprietors, salmon commissioners, taxmen,
anglers,    and the general public.
    The newspapers        inform us that within three days the watchers
have taken out       of the Esk    as many as 350        dead salmon.        All who
have examined the fish carefully, agree              in referring the     disease  to
the presence of      a  fungoid growth.
    The other fish in those rivers, as the smolts, trout, eels, lampreys,
minnows, pike, and flounders, are also said to be attacked in a
similar way to the salmon, and fears are entertained that the disease
 may become thoroughly established in the district
     In  these circumstances,     I  have thought     it might     be interesting to
 describe    the condition    of some    of the fish which        have come     under
 my observation.         In March last my friend Dr Philip Hair of Car
 lisle sent me the fin of a salmon which had been affected                     by the
 disease, and requested        me to state     if  possible   its nature.      Unfor
 tunately, the fin was in a putrid condition when               it reached   me, and
 as a   result of the examination,       I  could only state to       Dr Hair that
 the disease was probably a fungoid one.              A few   days later   I received
 from     Dr Hair     a fine   specimen    of   a  trout, but it was not stated
 whether the fish was taken alive or picked up dead.                   It  was, how
  ever,    quite fresh,     and the effects      of the disease were        painfully
 exhibited on the carcase.          A  hurried examination of this specimen
  enabled    me to inform     Dr Hair that the        disease was due to what       I
  had previously suspected, namely, a fungoid growth
      While examining this       specimen,     I  observed   entangled among the
  fronds of the fungus foreign matter of various kinds, namely, torulae
  or yeast fungus, triple phosphates,         fecula, human hairs, hairs       of the
  cat and the mouse, also desmids,          diatoms,    shreds of dyed wool and
 cotton,    with other fragments of matter unknown to me. Respecting
 the torulae,   I, in my letter to Dr Hair, asked if their presence could

be accounted for by              bakeries    or breweries        in Carlisle,    whoso refuso
might have got into the river.
      My letter was published by Dr Hair in                      the    Carlisle   Journal of
March         29th, and in the         Field    newspaper         of March       30th, and    as
worded it might            have been inferred that          I    regarded     the presence of
bakeries         and breweries       as the     cause of the disease.             This   was of
 course not intended.              On 12th April          I received       two salmon and a
trout from         J.  Dunne, Esq., chief constable of Cumberland and West
 moreland, all of them in            a diseased     condition.         Mr Dunne      requested
 me to make an examination of those fish, and hoped,                                 on public
 grounds, that         I  might be able to discover the true nature and cause
 of the     disease.
      As   a  result of my examination of those fish                   I  sent a preliminary
 report to Mr Dunne.                This     report   was     forwarded to the          Fishery
  Inspectors, and was considered                of  so  much importance            that it was
  published in the Times and                   many     of the        provincial    and    local
  newspapers.          Sir Robert Christison had               also very     kindly supplied
  me    with     a number of specimens from the river                      Nith, all of them
  affected with this disease.             An examination of              these has confirmed
  me    in  the opinion expressed           in the report above referred               to.   All
  these fish had the disease in an advanced                      stage, being more or less
  affected about the head, chin, branchiostegal                      rays, and fins in every
  instance.         One salmon had rubbed the chin till the lower jaw had
  nearly      separated     at the     symphysis, the skin was rubbed off the
  branchiostegal         rays, and    the rays      broken     ;   a   trout had the upper
   left jaw bare of skin, the bone worn and hanging loosely attached
   to the cheek, the          pectoral fin of the       left side in rags, and the rays
   worn to stumps.
       Another salmon had the skin rubbed off the nose and crown, and
   the matted fungus           covered    the bare parts; the dorsal fin was quite
   destroyed,      the strong anterior rays being reduced to stumps of half
   an   inch in length,        and  the    remains     of the fin bare, bleached, and
   without membrane.               Beneath the dorsal              fin   on each     side  were
   spaces    extending      3  inches forward towards the head, and 2£ inches
   backwards         toward the tail, thickly covered with the fungus.
   Besides these there were other spaces on the sides of the fish from                         1
    inch to    2  inches in diameter, all covered            by the fungus,        which gave
    the fish a spotted appearance.

  This fish     appears to have been alive when taken, as the                                      skull   and
brain    had been punctured by the fisherman.                                         The greater          part
of this fish was cooked               ;     it       was    very firm and fat, and the three
persons who made a meal of                       it pronounced it capital                      I    tasted       a
portion of the flesh from a part where the fungus covered the skin,
and could not detect                anything               different in the flavour                 from     an
ordinary fishmonger's              salmon.
   The fungus appears, in the first instance, to attack those parts of
the fish that are not covered                    with       scales, as the            crown, nose, sides
of the head, chin, throat, and the membranous parts of the fins.
From those parts the fungus extends by vegetative    growth (which
seems very vigorous), to those portions of the surface of the body
which are covered              with       scales.          On the sides            of the fish where
small patches of the fungus were situated on the scales (and no
rubbing had taken place) no sore could be detected, and the fungus
was easily wiped off              with the           finger.
   I   may also mention that                 all the fish which                 I received         from the
Eden river, both trout and salmon, were infested with tape-worms
of a large size, the worms being about                                2   yards in length and         ^ths
of an inch iu breadth               One of the salmon had from 60 to 80 yards of
those worms in the pyloric portion of the  gut Another salmon had
three    varieties of worms in various parts of its alimentary canaL
1st.    In   the stomach           were     many round worms, about 4 inches in
length, tapering to each end, and as thick as ordinary whip-cord                                             in
the thickest part       of     the body          ;    many of those worms were entangled
among the       gill   rays,      it being their habit                      to crawl there when            the
fish dies, and from their presence in this situation they are                                         called
gill worms by the fishermen.                               2d.    A        small spiral worm,         which
attaches itself, by burrowing                        in   the outer walls of the            intestine, in
the fat and pyloric appendages.                            3d.    Tape-worms seated within the
pylorus and intestine.
   On        30th May,        I    received           from Sir Robert Christison                     a large
salmon from the Nith.                 This fish             was believed to have been to the
sea,    after   being attacked                   with       fungus,          and   was    captured          on
its return.       The specimen                   was       a female,         and had the roe about
one-fourth grown          ;    the viscera were very healthy, and no entozoa
were found in it.             The head of this female                         is peculiar   in having         a
kip    on the under jaw, and a cavity                            in       the upper   jaw to   receive       it,

                            of Edinburgh, Session 1877-78.                                  729
as      in  the male fish of the species.                The right side of the head,
including         the eye and nose, was very deeply rubbed and                       the bones
injured, but no            fungus adhered to the injured              part.      The pectoral
 fin on the same           side had no membrane,          the rays being bare, broken,
 and      separate from the muscles at their roots.                   There were several
 patches       on both sides of the fish, from which the scales were rubbed
 off, but      no fungus adhered           to the rubbed parts.        In   several of those
  rubbed        parts, although        the   skin was unbroken, a portion of the
  muscle, corresponding in breadth to the external injury, and half an
  inch in depth, was in a pulpy condition; beneath other rubbed spots
  the muscle         was quite sound.           The dorsal, ventral, caudal, and anal
   fins   were all more or less injured             by rubbing.       No fungus adhered
   to any of the fins except             the anal, the rays       here being reduced          to
   stumps      of an inch or half an inch in length, on which a thickly
   matted covering of fungus is seated.                   The branchiostegal rays are
   very slightly        rubbed, and         are   the only other part of the fish on
    which    the    fungus remains.           In my report      to the Fishery Commis
    sioners in April last,        I  stated that the fish did not die of the fungus,
    but of    the injuries       they inflict     by rubbing     in trying      to rid them
    selves   of the pest          As    some     objection    was    taken     in   regard    to
    this statement,       I  quote,    in corroboration of my        views,    from a letter
    published in the Field of 25th May last.                  The letter was written by
    Commander Duncan               Stewart, R.N.        He says : — "       In  regard to the
    disease from which salmon              are suffering in some of our rivers,          it may
    be of advantage         that   I  should mention what         I   observed      in  a small
     river at the     head    of Castrie's Bay in Siberia.              I   found the river
     rather   low, but with plenty of clear               running water.            But what
     astonished me was to see thousands               of salmon in all      stages of disease
     and death, some darting away, but soon stopping to rub the side on
     the bottom       or on a rock       ;  others   were   constantly rubbing, others
     unable     to   rub.     In    those    last cases large       sores, from        the  size
     of a shilling     to that of a half crown, of a most                filthy   appearance,
      were  always present.          Fish in which      the scales had been rubbed off
      would try to get out of my way, but                   I  could    kill   them     with   a
      stick; those     with     the    skin    gone would rub         themselves         against
      my trousers."
         Supposing     this salmon from the Nith had been to the                       sea, and
      had  while there        got rid     of the greater      part of the fungus with

730                      Proceedings       of the Royal Society
which     it  was     affected,      it had returned to the river             in  such   a
mutilated condition, and with unhealed sores of such a nature,                      as in
all likelihood would have ultimately proved fatal.                   Besides, the    fact
that the fungus was not killed by the salt water, but was found in
a  highly vigorous condition on the parts to which                   it still   adhered,
gives but small hope of any permanent benefit to diseased fish from
a visit to the sea.
   The fungus belongs to Saprolegniew, a natural order of doubtful
affinity — said      to     have    the habits     of moulds and         fructification
algsa.    This order         consists    of the genera   saprolegnia and         achlya,
which are great enemies                of fish and other animals preserved              in
aquaria.
    The filaments of the fungus arise free from the outer surface of the
epidermic layers of the fish, having neither branches nor articulations.
They are tubes, the walls of which are perfectly translucent, and in
their interior at irregular intervals are small groups of fine granular
matter.
   The majority of the filaments are spear-shaped                     at their upper
terminations, and appear to be barren.
   The prolific       filaments,      on the contrary,     enlarge    at their upper
extremities, and form             elongated     club-shaped chambers,        in which
granular matter gathers.              In the midst of this granular matter small
round bodies        appear,     and those enlarging, gradually develop into
spores.      The prolific filaments           apparently contain more          granular
matter, and are of greater calibre than the other filaments.                   They   are
evidently destined from the first to be the propagating media.
    The spores escape by an opening in the summit of the chamber.
This    aperture   is not an original opening.          It  is produced in a some
what remarkable manner— so long as the spores are unripe and unfit
for expulsion,      a   slender continuation of the filament projects from
the apex of the chamber              in manner similar to the neck of a bottle.
At the point        at which        this joins the spore-sac,      there   is a slight
contraction, which goes on gradually increasing in depth.                  Ultimately,
when the spores are fully matured it drops off, and the aperture is
formed.        The filaments forming the mycelium of the plant are
tortuous and branched            ;  they ramify in the mucous          and epidermic
layers of the fish         ;  they do not penetrate      the corium where there
are    no  scales.       In other situations they never             reach    a   greater

                      of Edinburgh, Session 1877-78.                                  731
depth than the outer surface of the scales ; they are tubular,                         the
whole plant being without septa forms a single individual                                of
apparently indefinite extent.             The spores      are variously shaped           at
different stages, ovate and kidney being the              commonest forms.           They
are very minute, and require           a power of 450 to observe             them well.
The cilia     are two in number, a longer and a shorter one, and                        are
situated at the long axis of the spore.            They are difficult to observe,
and always disappear in permanently mounted preparations, although
the spores themselves remain unaltered in all other respects. When
 the     fungus   is stained     with     logwood       or  picric    acid,     excellent
 permanent preparations can bo got.                It   has been     stated      that the
 fungus dies with the fish.         I have not found this to be the case; on
 the contrary, all my observations            have been made          from dead fish.
  Some of the specimens         sent me from Carlisle          by Mr Dunne            were
 mis-sent to Aberdeen, and returned to me on the seventh                        day after
 the death of the fish, and yet           I have scores of permanent              prepara
 tions from these specimens, which show distinctly the characteristic
  form of saprolegnia ferax.
      I  have   also   found    the   fungus     perfectly     identical      in all the
  specimens    I have examined, which consist of salmon,                sea    trout, and
  river trout from       the  Eden,      and salmon        and   grayling       from the
  Nith.
      It has also been said that a salt solution              destroys     the     fungus,
  "which    melts in the solution like sugar in water."             On the contrary,
  salt and water is an excellent preservative of saprolegnia                ;   masses of
  it  before me as   I  write have been in       a salt solution for two months,
  and it remains        unaltered.       Further,      the    salmon      captured        in
  the Nith, which is believed to have gone to the                     sea   in order to
   get rid of the fungus, had the fungus growing vigorously on several
   parts of its body.      The fungus must either have instantly attacked
   the fish on its return to the river, or not have been destroyed during
   its stay in the salt water.
      Regarding the cause of the disease,          I  can offer no opinion further
   than that some functional condition of the fish seems necessary for
   the propagation of the fungus.             The germs of saprolegnia                ferax
   must exist at all times, and in many places;              and   if   so, there     must
   be a reason why fish are not constantly affected             with   the fungus and
   in every river.       I am persuaded        that   the    condition      of the      fish

732                  Proceedings     of tlie Royal    Society
is in some way either suitable or unsuitable for the propagation
and growth of the fungus.              Whether this arises from too high
or too low condition,      I am quite unable to say ; but I may remark
that while some of the fish examined were in the kelt stage, others
 were in a condition perfectly fit for food.

                             By G. Carr Robinson.
     It  is generally stated that isomorphous salts          are capable    of crys
  tallizing   together   in any proportions, or that              the  isomorphous
  elements which enter into them are capable of replacing one another
  in any proportion; e.g., potash alumina alum and potash iron
  alum can crystallise together in all proportions.

                               of Edinburgh,         Session    1877-78.                                      733
    Hauer * states that mixed crystals of alumina and chrome                                                  alum
grow in            a   solution of ammonia iron alum                ;   and, again,          he states           t
that the           more soluble isomorphous salt completely hinders the                                       solu
tion of        the less soluble, so that            if solutions of     common          alum, chrome
alum, and iron alum be mixed, precipitation                                  of the less soluble
alums will occur.
    The present paper is the result of some experiments made with
the four alums              — potash alumina, ammonia alumina,                        potash          chrome,
and ammonia iron.
    The solutions of the two first, potash                              alumina and                  ammonia
alumina, were obtained by saturating water                               at 100°            C.       with the
salts, and pouring off the mother-liquor from the crystals that de
posited on cooling.
    The chrome alum solution was obtained by saturating water with
the alum at a temperature                       carefully kept below that at which                             the
green modification of chrome alum is produced.
    Whilst             the solution of iron alum was made                    by saturating water,
acidulated with sulphuric acid, with the alum, at about 50° C.
    The following experiments were then made and observed                                             :   —
    a.       When       a   crystal of potash chrome alum is placed in                           a    solution
of potash alumina alum exposed to the air, the chromium is turned
out by the alumina, the interior                       of the crystal becomes granular,

6.   On     a     New Method for the Separation of Yttrium and Erbium
           from       Cerium, Lanthanum, and Didymium.                                              Part   I.    By
     J.      Gibson, Ph.D., and                       R    M. Morrison, D.Sc.
     The method for the separation of these two groups hitherto in use
was        first proposed              by Berzelius, and has been followed                                by almost
all chemists who have investigated these earths.                                            For the details of
this method we must refer to his "Handbuch;" but we may briefly
state that            it    depends on the relative solubilities                           of the double sul
phates           of   these       metals      with potassium in a saturated solution of
potassic          sulphate.            The yttrium and erbium double sulphates                                   are
said to be easily and completely soluble, while the double sulphates
of cerium, lanthanum,                         and didymium                 are    said to           be    perfectly
insoluble.              Wishing to prepare                     pure salts        of yttrium and erbium,
in order          if        possible to obtain the metals                        and to determine their
specific         heats, we tried this method, and found                                   that, although        it   is
a   good         rough method,                the separation              is   by no means               complete.
We repeated                     the separation six                  times, but never obtained                   the
earths       pure,           the spectroscope                always showing                 the characteristic
absorption-spectrum of didymium,                                     provided we examined a suffi
ciently thick layer of                  a   saturated nitric acid solution.                             The incom
pleteness             of this method                 is   indeed acknowledged                    by Bahr and
Bunson in their well-known                                paper       on these            metals.*        The   test
given for the                   presence      or absence of these two groups by these
chemists          was the presence                   or absence          of the absorption-spectra of
didymium               and       erbium respectively.                     We found, however, that

                           of Edinburgh,      Session     1877-78.                    735
not     only are the double sulphates of the didymium                       group   some
what soluble in a saturated solution of potassic sulphate, but that
some erbium, if not also some yttrium, is precipitated.                       Repetition
of this process fails to remove the last traces of the didymium
group.
     After trying various modifications of this               method,    some of which
gave better         results,   notably boiling      the double sulphates with the
saturated potassic-sulphate            solution and filtering hot, we determined
to look for another method, none of these variations being suffi
 ciently     good.
     Wo      have    obtained      better    results    by the     following     method.
 After      having      extracted     as much     as    possible of the didymium
 group by the old method, the earths are dissolved in nitric acid,
 and to this solution            a  large excess of a solution of carbonate             of
 ammonia is added,            and   the whole allowed to digest           for a day   in a
 closed     flask,    the precipitate being          frequently     shaken     up.    The
 liquid is      then    filtered and the undissolved residue              washed.      On
 acidifying       the filtrate    with hydrochloric         acid,  and   adding oxalic
 acid, a precipitate is obtained           which, on ignition, yields the oxides
 of yttrium        and   erbium, free from, or only containing the merest
 trace     of,  lanthanum or didymium,              which may be removed             by  a
 repetition of the           process.     Any cerium originally            present   goes
 into solution, and must be removed                   by boiling     a  solution of the
 sulphates     with    carbonate of magnesia.            The undissolved residue of
 the carbonate          of    ammonia     solution     still contains yttrium and
 erbium      carbonates,      but is much      richer in didymium, and must be
  treated   with    a fresh portion of carbonate          of ammonia solution.
     It  is essential     that the ammonium carbonate solution                be  neither
  too concentrated         or too dilute, as in the first case        some lanthanum
  and didymium dissolves,            and in the latter the carbonates         of yttrium
  and erbium,       after dissolving, crystallize out         as  double salts, leaving
  almost nothing         in solution.     The strength we found most suitable
  was about      half saturated.

 7.  On certain Effects of Periodic Variation              of Intensity of      a
        Musical    Note.      By Professor Cram Brown and                   Pro
        fessor Tait.
    Recent discussions    as   to the nature of vowel-sounds have         led  us
 to make     experiments (partly with an apparatus          constructed     some
 years ago for the same purpose)        upon the effect of    a periodic varia
 tion of intensity of a simple tone.
    It is obviously impossible to secure a simple harmonic           variation,
 so wo endeavoured     to produce    a displacement varying as
                                  1 - cos mt.
    An organ-pipe, giving       a tone very free      from harmonics,        was
sounded     on one side   of   a  partition  in which    were   cut a series of
large holes.    These were opened and shut periodically by         a revolving
 disc cut into separate sectors.      The form of the holes was calculated
on the rough assumption that the intensity of the sound                 passing
through them was at each instant proportional to the uncovered area
of the openings.      This may be approximated       to  in many ways, most
 simply    by making the holes       approximately square or of rhombus
 form, with one diagonal radial, and the corners at the ends of that
 diagonal somewhat     rounded off.
    Supposing the adjustment perfect, the result should have been the
disturbance
                             (1
                                 - cos mt) cos nt,
 or
                  cos ni -\   cos (m + n)t   -\ cos(m

                                                          n)t.
Thus, in addition to the tone given by the pipe, there should be two
others of the order    of summation and difference tones.           The result
was    tested  very easily by the       help  of resonators.      Standing    in
 front of the     openings in the partition,       the observer     applied    a
resonator    to each ear, and the pipe giving the tone whose number
of vibrations was the arithmetical mean of those of the tones of the
resonators    was   sounded on a small organ, and the disc made to
rotate with gradually       increasing velocity.       The resonators      were
found to be affected simultaneously.
    The experiments, as we made them, succeed             much better with

low       notes than with high — because, though the rotating apparatus
always produces a siren effect, the intensity of this effect is very
 small at low speeds. A very curious case occurs when m = n (i.e.,
 the siren giving the same note as the pipe), for then the first har
 monic comes in very marked.

                              intensity.         By Professor Tait.
       Two     years ago     I had    an opportunity of making from the deck of the
  steamer " Pharos
                              "
                                 some observations on the performance                 of the fog-
  siren at Sanda, off the             Mull of Cantire.          The instrument is worked
  by air       at about      1^    atmospheres      pressure;     and, though driven by a
  powerful         air-engine, sounds          for  7   seconds     only per minute.           One
  obvious        defect     of such an arrangement              I  saw to be the waste            of
  energy in producing               a   current of air through the trumpet of the
   siren along with the oscillations.                    It  then occurred         to me that a
   regular alternation of puffing and sucking — exactly analogous to the
   air-disturbance produced by                 a  drum — must be          a   much less costly
   source      of sound.         I  have    since   constructed      a  siren on this double
   action      principle, the air in the trumpet, which acts                     as a resonator,
   being put alternately in connection with reservoirs                           of compressed
    and rarefied air.          The small model has given very good results, and
    a   larger    one    is in progress.          The only defect            which    my model
    showed       was a waste          of energy     in the form of pulsations in the
    tubes     leading to        the    exhausted      receiver     and    to that containing
    compressed        air.     This    can be very greatly reduced,               but   I  do not
    yet see how to get rid of              it entirely,    unless    it  be possible      to make
    both receivers         so exactly as to act as additional                 resonators    to the
    siren.      If   this   can be carried out            in  practice      there    will   be   no
    energy spent except in sound.                  It  is obvious that the principle           just
     described is approximated to in practice whenever steam is employed
    in   a siren : — the     vacuum being produced by the condensation                      of the
     steam.
         Another device of           a somewhat       different character         was suggested
     to me    by the experiments described in the preceding paper.                           After
     trying, without much success, to reduce                   the    intensity of the siren
     notes   by filing the edges of the apertures, it occurred                      to me that     I

738             Proceedings of the Royal Soeiety                 of Edinburgh.
might usefully         intensify    them.            I     therefore had        copper     plates
soldered        perpendicularly     to       the revolving        disc, so as to increase
instead of diminishing            the    virtual      thickness of the edges               of   the
apertures.        The result was very striking.                      Such a siren        gives    a
sound whose intensity is not sensibly increased                        by   a   powerful      blast
from an organ bellows.             It   produces strong currents of air through
the holes in the fixed disc, whose direction                    in   general depends upoa
tho direction       in which the rotating disc is                    made   to revolve;         and
especially does so when the copper plates are inclined to the surface
of that disc.        When    the discs are both furnished with these plates,
turned       in opposite directions,               the result is still more           striking.
Various         other modifications           have       occurred to me, and are now
under trial,        especially one for producing                  currents alternately in
opposite      directions through the holes.
     By bringing up      a flat    plate towards the instrument, the quality
of the sound is altered in a remarkable manner, and to such an
extent that it seems well adapted                     for rapid Morse-signalling.               As
this instrument requires no work to be spent except                              in turning      it,
a   very large number may be kept continuously at work at once by the
same expenditure        of power        as   is   required for the intermittent roaring
of   a   single fog-siren.
