                       Chairman's Opening Address.
                                (Read December     2, 1895.)
     I have  to congratulate        the Society on the re-appointment to our
 Presidential      Chair of Lord          Kelvin, first of British Physicists.
 Five years     ago, as you are        aware, Lord Kelvin hecame President
 of the Royal Society of London,                 at the    urgent request of that
 body.     This is not      the first time,    I  may remind you, that we have
 provided    a  President       for the London Society.           The Philosophical
 Society of Edinburgh, as our body was known before                       it received
 the Royal Charter authorising             it to  assume its present designation,
 gave two Presidents          to the Royal Society of London — namely, the
 Earl of Morton and Sir John Pringle, Bart.
     In his Address, delivered              two    years ago,     our  respected ex-
 President    took note of some of the more important                    papers  com
 municated       to    the     Society    during     the    immediately     preceding
 Sessions.     I think I can hardly          do better than follow his example.
.But    before   making        the attempt,      I  wish briefly to refer to the
 successful completion           within the present year of         a great national
 undertaking.        I  allude,     of course,     to the famous      " Challenger "
 Expedition.        Our Library has now received the two volumes of
 Summary of Results, with Appendices, which complete the Society's
 set of the fifty volumes of Reports of the Scientific Results of the
 Voyage of H.M.S.            Challenger.       These voluminous       Reports form
 by far the largest contribution             hitherto made to Marine Zoology.
 Indeed,    their publication         marks an epoch         in this department of
 science.     Hardly       less   important      are   they    as  contributions    to
oceanography and cognate              sciences,    while they have at the        same
 time added greatly to our knowledge of insular floras and faunas.
 As Editor and part Author of these Reports, and as Director of the
work in connection with their publication, Dr Murray has had
a   laborious    and engrossing          task  ;   and   it may well     be  doubted

whether, with all his ability and energy, he could have brought
the work to so successful a conclusion, had it not been for him                    a
labour of love.      In offering him their hearty congratulations, the
Council are not without       the hope that the manifest success            which
has attended the conduct and completion of the                   " Challenger      "
Expedition may weigh with H.M.'s Government,                 and induce them
to accede to the proposal now being pressed upon them for                 a   well-
appointed Expedition      to Antarctic    Regions.
    I would now turn attention to some of the work accomplished by
Fellows during the     past two Sessions.        In the time at my disposal,
it  is obviously impossible to notice all the papers, which, for one
reason or another, might          be   considered     of importance.         Some
selection must be made, and perhaps           I shall  be pardoned     if  I  limit
attention very much to those which have most interested myself.
    Dr Pole, in     a  notable paper,     lias given some account of the
development of our knowledge of Colour-Blindness               (from which he
himself   is a sufferer),  beginning with the first well-authenticated
case — that of Dalton      — -and coming down to the researches and
discussions    of Young,       Helmholtz,      Stokes,    Clerk-Maxwell,        and
 others.   The Author analyses the relation of colour-blind sensations
 to those of normal vision, and discusses             the   import   of certain
 variations  found    to exist   in different colour-blind        persons.       Dr
 Peddie    has  also   communicated        to   the   Society    some     curious,
 investigations  in this interesting subject.
    Dr Whiting      read a paper      on the Comparative         Histology      and
 Physiology   of the Spleen, as found in twenty-two different kinds
 of animals, embracing all the typical         vertebrates   — from   the fish to
 man.    The paper is crowded with anatomical details,             which evince
 long-continued     and careful      research.      The    general   conclusion
 arrived at by the Author is that the giant-cells are riot phagocytes.
 After  caTeful study of the development of the nuclei of the young
 red-blood cells, he is opposed to the view that the extended nuclei
 are absorbed   by the giant-cells of the spleen.
    Dr Buchanan Young, having                devised a new apparatus             for
 counting    Bacterial   Colonies, has      described and figured it in             a
 communication to the Society.           Dr Young       is of opinion that the
 apparatus at present in use — that of Von Eemarch — is so far faulty

 4            Proceedings     of Royal Society of Edinburgh.                [t
 that  it does   not permit of the whole contents of the tube being
 actually counted, and thus gives only rough approximations.                     It
 was   with the view of overcoming this defect that the Author
 devised his new apparatus.           He has also contributed a paper on
 the Chemical and Bacteriological Examination of Soil, with special
 reference to the soil of grave-yards.         He finds that the number of
 micro-organisms    present in grave-yard         soil   exceeds  the number
 present in virgin soil in a very marked degree.
    Another subject relating       to  Public Health is treated of by          Dr
 Hunter Stewart in         a  paper on the Estimation          of Carbon and
 Nitrogen in Organic Substances, by the Kjeldhal method, and its
 application to the analysis of potable waters.           In this communica
tion, the Author gives the results of the analysis of potable waters
in Midlothian and the adjoining counties.
    Great interest   is now taken by the authorities            in all matters
relating   to Public     Health.      Everyone    who     can  look   back     for
thirty or forty    years   must recognise the advance that has been
made all along the line.        But the reference     to  Dr Young's and Dr
Hunter Stewart's      investigations      reminds    me that even      in  these
late days we often run the risk of being poisoned ourselves or of
poisoning    others by selecting        sites for cemeteries and sewage-
fields without first     considering     the  geological    structure    of the
ground.     When we      are disposing of decaying         organic matter we
should always ask ourselves the question — Do we know in what
direction   the natural      underground      drainage     will transport the
products    of decay   1    In disposing of our dead and our refuse
matter, unless we can answer that question without hesitation, we
may be taking sure means         for the propagation and dissemination
of disease.
   Professor T.   E. Frasbr     has given us two most important          papers
on producing Immunity against Serpents' Venom, and on the                 Anti
dotal Properties    of the Blood-Serum         of the Immunised       Animals.
These communications are crowded with the details of varied and
carefully-conducted experiments, and are of great scientific interest.
Let  us hope that the antidote described by the           Author will    be the
means of reducing      the great mortality that results from the bites
of venomous serpents.
   Professor   Rutherford has treated of the measurement of the

action-times, he has found, differ from those of certain German
observers.           That for sight         was mostly between                 O20 and 0'22 of                 a
second    ;   for hearing, from               0"15 to         016 of         a second    ;    for touch,
from 0-1416 to 0'1906 of a second.
   Dr John Murray                    and     Mr Robert Irvine                  have     discussed            the
occurrence of Oxides of Manganese in Fresh and Soa Water, with
special reference to the lochs of the West of Scotland.                                      They point
out that manganese in combination with silica is present                                              in many
of the rocks within                the drainage areas of those lochs, and that this,
in all probability,        is the source of the dioxide of manganese                                   present
in marine          deposits.        The silicates containing manganese arc broken
up, and        the manganese                converted into              a bi-carbonate,               which is
eventually          deposited as manganese                   dioxide.
   Mr John Aitkbn, in addition                         to two interesting papers                       on the
Hazing Effects of Atmospheric Dust, and                                 on Breath       Figures, gave
an interesting communication on the number of dust particles in
the atmosphere             of certain         places         in     Great     Britain     and on the
Continent.            He pointed out                the remarkable fact that at                       Kingair-
loch     and other places,                 when the sky was entirely clouded,                                the
number of dust particles showed no tendency to rise                                           as the day
advanced       ;    with       a   clear    sky, however, the number of particles
increased, and generally in proportion to the amount of clear sky.
Much of        the dust is so fine that               it will scarcely         settle of itself, but
the    deposition of vapour on the                         particles         causes them              to form
rain-drops         and   fall, and so the air is purified.
   Dr Buchan, in               an elaborate         paper, has insisted that the                       prevail
ing winds of the globe, in their direct and indirect effects, are the
most     powerful         agents      concerned in                 oceanic     circulation.                They
originate and maintain the surface-currents of the ocean                                          ;    and the
influence of these currents                   is,   through friction,           felt to      a        depth of
probably several            hundred fathoms.                      In intertropical       regions the
prevailing           trade-winds            drive      the         surface-currents           westwards
towards the western shores                     of the continents, and there, accord
ingly,   a    greater depth of warm water                         is   found in the upper layers
of the ocean             than elsewhere.                  Except         where     the rainfall                is
abnonnally           heavy, this           water     is   not only very warm but has                           a
higher salinity than the general average of the ocean.                                       It       is   one of

 6            Proceedings      of Royal Society of Edinburgh.                  [sess.
 the most remarkable          results of   the inquiry that      these    areas    of
high surface-temperature and high salinity are found represented
at all depths down to the bottom of the sea, with just a tendency
to extend     with increase of depth.          On the other hand,           on   the
 eastern   sides of the oceans, whence the trade-winds             start on their
 course,   there   is an upwelling        of colder water from the greater
 depths    towards    the surface,      in   a manner     similar   to what       Dr
 Murray, in     a paper read some years ago to this Society, showed to
 occur in the case of the Scottish lochs when strong winds sweep
 over their surface.        These cold areas of a lower surface-temperature
 and salinity are also continued          down to the bottom, with a like
 tendency to expansion of the areas with descent.                   It  is highly
 probable that the restriction of these          respective areas to the same
 parts of the ocean for all depths would             not have obtained       if the
 depth of the ocean in comparison to its extent had not been so
 insignificant.     The    presence  of ice-cold water at the bottom of the
 ocean   in all latitudes implies     a constant supply of water of a very
low temperature from the Southern and the Antarctic Oceans, and,
 in a less degree, from the Arctic Ocean.           This slow-moving current
 of cold water athwart the^bottom of all parts of the ocean is effected,
 on the one hand, by the reduction in intertropical regions of the

gravities of the ocean in high latitudes together with the head
 of water accumulated there by the S.W. winds of the Northern
 and the    N.W. winds of the Southern              Hemisphere.       There       are
subsidiary    causes   which powerfully        influence oceanic     circulation.
 Chief among these      are abnormally heavy rainfalls       — such   as  occur in
the west of the Pacific ; under-currents            of high temperature and
salinity   from the Mediterranean           and   the Red Sea ; the causes
leading to the extensive upwelling seen in the Pacific to the south
east of the Sandwich         Islands, and similar positions in the Atlantic
and Indian Oceans         ;  and the intertropical     position of the line of
lowest mean barometric pressure,           resulting   in a temperature much
higher in the North than in the South Atlantic, and much higher
in the South than in the North Pacific Ocean.

his researches on Hygrometry,          in which    he describes the apparatus

used by him to measure         the vapour     in the   atmosphere     by weighing
the water extracted from        it when dried.        Experiments were carried
on at Ben Nevis       Observatory, at Fort-William, and at Montpellier
by Mr Herbertson and several            assistants.     The results obtained at
these   places   agree so well that they have enabh'd              the  Author     to
construct tables      showing the relations of vapour-pressure, atmos
pheric pressure,     and temperature throughout            a considerable range.
He   also discusses    the reduction of the readings of the Dry and Wet
Bulb Hygrometer,        as given by different authorities, shows wherein
these   differ, and how far the present            set of experiments throws
light on this important question in practical meteorology.
   Mr J. C. Bbattie has given us a paper on the Relation                   between
the Variation of Resistance in Bismuth in             a Steady Magnetic Field,
and the Rotatory or Transverse Effect.               One important       feature  in
this paper is the novel mode of experiment, the magnetisation being
determined by the resistance change, so that the study of the Hall
Effect   is materially      simplified.      The     anomalous behaviour          of
Bismuth     is carefully studied under various conditions, and after
being subjected to varied mechanical treatment.
   This Society      has,  for many years, been particularly             strong in
mathematical and physical experimental science,                  and   I think it
will  be allowed by those        who have followed the work of the past
two    Sessions that our reputation in this respect               has been     fully
maintained.      Professor Chrystal        has communicated a fundamental
theorem    regarding the Equivalence of Systems of Ordinary Linear
Differential Equations, and its application to the Determination of
the Order and the Systematic Solution of a Determinate System of
Equations,     and Professor Chum Brown has shown us, by means
of a series of elaborate and ingenious models, how              a  1'arallelopiped
can be divided into Tetrahedra.
   In his   paper   on the    Kinetic Theory of          Gases,   Professor    Tait
pointed out, some years ago, that the celebrated                equation of Van
der Waals      had been obtained by an unsound process,                   and  thus
could not be correct.        He found it inconsistent witli the results of
     "               "
his    Challenger       work on the compression of water under great
pressure.     In  a recent paper     in our Proceedings       he returns to this
question, basing his tests          upon    the   lately-published      results of
Amagat's splendid work.            The comparison is curious.          From Van

der Waals' equation it is shown that the ratio of the pressures
required to reduce the volume of a fluid by                         10   per cent,      and
by  5 per cent,     respectively, cannot lie between about 2-3 and 2-8.
But Amagat's experiments show that, in all the seven liquids he
examined (bodies as different as water, alcohol, and ether being
included), the ratio in question varies from 2"5 to 2-73.
   In another       paper, Professor         Tait    deals   with the effects of the
Rotation of      a Projectile     on the Form of its Path.               He shows that
the   main facts       were     known        to Newton,        and that he gave the
correct explanation       ;  that Robins, seventy years later, independently
re-discovered,      and     gave   beautiful       experimental        proofs of them,
though,     nowadays,        Magnus       alone     is usually      mentioned in con
nection with the subject.             Professor Tait proceeds              to show that
the   peculiar     feather-like      flight of        a   well-driven      golf-ball,   the
initial upward concavity of its             path, the      length of time     it remains
in the air, and the consequent              large increase      of its range over that
calculated    from the ordinary theory of resisted                  projectiles, are due
entirely    to   the   rapid     under-spin         which     the ball receives       when
properly struck.         He also points out that, by sufficiently increasing
the rate of rotation of a golf-ball,               it  may be made         to move in a
path   which has       a   kink  !
   Dr Sprague'h paper, entitled                 a New Algebra, treats of some of
the different       kinds of operations             which      may be     performed on
permutations of the first natural numbers.                     It  consists   mainly of    a
development of the laws according to which the symbols denoting
the seven     operations      combine with each other.                It  is found that
these laws      differ in several         respects      from the rules of ordinary
Algebra, and any other calculus known to the Author,                          who there
fore thinks that the somewhat ambitious title of the paper                       — a New
 Algebra — may be justified.             It   appears, from the examples              given
of the application of his method,                that it is very closely connected
with    the    theory of numbers            ;   and one of the results obtained
throws some light on the theorems                     of Fermat and Wilson.
   Dr Knott's        paper     on Recent Innovations              in Vector Theory is
controversial in character.            Its    aim   is to refute the arguments            of
certain critics who have asserted                 that some of the principles of
Hamilton's Quaternions are unnatural, paradoxical, or lacking the
characteristics of fundamental geometrical principles.                       The Author

also examines the several      systems    of vector analysis, which these
critics  believe to be superior        to the quaternion        system.      His
general    conclusion is that the rival systems          cannot compare        in
coherency, power, and flexibility,       with quaternions, of which they
are, at best, half-hearted imitations.
    Professor    Cayley,   in   a   paper   entitled    Co-ordinates    versus
Quaternions, has said that, while co-ordinates are applicable to the
whole science of geometry,       quaternions seem to be      a particular and
very artificial    method for treating such       parts   of the science       of
3-dimensional geometry       as are most naturally discussed         by means
of the rectangular    co-ordinates.    Professor Tait, on the other hand,
holds that Cayley's views are only applicable to Hamilton's                 first
conception of the quaternion, which was nothing more than                 a  full
development of imaginaries, but not to Hamilton's subsequent                con
ception of the quaternion      as an organ   of expression,    giving simple,
comprehensive, and transparently intelligible           embodiment to the
most complicated of real geometrical and physical relations.
    Amid his laborious, but happily hopeful, and so far successful
work in developing the educational institutions of Cape Colony,
Dr Mum       has found time to continue his scientific researches.            He
has given     us  a  paper  on Sylvester's     Problem    in Elimination, in
dealing with      which he has found an axisymmetric determinant,
which     is  the square    of   its own    primary co-axial minors.           In
another paper, he has shown that the difference             between   any two
terms    of the adjugate determinant         is divisible    by the    original
determinant.
    Although this Society is literary as well as scientific, we are not
often favoured with literary communications.                The only paper
received during the past Session which might be classed as such is
one by Professor D'Arcy Thompson on Ancient Symbolism.                      It is
scientific, however, as well as literary — being an attempt to extract
the   hidden    astronomical    meaning
                                           " from   graven     emblem,     from
symbolic monument, from the orientation of temple-walls, from the
difficult interpretation of Hellenic names of Hero and Heroine, of
solar god and lunar goddess,         of mysterious monster and fabled
bird, of celestial river and starry hill."
    During the last and    the preceding Session we have been favoured
with    addresses from Professor      Flinders Petrie, Dr Munro, and

 10            Proceedings    of Royal Society of Edinburgh.                   [sess.
 Professor     M'Kendrick, which were delivered at the request of the
 Council.      Professor   Petrie's address was on a hitherto            unknown
 race that held     Upper Egypt between the Vlth and             Xlth    dynasties.
 In   the first of   Dr Munro's      addresses,    he discussed the      Rise and
 Progress     of Anthropology,      while the      second    was  devoted to an
account       of   Lake-dwelling      Research.       Professor    M'Kendrick's
communication         was    on   the   Phonograph,         with   Experimental
 Illustrations.
     We have also had        addresses    from the Duke of          Argyll       and
 Dr John Murray —the former of whom treated of the glacial
 phenomena in the neighbourhood              of Inveraray, and the latter of
 the remarkable       and hitherto      unknown        forms   of   life dredged
 from    the floor of    the ocean     during     the famous voyage         of the
 " Challenger."
     Before concluding     these very incomplete         references to the work
 of the past two Sessions,       I must   not omit to mention Sir         William
 Turner's careful review of the evidence adduced by M. Dubois as
 to the occurrence of a specimen of the long-looked-for " missing
link."     The remains described by Dubois consist of                a calvaria, a
 femur,    and two     teeth, which wore found embedded in certain
ancient      river-deposits.    The    bones     are    associated with       other
 mammalian remains.          According   to Dubois, the skull-cap especially,
and the other relics in a minor degree, show a union of simian and
human characters       ; and he thinks he is justified in assigning them
to a new genus — Pithecanthropus            erectus.    Sir William Turner, in
his address,      while admitting     the low type of the skull-cap, was
nevertheless of opinion        that it is distinctly human, as also are the
femur     and the teeth.       Since   Sir William's paper        was     read,   M.
 Dubois has visited Edinburgh, and brought with him the actual
specimens.       After   carefully    examining       these    most    interesting
remains, Sir William Turner admits that the skull is of a consider
ably lower type than the figures in M. Dubois' original                 paper had
led him to believe.          He still thinks, however, that the balance of
evidence is in favour of its being human.              It  would seem that the
British and Foreign anthropologists who have handled the specimens
are divided in opinion.        Many agree in considering that Dubois has
found a     " missing link "
                               ; some,  again, think the skull is that of a
large ape ; while others maintain that it is simply that of a very

low type of man.                   As    a geologist,    I   have   no title to express any
opinion as to the character of this remarkable calvaria, but                                      I    must
say that      I    am impressed by the fact that the remains were obtained
from deposits which seem to be of greater                              age       than those which
have yielded the earliest relics of man in Europe.                                   According            to
Dubois, the deposits are not only of great extent and thickness,
but they are charged                    with the relics of          an extinct            mammalian
fauna.        These remains have yet to be described                         ;    but from what             I
learned in conversation with M. Dubois, there                                    can be but            little
doubt that they belong to a Pliocene horizon.                                     Now,        when one
recalls the fact that the oldest skulls obtained from Pleistocene
deposits in Europe                — although not           so small      and ape-like as the
presumably much older calvaria from Java — are nevertheless of
a    low type, one cannot but be much impressed                                   by Dubois'            dis
covery.           It   is,   to say the least,       highly   suggestive           that the oldest
crania should have this character,                    and that the most ancient of all
should be the most apedike.
     During        the past Session we have added                   to our number fourteen
Ordinary          Fellows,        and four British           and six         Foreign          Honorary
Fellows, but we have at the same time to lament the loss, by death,
of    ten Ordinary Fellows,                   and    two   British and three Foreign
Honorary           Fellows.         Of     these,   the usual obituary notices will, in
due    time be communicated to the Society, but                                  I   may          on    this
occasion          be allowed        to say     a    few words regarding each of our
departed          Associates.
     Amongst the losses which come specially home to us                                  as   a   Society
is   that of our former President, Lord Moncbkiff.                                I      regret that     I
can devote only              a   passing    notice to his memory.                  But the duty of
delineating his distinguished career                    as advocate          and judge must be
left to   a   more capable hand than mine.                     We      were fortunate indeed
in having him for our President, and                       I    feel    sure that         1   voice the
opinion of our Society when                  I      say that he most worthily                  occupied
the    Chair.          The brilliant address which he delivered here, giving
a    "Review of the Hundred Years' History of                           the .Society,"            and his
charming Biographical Notice of the late                        Mr Campbell Swinton of
Kimmerghame,                 are admirable alike        in matter        and       manner.             Lord
Monereiff was elected               a    Fellow of    the Society       in       1870.

   Mr Patrick Dudgeon of Cargen, who died on 9th February
1895, at   the ripe   age of 78, combined        in himself very happily the
characters of savant and country            gentleman.     As    a mineralogist
he was a recognised authority, and few could equal his knowledge
of the mineralogy       of his native land.         Amongst     other scientific
papers,  he wrote a historical        account of the finding and working
of gold in Dumfriesshire.           He also published         numerous papers
on the Place-names of Scotland, and compiled a Glossary of the
Galloway     Dialect.     As showing his public spirit,         I may mention
that he recently established at Cargen a circulating library, which
is free to all      residents    in the neighbourhood.           He was much
esteemed    as a landlord,      and endeared himself         to his friends by
his sterling character and kindliness.            He was elected    a Fellow of
the Society in 1860.
   Dr Thomas A. G.        Balfour     was educated at the     High School and
the University of Edinburgh.            He at first studied for the ministry,
entering the Theological       Hall of the New College, but subsequently
turned his attention       to medicine, and having        taken the degree of
M.D., practised for forty years in this city.                He wrote several
works, of which the best known              are,  All  Nature a Symbol, and
 Christ's Jewels, and he contributed         a number     of articles to perio
dicals.    He died on 10th March of the present year, at the age
of 70.     He was elected a Fellow of the Society in 1870.
    Dr Benjamin Carrington graduated as M.D. at Edinburgh, and
subsequently     became      Medical    Officer of Health      for Eccles.    He
 had a European        reputation     as a cryptogamic      botanist, and was
a copious contributor       to scientific journals.     His extensive Crypto
 gamic    Herbarium      is now     in the Museum         of   Owens    College,
 Manchester.      He died on 18th January 1895.                He was elected    a
 Fellow of this Society in       1874.
    The Kev. Thomas        Turnbull       was  appointed to the first charge
 of the Established       Church at Lesmahagow.             He discharged his
 pastoral duties with much acceptance,            and his sudden death       will
be long regretted by his parishioners, and especially by the poor,
 to whom     he   is said to have displayed          " unbounded liberality."
 He died on 22nd May          1894, at the early age of 46 — the same year
in which    he had been elected a       Fellow of our Society.

Engineering College, Rourkee, and Examiner in Chemistry for the

a gold      medal from the University of Edinburgh for his thesis on
" Sulphureous         Mineral Waters," and was author of              a  Prize Essay
on   "The Mineral Waters of Scotland."                   He was also author of
" Analytical         Tables   for the Use       of    Students of Medicine "            ;

He died      on 16 th   January of the present       year.    He   became a     Fellow
of the Society in 1863.
    It  is unnecessary to refer to the career            of our much regretted
Fellow, Dr Cleghorn of Stravithie,                  as Professor      M'Intosh      has
already communicated to the Society a full and interesting                      sketch
of his life.
    Mr Peter Denny             was   born at Dumbarton         in   1820.      He   was
head     of the well-known           firm of William       Denny and Brothers,
which       has    launched     over 500    vessels,   representing       upwards of
 600,000 tons.         The firm's shipbuilding establishment is admittedly
 one of the most complete and scientifically equipped in this
 country       or elsewhere.       Mr Denny      was    also   the founder of the
 large engineering establishment of Denny & Co.                     In   1870 he was
 appointed        one of a Parliamentary       Committee       on designs of ships
 of war.       He was for     some time Provost of Dumbarton,             and, before
 the days of school-boards, maintained in that town                 a  school for the
 children of the poorer          classes.   Subsequently       he founded several
 bursaries       to be   competed for by pupils under the local School
 Board.        He received the      degree of   LL.D. from Glasgow, and             was
 decorated with several foreign orders of knighthood.                     He    became
 a  Fellow of this Society in         1876.
     Mr Alexander Goodman More, in conjunction with Dr David
  Moore, published in 1866 an excellent account of the geographical
  distribution of plants in Ireland, under the title of " Contributions
  towards      a   Cybele Hibernica."        He    also   prepared      a  list of the
  birds of Ireland in 1885, in connection with the Dublin Science
  and   Art Museum        ;  and subsequently published           a  capital guide to
  the   Natural History Department             of the same institution.              He

succeeded    Dr Carte       as    Curator     of    that Department,      but after
twenty years' service was compelled by illness to resign in 1887                   —
the same year in which he became a Fellow of this Society.
    Dr John Shand, after          a distinguished       University   career, gradu
ated  in Medicine     at  Edinburgh        in 1844.       For   some time he held
resident   appointments         in the Royal Infirmary,           and   afterwards
became    Assistant    Pathologist.         Leaving     Edinburgh,    he practised
with much     success at    Kirkcudbright, where            he held nearly every
public   appointment      open     to one of his profession.          He   was very
popular, and    a  welcome visitor in cot and country mansion alike.
Like all the members of bis family               he was an accomplished, not
to say a daring, horseman.             He     was    fond of telling how, on a
certain occasion,     he astonished       the Galloway        Hunt with the per
formance     of   a nag    which he had picked up for the not very
extravagant sum of £10.             Joining    the   hunt   one day, he found his
sporting friends balked by a formidable               6-feet wall, over which his
wonderful purchase flew like          a  bird — giving     a lead that none of the
others dared to follow.           In early manhood he was unfortunately
prostrated by a hemiplegic attack.              Recovering, he moved to this
city, where he continued            to practise      his profession.     He    was   a
Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians,                     and was     elected   a
 Fellow of our Society         so recently as last year.          He died in the
 present year, on 12th March, at the age of 72.
    Thomas    Hrnby Huxley was born at Ealing, in Middlesex,                   on 4th
 May   1825.    He    was educated at        Ealing School and Charing Cross
 Hospital, and served as Assistant-Surgeon                on   H.M.S.   "Victory,"
 and "Rattlesnake," from 1846-50.                 In   1854    he became     Palaeon
 tologist to the Geological Survey, and Professor of Natural History
 in the Royal School of Mines, and,                1855,  Fullerian Professor of
 Physiology at the Royal Institution.               During his life    he occupied
 many    prominent      posts.     Thus in       1874    he   was installed      Lord
 Rector of Aberdeen University ; was Rede Lecturer at Cambridge
 in 1883,   and    President      of the Royal         Society from    1883-1885.
 This is not the    place, nor am       I  competent to give any account of
 Huxley's work       as a man of science.             He himself had       a  far too
 modest estimate of that work, when he wrote as follows                  :
                                                                             " I have
 subordinated any reasonable or unreasonable ambition for scientific
 fame which     I   may have permitted myself               to entertain to other

ends    : — to the popularisation of           science     ;  to the development and
organisation        of scientific education       ;   and     to the     endless   series  of
battles and skirmishes             over evolution."             Despite      these   modest
remarks, we all know that his original investigations alone have
given him        a distinguished place among British biologists.                     He was
elected a Fellow of our Society in 1876.
     We     have    also lost    the genial Professor               Blackib.       Born   in
Glasgow in 1809, he was appointed successively to the Chair of
Latin       Literature    in Aberdeen,        and      to    the Chair of Greek in
Edinburgh. It has been               said   of him       :
                                                            " There was no winter in
his year, no sorrow in his           song.     He was a perennial fountain of
sweetness        and light.     There never came              a   frost keen enough        to
freeze the silvery column as            it   rose, nor a wind           strong enough to
break into drift its melodious fall."                 He contributed several papers
to the Transactions          of this Society        ;  and his enthusiasm for the
language of Greece in its ancient and modern phases gave                             a keen
zest to the communications on the subject with which he favoured
lis.    He    became a     Fellow of    the Society        in   18G3, and died on 2nd
March of the present year.
     Arthur Cayley          was born at Richmond,               Surrey, on 16th August
1821.        He graduated       at Trinity College, Cambridge, in                1812, was
called to the bar in 1819, and became Sadlerian Professor of Pure
Mathematics          at Cambridge in 1863.                Those who are capable            of
appreciating his work say of him, that "while he was cosmopolitan
in his mathematics,          he was a master           in    every branch."         Perhaps
he     will   be best    remembered        as   the    creator of an entirely new
branch        of   mathematics,       by his      discovery          of   the   Theory     of
Invariants.         The Royal Society's Catalogue contains the titles of
 724 papers        by Cayley, down to 1883.                 He became an Honorary
 Fellow of our Society in           1865, and       died on January 26th of the
 present year.
     James Dwight Dana was born on 12th February 1813 at Utica,
U.S. of America. His appointment as mathematical instructor of
midshipmen in the U.S. navy gave him opportunities of travelling
 which he used to the best advantage.                        Ho subsequently became
Mineralogist         and Geologist       to   the U.S.           Exploring Expedition
which was to circumnavigate the globe,                        under the command of
Charles Wilkes.            In  the   course    of the voyage            his party had to

 take to the boats, and some hours afterwards they saw the vessel
 which had      been     their home for three years disappear          beneath     the
 waves.     In    1845 he became          Professor    of  Geology and Natural
 History at Yale College.             Dana was a very hard worker and a
 prolific  writer.       Among his most important            publications   are    the
 Reports     of     the Wilkes        Expedition      on  Geology,     Corals,    and
 Crustaceans     ;    his   " System of       Mineralogy," his " Manual of
 Geology,"
               " Corals and Coral Islands," and " Characteristics of
 Volcanoes."         He is the author of other manuals and of upwards
 of 200 separate         papers.    Dana was distinguished as an observer,
 but he also possessed in a high degree the power of generalising.
 His manuals of Mineralogy             and    Geology are      probably as much
 used in Europe as they are in America.                  He died on 15th April
 1895.
    Sven    Loven was born at Stockholm in 1809, graduated as
 D.  Phil,  at the University of Lund in 1829, and after a year in
 Berlin (1830-31) devoted himself to the study of Zoology. He
 particularly      investigated     the marine      fauna round     the coasts of
 Scandinavia,        and    conducted     the   first  scientific  expedition       to
 Spitzbergen.        In   1841   he became      Keeper    of the Department of
 Lower Evertebrates in the State Museum of Natural History at
 Stockholm.         He is the author of many scientific memoirs, the
most important          of which are       published     by the Swedish       Royal
Academy of Sciences.             He   was   elected a Fellow of our Society in
 1881, and died on 3rd September last.
    Louis Pasteur, who died on 28th September last, was elected
an Honorary Fellow of this Society in 1874.                    His whole career,
as you are aware,          has been characterised by a series          of brilliant
researches,    to only a few of         which    can reference be made         here.
Some of his earliest work was successfully devoted to the structure
of crystals.          Subsequently      he   discovered     the true    nature      of
fermentation.         Disproving the theory of Liebig, that fermentation
was simply the chemical decomposition of bodies arising from                      the
unstable equilibrium          of their molecules, he showed that all types
of fermentation are produced by microscopic organisms — bacteria
being the chief agents by which the complex constituents of plants
and animals are brought back to simple forms capable of serving
again as food for plants.          The nature of fermentation being known,

he was able,      by a few simple directions, to put an end                    to the
soaring of wines and to the spoiling of beer and other products,
and thus for the future prevented a loss of millions to his country.
He next demonstrated that             the belief     in  spontaneous      generation
was unfounded.         As   a  direct result of Pasteur's early publications,
we all know what            a   revolution   in Surgery      was effected      by Sir
Joseph Lister.       Again, in the destruction that threatened one of
the great industries of France — silk-worm                raising — Pasteur came
to the rescue.      Owing       to the " febrine    "
                                                       disease   in  the worms, the
production had fallen from 57,000,000 lbs. to 8,000,000 lbs., when
he discovered the cause of the disease and indicated                    the remedy,
which has      since   restored the industry           to its former prosperity.
Pasteur's next triumph was over anthrax.                   At   the   time he began
his researches,     this disease had occasioned            in the     course   of two
years   the death of 62,107 oxen, 534,245 sheep, and 2,196 horses.
Having    observed     the fact that in man one attack of an infectious
disease   frequently renders an individual immune against a second,
he prepared a vaccinating virus, capable of producing a mild                     form
of anthrax      in domestic animals, in the expectation that after
recovery they would similarly be rendered immune.                        The experi
ments were       crowned        with   success,   and the        resulting    gain to
agriculturists    must     be reckoned      in millions of pounds sterling.
Pasteur's    treatment        of   hydrophobia       proceeded       on   the    same
principles.     In his Institute,       several  thousands of persons bitten
by animals       believed      to  be   rabid,  have been treated,           and the
number of deaths has been only                a little over      one   per cent.
   In   concluding      this imperfect      retrospect,     it only      remains to
congratulate the Society on its continued                activity and prosperity.
Zealous workers go to their honoured rest, and some of us that are
left are no longer in the heyday of our strength              ;   but our ranks are
always being recruited by younger seekers after truth, who will
doubtless maintain and increase            the  reputation of the Society in
the years to come.

Notes regarding, and Model of, Mass of Manufactured
      Iron, bearing date 1807, found beside Glacier de la
      Plaine Morte, Rhone Valley. By James Milne, Milton
      House Works.
                            (Read December  2, 1895.)
   Mr President       and    Gentlemen,  — During the        past   summer     I
visited for two or three weeks a new summer and winter Alpine
resort, called Hotel du Pare, built by M. Zufferey and a partner
near   the  village    of   Montana,   on the north side of the Rhone
valley,  above    Sierre,    which is situated      on a curious      park-like
plateau, with a number of lake-like           reservoirs and quantities of
timber, at an elevation of 5000 to 6000 feet.
   While enjoying       to the   full the beautiful    walks and views and

the superabundance        of flowers, many of which are now getting
comparatively     scarce   if not extinct in the older     resorts,  I  pushed
my way one day up to the Glacier           de la Plaine Morte by       a valley
several miles to the eastward of the hotel.             It is a stiff walk of
about four hours from the hotel to the Glacier, first through thick
pine woods and steep pasture, and latterly, as you penetrate the
side valley, along very steep slides of debris composed of clayey
slate and bottoms filled with very rough stones              that   have been

carried       from       the cliffs above,                 the only         vegetation           being the
numerous ranunculi, gentiana bavarica, and other Alpine flowers
familiar to     those who are accustomed                       to search for them at these
high altitudes.
  I     may here mention that we sprang a hen ptarmigan with                                                a
large brood of chicks              ;   and a few days previously, when alone in
the next valley, a grand eagle sailed over my head almost                                              within
gunshot.        I    never before          found either in the Alps,                         although       I
have a number of times come across chamois within shot.
  After visiting the Glacier and returning                                     rather tired, as the
day had been               very    sultry,        I    came       upon         this       mass    of    iron.
Naturally it attracted my attention, and                           I     stopped      to turn       it over
for examination ; but being very tired                                 I    did not wait           to take
measurements,            especially as a heavy thunderstorm had broken out
and we were anxious to get home.
  We had            a native cowherd with us, and on questioning him, he
at once made          mention of the " chevalier " in connection with this
iron.     I   jumped to the conclusion that he referred to Napoleon,
and that        this       piece       of iron was well                known;         but on        further
interrogation        I    found neither this man, nor apparently any other
about the district, had ever heard about                           it,     and the man's reference
to the "chevalier" was simply that the block of iron might have
been used by         a    shoeing smith.
   On thinking the matter over at home,                           I        was satisfied          that con
siderable interest            might attach             to this relic, so         I        determined to
again visit the spot and take particulars,                                   several       others in the
hotel also being desirous of seeing my find.
   The morning fixed on for the expedition turned out wet, with
thick mist, which reduced the party to Colonel Armstrong, E.E.,
and myself.           We     got thoroughly soaked                     at the start, and for the
first two and         a    half hours     I       quite despaired              of finding my way,
far less finding such              a    small article among such                      a   chaos of rocks
and stones.           However, the mist lifted for                         a   few minutes, and           I
found my bearings had been correct, and                            I         had struck the right
side valley          and     about the right level, and soon after the day
cleared up into brilliant sunshine and                        a   nice      breeze, which quickly
dried our clothes.
I       found the iron easily.               It       is   lying quite         close to the glacier

stream which runs down the valley, and must he buried deep under
snow for the greater part of the year.                      There are few large stones
about it.       We     crossed    several deep patches of snow to reach the
place.     I show      on the map the exact position in which the iron is
lying, but it may have travelled for                  a long distance.                  I should     be
much afraid that next summer the snow and ice may have carried
it into the bed of the           stream, where        it would        be next to impossible
to find   it,   although the place where              it   is   lying     is   nearly level, and
it   may lie for some years before reaching the stream.                                  The iron is
not, however, more than fifteen feet from                       it   just now.
     On the mountain side, directly              above, there are the remains                          of
two small huts,        a   number of slabs of wood still lying about.                               The
huts may be of recent erection, or they may be                        a   hundred years old.
"Wood does not decay rapidly buried                    under snow, or in the clear
atmosphere of these high altitudes, and the huts may possibly have
been dug out,         built and roofed with slabs of                 slate,    a   hundred years
ago.      They    are on   a   little knoll, and not in the way of avalanches.
     The iron        appears   to me to be of fine quality.                             It   has been
battered up all along the top, which implies                          a   certain amount of
malleability,        from which, and the rugged nature of the defective
corner,  I      am    inclined to think the            percentage             of carbon        is   low
enough to suggest that            it   is   wrought    iron and not cast.                    I   had   a
small file with me, and found the iron filed freely, and exposed                                       a
fairly homogeneous surface.                  The skin of oxide                is   very thin, and
the file easily went through it.                For all         the time the iron has lain
exposed,  I     do not think      it    has lost weight

various dimensions, and the rubbing                   I    made       with     a   piece of char

 of paper taken for the purpose.       The date, 1807, in hollow     figures,
 is quite distinct, with a fragment of enclosing border line.          There
 is a hole    1^  inch by  1 inch right through, and filled up with a
 1-inch bar and two iron spikes, the 1-inch bar having evidently
 been roughly cut off after being wedged in the hole.          Perhaps this
 bar was fixed in position to enable      the block to be carried easily.
 There is also a curious hole       1J inch by    \\  inch in the bottom.
 You will   see the border under the date, and three strange           rough
square indentations.       The   top has evidently      been   a  good   deal
 battered, and one end considerably staved over.
    The    opinion   I at first formed was      that the iron had been
carried there by one of Napoleon's armies, which may have made
a   futile expedition up this valley,      and   abandoned some of the
heavy baggage, the iron being part of its equipment.                The un
wieldy shape, however, does not support this theory, and the date
is too late.
    The opinion    I now  hold is that this iron has been used by some
scientific expedition as a mark, or to determine the travel of the
 glacier or surface stone.     I believe, about the year 1807, there was
 such an expedition carrying out research        in  the  Alps, and   I  feel
confident     that some of the members        of this or other kindred
 societies not only will be interested to hear of this find, but may
 possibly be able to give information which may lead to our dis
covering its origin.
    The glacier does not come down this valley, but        I have  no doubt
that in quite recent times it has extended over the edge of the
rocks in this direction for      a  considerable distance.      There is no
vegetation in the bottom where the iron is lying, but there is              a
sparse growth of various ranunculi, &c., a short distance            up the
¦sides of the valley, perhaps 100 to 150 yards above.
    The weight of the iron    I estimate at from 250 to 300 lbs.

On the Relationship of the Liver to Fats. By D. Noel
       Paton, M.D., F.E.C.P.E., Superintendent of the Research
       Laboratory of     the Royal College of Physicians, Edinburgh.
    (Abstract of a paper appearing in extenso in the Journal of Physiology,
                                February 1896.)
                           (Read December   2, 1895.)
   The liver is on the direct channel of absorption of carbohydrates
and proteids, and its connection          with the metabolism of these
substances     has been fully demonstrated.
   It is   not on the channel of absorption of fats, and its relationship
to the metabolism of fats has never been systematically investi
gated.
    The object of the present research is to elucidate this question.
    The first part of the paper is concerned with an investigation
into the methods of estimating the fats.              It is shown that after
complete      extraction   with ether, by treating the residue with
hydrochloric     acid and heat, a further amount of material may be
extracted by ether, but that       it is impossible    to say how far this    is
composed      of the fatty acids previously       combined     with   bases   as
soaps,    and how     far from the decomposition          of nuclein    bodies.
The present      research,  therefore, is concerned simply with the fats
extracted by ether.
    It  is next shown that the ether extract is no fair measure of the
 amount of fats present, since      it contains on    an average only 57 per
 cent, of fatty acids.     In estimating the amount of fats, it is       neces
 sary to determine the fatty acids, and not merely the ether extract.
 The fatty acids amount        to between 2 and 3 per cent, of the        liver
 substance.
    In the liver the proportion of palmitic and stearic acids to oleic
 acid is shown to be markedly higher than in the fats of the rest of
 the body.      Hence the liver fat has a high melting-point.
    As regards the nature of the compounds of             these fatty acids,   it
 is found    that one of the most important is lecithin.           About    one-
 half of the acids is usually combined in this             substance.    About
 2-3 per cent, of the liver, or 10 per cent, of its dry solids, is com

1895-96.]    D. Noel Paton on Relationship of Liver                to Fats.    23
posed    of lecithin.      When fat accumulates        in the liver, the pro
portion of lecithin       falls.     In connection with   the function of this
hepatic lecithin,      the    part played by lecithin      in the    egg, as the
store material for the phosphorus of the embryo,                 is pointed out,
and it is concluded that the function of the hepatic lecithin is to
fix phosphorus      as a step        towards its synthesis into the nucleo-
compounds of the body.
   The possibility of determining the amount of free fatty acids in
the ether extract of the liver is considered, and it is shown that
Hofmann's conclusions are valueless.
   The    amount of cholesterin is found            to be smaller than that
indicated by Kausch          :   in rabbits there is an       average   of 0 039
per cent, and in       cats 0-029 per cent, of the liver.          In estimating
the fatty acids, the cholesterin may thus be disregarded.
   The percentage       of ether extract not combined with fatty acids is
shown to vary greatly.             On an average it amounts to 10 per cent.
The nature of this is not considered.
   Taking the fatty        acids as a measure     of the amount of fats, the
influence of various conditions on the liver fats is investigated.
                                    A. Starvation.
    It is shown that after three           days' starvation in cats, and after
four days' in pigeons, the average amount of fatty acids in the liver
is maintained.      The importance of this in fixing waste phosphorus
as lecithin   as a step        to its reconversion to nucleo-compounds is
indicated.
                        B. Influence of various Foods.
    1. Fats. — That the fats of the food are largely stored                 in the
liver of certain animals          is shown by experiments on cats and rats.
That when      so stored they are afterwards (in cats in about seventy
hours) either metabolised in the organ or exported from it is
also shown.       That the former process goes on was indicated in
considering the function of lecithin.
    2.  Carbohydrates. — The generally accepted             statement    that the
amount of glycogen and fat corresponds              is disproved.      Food rich
 in carbohydrates     is shown to increase the liver fats.          The question
of the source of these fats is investigated, and it is shown that as

24               Proceedings     of Royal Society of Edinburgh.              [i
the glycogen disappears from the liver there is an actual increase
in the liver       fats.    That this is not     a   transport of body fats to    the
liver is indicated by the fact that the blood serum remains clear,
                                                           would
and that the melting-point of the liver fats does not fall, as
be expected if the body fata with their lower melting-point were
added.  It therefore, concluded that the fats are formed from
                  is,
the glycogen.
    3.   Proteids.      — The evidence of the production of fats from pro-
teids    is   considered.     The evidence of the proteids of the food being
a   source      of fat in the liver   is   investigated.    The evidence opposes
the view that liver fats are formed from proteids.

    In  Nature of January 24, 1895, appears an abstract               of a paper
read   before the Royal Society of Edinburgh               on March     7, 1892,
by   Dr John Murray      and     Mr Robert Irvine, and published in the
 Transactions of the Society, vol. xxxvii. part            2,  No. 23, entitled
" Chemical     Changes   between     Sea-water and Oceanic Deposits."
    This is  an account of a chemical examination              of the sea-water
salts in the water adhering to or retained in mud, with special
reference to the formation of the deposit known as " Blue Mud."
    Dittmar's analysis of      sea- water is quoted and compared         with an
analysis of mud-water.         The chief points of difference between the
two is the occurrence         in mud-water       salts  of 0"206 per cent, of
ammonium sulphate, 0-729 per cent, of magnesium carbonate,                   and
018 per    cent, of  manganous      carbonate ; also that the total salts are
low in proportion to the chlorine they contain.
    The occurrence    of ammonium sulphate in this mud, and also of
manganous carbonate,        are facts    of much interest       ; but there are
some equations given to explain the chemical changes                  which the
mud undergoes       which are not strictly in accordance             with  facts.
There are three points which         I  would desire to draw attention to         :
first, the reduction     of the sulphates        ; second,    the oxidation    of
sulphuretted hydrogen       ;    and  third, the formation of manganous
carbonate.
    The equations are written without          reference   to the part played
by water in the chemical changes           involved, but it may have been
thought     that  the  accuracy sacrificed was           compensated     by the
simpler form of the equations.
   Equation No.     1 reads as follows     : —
                        RS04     + 2C = 2C02 +     RS.—
where    R is an alkaline earth metal.
    This, as a matter of fact, expresses what takes place in the "black

studying in this connection.
    Thus, in the case of calcium sulphate its reduction in this              fashion
produces calcium sulphide, a compound which is insoluble in water.
Calcium sulphide        is the principal     constituent     of the   " black-ash     **
waste,    after the carbonate of soda has been dissolved out ;                     and
when this is left in contact with water               it gradually decomposes,,
yielding calcium sulphydrate and calcium hydroxide                  thus  : —
        (Kraushaar, Dingier'  s Polytechnisches  Journal, vol.   226, p. 412.)
                     2CaS + 2H20 = CaH2S2 + CaH202              .
    The action of air upon the calcium sulphydrate has been shown
by    the same author        to form     calcium polysulphide         and calcium
thiosulphate, CaS203. The action of carbon dioxide is well known.
    The sulphur in the mud when the sulphates have been reduced
is supposed by Messrs Murray and Irvine in part to pass into solu
tion as sulphuretted hydrogen, and then to be oxidised back to sul
phuric acid, which in turn decomposes              the carbonates and re-forms
sulphates.
                 " A certain part of the sulphides, or it may              be of   the
hydrosulphuric       acid, reduces the ferric oxide of the deposit, forming
sulphide of iron."        The sulphide of iron, it is pointed out, gives the
 characteristic blue-black colour to the great majority of blue muds.
    Now, it is     a well-known      fact that living organisms reduce the
 sulphates     and the mud becomes            more or less black or dark             in
 colour by reason of        the formation       of ferrous sulphide.          Hence,
 those   who     are  accustomed to examine             rivers   and streams        for
 pollution    first take note of the colour of            the mud, and observe
 whether     it undergoes any change, for when the pollution is inter
 mittent the mud may be red or yellow one day and black the next,
 subsequently      returning    to its original     colour.     The chemistry of
 the changes which take place between the constituents                       of such
 muds has in a great measure been explained by                 Mr J. T. Buchanan
 in  a paper
                " On the Occurrence of Sulphur in Marine Muds," etc
 (Proc. Royal Soc. Edin.           Read December 1, 1890).
     He points out the part which is played by manganese                    sulphide,

and shows that it acts like an alkaline sulphydrate in converting
ferric hydroxide         into   ferrous sulphide.       When air acts        on the
ferrous      sulphide,    sulphur    separates    according to a well-known
reaction, and ferric hydroxide is re-formed.
     In  the absence of manganese           it is doubtful whether         a similar
action takes place through the agency of calcium sulphate being
reduced to calcium sulphydrate,           as  will appear from a careful study
of the following facts which          have already been ascertained.
     It  was shown by Lothar Meyer, as far back                as 1864, that the
 sulphuretted hydrogen in mineral waters is very generally a product
 of the    alg£B   which are found in them {J. fur Pralctische Chemie,
 vol. xci.).      Cohn described a bacterium found in a well-water which
 evolved sulphuretted             hydrogen      (Beitratje    zur     Biologie    der
 Pflanzen, vol. i. part 3, 1875).         Etard and Olivier showed that in
 mineral waters sulphate of lime yields sulphuretted hydrogen, or
 even     free     sulphur     (Comptes      Rerulus,    1882).       Hoppe-Seyler
 described       the  fermentation of cellulose        (Zeitschrift fiir physio-
 lorjisdte Chemie, vol. x. part 5, 1886) by the agency of the bacillus
 amylohw.ter, and showed that the organism resolves the cellulose
 into equal volumes of methane,               CH4, and carbon         dioxide, C0.2.
 "When,     however, there were sulphates present                in the water the
 volume of carbon dioxide was greatly increased, being ten volumes
  of C02 to one volume of CH4. This arises from the oxidation of
 the methane by the sulphate in accordance with the following
  equation    : —
                                      =
                      CH4 + CaS04 CaCOs + H2S + H20.
      Sergius Winogradsky has made             a most    careful investigation of
  the life-history of various species of sulphur-bacteria or beggiatoa?
  (Botanische Zeitung, pp. 490-610, 1887).
      These organisms separate sulphur from sulphuretted hydrogen,
  and this gas is quite indispensable to their life            ;   but they cannot
  live in a saturated solution of H2S,          as was  believed by Colin.
      The sulphur which the         beggiatoae separate     from H2S is oxidised
  by them into sulphuric acid, and in this way the carbonates formed
  by the fermentation of cellulose accompanying the reduction of

     These              sulphur-bacteria     are able     to subsist       on a very minute
quantity of organic matter, and the only product of their
                                                                                     " respira
tion " is sulphuric acid. This substance is formed by                               a   process
which is termed respiration, because                       it is the   cause of a    chemical
change which sets free energy in the form of heat                                 The sulphur
which the bacteria remove from sulphuretted                            hydrogen is secreted
by the organism, and subsequently oxidised.
     As       a   matter of fact, the deoxidation                of sulphates contained        in
either fresh or sea water is due to the action of such organisms as
the bacterium mdphureum and the bacterium hydroeulphureum.
     In the Black                  Sea,   as we   know from        the paper read by          Dr
Andrussow, a large amount of sulphuretted hydrogen is dissolved                                in
the water.                 I   certainly understood       Dr Andrussow        to say, at      the
meeting of the British Association at Edinburgh, that the process
whereby sulphuretted                      hydrogen is formed is due to the bacteria,
and       I       immediately connected this statement with the known re
duction of calcium and magnesium sulphates in both sea and fresh
water by the sulphur-bacteria                     or beggiatoae.
     But it             appears,    in the translated abstract of his paper in the
Journal of the Royal Geographical Society, January 1893,                                 to be
attributed to the decomposition, after death, of a great number                                of
minute             organism and river debris.               It    is well known that the
organic materials of dead organisms cannot decompose                                except by
the operation of living organisms (Pasteur, Comptes                               Rendus, vol.
66, p. 738).                   In Dr   Andrussow's      diagram there are the following
data: —
                         " Lower Limit of Organic Life, 100 fathoms.
                           Upper Limit of H2S,          100 fathoms.
                           Upper Limit of Sulphides,    200 fathoms.
                           No organic life except bacteria."
     This certainly             appears to bear out my interpretation of his remarks.
There             is,   however,   a   note to the effect that the generation of              HjS
and of sulphides                 goes on down to     a    depth of 800 fathoms.
     It   is      now of no importance in what precise                 manner his remarks

1S95-96.]      Mr W. N. Hartley              on Changes          in Oceanic Deposits. 29
were to be interpreted, because, as a matter of fact, the actual
organism which is the cause of this change has been described                                    and
named by Zelinsky as the Bacterium Hydrosulphureum                                      Pontieum
(Proc. of      the Russian          Physical and Chemical                 Society,      vol. xxv.
part 5, 1893; also            P. and G.       C. Frankland's         Micro-Organisms              in
Water, p. 458).
 This bacterium appears                to live upon the cellulose of vegetable
debris, and it abstracts the oxygen from sulphates.
   I    must take exception to Messrs Murray and Irvine's                                explana
tion of the change which they believe takes place in solutions of
sulphuretted          hydrogen.        They        citeshow (1st)
                                                           experiments          to
that a solution of sulphuretted hydrogen in pure water, when left
to stand for     a    month, was found to be oxidised to sulphuric                            acid   ;
(2nd) that a solution of sulphuretted hydrogen in sea-water                                      was
oxidised to sulphuric acid.
   To take this latter              case first, the oxidation             is   caused      by the
bacteria in the manner already explained.                         In the first        case, where
the sulphuretted hydrogen is dissolved in pure water,                                    there    is,
according to my experience,                 no oxidation of sulphuretted hydrogen.
In January         of the present           year I        had six wide-mouthed bottles
charged with          a   litre of distilled water, which filled each of them
to about       §     its capacity.          In     succession     they were           charged     to
saturation with carefully purified hydrogen sulphide, evolved from
ferrous sulphide by the action of sulphuric                          acid.       These bottles
were kept in       a   fume chamber in full daylight, where the morning
sun could reach them.                The temperature varied from                     12° to 17° C.
In     five or six days       it   was found that the bottles did not smell of
sulphuretted hydrogen.                 In two of          them    there    had been       a   slight
 deposition      of    sulphur.        It    was     thought       that the          oxidation    of
the sulphuretted              hydrogen might              not necessarily have             formed
 sulphurous or sulphuric acid, but one of the thionic acid.                               Accord
 ingly,   a   very careful examination was made of each liquid.                                  The
 introduction of          a   little cupric chloride solution             gave no black pre
cipitate.      Iodine         solution was not decolorised.                    Barium chloride
 gave no precipitate.              Other experiments were made, but they need
not be referred to, as no evidence was obtained of any oxidation
 products being contained in the liquid.                          The gas seems to have
simply diffused out of the vessels.

30             Proceedings      of Boyal Society of Edinburgh,                   [skss.
   It    was    then    determined      to ascertain whether ferric oxide             in
presence     of oxygen would oxidise sulphuretted hydrogen solution.
Ignited ferric oxide,          also some red haematite,            were placed    in a
Lunge nitrometer with             a solution    of sulphuretted        hydrogen, and
mixed      with this     was    some oxygen, but no action took place ;            the
gas    did not diminish in volume.               When ferric oxide is replaced
by ferric hydroxide, oxidation takes              place   with great rapidity.
    It  follows, then, that sulphuretted             hydrogen is not oxidised         to
8ulphuric      acid simply by the oxygen of the air, and ferric oxide is
not acted upon by sulphuretted              hydrogen so       as  to produce ferrous
sulphide and free sulphur, according to               Dr Murray and Mr Irvine's
equation     :—
                    (4) Fe203 + 3H2S = 2FeS + S + 3H20.*
For such action         to take place      it is  necessary     that the ferric com
pound should be the hydroxide, such as is used in the purification
of  coal-gas.
    The thenno-chemical            equations     worked      out for the chemical
changes which take place               between the        organic matter and the
mineral salts in mud, show that, at each stage, there is heat evolu

processes of some,              if   not all, of these sulphur-bacteria                       ;    but let us
suppose         that there may be some organisms which act directly upon
sulphuretted hydrogen in presence of oxygen without the separation
of sulphur,       it   will     be seen that the heat evolved under such con
ditions     is   nothing like so great               as    in the former case             :

The difference between the changes in (a) and (b), taken together,

favour of the former, and                       it   is    therefore in the highest                    degree
probable that the former chemical change                                    is   actually that which
takes place.

    I   will now refer to         the occurrence     of manganese       carbonate     in
the mud-water, which               was  found    to amount to        (H8   per   cent.,
although        no manganese        was found in the sea-water.
     In   a paper    by  Mr W. E. Adeney, in the Scientific Proc, Royal
Dublin Society, April               1894,  a   very lucid      account is given of
the     changes which take place in sludge derived from sewage which
had been submitted to the action of permanganate.
     It was     found that the manganese           dioxide which appears to be
the      first product of the reducing action of the                 organic matter
became converted into manganese                 carbonate      whether in presence
of much water or            not.     The author suggests         that the reduction
and conversion into a carbonate of such                a stable   oxide is due to       a
similar action to that whereby Gayon                 and   Dupetit    found nitre to
be converted into nitrogen and potassium                     carbonate,   under     the
influence of two micro-organisms isolated                from sewage and named
the a and /? bacterium denitrificans.
     It is supposed that the available oxygen in the manganic oxide
 is used up by an organism in destroying the carbon                        of organic
 matter, and by thermo-chemical equations                   it  is shown that      this
 can be       a  considerable source       of energy to the organism.             It   is
 extremely        probable that the         manganese      in this    case   furnishes
 oxygen to such an organism                as the bacillus amylobacter,         and is
 utilised in the destruction of cellulose, or in destroying the methane
 which is evolved during            the fermentation of this substance.
                                       Conclusions.
      1.  The sulphates in fresh and            sea   water mud are reduced           to
  carbonates      and sulphuretted hydrogen by the fermentation of cellu
  lose through the agency of different species of bacteria.
      2.  We have       no evidence       whatever that calcium          sulphide     or
  calcium sulphydrate            is formed in      the course      of the chemical
  change,     and therefore the equations          1, 2, 3  of Messrs Murray and
  Irvine     are not to be relied         on  for an exact       explanation of the
  reactions which occur in mud-waters.

    3. Sulphuretted     hydrogen is not oxidised simply by atmospheric
air to sulphuric acid at ordinary temperatures.
    4. Sulphur-bacteria     secrete  sulphur which they separate         from
sulphuretted hydrogen, a compound which is essential to their life.
This sulphur is then oxidised by the bacteria to sulphuric acid,
which acts upon the carbonates and again forms sulphates.
    5.  The formation of      manganese    carbonate appears to be due to
an action on manganic         oxide similar    to that   which   operates   on
sulphates in presence       of cellulose undergoing fermentation.
    Note. — The process of sulphur fermentation was first noticed by
me    in 1870.     It occurred in stagnant water which filtered through
a bed of new red sandstone after       it had  passed through mud      highly
charged with vegetable ddbris.         In 1872, when studying the life-
history and chemical changes caused by the bacteria, called at that
time vibrios,     I found  that beer was capable of undergoing a very
powerful      sulphur   fermentation.     It  was  not then suspected       of
being due to bacteria, but believed to be the effect of an abnormal
fermentation caused by the common forms of yeast (saccharomyces).
On the publication of Cohn's        paper in 1875, giving      an account    of
a bacterium found      in well-water, which evolved sulphuretted hydro
gen, an    explanation was afforded capable of application to all the
facts known at the time.
     It  may easily be shown        by thermo-chemical       equations    that
 neither organic matter nor carbon itself can reduce sulphates such
 as   calcium   sulphate to sulphides      except at   a high   temperature,
 because    the thermal effect results in an absorption of heat under
 the    most favourable conditions     for such chemical      changes.

   On 16th December 1895 a paper                        written by Professor W. N.
Hartley, F.R.S., Royal College of Science, Dublin, was read before
this Society "On the Cause and Nature of Chemical Changes
occurring         in Oceanic Deposits," in which he criticised and took
exception to certain conclusions we had arrived at, which formed
the    basis      of a paper      read by us      in March         1802,    and published
in the Transactions of             the Society,        Vol. xxxvii., Part ii., Xo.              23,
under the title " On              the Chemical Changes which                    take    place    in
the Composition              of Sea-water     associated with        Blue Muds on the
Floor of the Ocean."
   At the time of writing his               paper Professor       Hartley        had not seen
ours, and was only in possession of the necessarily                        curtailed notice
of it which appeared              in Nature of January 24, 1895, f rom which
he appears to have drawn inferences that a                       fuller knowledge would
have       altered.      Practically,    with the exception of one or two of
our experimental results, Professor Hartley is in accord with us                                 so
far   as   the principal results are concerned.                  In taking exception             to
the formulae by which we endeavour to explain the decomposition
of sulphates in sea-water               in the presence of organic matter and
ferric-hydrate,          or ferruginous clay, he assumes the equations we
use to mean             the same as that which would occur in a black ash
furnace under the influence of great heat.                       Our object in adopting
the explanation of the reaction which appeared in our paper was to
render it as simple as possible; and occurring                       as    it    does in mud
saturated with water, we did not think it necessary                               to specially
refer to the hydrous condition of the salts.
  The reduction of sulphates in mineral water by organic matter
is so familiar          to chemists that we need not refer further to                            it,
except that        it   is   acknowledged that most waters                holding in solu
tion sulphides or sulphuretted                 hydrogen derive these                   from     the
deoxidation           of the sulphates of the alkali              or the        alkaline earth
present      in   the water.       Of   course,   it   was   a   reaction similar to this

    Professor Hartley next refers to the influence of living organisms
reducing      sulphates    and    forming    with    ferric-hydrate       ferrous-
sulphide,    founding his facts upon a paper by         Mr    J.  Y. Buchanan
"On the Occurrence of Sulphur in Marine Muds." It is not
necessary    for us to further reply to this statement, as the subject
has been     dealt with, first, in a paper by Irvine and Gibson,* and,
second,   in  a paper by     Murray and Irvine, t showing that whilst
manganous       sulphide    is  rapidly decomposed         by    carbonic    acid,
ferrous-sulphide     is stable under such circumstances        ; so  that whilst
ferrous-sulphide      is present in these      blue   muds, often in         large
quantity, manganous sulphide is decomposed by the carbonic acids
or bi-carbonates present in sea-water,          bi-carbonate of manganese
being formed and sulphuretted hydrogen given off.
    Professor Hartley goes on to state that alga or cellulose has the
power of decomposing sulphate of lime and producing sulphuretted
hydrogen,     and that this      decomposition     is effected     through      the
agency of the "bacillus amylobacter,"            giving the somewhat com
plicated formula       described by Hoppe-Seyler          in 1886, by which
methane and carbon-dioxide           are produced under the influence             of
this bacterium.        We do not think it necessary to criticise the
results he refers to, as in our paper we admit and refer to                     the
influence of bacteria in bringing about the changes which lead to
the production      of blue muds.       Indeed, experimentally       we showed
in   1892   that sea-water containing       sterilised organic       matter and
ferric-hydrate failed to exhibit the changes which in an unsteriUsed
condition gave the characteristic reduction of the sulphates and the
production of ferrous sulphide, such as occurs in blue muds.                     In
Frankland's book on Micro-Organisms            in Water,    page 114, is given
a   table by Kussell     showing the number of bacteria found in sea
muds deposited at different depths.           In mud deposited at         a depth
of 15 metres,     1  c.c. contained    245,000, whilst the water immedi
ately above     only contained       121,000.    The numbers         are   rapidly

decreased         in muds     deposited   at greater depth     :   thus at 500 metres
1   cc     of mud contains only 12,500                  bacteria,    whilst    the water
above contains only 22 per cc.                  Kussell's investigations seem to
show that the number of microbes decrease in                         a  marked degree
in the cooler waters of                 the   Temperate       Zone,     whilst in        the
Mediterranean             muds or slimes, where the water is warm                 even     at
great depths, they occur in very large proportion.
    It is to be observed           that besides     the   organic matter carried to
the sea from continents, and alga, one of the products of the                           sea,
the remains of nitrogenous organic matter and effete products of
animal organisms bulk largely in the fermenting or decomposing
mass, and         it is not at all the simple cellulose or        alga with which we
have to deal, as Professor Hartley argues is the case.                     It  was there
fore impossible for us to give theoretical formula; such                   as is  given in
Professor          Hartley's    paper,  which would        explain all the change
taking place           in  these   muds   ; and,   consequently, we adopted             one
which would give             a general,  and so far explanatory, view of what
takes place.           We    were aware that the        changes we endeavoured             to
point out in our paper were believed                    by some authorities           to be
simply        the results of the ingestion or digestion of sulphates                      by
bacteria, namely, bacterium hydro-sulfureum                       ponticum, and         bac
terium sulfureum, which are supposed                     to bo able       to   effect this
change       ;   but at the time we brought this subject before the Society
(1891) the then known facts in connection with these organisms,
and the power they had ascribed to them, were of too vague and
unsatisfactory          a nature to be relied upon, and we chose rather to
explain the facts resulting from our experiments in                         a  manner      as
simple         as   was    possible with     known      chemical data.           Professor
 Hartley,        in this connection, refers          to   Andrussow's         paper,   read
before the British             Association    at Edinburgh        in 18U2, " On the
 Condition of the Water in the Black Sea under the 100 Fathoms
        "
 Line      ;    but, so far as we know from personal             communication with
 Andrussow           and the meagre         statement which          appeared       in   the
 Royal Geographical Society's Magazine,                  we incline      to doubt that
 living organisms          can exist in water which is practically a saturated
 solution of sulphuretted hydrogen               ;  but on this point we have no
 experiments of our own to bring forward.

                  However,
inform us whether the organisms were living or dead when found
in the Black              Sea mud.            If    living, this      would      prove           the fact
claimed for        it,     that    this bacterium             is   able    to live under            such
circumstances         ;   but   if   dead,    it   simply represents an organism which
had been poisoned by its own effete products, and whose remains
have sunk to the bottom and accumulated with the other organic
remains there.             In our paper we refer to this condition of the
Black    Sea, first brought into notice by Andrussow                             and others, but
we accounted for the presence                        of sulphuretted           hydrogen in such
an amount there owing to the                          Isea   being practically            land-locked,
having      no oceanic            circulation,        and where           the amount             of iron
present in the suspended mud brought                                down by rivers was not
sufficient to absorb or combine with the sulphur of the deoxidised
sulphates, and so form               a   blue or black mud such as                   is   deposited on
ocean floors where ferruginous clays are abundant.                               The ferric oxide
in   these muds       is   readily blackened by sulphuretted hydrogen.
            Hartley takes exception to the statement we
     Professor                                                                                     made,
that when sulphuretted hydrogen in solution in pure water                                         is   left
exposed to air for           a    sufficient length of time, part of the sulphur
combined with hydrogen                   as   sulphuretted hydrogen,             is   oxidised into
sulphuric    acid.         Our experiments were                    made    with such         care      that
we cannot accept             as      conclusive         the argument            produced          to the
contrary.        As   we performed our experiments,                       it   was immaterial            to
us whether the sulphuretted                    hydrogen was decomposed                     or oxidised
with the deposition of sulphur or not       so, the sulphur being in
                                                             ;   if
afine state of division, in presence of water may have oxidised into
sulphuric    acid.         The point that we wished to bring prominently
forward     was,      that when          a     solution       of sulphuretted             hydrogen       is
exposed     to the influence of air or oxygen, changes                          take place which,
in the   end, produce sulphuric                     acid.     As we have shown from our
experiments, sulphuretted                     hydrogen, when in excess, decomposes
calcium and magnesium carbonates,                             both always present in blue
muds, producing              sulphides             of these      metals;       and    it    is    beyond
question that the sulphides so formed are, in their turn, decomposed

by    excess   of carbonic acid     present in these muds,         sulphuretted
hydrogen      being set free.
    With   regard to the fermentation of Cellulose and its products,          we
leave Professor         Hartley's conclusions     as  they stand,     having no
criticism    to offer, as the subject has not been especially studied by
us  ;  and we would, in conclusion, remark, that the chemical changes
occurring and recurring in such an exceedingly complex compound
as is represented      by oceanic blue mud, cannot be written down even
by the most complicated reactions or formulae, but which,                on the
other hand, might be a simple matter if the organic remains              present
in. these muds       were only cellulose, as is represented         in Professor
 Hartley's    paper.     A principal object of our    paper on the blue muds
 was to explain how vast chemical reactions were continually taking
 place between       the sea-water   salts  and ferruginous      muds   or clays
 and decomposing organic matter, one of which             was the abstraction
 from the sea and storing up of sulphur in a              stable   condition   in
 muds     which,     in  time, become      rocks,   containing    that  element
 generally in the form of sulphide of iron.
    Later knowledge compels us to admit that the changes                in these
 fermenting     blue muds may be wholly dependent on the influences
 of bacteria.

Note of a Case of Early Appreciation of Musical Pitch.
       By   John     G.   M'Kendrick, M.D.,         Professor    of   Physiology
       in the University of Glasgow.
                            (Read February 17, 1896.)
    A boy has recently         come   under my observation in whom the
appreciation of pitch is developed at so early an age and with so
remarkable a degree         of accuracy as to justify a record being made
of the case.
    His   name is   John Baptist Toner.         He was born on 11th June
1891, so that he is now         a little  more  than four and a half years
of age.      He is   a fine healthy-looking     boy.     His parents, who are
young, are both musical.           The mother sings and has       a keen appre
ciation of music.          The father plays on both the piano and the
organ, has all his life taken much interest in music, and has studied
the theory of the art.           So far as can be discovered, neither the
grandparents, nor any member of collateral branches of the family,
were distinguished        by musical ability.
    Since    he was     two years of age, the boy has had access to a
piano, and he seems to find pleasure in fingering the keys.               During
the last week of 1895, his father first taught him the names of
the notes on the piano, and he says that his little boy picked up
this    information      with astonishing      rapidity.     He acquired      the
 names     of the white      keys in two or three        minutes, in his     first
 lesson,   and the names        of the black keys were acquired on the
 following day in an equally short period of time.                    Since  that
 date, he has not forgotten         the names    of the notes, and when any
 note is sounded, by striking         a  key on the piano, he invariably can
 tell the   name     of the note, simply      after hearing the sound, and
  without    seeing   the key struck.       Not only     so, but    he can name
  two notes when two notes are struck on any part of the keyboard,
  and he can name the notes of any chord, or give the names of the
  notes when     any three keys are struck on the piano at the same
  moment.
     I  examined the boy in the first instance in his father's house.

He    -was          at the other side of the room from where the piano stood,
¦with        his         back towards me, and he bent his head over a sofa.
Keys         were then struck at random                                all over            the keyboard, and                        he
made no mistake in at once giving the name of the note.                                                                    Thus,
adopting the notation of Helmholtz* for the different octaves, he
gave         e'; f"; a'b; f'jf; f                   'ft

gave correctly                     e"   g';    f"     g';  c'; c' g';
                                                               d'                            gc';         b' a";
                                                                                                                        c'fl     ff;

He then                 resolved,           without       error,      the       following triple sounds —                       :

                                               g"                                    ;                                V
d"       F»$ .             These are only examples of the trials to which he was
subjected.                 The piano was as nearly as possible at concert pitch.
     On another                  occasion,      I        tested      his ear with                  a     set of        Koenig's
forks in which the middle                             c   of the piano = 256, lower than concert
pitch.           He thus listened to                         tones lower in pitch than those                                        to
which he was accustomed.                                  In    each trial, after                  a     very short time
for consideration,                      he gave        a    name       to the            tone which               nearly cor
responded to the                        pitch with which                    he        was          familiar.           Thus         c*
(Ut = 256)               was called            d,   and so on, except when                         I     sounded          a     fork
giving concert pitch, when                            it    was at once named correctly.                                  Know
ing nothing about what                              is    meant       by sharpening and flattening                                  a
note, but attaching                     a     value or meaning to the sounds                                   produced          by
striking            the black keys of the                      piano, the            boy named the sound as
it   corresponded to his standard.                                    Thus           he at once recognised                          c'
(concert             pitch), and although the note was flattened,                                                 it   still, to
him, was                 c',   till   it    came to cb          (a    name,          however,             which was not
in the child's nomenclature) and then     became                                      it                         b,   and was
always answered as    until   was actually reached.
                                             b              b                                                         In      cases
where            the       child knew               the     name       of the semitone,                        such        as    g$  ,
then the boundary to him was                                   a    quarter of           a   tone        (half of         a   semi
tone).
     This child                 has therefore acquired                      a    standard of pitch, and he
 remains faithful to this standard under all circumstances.                                                                   Thus
he can sing, so far as the compass                                        of his little                  voice    will allow,
 any note one may                           name,      and he         invariably               sings      it     correctly at
 concert pitch.                         His     ear      always        keeps             him        right        to    his own
             *
                 The middle             o   of the pianoforto        is   c',   or   Utj, in French notation.

standard, or, in other words, he has               a  gift of absolute perception of
pitch in conformity with his standard.
   After this trial, he          came    to my house and was tested by a
Bechstein      piano and an American                organ, both at concert pitch.
He    made     very   few      mistakes,      and      it  was    only   reasonable    to
attribute these to the distraction              caused by the new surroundings
in which he       was   placed.       When       I    caught his attention       he was
invariably    correct.
   Those who practise the tonic sol-fa system are expected to sing
any note of the scale when the tonic is given, and, no doubt, tens
of thousands       of  children       can    do this without difficulty.             The
test for the elementary certificate of the Tonic Sol-fa College is                     a3
follows : —
    " Pitch the key note by          means of a given C, sol-fa not more than
         three times, and afterwards sing to words or to the syllable
                    '       '
          laa any     part     in  a Psalm or        Hymn tune in       the tonic sol-fa
         notation, not        seen before, but           not necessarily containing
         any passages of transition, or of the minor mode,                       or any
          division of time less than           a  full pulse."
   This quotation is given to show that the                   tests are quite different
from those which were applied                to this      child, who had no key or
reference note given to him to aid him in his search after particular
notes.     Here, however, is        a case   where pitch is appreciated directly,
and where no musical education has been imparted.                             It is true
that in one sense there has been a musical education of the ear, as
during the last two years            the boy has touched every key on the
piano and listened to the sound            ; but it is only about a month since
he acquired the names of the notes.                    He has     also listened almost
daily to good music.           He now      associates      the names a, b, c,    g, etc.,
with particular sounds within the whole range of the piano.
    I observed that in resolving a triplet of notes he always men
tioned first the one highest in pitch, and he seemed to                   " feel about,"
as  it were, for the other         notes, but        the correct     answer was given
within     a  quarter    of     a  minute.         After    a good    many trials     his
attention flagged,      and then, occasionally, he made mistakes.                     In
the fingering with his own piano, the only error committed was with
the lowest note of the instrument, and this note was out of tune.
It  was also curious to notice that the boy was astonished that                       his

1595-96.]    Prof. M'Kendrick on Appreciation of Musical Pitch. 43
father had any difficulty in naming notes, when he, the boy, struck
them on the piano.         He   was impatient     and even irritable      when
one inadvertently mistook the answer he gave.            Thus, if he named
f j and I said    g, he emphatically shouted    :
                                                   " No,  no,  f J, f $ " !
    This case is of importance in connection with the question of
tonal fusion and the analytic powers         we undoubtedly possess.          A

are deficient    in this faculty, and that they fail      to develop      it by
practice.     One can hardly resist the conclusion that it is a gift
dependent on the delicacy of the ear and the part of the brain that
receives auditory impressions,      and that each note of a given instru

by which it is identified.*

made of aluminium, tuned to Ut4 = 512 vibs. p. sec, attached                      to
the ends     of four light bars forming        a cross.     The cross, carrying
the resonators,   is balanced on     a fine  pivot placed vertically.       "When
the fork is sounded      (by an electro-magnet        between    the limbs)     the
cross carrying the four resonators          begins   to  rotate.    The motion
arises from the greater pressure at the node at the closed end              in the
interior of the resonator nearest the source of sound              than on the
outer surface of this end.       If   the mouth of the cylinder is directed
towards the source of sound, the resonator is repelled by the greater
pressure within.       The next resonator is slightly attracted, but           it is
brought within the sphere of greater pressure mainly by the inertia
of the first resonator,   and so on.    J

    Dr M'Kendrick showed                 an extremely sensitive flame made by
Dr R. Koenig.            It     is constructed on the         type    of the sensitive
flame      apparatus      devised       by Barrett*      and    improved      by Govi.
A Lecomtef          burner directs the gas towards          a fine  wire gauze screen,
and when the gas is            lit  above the screen the flame is very sensitive
at    ordinary      pressures.       The special     part of the apparatus        now
 shown consisted of a funnel or resonator placed at right angles to
 the Lecomte         gas-jet     and opening into the space below the gauze
 screen.      To   ensure success a fine stop-cock         or clip must be used for
 the regulation        of the quantity of gas.            Dr M'Kendrick showed
 also that by placing a glass tube               460 mm. in length by 40 mm.
 in diameter over the flame, and about                  4  mm. above      the level of
 the gauze,      as first suggested by Geyer,J a musical note was heard
 which was disturbed                by vibrations     acting on the flame.          The
  apparatus     not only showed the ticking of              a  watch, placed in the
  resonator, by the movements              of the flame, but with each " tic " the
  tube sounded        slightly.       The slightest movement in the vicinity
 of the apparatus agitated            the flame   ; and as the latter was arranged
  so as  to be near the point when            it evoked   the tone of the tube, now
  and   again tbe tube gave forth a strong tone                  as a  vibration acted
  on the mass      of gas below the gauze.

  Note on Mr Alfred Graham's Method of producing
       Sound by an Electrical Arrangement.                       By John G.
       M'Kendrick, M.D., Professor of Physiology in the Univer
       sity of Glasgow.
                             (Read February 17, 1896.)
     During the past year      I have had many opportunities, in connec
 tion with a research on the phonograph, of observing the efficacy
 of  Mr Graham's method of electrically producing sound, and as it
 is not generally known, a short explanation may be useful.
    Two or     more    cells are connected to a mass of granular carbon
 whose resistance can be varied by vibration, and the circuit is           then
 completed through the coils of an electro-magnet.             In front of the
 electro-magnet is a diaphragm sensitive to the variations of current
 flowing through the electro-magnet             This diaphragm is     so placed
 relatively   to the circuit of variable resistance, that any vibration
 imparted to    it is transmitted through     a column of air to the     circuit
of the variable resistance or its diaphragm.           The granular carbon,
similar to that in telephonic transmitters, is contained in a box or
chamber      closed at one       end by   a   diaphragm     of   carbon,   with
which the granular carbon is in electrical contact.                The carbon
resistance   box is so placed that its diaphragm          is acted on by the
vibrations    set up     by the diaphragm       of  the electro-magnet       To
effect this, a flexible tube passes from the       front of the diaphragm of
the transmitter to the front of the diaphragm of the electro-magnet.
Thus,    when     the various     parts of the apparatus       are  connected,
as seen   in the figure, and when the circuit is completed by closing
a  key, the vibrations set up in the telephone diaphragm are caused
to act upon the      circuit of variable resistance, which, in turn, again
acts   upon the telephone or receiver            diaphragm.     A   continuous
musical sound is then emitted.
    The receiving or telephonic element of the apparatus consists of
a  powerful permanent magnet carrying upon its poles spools wound
with low resistance coils.          This   acts   on an iron diaphragm       of
considerable     area,   about 90 mm. in diameter, and of            minimum

1895-96.]      Prof. M'Kendrick on Electrical Musical Tones.                 47
thickness,     so that   a maximum       amplitude   of  vibration    may be
obtained.      The element of variable       resistance is composed of        a
stationary electrode of carbon mounted in             a  case  of   insulating
material.      A   diaphragm   of carbon     is fixed   in  the case.     This
forms the movable electrode of the apparatus, and between the
stationary    and movable electrodes is placed        a quantity of carbon
granules.
    When    at rest, and before the key completing the      circuit is closed,
the iron diaphragm is held in tension by the permanent magnet.
On closing the key, the coils of the electro-magnet        energise   and the
                                                                   .Canton      \

 diaphragm is attracted.      This movement of the diaphragm operates
 through the air column in the flexible tube and the carbon dia
 phragm is acted upon, thus increasing or diminishing the resistance
 of the circuit of variable resistance.        Thus, for example, increase
 of the resistance decreases the strength of the battery current and
 causes   a   return   movement     of the receiver     diaphragm,     which,
 through    the air    column,   produces a return       movement      of   the
 diaphragm      of variable resistance, causing    a decrease   in the resist
 ance of the circuit.     The consequent   increase of the battery current,
 in turn, increases the energy of the receiver coils.        Thus reciprocal
 effects are    produced, resulting     in the production      of  a  musical

sound, which     lasts as long    as the circuit is kept closed.        The
pitch, loudness, or quality of the sound may be modified by varying
the strength of the battery current, by changing its direction, or by
varying   suddenly the length of the column of air, or the pressure,
in the flexible tube   (see diagram).
   Measurements      made   for   me  by   Mr Alexander       Gait, of   the
Physical Laboratory      of the University of      Glasgow, showed       the
resistance of the receiver (the electro-magnet) to be 2 ohms, while
that of the variable resistance fluctuated between 13 and 29 ohms.
The apparatus works well with two of Obach's dry cells, Q pattern^
which, with the resistance just mentioned, give about one-fifth of
an ampere.
   The apparatus is interesting, not only on theoretical grounds,
but because it suggests the possibility of constructing a new kind
of musical instrument.       Thus diaphragms might       be tuned to the
notes of the scale, and by pressing on keys, and thus completing
circuits,  musical notes having something of the quality of those of
brass instruments might be produced.          Possibly,  also, by piercing
holes at proper distances in the flexible tube, these holes might be so
fingered  as to produce different sounds, and thus we might have an
electric flute.   I have found   a modification of  Mr Graham's method
of great service in connection       with the phonograph.         It might
also be adapted to the purpose of rendering audible         in a room    the
sounds of respiration, or even the sounds of the heart.

    This work     was commenced            at the suggestion     of Prof.     Ewart,
F.R.S., to     whose    kindness      I  am indebted for the        material used,
and for much assistance            and advice during        the   progress    of the
investigation.      Prof. Ewart       placed two specimens      at my disposal     —
a male and a female,           both of which         were   about 43 cm. long,
 excluding, of course,       the   lash.     As, however, the male had been
 partly   dissected    for   special     points   in connection with another
 investigation, it was only available for the study of the                IXth    and
 Xth cranial nerves ;      the main bulk of the         present work, therefore,
 having been carried out on a single specimen.                   Hence there are
 several points on which my work              will require confirmation.
    As the dissection of        the cranial nerves of Chimiera            elucidated
 facts of a more interesting character than            I  had anticipated,     it was
 thought desirable to publish            a  preliminary statement      containing    a
 brief account of the facts, and to leave the full description with
 figures and morphological           deductions for     a future communication,
 which    I  hope   to lay before the Royal Society in a few weeks'
 time.    The present paper, therefore, pretends to be              a  brief review
 of the more important facts and nothing more.
     Having nothing new          to describe with       respect  to the    olfactory
 and optic nerves,     I shall    commence      with  the  oculo-motor : —
     Third   Nerve. — This is      a large    nerve,  and arises from the crus
  cerebri by two principal roots just behind the pituitary body.                   On
  emerging from its foramen in the orbit, it immediately gives off                   a
  branch to the superior rectus            muscle  of the eye, and divides into
  two large dorsal and ventral branches running                 respectively over
  and under the optic nerve.              The dorsal branch courses          straight
  across  the orbit and fans out on the internal            rectus muscle, whilst
  the ventral, after giving off a branch to the inferior rectus, pursues
  a somewhat similar course and supplies the inferior oblique.                    The
  ventral division    of the Hlrd, just after its origin, gives off             a fine

nerve, which, being joined by            a similar nerve from the profundus
division of the Vth, swells          to form the      ciliary ganglion, and this,
on being teased, was seen           to contain large nerve cells. From the
ciliary ganglion two ciliary nerves with the characteristic wavy
course proceed to the eye.              This account of the ciliary ganglion
agrees    with that described in Lcemargus by Ewart, but                   I should
like to    leave    the matter in Ghimcera an open one, as               I only  dis
sected    the ciliary ganglion on one side, and then, owing to the
parts having been disturbed by previous dissection, not as carefully
as   I could    have wished.
     Fourth Nerve. — Arises,         as  in all vertebrates, from the roof of
the Sylvian aqueduct, and emerges               from the brain in the perpen
dicular furrow between the optic lobes and cerebellum.                    It courses
upwards and forwards, and reaches                 the orbit under cover of the
superficial ophthalmic division of the            Vllth.     It is obscured by the
 latter for the greater part of its course, but finally takes a dorsal
 curve and supplies the superior oblique muscle of the eye.
     Fifth Nerve. —This nerve is in          a more primitive condition than       in
 any vertebrate yet described, and its distribution,             therefore, is some
 what important.         It  arises from the medulla by two closely applied
 roots under cover of the buccal root of the                  Vllth.    These two
 roots fuse indissolubly,        and neither they nor their product mingle
 with the roots of the           Vllth,    or in any way become         inseparable
 from them.         The Vth nerve, therefore, may           be followed     through
 out almost the whole of its course without the confusing elements
 which mixed roots inevitably introduce.*                  The Vth, after passing
 through      the same      foramen which gives exit to the buccal and
 hyomandibular         divisions   of the    Vllth,     immediately expands into
 the large Gasserian ganglion, and              I  distinguish    five branches as

 detail.

   (a.) Superficial Ophthalmic.
                                — This nerve is exceedingly inter
esting, since it does not fuse with the nerve of the same name
from the Vllth, and its distribution                       may therefore be ascertained
without any of the doubt                necessarily        attached to its distribution           in
the Elasmobranch             fishes.       It     arises   from the Gasserian ganglion
and courses         straight upwards, and after crossing the                            superficial
ophthalmic of the            Vllth,      runs straight forwards to                be    distributed
to the akin, over and in front of the orbital region.                                    We   may,
therefore, conclude with certainty that this branch of the Vth does
not in      Chimcera,   and doubtless also                 in other     fishes, innervate any
of the      sense organs of the lateral line.                 As     an important variation,
I   may note that       I   have      seen      it   send a few fibres         to the superficial
ophthalmic of the    Vllth as it passes over it.
  (b.) Profundus.
                    —  This branch of the Vth is also of great interest.
In the first place, it is undoubtedly a branch of the Vth, and does
not arise by a separate root from the medulla.                            It   springs from the
main trunk of the Vth, slightly                       distal to the Gasserian            ganglion,
and after giving off a twig to the ciliary ganglion, runs straight
forwards across the orbit dorsal to the optic nerve.                               It    perforates
the cartilage of the cranium at the anterior end of the orbit, and
courses upwards         to fan over and                completely fuse with the super
ficial ophthalmic branch of the                      Vllth.       Its distribution after this
point is necessarily             a   difficult,      if not   an impossible, question to
determine.        "When the profundus has traversed                      about two-thirds of
the orbit, it gives off    conspicuous branch (which may immediately
                                 a
divide       into two), and this branch, running in a canal bored in

of the     Vllth,    and eventually reaches the skin in front of the orbit.
Here       it gives off two important twigs, which                       innervate       two sense
organs of five supra-orbital canal (marked black in the figure).*

    (e.) Pharyngeal      or Visceral.  — This is   a branch of the     maxillary
division of the Vth, and           arises  ventrally    from one of the    main
branches of the maxillary,          dipping down and running backwards,
and ultimately passing on to the pharynx                at the point where   the
lower jaw articulates with the skull.             It  is a slender nerve with a
long course, and was not traced far on to the pharynx, having                 by
this time become extremely fine.*
    The Vth, then, in Chimara, is            a perfectly typical cranial nerve,
in    so far as   it  possesses  dorsal sensory branches to the skin and
sense organs,      a pharyngeal      branch to the mouth, and finally pre-
and post-branchial branches (maxillary and mandibular).
     Sixth Nerve. — Arises by six rootlets from the ventral pyramids
 of the medulla at a level slightly behind the dorsal root of the
 Vllth.      It  runs forwards      and slightly downwards,        and reaching
 the orbit by a foramen under cover of the roots of              Vth and Vllth,
 passes straight into the external rectus muscle of the eye, which             it
 supplies.
     Seventh    Nerve. — This arises      from the medulla by three main
 roots, two of which are ventral and the other dorsal.                The dorsal
 root (which arises just behind the restiform bodies, and on a level
 with their dorsal border) is connected mostly with the buccal, but
 also with both the other roots by distinct branches.                At no point,
 however, is there any confusion            between the roots of the       Vllth
 and Vth.        The   seven   divisions    to be distinguished     in the skate
 and Laimargu8 exist also in Chimawa.               These are   :—
     (a.) Superficial Ophthalmic.
                                        — Has dorsal and ventral roots, and
  courses   over the eye to be distributed           to the supra-orbital canal
                                                    —
  (marked by cross-hatching in the figure SO), and the superficial
  ophthalmic     group of ampulla,        which with its fellow of the oppo
  site side occupies by far the greater part of the cavity of the snout.
  As this nerve      passes through the canal      in the cranium to reach the
  orbit it  swells into a large ganglion.
      (b.) Buccal.
                     — Constitutes the main part of the dorsal root of the
  Vllth, and reaches the orbit through a foramen which also gives
  exit to the remainder          of the    Vllth    and the Vth.      In  passing
  through     the cranium      it expands into the large buccal ganglion.
     *  I might describe other visceral branches of the Vth, but shall postpone
  doing so until I have dissected other specimens.

The buccal nerve, which accompanies the main trunk of the Vth
for   some   little distance in the orbit, but is easily separable from        it,
divides into inner and outer buccal truuks, and innervates the
sensory canals lettered B1, and B2 in the figure (marked by dots),

and terminating in inner and outer buccal groups of ampullae.
The latter group differs from the others previously described in
that the ampullae are much smaller, being, in fact, only about half
the   size   of those in the superficial ophthalmic          and inner buccal
groups.
     The hyomandibular and facial proper arise from the medulla by

roof of the mouth, and to the mouth in the immediate neighbourhood
of the teeth of       the upper jaw.
    (g.) Chorda tympani.          — This     is a conspicuous nerve arising             just
distal to the palatine, and is distributed to the sides and floor of
the mouth.         It  receives a branch from the facial proper             as  described
above.
    The facial, then, is to a great extent a typical cranial nerve.                       It
has     four dorsal sensory          branches (superficial ophthalmic,             buccal,
external mandibular,           and hyomandibular),             two visceral branches
 (palatine and chorda), and            proe-  and post-branchial branches          (?).
    Eighth Nerve. — Arises from the               side of the medulla by a single
root situated in the angle formed by the root of the buccal and the
ventral root of the superficial ophthalmic of the                    Yllth.     It  imme
diately expands into            a large      ganglion, and        gives off the      usual
ampullary and vestibular branches.                  The vestibule contains a hard
calcareous otolith of a very curious shape.
    Ninth Nerve. — As figured by Hubrecht* in his memoir                           on the
skull of the Holocephali,             this nerve emerges from the cranium by
a  separate      foramen.      It   arises    from the medulla by          a   main root
and     two     rootlets under cover           of the root of the lateralis, and
expands       into an obvious ganglion immediately on emerging                        from
the cranium.          From   the ganglion a very fine dorsal branch is sent
up to the skin, but this does not innervate any sense organs                        of the
lateral    line.     There are three pharyngeal branches,                  but none of
these correspond to the pharyngeals of the vagus                        in their precise
distribution.        There are    prse-  and post-branchial branches           to the first
 and    second     demi-branchs         respectively,      on   the    hyoid    and first
 branchial arch, and both of these are continued ventrally on to the
 pharynx, thus forming two accessory                  pharyngeal branches, or five
 in all.     Two nerves      are also given off which accompany              and supply
 the  first branchial arch.
    Tenth Nerve. — The vagus            in  Chimaera    is  in  a specially interesting
 condition,      and is more        primitive     than in any other vertebrate.

the vagua of Chimcera would be in the unique condition               of consist
ing of five perfectly distinct       nerves.    As far   as  I am aware,     this
condition    is most nearly approached       in Torpedo, the    IXth   and   Xth.
cranial   nerves of which       I  dissected some     time ago at Professor
E wart's suggestion.     In  Chimcera the vagus arises by five main roots,
of which the most anterior is the root of the lateralis.              The next
three roots are those of the three branchial            nerves which supply
the posterior demi-branch (or third) on the first branchial arch, two
demi-branchs on both the second and third arches, and a single
demi-branch on the anterior face of the last or fourth branchial arch.
There are thus five gills, of which the first and last (on the hyoid
and fourth branchial arches) consist of a single demi-branch only,
and the remaining three of two demi-branchs             each.    The distribu
tion of each branchial nerve to        a great extent resembles     that of the
IXth, and will be described in my next paper. The posterior root
of the Xth is that of the intestinal.         This nerve forms an elaborate
plexus on the stomach and oesophagus, and the only nerve from the
 vagus to the heart which      I  have yet found, is a very fine branch of
 the intestinal     which ran in the wall of the sinus            venosus.      In
 several Elasmobranchs        I   have    found   a   nerve    from     the   last
 branchial    division   of the vagus going        to the    heart,   but   have
 hitherto not seen any traces of it in Chimcera.         The lateralis, besides
 innervating    the lateralis   canal, gives off a nerve dorsally         to the
 commissural     and median canal (shown by oblique shading — L).
 This dorsal branch requires very careful dissection, as it would be
 very easy to mistake its origin, as, indeed,       I  did mistake     it myself
 until  a careful revision showed me my error.         Further complications
 in dissecting the vagus      are the dorsal branches from the anterior
 spinal nerves passing through the cranium, which seem to arise from
 the   IXth   and Xth.     I  shall describe these nerves fully and the
 other spinal nerves in my future paper.
     Conclusion. — The study of       the cranial nerves of      Chimcem un
 doubtedly     emphasises   the affinities which the        Holocephali     have
 with the Elasmobranchs,         and more particularly with the sharks,
 but it may be added with equal certainty that both as regards the
 anatomy of the brain and the distribution of the cranial nerves,
 the   Holocephali    are more    archaic and have not undergone            such
 differentiation    as the Elasmobranchs       evidently    have.

Experiment illustrating the Modern Theory of Salt-
               Solution. By Professor Crum Brown.
                            (Read January 20, 1896.)
    It is well known to all chemists that sulphuretted hydrogen does
not give a precipitate of zinc sulphide in a solution of zinc chloride
or zinc sulphate      if  a sufficient (quite small) quantity         of a strong
acid, such as hydrochloric       or sulphuric acid, has been added to the
solution.     It  is also quite well known that if we add              a  sufficient
quantity of a solution of sodium acetate to the clear solution con
taining the zinc salt sulphuretted hydrogen and strong acid,                      we
throw down the whole of the zinc                as sulphide.     This  used to he
explained as follows : — Hydrochloric acid acts on zinc sulphide thus,
 ZnS + 2HC1 = H„S + ZnCl2,            and    therefore    the    opposite    action
 ZuClo + H2S = ZnS + 2HC1 cannot take place in the presence of
hydrochloric acid. But as acetic acid is too weak an acid to act on
zinc sulphide, the presence of acetic acid does not prevent the pre
cipitation of zinc sulphide, and the hydrochloric                 acid   originally
there, as well as that produced by the reaction,             acts on the sodium
acetate to form sodium chloride and acetic               acid.    On the modern
theory the explanation is this          : — The zinc   .sulphide is attacked not
by the hydrochloric      acid, but by the hydrogen ions; these are present
in the solution of hydrochloric acid          ;  and that acid being to a groat
extent
          " ionised,"  we have a great concentration of hydrogen ions.
There is a limiting value for the concentration of hydrogen ions,
above   which the action ZnS        +  2H'   =   Zn" + H.,8  takes place, so that
zinc   sulphide     cannot be      formed by the action of sulphuretted
hydrogen on a zinc salt          in a solution containing hydrogen              ions
with   a  concentration above this limiting value.               The addition to
a  solution containing hydrogen ions of            a salt of   a weak   acid, such
as acetic    acid, diminishes     the concentration of the hydrogen ions.
Sodium acetate is ionised to a very much greater                     extent than
hydrogen acetate, and therefore when we add sodium acetate we
are  adding not only NaA but also Xa* + A', and some of the A' ions
so  introduced unite with H" ions to form HA, and                so diminish the

58           Proceedings    of Royal Society of Edinburgh.               [sess.
concentration of    H' ions.   We   can thus  diminish this concentration
below the limiting value above referred to, and thus allow of              the
precipitation of the whole of the zinc as ZnS.
   Either of    these  explanations    is sufficient    to account   for   the
phenomena.       But we can arrange       a crucial   experiment   to decide
between the two theories.        To   a solution    of  ferrous acetate    add
enough acetic acid to prevent the precipitation of FeS on addition
of sulphuretted hydrogen ; add sulphuretted hydrogen to this acid
solution   of ferrous acetate, of course no black precipitate appears ;
now add solution of sodium acetate, and FeS is thrown down.                 As
there is here no acid present but acetic acid, the first theory offers
no explanation of the phenomena, but the second              does.   We can
add to ferrous acetate enough acetic acid to have the concentration
of  H'  ions above the limiting value for FeS (which is much below
that for ZnS), and so prevent the formation of FeS j and we can
add to this     solution   containing   ferrous  acetate,   acetic acid, and
sulphuretted hydrogen, enough sodium acetate to diminish the con
centration of the    H'  ions below the limiting value, and so allow of
the formation of FeS.

     In   spite of   the great    amount      of attention       which     has  been
  bestowed upon this group by many workers, it must still be said
  that our knowledge of its systematic position is very meagre and
  uncertain, and that there are points in its anatomy which require
  elucidation.     Through the kindness of Professor M'Intosh                 I have
  been enabled to examine some specimens of               P. australis,   and also a
  Phoronis, which appears to be a new species.                I reserve a detailed
 account of      my results for later publication,           and   here   only refer
  very briefly    to leading    points.     I   may mention         that Professor
  M'Intosh    has also allowed me the inspection            of his serial sections
 of P. Iniskii.      M'Intosh,   and    after a careful comparison            I have
 not    the   slightest    doubt   that    this   is  a   distinct    species   from
 P.   australis — it has been usual to regard           the distinction     between
these two forms as not of specific value.
     Divisions of the Body. — It is usual, in describing the structure of
Phoronis, to refer to two different parts of the body which lie before
and behind the septum respectively.              I  propose, for reasons shown
later, to emphasise the division of the body into — (1) The epistome,

 what involved, relationship        to the next part        ;  (2)   the tentacular
region, which      I  prefer to call the collar, consisting of a ring round
the mouth region,       the oral part being produced into two arms or pro
 cesses which bear tentacles      and are coiled, and the aboral end being
limited superficially by the        nerve    ring and fundamentally by the
so-called septum ;       (3) the trunk, including         all the region behind
the septum.
    These three divisions are not mere conveniences                  of description,
but   are definite segments,     having body-cavities separated from each
other by mesenteries,       and differing in form and function              amongst
themselves.
    The  tentacles, as is well known, are arranged upon the lophophore

60            Proceedings             of Royal Society of Edinburgh.                        [
in two parallel rows, an outer and an inner, the inner being on the
concave side of the coiled lophophore and the outer on the convex.
     Between these two rows of tentacles is contained an imperfectly
shut-off cavity, which we may term the " branchial space."                            Its roof
is open at the apex of the tentacles, its lateral walls are                        formed by
the tentacles,         and    its floor is formed partly by the epistome,                       and,
partly on the outer side of                      it,   the mouth.         The inner     row of
tentacles     is   in    close        contact with         the epistome throughout              this
cavity, except in the middle                      line.        Here    the tentacles are        dis
continuous for         a   small space, those of each side, however, overlap
ping so that       a   " branchial fissure "              is   produced which leads          from
the branchial space into the lophophoral concavity.
     The lophophoral arms                are coiled round so that the inner row                   of
tentacles also tend               to inclose       a    space    which    we may      term       the
" atrial    space."        This       opens freely above,         has the outer wall of the
collar below, and            is   closed   in by the inner row of tentacles, except
in the median line.                Here    it     opens    orally to the branchial         fissure
and aborally to the exterior.
     Into the atrial         space     are discharged the waste products              from the
anus, nephridia (including sexual products), and lophophoral organs.
     Both branchial and atrial spaces in the large species of Phoronis
are continued up the three coils of the arms.
     Ectoderm,     —The           ectoderm consists, for the most part, of three
types of one-layered epithelium.
     The trunk has numerous circular transverse furrows which are
found to be due to                a   plication of the epithelium.             This   is   a     per
manent and normal folding of the glandular cuticle-secreting cells,
and    is   not, as formerly asserted, due to contraction during                       the pro
cesses of     killing and preserving.
     In the collar and epistomial regions there occur the two other
types of epithelium.               The first or branchial             has very much elongated
glandular ciliated cells, with email nuclei                      ;    they are found covering
the whole surface of the branchial                        space, as defined above, and are
continuous with others of                  a   similar type lining the oesophagus.          These
 cells secrete copious mucus, strings of which are noticed in section
 to be      passing down the tentacles and into the mouth, carrying
 numerous food particles adhering to them.                              This method of food
 ingestion forcibly recalls that of the Tunicata.                          The epistome pro

jects over      the branchial space at an angle, and evidently serves to
sheer off the water current            and direct    it through    the   branchial
 fissure    into the atrial space.
      The   epistome   is continued   as  a ridge projecting across the floor
 of    the branchial chamber the whole way round the coils, which
 ascend in a spiral, so that it forms a beautifully constructed appara
 tus for separating the water and food currents.
      The third type      is the atrial epithelium, the cells of which            are
  small, compact, and cubical, with large nuclei            ; they usually have
  numerous       pigment spots, and are mostly non-ciliated.             This   type
  lines the whole atrial      space except the lophophoral organs and the
  nerve ring, and the branchial fissure,         so  that the upper surface        of
   the epistome is (in the median line) covered with this epithelium,
   the lower surface with the branchial type.
      Nervous System.     — This  is ectodermal,    and has been described         by
             Diagram of Longitudinal Section through Phoronis to one
                                 side of median line.
   various workers, who do not, however, agree entirely.              Cori gives     a
   detailed account of the nerves in       P. paammophila, with which I find,
    Diagram    of Longitudinal Section through Phoronis through median line.
        In each diagram  the branchial epithelium is thick-, the atrial thin- lined.
    for the  most part,   P. australis  agrees, except that, as Benharn stated,
    there are two longitudinal nerves (paired) near the lateral mesentery.

 62             Proceedings    of Royal Society of Edinburgh.                 [sess.
 I  fail,   however,    to   understand      the latter's   statement   that    the
 nervous system is        " mainly   ventral."     All  the main nervous con
 centrations lie in the atrial floor ; in fact, in or close to the line
joining mouth and anus.
    Lophophoral Organs. — These appear to be compound organs, con
 sisting of (1) the ciliated lophophoral nerve ring ; (2) excretory cells
 in a mass at the base of atrium ; (3) ectodermal flap or funnel facing
 inwards, and in contact with the inner row of tentacles.              Tins latter
 consists of ciliated ectoderm inside and atrial epithelium outside                 ;
 between these is a continuation           of the collar body cavity.       At the
 base of the      funnel is  a minute aperture on each side opening into
 the collar cavity.       I  believe the flap to be the remnant of        a  dorsal
 lamella, and the pores        to be true collar     pores.     The lophophoral
 organ or flap extends for some way (quite a quarter of a coil                   in
 P. auslralis), and is not short,        as has been figured by one observer.
    Body Cavities. — Each of       the divisions of the body already referred
 to, namely, epistome, collar, and trunk, has a well-defined coelomic
 cavity, separated from each other by mesenteries.
    Between        the coelomic    peritoneum      and    the   ectoderm is the
 " basement tissue," which is apparently the result of the secretory
 activity of cells which lie imbedded here and there in the matrix,
 and which are probably           mesoblastic in origin (Caldwell).            This
skeletal structure does not appear to differ in any essential degree
 from cartilage, and may be directly compared to the " chondroid
          "
tissue of Balanoglossus.           It lines the whole body under the ecto
 derm and between the coelomic              walls.   Thus,    between the collar
and trunk cavities,       it forms   a  thick " septum " or " diaphragm," to
 which     are attached the longitudinal      muscles.     This chondroid tissue
 and the vascular spaces evidently             occupy the blastocoelic      cavity.
The tissue is not present to any extent in the very young Phoronis.
    The mesentery between the epistome and the collar supports the
lophophoral and tentacular veins, but is not thickened by chondroid
tissue.
    On either side of the branchial fissure            each   collar cavity has   a
short diverticulum       which ends in      a minute aperture to the exterior,
the collar pore.       The epistome and its cavity is produced into two
long processes which run dorsally to the collar cavity in each arm.
It   has a communication          by   a  small pore on each side into the

1895-96.]        Mr Arthur T. Masterman                  on Phoronis.               G3
collar cavity.         All  the cavities tend to be obliterated by mesen-
chymatous tissue.
     Trunk    Cavities.  — The longitudinal         muscles     run from septum to
base, and are inclosed          in special parts of        the cavity, shut off by
thin walls, from the general cavity of            the coelome. The       trunk cavity
is bent upon itself, but this reduplication does not affect the collat
 or epistome regions.
     As   regards     the vascular system,       the dorsal vessel       runs in the
space     between the gut and the body cavities, and the ventral
vessel evidently belongs to the space                  in   the ventral mesentery,
 but is secondarily deflected           over to the left coelomic cavity.
     Coming to the affinities of Phoronis,              I am led to formulate the
 view that this genus must take its place amongst the Hemichordata,
 in spite of the obvious fact that in          none of the known species have
 a notochord or gill-slits been described.
     In his report upon Phoronis            busfcii, Professor     M'Intosh    was led
 to compare several of the organs, such as the nervous system, with
 those    of   CephcUodiscus,     and   he even suggested           comparisons   with
 Baianoglossus.          Mr Harmer, in his Appendix                to the Challenger
                    '
 Report upon          Cephalmliscus,'    also suggested       some points of resem
 blance between this form and Phoronis ; and Professor Lankester,
                                                                            '
 in his article in         the  Encyclopaedia       Britannica upon           Polyzoa,'
 pointed out features in common between the Pterobrachia and the
 Vermiformia.           We   can accept this observer's         comparison between
 the forms here          mentioned without         following      him in his consti
 tution of the Polyzoa or the Podaxonia.
     The     formation       of  the    group Hemiclwrdata,            involving    the
  removal      of Cephalodiscus and Rhabdopleura into phylctic con
  nection with Baianoglossus, tended, to those who accepted this
 classification, to disguise what           I  believe to be the true affinities
  of Phoronis     ;   especially because the presence             of a notochord and
  gill-slits  were stated to be essential        characters      of the group.     This
  is not the place to go fully into the views held with regard                        to
  the affinities of Phoronis         ; various workers have allied it to the
  Gephyrea,     the Brachiopoda,        the Chcdopoda,         or even the Polyzoa.
      I have    embodied my main points               of comparison of Phoronis
  with the Hemichordata            in a table, all details being left over for
   the present.        We may       here    deal   with    the   two chief points in

 64          Proceedings    of Royal Society of Edinburgh.                   [sess.
which Phoronis differs from the others, namely, the                 absence   of  a
notochord and gill-slits.
    We may first take into consideration the notochord.
    This, though an important organ in Balanoglossus, is greatly
reduced in Cephalodiscus and in Ehabdopleura.                  In all  three  it is
intimately    connected with       the proboscis       (syn. epistome or pre-
 oral lobe), and shares its degree of prominence with this organ.
    In  the case of Phoronis,       we already know from its ontogeny
that its larval form, Actinotrocha,          has a very well-developed pre-
oral lobe,   but that this atrophies almost entirely,             leaving only a
vestigial epistome (Caldwell).           This being so, we must seek for
the notochord, not in the adult Phoronis, but in the Actinotrocha
just before its metamorphosis.
    To prophesy is    a dangerous pursuit,          especially in morphology,
but   I  cannot help suspecting that subsequent investigations                 will
reveal some trace of an organ homologous to the notochord in the
Actinotrocha stage.
    Such a discovery, although convincing, is not, however, essential
to our contention,     for  a notochord       may never have been evolved
in Phoronis,      and   yet   its   alliance    with    the Hemicfiordata        be
 unassailable.
    Secondly,   there are no gill-slits.        This is    a  feature which,     so
 far as is known, is not found at all in one of the Hemichordata,
namely,     Ehabdopleura,      and    the    gill-slits differ in number in
structure, and even,     perhaps, in function in the other two.             Apart
from this, we have pointed out that the
                                                       " branchial fissure " in
Phoronis performs the function            of the gill-slits of Cephalodiscus ;
and although,      of course,     not morphologically        equivalent,   yet its
presence    points out a factor which might              easily account for the
non-evolution     or atrophy of true gill-slits in the gut region.
    We may     assume   that the reduction of the epistome,           consequent
 upon a sedentary life, enabled the outer row of tentacles to be car
 ried across the median line ventrally, and thus formed the branchial
space above referred      to, which physiologically can          be compared     in
 every detail with the pharynx          of Tunicata    :  the same comparison
 holds true for the branchial fissure and the atrial space.              Phoronis
 having therefore, through loss of function by the pre-oral lobe, been
 enabled to evolve a complete branchial           and food-collecting area (by

1895-96.]             Mr Arthur T. Masterman            on Phoronis.                 G.~>
the approximation           and fusion of post-oral      tentacles),   all situated in
front of          the true mouth,    we    at least should      not expect      to find
organs fulfilling similar functions in             the   endodermal area behind
 the mouth.
     Although, therefore, there are           no notochord nor gill-slits in the
 adult Phoronis, yet we can find               analogous    organs    and   therein —
 reasons for the forestalling or replacement             of these two structures.
      A few      words with reference to the Table of Comparison             :   It will
 be seen that Phoronis          offers   various points of resemblance          to each
 usually acknowledged           member    of the group, and thereby lends sup
 port to the constitution of the group as such.
     We may note that, in sedentary habit, pre-oral                 lobe, and collar-
  region, Phoronis most nearly agrees with CepJuilodisriix and Rhubdo-
 ji/eura    ;   and in the shape       and   structure of the trunk, including
  vascular system, it more nearly resembles Balanutjloxxuii.
      In comparing        these  two forms,     I would amplify Wilson's           sug
  gestion     ;  and by separating the anal half of the trunk                from the
  anterior half, in fact, straightening out the trunk, would eliminate
  a point of dissimilarity which is due to             a secondary     adaptation on
  the part of the tubicolous Phoronis.            (N.B. — It    is well to note that
  a  similar mode        of comparison must be held valid by those who
  contend       for a phyletic connection between          Balanoylomis and the
  other Hemichordaia.)

efferent vessel being partially moved        back   from   its true asym
metrical position.
   These two asymmetrical features are probably connected the one
with the other.     I leave out the nephridia     in order not    to compli
cate matters.
   In the region of the stomach the two blood-vessels communicate
round the gut by       a sinus formed between it and the coelomic
epithelium.
   In diagram    2 the   separation  is partially effected     so that   the
lateral mesenteries are seen to be composed      of the dorsal mesentery
                                    2-
of the anterior half of the trunk and the dorsal peritoneum of the
posterior half.
   As the posterior part of the trunk      moves     out it allows of the
approximation of the two anterior elements of the lateral mesentery
to approach one another in the median line,          and the same applies
to the two nerve cords.

 The main features    are : —Simple   epidermis, with mucous glands and
nerve fibrils,   concentrated dorsally     in the median line ; a dorsal
and ventral mesentery, the former incomplete in the hind region,
as in some species of Balanoglossus ; dorsal afferent blood-vessel in
dorsal mesentery, communicating         with the ventral efferent        vessel
by enteric sinus    ; ventral   efferent vessel    connected with ventral
mesentery,     and dividing     into two    in collar    ; ccelomic   pouches,
largely filled with connective-tissue,       sexual glands,      a  thin layer
of circular muscles,       and   within them      a  layer of     longitudinal
muscles,   inserted   anteriorly    in chondroid     tissue,   posteriorly   in
body wall ; cuticular     secretion of ectoderm,      forming more or less
permanent
             " tube."
   I would define the Hemichordata        as follows   : —
   Coelomate animals, with three parts of the body, an impaired pre-
oral and two paired post-oral, each opens         typically to the exterior
by ciliated pores ; ectoderm simple, with mucous glands, partially or
wholly ciliated  ; nervous system ectodermal, concentrated in dorsal
collar region, at base of epistome, and in post-oral collar ring — there
may or may not be dorsal or ventral cords or both           ; simple black or
coloured pigment in the ectoderm cells — a cuticular secretion of the

 68           Proceedings      of Royal Society of Edinburgh.              [skss.
 ectoderm forms      a more or less permanent and connected skeletal
 structure  ;   endoderm simple and glandular, mostly ciliated         — that in
 dorsal collar region forms in most a vacuolated skeletal area, the
 notochord    ;  and in some are paired endodermal openings to the ex
terior in the trunk region, gill-slits       ; there are five coelomic pouches
usually    secondarily filled with         connective-tissue,  and   the trunk
cavities containing the generative organs ; there may or may not be
a vascular system      and well-differentiated       muscular layers ;   a meso
dermal chondroid tissue, hypertrophied at various parts.               Dioecious
 or hermaphrodite, solitary, sedentary, colonial, or gregarious.
    It is undeniable     that Phoronis shows close affinities with           the
 Brachiopoda      and the Gephyrea       ;  and, on theother hand, Balano-
glossus shows equally remarkable affinities with Echinodermata.                 I
 believe these resemblances will all eventually find expression in the
 constitution of one large primitive group which we may provisionally
term the Trimetamera, emphasising their fundamental                  feature of
having the mesoderm         divided    up into a pre-oral and two post-oral
coelomic     pouches,    all,   primitively,    opening    to the exterior    by
ciliated pores, the earliest condition of nephro-gonaducts.            The pre-
oral segment is specialised for locomotion and for sense functions,
and degenerates      upon the assumption of a sedentary life.           The   1st
post-oral segment is mainly connected with locomotion and ingestion
of food, and is usually tentacular, whilst the trunk segment, or             3rd
post-oral, is concerned with digestion and reproduction.
    From this type, by segmentation of the trunk,              are derived   the
 polymetamerous forms (Chcetopoda,             Annelida,  and Chordaia).
    The Trimetamera       I   believe to be the most primitive        Cadomata
derived directly from the Coelenterata, and they persist in varied
forms    to the present day in the Heinichordata,               Echinodermata,
Brachiopoda,       Chwtognatha, unarmed Gephyrea, and possibly the
Mullusca.
    The division     of the body into three          segments   has been made
permanent in these forms, because of             a  peculiar physiological  and
morphological fitness in this number, as seen by a secondary acquire
ment by polymetamerous forms of a prosoma,                mesosoma,   and meta-
soma, or head, thorax, and abdomen, which can be exactly compared
(physiologically)    to the three segments         of the Trimetamera.      The
following table will     express    the likely relationships   : —

      1.    Assumption          of sedentary          life, with degeneration        of pre-oral
              lobe,    carrying with it the atrophy of notochord and pro
              boscis pore.
      2.    A synchronous tentacular hypertrophy of collar                        region.
      3.    A synchronous reduplication of trunk                   region.
      4.    Further reduction of epistome, with growth of tentacles across
              mid-ventral line to form branchial space.
      5.    Fusion of base of tentacles, and dorsal coiling of lnphophoral
              arms,     fusing at their bases with body, and thus forming
              atrial space.
      6.    Atrophy of ventral half of collar flap, dorsal half persists                         as
              dorsal lamella.
       7.   Atrophy of gill-slits            (if   ever   present) in correlation           to the
              perfection of extra-oral branchial apparatus.
       8.    Further hypertrophy in large species of Phoronis, of branchial
              system by further coiling of epistome                  and collar arms.

Some Points in the Physiological Chemistry and Co
   agulation of Milk. By David Fraser Harris, B.Sc.
   (Lond.), M.B.C.M., F.K.S.E. Communicated by John G.
           M'Kbndbick,          M.D., Professor of Physiology in the University
           of Glasgow.*
                                        (Bead March 2, 1896.)
I. The Physico-Chemical Condition                                 op    Caseinogen in                    Milk.
     According            to   the   latest views of          physiological                 chemists, the
innumerable fine particles of milk are identified with the caseinogen.
For instance, Halliburton! regards these particles                                          as    caseinogen
and nuclein which are obviously not fat-globules;                                           and Stirling         J
unhesitatingly             accepts     the view of the particulate                          nature of this
proteid, adducing as proof the fact of the absence of all particles
from the filtrate of milk through a porous clay-filter.
     I     used a "Berkefeld" diatomaceous filter (holding 150 c.c.) said
to
         " sterilise " water. On immersing it in milk, and by creating a
partial vacuum inside                  it,   there was obtained an exhaustion-filtrate
perfectly limpid and free from all particles.                                     Unless sterilised by
heat,       a   vigorous        growth       of    fungi    appeared in                 it,      there    being
abundant             nourishment       for     them, seeing that                  it   contains lactose,
chlorides, phosphates,               sulphates, calcium, and            a     proteid (undoubtedly
the lact-albumin),               but   is    incapable of clotting                  with rennet.             Its
reaction        is   faintly acid.           Caseinogen cannot, then, be held to be
"dissolved" in the               plasma,          in the ordinary           sense      of   a     "solution,"
else this pressure-filtrate would be coagulable and only as last              ;                          a
resource should we fall back upon the rather unsatisfactory hypo
thesis that          it   may be present as molecules too large to pass through
the pores of          a    diatomaceous filter.

it is these       that are held to he caseinogen                         exclusively, while the
globules        are    said   to be only fat.               Optically,        however,          all these
particles behave alike ; the smallest refract light exactly as do the
largest, but when one set are focussed the others are out of focus,
so    that they do not all look bright or dark at once.                                       Further, all
these particles appear to stain with                    1   per cent, osmic acid.
      Neither globules nor            granules         could be stained with any of the
following       : — Carmine,        picrocarmine, hematoxylin,                          and    eosin,   and
I    have completely failed to demonstrate                       the presence of an envelope
or membrane            round the globules,             much less to prove the assertion
that       it is of equal thickness round particles of all                       sizes, as is asserted
by Oliver.*
      We are warranted in asserting that the union of fat with casein
ogen        is an exceedingly            intimate      one,      whether the proteid be                    a
membrane or be interstitially                    associated        with the fat, and may,                  I
think,       say that      whereas        the    globules consist of a maximum of
fat and a       minimum of caseinogen, the granules have                                 a   minimum of
fat and a       maximum of caseinogen.                      It   is familiar to chemists                that
if    we    try to precipitate the caseinogen                    we precipitate the fat, and
if    we    try to clot the caseinogen we entangle the fat                          ;   in short, what
ever happens           to the caseinogen happens to the fat, and vice versd.
      With the        microscope     I   scrutinised a large number of clots, pre
cipitates, and wheys to find a striking similarity                            in all.          The acetic
acid-precipitate           in milk consists            of masses of the very smallest
particles agglutinated together,                 many of the globules                     being present
             with them — the             so-called      " precipitate of                caseinogen       en
along
tangling       the fat."        There is not an appearance                              of fibre.       But
cream       itself, "the fat," par excellence,                   is,   when treated with acid,
microscopically          the same thing, save that the relative proportion of
globules to granules           is   reversed.
      Amorsel of the clot (produced by rennet)                             is,   under the micro
scope,   extremely like the acid-precipitate —                            a   multitude             of fine
granules cohering with great tenacity, with                             relatively few globules
caaght amongst             them.         There    is   no vestige         of fibrillation.              The

nation   of a large number                 of the granules.             All   these     particles,
whether in clot or precipitate, stain with osmic acid.
  Further, the so-called "pure solutions of caseinogen" or "sus
           "
pensions   (which seems to be much nearer the truth), whether in
water or in dilute MgS04, have as many globules and granules as
whey or diluted milk, e.g., milk diluted to one in four.   Apart
from these particles they have no caseinogen, and the exhaustion-
filtrate of " pure caseinogen

                                will not only not clot, but contains
no proteid or chemical substance                    at all ;     it is water.
   The whey from the acid-precipitate in milk, or the whey from
the rennet clot, are alike turbid, owing to the large number of both
globules and granules which they contain                    ;    accordingly,     I find I      can
obtain from either of them a precipitate with acetic acid, and a
clot with rennet, calcic phosphate, and phosphoric                               acid present
together, of course very open as solidifications, yet, microscopically,
indistinguishable            from the original clots in milk, and with all their
particles stainable by osmic acid.
     Further,       as scrutinised under the microscope, the actions of                        acid
and rennet on a hot-stage                 are identical, resulting       in an agglutina
tion of multitudes              of granules and some             globules, many of both
kinds remaining isolated in the whey.
   Halliburton* states that Hoppe-Seyler got as much " casein from
cream, as from portions of milk below the cream" — presumably
from equal weights of cream                  and milk below it.               In other words,
there is as much caseinogen                 associated     with the large oil-globules
(the   cream)           as there    is with the smaller            globules      and smallest
particles in the skimmed milk below.
     Cream is but the comparatively quickly-formed                             aggregation of
the larger oil-globules risen to the surface, these being so much
lighter than their bulk of plasma                ; a   centrifuge hastens this separa
tion, but never effects               a   complete separation of the              " cream " or
" fat," for the          same reason that after a certain time some particles
will never rise           to the surface of skimmed              milk, it can         be no more
" creamed       "
                    ;    but is still opalescent,      and contains fat on analysis.
     Now, if        these    smallest particles        were fat alone,          they ought       in
time to rise to the surface of skimmed                      milk, and ought always to
be separated            by the "centrifuge";           the only inference             is,   not that

 they are pure              caseinogen,         but that they are fat-particles weighted
 down or loaded                  by caseinogen              till they     are of exactly the           same
 specific       gravity as milk-plasma, from which, therefore, they never
 rise, nor can be separated                    by centrifugalisation.
    If    they were pure caseinogen,                        skimmed milk should contain no
 fat ; but         it   does contain fat ; its particles stain with osmic acid like
 full milk.             In any   case,   if   any of these particles were pure or               "naked"
 fat, there         would be nothing to prevent their coalescing,                               the    milk
 would not be the emulsion                       it   is.        Thus skimmed milk            gives very
 little   fat            with cream (into which all the large globules
                    compared
 have     risen), because all the very smallest particles only are left in
 it,   but     it   gives    as      much casein            as    cream, because         associated    with
 these     myriads of specks of oil                   is    some not inconsiderable burden of
proteid, enough               to raise their specific                   gravity from that of oil to
 that     of   milk plasma.
       The envelope- theory appears                         to have several            things to recom
mend      it   :—
    (1.) The permanent emulsion, which                                  milk   is.
   (2.) The analogy from artificial emulsions, where egg-albumin or
gum       is   made the coating of oil-globules.
   (3.) Cohesiveness of these                         oil particles in precipitates and clots,
amounting               in certain    cases, e.g., in old shrunken                     clots, to extreme
tenacity       ;    naked oil-globules could not exhibit this property.
  (4.) The action of an alkali                    in apparently dissolving                off something,
so that        the fat can then be dissolved by ether, &c.                                 Even without
ether the globules can now coalesce                                   into large drops, which have
lost the spherical                appearance          and dark      periphery of fat-globules.
  (5.)       The fact that something                   is   broken or ruptured in " churning"
milk,     whereby            the oil-globules accumulate                       and     caseinogen     is   ap
parently liberated               ;   for butter-milk              contains     a     larger percentage of
casein       than milk skimmed.                       This       is   just what       we would expect,
for instead of fat being taken out of                             it   as cream with its associated
caseinogen, all the fat               is   left in    it,   but disintegrated there, and after
wards removed, having set free                         in    the plasma        its associated proteid,
which, being the caseinogen                           of the cream, comes to be added                      in
analysis to the casein of what would otherwise have been skimmed
milk whose percentage                    of casein      is       thus considerably raised.
   Hence,      I        think, we        are justified            in only saying at present that

76             Proceedings     of Royal Society of Edinburgh.                [sess.
both the largest and the smallest particles in milk contain fat                   in
direct ratio to their bulk, and caseinogen             in indirect ratio to     the
same; that the caseinogen           is associated     with the fat in      a most
intimate fashion, yet one which can be destroyed by                a   mechanical
process such as
                      " churning."
       II.  On Caseinogen— its Chemistry and Coagulation.
    Following Halliburton, the term           casein   is reserved for the    chief
proteid of milk when            it has been    rendered visible     as a clot     or
 precipitate by the action of an enzyme, usually rennin of rennet,
 sometimes bacterial ferments.
     Acetic acid is said merely to precipitate the caseinogen ; preci
 pitation also is the effect of saturating milk with MgS04.
     I  studied    the chemistry     of "pure       caseinogen"   with Ringer's
 solution or suspension, made by grinding up the washed acetic acid
 precipitate with fine prepared chalk and throwing the mixture                  into
 a couple of litres of     distilled water.       The chalk particles fall to the
 bottom, some of the large globules rise to the top, while the water
 in between contains the smaller globules and granules.                  "We   thus
 obtain an odourless, opalescent,         neutral liquid of varying specific
 gravity (depending on the amount of water used) which,                      unless
 sterilised by boiling, rapidly becomes putrid and clotted.                  Steril
 ised and well corked,       it keeps for    a  fortnight or more.      It  boils at
  103°    C,  and like milk, especially in an open dish, it skins over               ;
  this   pellicle   can be   nothing    else     than a surface    dessication     of
  "caseinogen."
      As in milk this proteid is entirely precipitated by saturating
  with MgS04,        a chemical and not a mechanical process, inasmuch
  as such precipitation       entirely  fails when ground glass, fine sand,
  dust, or chalk is agitated with the liquid.               The various familiar
  proteid    precipitants,    as might     be    expected,   entirely   precipitate
  caseinogen      both pure and in milk         ;  corrosive sublimate does not
  appear to precipitate       it in milk.     The corrosive mineral acids (in
  minini doses) precipitate caseinogen         both in milk and when "pure,"
  excess of the acid in many cases effecting a partial solution.             Acetic
  acid of only 10 per cent, tends in excess to dissolve its precipitate.
   Picric acid    does not precipitate     it in milk, but     does   in pure solu

tion.        Tartaric and citric acids precipitate it in milk, but not in
pure solution,           not even when their powders are boiled with it.
Carbolic acid fails to precipitate it in either condition.                                        Lactic acid
when dilute precipitates it in pure solution, but not in milk when
either dilute or strong.                 When strong it does not precipitate it
even in pure solution.                 This inertness of lactic acid is very remark
able when compared                with its          alleged       activity            as a    precipitant pro
duced by fermentation from lactose.
     On the other hand, tannic, benzoic,                              oxalic, salicylic, and phos
phoric acids precipitate caseinogen                          in both conditions.
     Boracic acid, so far from precipitating                               it,   is   a   very efficient anti
septic     ;   mixed with     it    milk     appears not to become putrid at the end
of three months.
     Milk       alone    would     not,     therefore, seem to be an antidote for
picric,        carbolic, or boracic acid poisoning.
     With       an alkali, e.g.,       KHO, NallO,               or    NH..HO, milk, especially
if   heated, becomes          less opalescent,               and      if   further heated some pre
cipitate        may appear.            In   a   very short time the solution becomes
yellowish-brown from decomposition and some saponification of the
fata.        Upon neutralisation or acidification                            an abundant            precipitate
falls.         With certain       acids, the neutralisation precipitate                            is   dissolved
in   excess of the acid, caseinogen                         in   these       circumstances behaving
like     a     true alkali-albumin.
     Pure caseinogen          treated,          e.g.,       with XII4.IIO,                is   "dissolved,"      in
that the solution            is    clarified    ;    neutralisation               or acidification preci
pitates        it,   and excess of weak acid only slightly dissolves it.

     After having added rennet to          a solution    containing caseinogen
  and kept the mixture        for sometime (30 minutes)            at 40°   C, the
  non-appearance of a clot is not now-a-days               held to prove        that
 caseinogen has not been acted on by rennet, but merely that the
 casein has not been precipitated.
     I  have corroborated the value of Ringer's test of the formation              of
  this soluble  casein,   which, for brevity,    I shall  call pro-casein, based
  on his belief in the two-fold nature of the process of clotting, viz.          : —
                        — The conversion of caseinogen by rennet into a
     (1.) Stage one.
 soluble form of casein (gerinnung).
     (2.) Stage two.
                      — The precipitation or solidification of pro-casein
 into a more or less cohesive clot or curd — casein — in presence of or
 by the action of certain substances (abscheidung).                This is shown
 by boiling the solution        containing    the rennet, so as to         kill the
 enzyme and prevent its further action.              When cold,        some   preci
 pitant of pro-casein is added to the tube, usually CaCl2, and              if after
 heating, a precipitate now falls,       it is  assumed    that the rennet       did
 its work independently        of the CaCl2 or other precipitant.               One
 cannot demonstrate stage two in ordinary milk, because clotting
 occurs in it without the addition of any precipitant            ;  it can be   well
 shown in diluted        milk or in pure solutions of caseinogen; thus,
 dilute milk (1 in 4) heated at 40° C. with M.R. gave no clot, it
 was then boiled, and on cooling 4 m. of CaCl2 (10 per cent, solu
tion) were added, when a clot appeared.                Had the solution not
been boiled, we should have called it a case of clotting due to the
adjuvancy of CaCl2 ; we now know the rennet acted without any
assistance from the CaCl2, which merely precipitated the preformed
pro-casein.       (CaCl2 precipitates pro-casein with great rapidity,
and, except in dilute solutions, as a firm curd, whereas it precipi
tates caseinogen     in milk very much       more slowly, at a much          higher
temperature, and often only as         a   slimy deposit).      The importance
of  a  free acid in effecting stage two is well brought out by the follow
ing experiments.         Ringer's pure caseinogen or milk + N.R., heated
gave no clot ;     boil each solution,    and add    1 in acetic acid to each,
when a clot forms in each.             Had we not previously            boiled   we
might have imagined the rennet had not been able to act until the
acid was added, whereas what really occurred was that the rennet
did its work in the neutral medium,                the result of       that   work

  becoming a visible           effect only    in  the acid     medium.      Both CaClo
  and    acetic      acid   (10 per cent.) are precipitants of pro-casein.
  CaCL is not a precipitant of pure caseinogen.                     Although one can
  make     "curds and whey" in neutral milk, still the lay public have
  recognised the fact that acidity               hastens the clot's appearance            in
  that the rennet essences             for culinary       purposes    are  highly     acid.
  Keeping in view the acidity of the preparations of rennet (upon
 which point          Dr Ringer      gives   us scarcely      enough information),         I
 repeated his experiments with milk, diluted with water                          1   in 4,
 which, as he alleges, does not clot                with Martindale's faintly          acid
 rennet.       "When      this has been added          to milk the acidity is very
 slight;    if   some     of this mixture       be boiled, and then either have
 added to      it  1   m. acetic   acid or    2  or 3 m.   CaCl0,   a clot is obtained.
 Again,     I always      obtained a clot when using            A.E. instead    of   M.R.
 with    1  in 4 milk.         Both these rennets formed pro-casein,                but it
required either acetic acid or CaCl2 to make the work of the faintly
acid rennet manifest
     Further, on this point, the following experiments tell their own
tale,    R.C.    +  N.R.   = 0,   whereas      RC.   +  A.R.   = clot, where     R.C.    =
Ringer's pure caseinogen.                Before the use of Ringer's            test     the
following        results    would     have     corroborated      the   statement      that
"acidity favours while alkalinity inhibits clotting." Milk + A.R. =
a clot at once, but milk rendered distinctly alkaline by the addition
of ^th of its volume of NH4.HO heated with M.R. gives no clot.
If   we   boil    some of this last and          add   2  or  3 m.  of CaCl., wc get       a
clot, proving          that alkalinity does not inhibit or antagonise                   the
formation of pro-casein,            but inhibits, without antagonising, the fall
of casein.           As far    as  my observations         go, rennet is antagonised
(?  killed) in stage one by the presence only of concentrated acid added
to one half the volume of the caseinogen-containing liquid ; or by
 being heated to 100° C.             Pro-casein formed in dilute solutions (e.g.,
 Ringer's caseinogen           or milk     1  in  4) may      not be precipitated by
                      thus— R.C.       N.R.    = 0, boil this, and                     still
 CaCL, alone,                        +                                 add CaCl2,
 no   clot, then add         1  in  acetic   acid when a clot appears.             Again,
 acidity was the only differential factor in the following in both of
 which CaCl2 was present — R.C. + CaCl2 + N.R. = 0 whereas R.C. +
 CaCl2 + A.R.
                      = clot.    Phosphoric acid,        I find, forms a firmer clot
 than other acid used at the same dilution.

                The Alkaline Earths as Precipitants                      of Casein.
     Of   these, calcic salts seem to be the readiest precipitants,                             only
the soluble salts of calcium having any effect, which shows that
this precipitation of pro-casein is not a mechanical process occurring
round the particles of an insoluble                    salt   as   round foci, for the calcic
phosphate, carbonate,  and hydrate (the two former being added
solid) have no precipitating power at all.   Ringer, indeed, holds
that CaHjOj dissolves casein.    The soluble salts of barium and
strontium also precipitate pro-casein, the following of which were
tested    — baric chloride,            nitrate,    carbonate,           strontic    nitrate,       and
lactate.       (The rather insoluble baric carbonate has not much preci
pitating       power).  Thus one cannot say it is the metal calcium
which is effective in this precipitation, because both Ba and Sr can
act vicariously ; nor is it the CI in association with    seeing that              it,

or no precipitating power              ;   this   is   interesting in that magnesium                is
the lightest atomically of the group, so that the three alkaline earths,
Ca, Ba, and Sr, which have so many properties in common, have this
additional one — the power of precipitating                          pro-casein.         Of   course,
MgS04 in saturation precipitates       just as      does caseinogen.

     It   is   interesting      that     calcic    orthophosphate,             being the chief

used in cheese-making,            it   becomes like the hardest outside portions
of a cheese.        It  has been        classified    as "coagulated       proteid," and
although      it is such in origin, yet it departs markedly from the
characteristics of that group as typified by " Fibrine." For instance,
it is readily soluble in strong acids, e.g., H,S04, and alkalies, e.g.,
KHO, forming a violet and                a  pink solution with        each respectively.
This is quite unlike fibrine.              Further, casein may be dissolved (to a
certain extent) in CaH^Oj, from which solution it may be clotted
by rennet, and this process may be repeated ad infin. — unlike
fibrine, but      like myosin.           Einger      has    insisted that casein       is   a
chemical compound usually of a calcic salt,                     with   the soluble form
 of casein :    this  I tried    to verify by chemical analysis of the whey
 or filtrate   from milk clotted by rennet, and                    milk   coagulated      by
 acetic   acid.     The results of           one    of these      analyses   are    as   fol

 From which we see there is less calcic orthophosphate                      in 50 c.c. of
 rennet   whey than there is in 50 c.c. of acetic acid whey — a differ
 ence   which is a measure             of the salt that has combined with the
 procasein to form the            clot.     This    also shows that there         is some
 chemical difference          between the           precipitation of caseinogen by
 an   acid and the clotting of it by rennet — a difference able to be
 expressed,    at least,  in  terms of the union of calcic phosphate.                 Some
 call this  clot a caseate of calcium.             Normally in milk it may be so             ;
 but, whatever       view we take of its chemical nature, we must not
 forget    that    artificially     we      can    produce      a  barium-casein       or   a
 strontium-casein       with    as great      ease    as a calcium-casein.       Analysis
  also shows    that there is less calcic phosphate in rennet whey than
  in the same volume            of milk      ; again     a   proof that this salt has
  chemically united        with      the   procasein.
     I believe   I have been       able to observe a slight rise of temperature
 in milk to which           rennet was         added      over   that maintained in         a
 specimen of pure        milk   ;  but, without         further corroboration of this

cheese         to begin          with.        What     I    believe happens                   is,   that under
bacterial fermentation the proteid (casein)  partly converted into         is
caseoses or peptones, thus liberating much of the previously inter-
stitially confined fat.

              Salts in the Clotting of Milk.
     Ringer's words are                 :
                                             " The antagonism          between calcium salts and
sodium,            potassium,          and ammonium salts                is      limited        to the preci
pitation of casein, and does not affect the chemical change                                                  from
caseinogen           to casein."*              In this     research  I       did not investigate the
action of the sodium and ammonium salts.                                           It   must be remem
bered       that Dr Ringor                   used —¦

in other words,                  alleges      that the presence              of    a    salt of potassium
antagonises           the precipitation             of procasein by          a    calcic salt.          I   there
fore thought              it   well to study the general question of the effect upon
the clotting of                milk of        as   many potassium salts                 as

hands on, viz., twenty different salts.                             Believing, for reasons given
already,           that   a    neutral or faintly acid rennet will not bring about
clotting in          a    solution containing such an amount of calcic salt                                      as,
with       a   more       acid    rennet, will cause clotting,                   I      used        a   glycerine-
extract of rennet of rather                          more       distinctly         acid       reaction       than
Martindale's.
     Half      a    test-tubeful of fresh neutral milk was dosed with                                        2   or
3   c.c. of the solution of the                     potassium salt (30 per cent, solution),
and then received                 5    m. of the rennet         ;   the whole being thus heated
to 50" C.
     A     control experiment was in each case made, wherein the                                              con-

 or neutralised or the reaction made            faintly acid by acetic acid        : —
 Potassium, bicarbonate, bichromate, carbonate,               chromate, cyanide,
 ferricyanide, permanganate,        — these    salts,   except the second,         are
 alkaline, some very decidedly            so.
      No clot was obtained when potassium oxalate was added to the
  milk, — the examination of this result will be taken up under
  decalcified   milk.   In no    case was a salt of calcium          whl-l     to the
  tubes, so that where a clot did occur           it   was in presence     of   a pre
  ponderating amount of potassium compared with calcium salt.
       Thus, the group of potassium salts is sharply divided into two
  groups — (1) those faintly      alkaline, neutral, or acid salts which do
  not antagonise    the clotting of procasein        in milk ; and (2) a smaller
  group, all alkaline,   which   either   inhibit  the   fall of casein, j'.<?., delay
   its appearance beyond the normal time for clotting, or antagonise                  it
  altogether.
       This inhibition or antagonism would seem to depend more upon
   the  reaction of the potassium salt than upon any property in the
   salt as a salt of potassium.
       It was not necessary    in these experiments to apply Ringer's test
   as to  whether procasein had been formed, because he holds that

the potassium salts do not antagonise this first stage of                              clotting       ;
in several cases it         was applied, one of       which is given below.
     Milk and K-cyanide            +   A.R.   =    0: boiled and divided in three
portions, to one of which was added                   1   m. acetic acid, result a             clot   ;
to a second, 4 m. of CaCl2 (10 % sol.), result a clot at once                          (showing
that soluble casein was pre-formed)                  ; to a     third,      1    m. acetic     acid
+ 3 m. CaCl2, result clot.
     I   made a large number of similar               experiments with K-salts                 and
caseinogen (Ringer's pure solution), but my results are too perplex
ing to be published at this time               ;   the general result seems to               point
to a corroboration          of the antagonism as alleged.                       Although some
of the clots in the milk dosed with K-salts were jelly-like, others
(ana amongst them some of those                     in alkaline tubes) contracted to
clots of very high tenacity.
                       V. The Case       op        Decalcified Milk.
     There     still remains the        case       of milk treated with potassium
oxalate, which, if warmed with a not excessively acid rennet,                                  will
yield no clot.          In order   to deal    with absolutely limeless substances,
I   added potassium oxalate to the rennet, and by centrifugalising                                a
portion of       it,   obtained decalcified rennet.             In like manner       I    centri-
fugalised the decalcified milk, obtaining                   a   copious deposit of amor
phous calcic oxalate, which passes through                         ordinary         filter-paper.
If   a   portion of the decalcified milk, which has been warmed with
decalcified rennet for upwards of half an hour and has not clotted,
be boiled        and cooled, we find that            a    clot immediately appears on
the addition of either          few m. of CaCl2 (or other soluble salt of
                                 a
Ca, or     a   salt of Ba or Sr) or  m. acetic acid.
                                        1
     Throughout          these   processes    we have (1) the native                  K-salts of
the milk   (2) the K-phosphate, presumably formed in the double
             ;
decomposition between the calcic phosphate and K-oxalate    and                           ;
(3) some excess, doubtless, of uncombined K-oxalate.    The failure
of casein to appear as     clot with rennet in decalcified milk
                                   a                                                             is
therefore due not to the presence of K-salts but to the absence of
calcium salts.
     Decalcified        milk allows its caseinogen               to    be       precipitated    by
acetic acid and by all the proteid precipitants,                      as   one might expect.

As    to its precipitability             by salts,      I   made    a   large number of obser
vations tending to show that decalcified caseinogen                                  is,   on the whole,
more unstable               than normal caseinogen                  in milk — result perhaps

 I       had      been        often     struck      with the apparently unsatisfactory
character          of the artificial              digestion of milk by means of                          "2   %
HC1 and dry pepsine, in that no visible                                   change appeared                even
after days          on the water-bath.                 I        thought     it   well      to   study the
powers of coagulation                    of several artificial            preparations, and their
relative efficiency             in digestion of milk               as shown by the amount of
caseoses         or peptones formed.

                                    a    little   1    %   sodium carbonate.
      At the end of            5'   on the water-bath at 40°                C, I    reported —
      (1)    In    the tube with liquor pepticus there was                       a   dense, tenacious,
 rope-like clot       ;
      (2)    In    that with the liquor pancreaticus there was an exceed
 ingly soft, friable clot,              with      as   little cohesion      as possible         ;
      (3)    In that with the glycerine-extract                           there was        a    fairly firm
 clot,      not so good as in (1). In none of the others                                was     there any
 vitiUe change.
      At the end of            30' no further visible change                     was to be observed.
 After five hours, the tubes                   with the pepticus and glycerine-extract
 showed some signs of                   a   partial solution of the clot in each, but                         it
 was        by   no means       marked.           That with the pancreaticus contained
 a   turbid       fluid :     all the clot had vanished             ;   the fluid was much more
 translucent than              milk, and more              so than the contents of any other
 tube.           The superior translucency in this tube                         I    attribute        to the
 partial         decomposition           and saponification               of     the fat —      a    process
 which could not go on                   in any other tube. The                  second tube showed

an open              floeculent precipitate        ;   the first and third                   showed    no
change.
     After eight         days      I   tested   the tubes         for caseoses or peptones             by
the       Biuret       reaction.         The pancreatic           digestion yielded the               test
most frankly,            next thereafter that with liquor pepticus,                           then    that
with HC1 and pepsine, then that with pepsine alone (probably due
to bacterial fermentation of caseinogen),                               and lastly a mere            trace
with the glycerine-extract.
   My experiments with milk mixed with water or with CaH20.»,
in order to render it more digestible, as it is alleged, tend to show
that this property is entirely due to the greater laxity of the                                       clot
which forms when the solid particles of milk are, from any cause,
separated            from one another.             Evidently         the power of rennin               for
binding particle to particle is weakened                           when it has to act through
a    greater          distance upon these              particles    :    none    of these clots        in
diluted milk has the absolute laxity of the pancreatic clot in milk.

                                   INCREASING ITS DIGESTIBILITY.
      This       I   fully   confirm.       Sir William Priestley* called attention
to Mons. Budin of Paris's observation that milk, not diluted                                          and
not boiled, but merely treated as above, yields a clot of digestibility
superior to that produced                   in previously unhealed milk.
      I   find       the clot with        Benger's      liquor pepticus           is,   in   the case of
the heated             milk, an exquisite jelly of great friability upon any
such agitation as occurs with                     the gastric           movements,       whereas      the
tenacity and density of the clot by pepticus in ordinary milk would
make the mass resist this breaking process for                              a   much longer time.
After       some hours there was distinctly                        more     proteose         in the tube
with the soft clot than in that with the hard.

 fresh milk yields a blue colour         with tincture of guaiac, while boiled

      I am  unable to substantiate the statement of authors that boiled
 milk is     "far more difficult        to   coagulate than         unboiled      milk."
 The clot     in boiled milk       so entirely   fills the tube like        a jelly, and
  separates from its whey so slowly, that unless the tube be examined
  very closely,   and by inverting      it from time to time, the time of the
  formation    of the clot may easily be missed.

  cannot find that the rennet clot occupies any longer time than                         in
  ordinary   milk    to do its work, whether          it  be added to cold           milk
 previously     boiled or to warm milk previously                boiled.        Authors
 state   that this  " difficulty " is due to     some of the calcic phosphate
 having     become     insoluble.    I  can find none of         it upon prolonged
  centrifugalisation of boiled milk.
      The  fat of milk may        be very   strikingly shown by adding               to a
  large vessel   of milk     Jth or so of its volume of a         1   % sol.   of osmic
 acid.     The mixture in about half an hour will have                      become     jet
 black, and does not purify within           a year.
                 The "Wheys, Dialysates,             and    Filtrates.
     In  rennet wliey there is some caseinogen,            for there     are yet many
particles.       It  may be precipitated          by     heating      the whey with
CaCl2 + and a m. or two of phosphoric                acid, and it may be clotted

     Rennet whey treated with acetic acid gives a precipitate quite
indistinguishable        microscopically from any of the acid-precipitates
of caseinogen.

  (1) Caseinogen is not, in the ordinary acceptation, in solution                                   in
milk-plasma, it is in the most intimate association with the fat ;                                  in
all probability the particles consist of fat in direct ratio and                                    of
caseinogen in indirect ratio to their bulk : in this sense, caseinogen
is "particulate."
     The arguments that           caseinogen         is present as an envelope are                still
entitled    to respect;         but there is some evidence pointing                     to        this
proteid being interstitially associated                    with the fat.

   (2) Both the clots and precipitates in milk and in
caseinogen are more or less cohesive agglutinations of the pre
existing    particles     :    there is no trace of fibrous structure.

Their pressure-filtrates contain no proteid.
   (4) Ringer's view of the clotting of casein being a twofold pro

     An analysis of             the versification of some of our nineteenth                         cen
tury poets           has       produced        certain very interesting             that
                                                                                     results
may be graphically represented.                        The subject of versification still
demands          more         exact    treatment, and any contributions which em
body the results of real analytical treatment are of value.
     It   is well known that the chief objection to our iambic measure,
which is the normal English                       measure, is its tendency              to produce
a monotonous                  pendulum-like       tick-tick.         If,    on the other hand,
we employ anapa:stic                   measure, the          triple movement to every foot
demands          too much exertion of the tongue.                          English verse possess
ing the finest cadences lies between                           the two extremes of a pure
iambic treatment and                    a pure    anapaestic treatment.
     It    may      be    laid down       as    a safe       dictum that, in lyric verse at
least, one anapaest in a line otherwise iambic constitutes                                 it   an ana
paestic      line.       The poet who writes in iambics is not then free to
introduce           anapaests.         The expedient to which he will resort is a
free use of the catch.                  "Wo    shall   sec    that Gordon, in his exquisite
ballad The Sick Stuck- Ruhr, uses the catch, where emotion is at                                              a
high pitch,              13    times    in 16 lines.           A   poet writing       in     anapaests
is free to use iambs                   where     he will,      and    even     the   monosyllabic
foot at the beginning of a line or after the cawura.                                    Browning,
in his AM             Vogler, has actually one hexameter                  line (Stanza III.
1.   7)   with only           5 unaccented       syllables,     or one less than an iambic
line can have.                It   is the shortest       line in the poem and is placed
next to an 11-syllabled line, the longest                            line he uses.         There        are
only three of these 11-syllabled lines in this poem                                  (III.      1, 2,    8).
The average length of his line in the poem                            is   14'22 syllables.
     Of the theoretically possible                     maximum of 96 unaccented                         syl
lables in an 8-lined anapaestic hexametric stanza, Browning                                        never
in any stanza gives                us more       than 71, or less than 61.              The       move

verse of the sensations               of     a   musician in producing                a masterpiece.
     The curve (see Plate) represents                        five main phases of emotion.
     Stanzas        I.,   II., III., IV.         are the overture, with            a   gradual height
ening of emotion.
     Stanzas        V.,   VI., VII.      give the supreme                mountain-top height of
delight in creation.                The artist          is   " in heaven,"          and      was    "   made

sidered)       of spiritual          comfort:           "There      shall      never be one lost
good."
     Stanzas     X., XI.,        XII.    are      in   the mood of cheerful acquiescence,

     In Rugby Chapel              we have unrhymed                  anapaestic         trimeters, with
very frequent             initial truncation of both               unaccented          syllables.         The
average        number of           unaccented            syllables to the lino                 is   slightly

    Stanzas    IX., X., XL    are intellectual   and reflective, rather    than
emotional ; hence, though not sad and almost despairing, like               VL,
they are sober and serious, approaching the iambic treatment.
    In  The Sick Stock-Rider the writer has chosen an iambic measure,
heptameters and pentameters alternating,               with alternate rhyme.
The measure is used with much skill, especially in respect to the
caesura,   which is   used to break the mechanical         beat of the iambs,
and bring       in  anapaestic   effects;   but this is beside our present
treatment.        The element of expansion           for emotional     effect   is
 found in the catch, which is remarkably frequent when the subject
 is exhilarating,    while it sinks to     zero where there is no liveliness.
 The points     on the curve are obtained by estimating         in fractions of
 1 6 the ratio   of the number of     catches  in each stanza to the     number
 of lines composing it.        In the  case of the second stanza, which       has
  16 lines, the number 13 represents the real number of catches as
 well   as the ratio J  Jths.    On the other hand, in Stanza       VII,  which
 has only 8 lines, the real number of catches is 3, giving              for ratio
 ¦j^ths.     Similarly with the others.         The following       is a theme
 analysis   : —
     I.  Overture.     Weariness, brightening      into cheerfulness.
     II. Exhilarating reminiscences — " glorious                  "
                                                         gallops and feats of
  derring-do.

        Notes on Clouds.               By   John Aitken,         Esq., F.E.S.
                                  (Read May 4, 1896.)
    There are two points connected             with clouds on which      I  wish to
make a few remarks.              The first is on the classification of clouds,
and    the second     on the manner in which certain forms of clouds are
produced.         It  may be as well to remark at the outset               that the
observations       are those of an
                                        " outsider," being in     a  department of
meteorology to which the writer has given but little attention, and
they have been          written with the view of calling the attention of
specialists, and getting their opinion on the subject.
    It  appears to me that in classifying clouds they ought first of all
to be divided into two great classes.               In   the  one class should be
placed all clouds       in  the process of formation, and in the other those
in the process of decay.            The two classes might be called Cloud* in
Formation and Clouds in Da-ay.                  "We may take       Cumulus clouds
as   an    example     of the former, and Nimbus              of the latter.     My
observations       made    in  the clouds themselves        have shown that there
is a difference       in the structure of these two classes of clouds.             In
clouds in formation           the water particles are much smaller and            far
more    numerous than in clouds in decay             ;  and while the particles in
 clouds in decay are large enough             to be seen    with  the unaided eye
when they        fall  on a properly lighted       micrometer, they are so small
in clouds       in formation that,        if  the condensation is taking       place
rapidly, the       particles cannot be seen without            the aid of a lens    of
 considerable magnifying power.               In  the former case the number of
 particles    falling   per square     millimetre is small, while in the latter
 they are so     numerous that it is impossible to count them.
    It  appears that one good end            might be served       by adopting this
 classification.      It  would direct the attention of observers           more    to
 looking     on the processes going on in decay for an explanation of
 many    of the forms observed in clouds.              In  most   books on clouds,
  when   describing the different shapes of clouds, it is almost always
 assumed      that they are in the process of formation, and the whole
  explanation     of the shapes taken by the clouds is founded on this

 supposition.            Now it is very evident that very many clouds are                                in
 the process of decay, and their forms can only be explained by                                         the
 processes going on under these conditions.
      This brings         me      to the        second     point      in this        communication,
 namely, the manner in which ripple-marked                               cirrus clouds are pro
 duced.  The explanation which has generally been accepted of the
formation of this form of cloud   that the ripple markings are due
                                                    is,
to the general movements of the air giving rise to series of eddies              a
the axes of the eddies being horizontal, and roughly parallel to each
other.       It   is   very evident that the air revolving round these hori
zontal axes, that           is,   in   a   vertical plane, will at the lower part of                     its
path be subjected to compression, and at the upper part to expan
sion.      The result of this              will evidently         be, supposing the air            to be
nearly saturated with moisture,                    a    tendency for cloudy condensation
to take place in the air at the upper part of its path, and                                 it    is   this
cloudy condensation in the upper part of the eddies that                                          is   sup
posed to produce the               ripple-like cirrus       ;    each ripple mark           indicating
the upper part of an eddy.                      One objection    I      have always felt to this
explanation        is,   that   it   is   difficult to imagine that the small amount
of elevation and consequent expansion and cooling could give rise
to so dense an amount of clouding as   generally observed. Any  is
clouding     produced in this way one would expect to be extremely
thin and filmy.           I        have for the last few years made                          frequent
observations of these clouds, and                       I   have to admit           I    have never
once seen them           in the        process of formation,            or seen one appear in a
clear sky.         In all         cases     that have come            under my observation,
these ripple clouds have been clouds in decay.                                They     are generally
formed out of some strato-cirrus or similar cloud.                               When     we observe
these     strato-cirrus         in fine weather,           it    will    be      found     that    they
frequently change to ripple-marked                         cirrus before vanishing.                    The
process     of their       formation            would     seem       to be   :   the     strato-cirrus
gradually thins away               till   it   attains such      a   depth, that       if   there are
any eddies at their level, the eddies break the stratus cloud up into
parallel or nearly parallel masses, the clear air                                being     drawn        in
between the eddies.                    It will   be observed that          this explanation re
quires the eddies, but not to produce the clouding, only to explain
the breaking up of the uniform cirrus cloud into ripple cirrus.
  One thing which supports                        this explanation            is,    that lenticular-

cirrus are frequently observed with ripple markings on one or more
sides of them just where the cloud is thin enough to be broken
through by the eddies.                 If      we watch these lenticular-formed clouds
under these           conditions,          we frequently           see     the     ripple      markings
getting nearer and nearer the centre                            as the     cloud decays; and at
last, when nearly dissolved, the ripple markings will be seen extend
ing quite across the cloud.                      It    seems probable that                " mackerel "
and other cloud forms may be produced                             in    the same way.
    The shapes          which    these          ripple cirrus assume               are        much more
varied than is generally supposed.                         I   lately observed         a moat      interest
ing form in the south of France while the mistral was blowing
strongly.         There       were         a   few     cirrus      in    the     sky     at    the       time,
and one of            these    was         rapidly     being broken              up into           irregular
ripple      forms, but at one point there was formed                               a most          perfectly
cylindrical-shaped            piece,       its length          being about twenty times its
diameter.         The whirling effect of the eddy was very evident by
the circular streaking of the clouding.                                 Further,       this cloud was
evidently hollow, that               is,   the interior was filled with clear air as the
cloud was thinnest along the axis, and                           it   had all the appearance                of
a    revolving tube of cloudy air.
     It   is   not contended      here that ripple clouds are never produced                                in
the manner which has generally been accepted, only that so far                                              as
the writer's observations go they have never been observed forming
in    the      manner supposed.                 It    is   hoped that others will put the
explanation here offered to the test of observation,                                and       it   is   princi
pally with view of getting

      Effect of Normal Gastric Secretion on Amylolysis                           Ihj   Ptyalin.
     The following experiments were performed with normal human
gastric secretion.         After thoroughly washing out                      the stomach of              a
healthy man, several          ounces of          a   dilute solution of Caffyn's liquor
carnis were introduced into it.                      After      the lapse     of an hour the
contents       of the stomach       were       drawn off, filtered, and used instead
of the pure acid solutions in former experiments.                                The acidity          of
the gastric fluid was due to inorganic acid and                             amounted to 0-15
per cent, hydrochloric           acid.

     This experiment shows that, in                    the stomach,         with an acidity          of
the contents less than that even                       normally present          in the gastric
secretion,      the action of ptyalin             is      wholly    restrained.
     Was the ferment merely inhibited                       from action by the acid, or
was   it   destroyed   1
     To determine this,     I      took        equal      volumes of this gastric fluid,
1   per cent, starch       solution, and saliva, and having mixed them,
carefully neutralised the mixture with                      a   solution of caustic potash,

On examining the mixture shortly after neutralisation, the whole
of the starch was found to have undergone                          conversion.         It   reduced
Fehling's       solution strongly, and contained 0-22                        per cent,        of    re

   I   performed      similar    experiments with the gastric fluid from                   a
case of    chronic gastric catarrh, the acidity of which was equal to
0 067 per cent,       hydrochloric      acid.

After being neutralised, however, the starch                      was completely con
verted     within ten minutes,           and     the reducing substances           present
amounted to 0*23 per cent.
    Does the        acid merely restrain,           or   does     it actually kill      the
 ptyalin ferment,       if  exposed      long enough to its influence            1
    By   some   authors    it  is affirmed      that the former alone occurs, and
 that the conversive action of ptyalin               again    becomes      potent on the
 gastric contents      becoming alkaline after passing into the intestine.
 Others, again, state        that the ferment is actually killed during its
 stay in the stomach.
    Outside of the body            I  found that the following              takes    place.
 I placed    in a vessel

 At   the   end of an hour the starch had undergone                       no conversion.
 I then carefully neutralised           the     mixture and kept it at 38° C. for
 thirty minutes.          It   was    then found        to  contain      much erythro-
 dextrin, soluble starch,         and    some unchanged starch.               Substances
 reducing Fehling's         solution amounted to 0-19 per cent.
    In another experiment           I left    a similar mixture at        a temperature
 of 38° C.    for twenty-four hours before neutralising it.                   At   the end
 of this    period the starch had undergone no conversion.                          It was
 then   neutralised and kept at the same                     temperature for thirty
 minutes, at the end of which                time it contained much unchanged
 starch, some      soluble starch and erythrodextrin,                and 0 09 per cent,
 of reducing      substances.       After being kept in the warm chamber
 for two    hours, it gave      no coloration with iodine (showing that the

starch had been changed              into the higher or achroodextrins), and
contained 0-138 per cent,             reducing substance.
    These experiments show that, with the degree of acidity found
in   the above     secretions,    the   ferment ptyalin       is not killed, but its
converting action is prevented.             The diastatic action of the saliva
seems also to become            weaker the longer it is exposed             to the in
fluence      of the acid,    as   is shown in the second             case, where     the
ptyalin       was  exposed     to   the action of the acid for twenty-four
hours.        In this  case the converting            action was feeble and very
slow compared         with its action when exposed               to the influence of
 the    acid   for one hour only.
     I  am inclined      to believe,     therefore, that, as the acidity of the
 gastric contents increases           during      digestion, so is the power of the
 ferment ptyalin diminished, till, at the end of digestion, it must                   be
 almost,     if not entirely,    destroyed       and rendered incapable of resum
 ing its function in the small intestine.

  a healthy individual       (the acidity of the latter was equal to 0 211
  per cent, hydrochloric acid), and kept all at a temperature of 38s C.
  There was absolutely no change              in the starch even after the lapse
 of two hours.

On testing the fluid one hour afterwards, 0 6 per cent, of reducing
sugar was present.         This  appeared     to be the maximum conversion,
as the figure      remained the same at the end of the second hour.
We note, however, that in this              case   the   acidity was practically
nil, and the        conversion was      probably due         to saliva    swallowed
 accidentally.
    My next experiments            were    made     with starch in        the   living
 itomach.
    I. Healthy Digestion. — After having thoroughly washed out the
 stomach    of  a   healthy man, 250 c.c. of a 5 per cent, mucilage of
 starch were     injected into his stomach,         taking care that no saliva
 was included.
    After the lapse of       one   hour the elastic        tube   was passed,      and
 72   cc   of a turbid,      whitish fluid       were   withdrawn.         The total
acidity was equal        to 0-22    per cent      hydrochloric      acid,   and was
composed       entirely   of this   acid.     The    contents consisted        of un
changed     starch in large       amount, tolerable quantities            of soluble
starch   and erythrodextrin,       along with     a trace   of reducing sugar.
    After the lapse of two hours, 56 c.c. of clear, viscid fluid were
syphoned      off.    The acidity was inorganic, and amounted to 0'1                  7
per cent.       There was very little starch present, and no erythro
dextrin    or sugar.
    The erythrodextrin       and sugar which were present at the end of
the   first hour had either been absorbed              through the walls of the
stomach or had been           passed   on through       the    pylorus.
    II. Chronic Gastric Catarrh. — As in the preceding,                   250 c.c. of
the    5  per   cent    starch mucilage were          injected    into the empty
stomach.
    One hour later, 96 c.c. of a       whitish fluid       were   drawn off.       The
total   acidity was equal to 0*127 per cent, hydrochloric acid.                 Much

unchanged starch was present,                       soluble starch and erythrodextrin
in small amount,             and     a mere        trace    of sugar.
    After    an   interval        of two hours, 100 c.c. of                   a  thick whitish-
yellow      fluid     were obtained               from      the   stomach.          Organic and
mineral acids were              present in nearly equal amounts.                         The total
acidity amounted to             0 2 25 per         cent.       Here, also, much unchanged
starch was present,            a   small amount of erythrodextrin,                     and  a trace
of sugar.

solution were            injected      into this       patient's stomach             with similar
precautions.
    After the       lapse     of one hour,            41     c.c. of clear      thin fluid were
withdrawn.            The      total     acidity      amounted to           O'Ol per cent           as
hydrochloric          acid.        Small       amounts of unchanged                   and soluble
starch      were present,            but     no erythrodextrin.                Reducing       sugar
amounted to           1    per cent.
    After the     lapse of two hours, 67 c.c. of thin yellowish fluid were
obtained.        The acidity was almost nil, amounting to 00036                                   per
cent.     A   trace of starch was present,                   but erythrodextrin          and sugar
were both absent.

    A   glance at this table shows that, with the acidity of the healthy
stomach       or   in pathological conditions where                        the    acidity is not
diminished,       conversion of starch                 is soon      brought        to an end in
the    stomach.           Whereas,        in    those     conditions        where       the  gastric
juice has      a  feeble degree of acidity,                    the conversion of starch              is

carried on to a great extent        in the  stomach, as is shown in the case of
pernicious anaemia, where probably amylolysis was carried on to its
full limit, and the products either at once absorbed                  or passed on
into the duodenum.
    In   these experiments the starch was introduced directly into the
stomach by means of the stomach-tube.                  In this   way there was no
admixture         of saliva   except what        was   swallowed      subsequently.
The table        shows that, in cases where the normal acidity was not
lessened, this swallowed saliva had            little conversive action        on the
starch.      It likewise shows that even a pure starch solution introduced
into the stomach promotes          the secretion of hydrochloric         acid  ; a fact
which, on a        priori grounds,    we should not have expected           as being
inimical to the digestion of amylaceous              matters.
    From the high degree of conversion which the starch has under
 gone    in the stomach of the patient with pernicious anaemia,              I should
 be   inclined to think that this was due either to swallowed saliva or
 to a conversive       ferment secreted by the gastric mucous membrane,
 as  has been described as occurring in the stomach               of the pig.
     The above, however, is not the normal condition in which starchy
 food is received into the stomach.             It is always mixed up       with   and
 accompanied by the products of salivary secretion.
     In   order to see what changes       occur     in starch    solutions received
 into the stomach        under such conditions,        I  performed the following
 experiments       : —
       Combined Effect     of Salivary awl Gastric Digestion           on Starch.
     Having thoroughly         washed      out the      stomach,    I   allowed     the
 following      patients to eat slowly     a  fluid mucilage of boiled starch.
     I. Healthy Digestion. — 250         c.c. of boiled starch solution           eaten
 slowly.
     Fifteen minutes later       I   drew off 40 c.c.        The total acidity was
 equal to 0*061        per cent,    hydrochloric      acid.     Unchanged       starch,
 soluble     starch, and erythrodextrin         were    present   in large amount,
 and reducing sugar         amounted to 0'16 per cent.
     I  carefully neutralised this fluid, and kept it at a temperature                of

 38° C. to see      if any further conversion would take          place.     After
 being kept thus for forty-five           minutes,   no further change had
 occurred.       The ptyalin ferment had, in this        case, been    killed by
 this degree of acidity of the gastric             contents, viz.,    0-061     per
cent, hydrochloric acid.
     One hour after the ingestion       of the starch solution other 45 c.c.
 were syphoned off.           The total acidity equalled 0-102 per cent,         as
 hydrochloric      acid  ; much unchanged starch was present, along          with
 traces of erythrodextrin       and sugar.
     This   also was neutralised and kept at 38° C.     for forty -five minutes.
 Neither in this      case did any  further change occur.
     These examples illustrate that the normal acidity of the healthy
gastric     secretion     not  only restrains but soon kills       the salivary
 ferment.

erythrodextrin,        along with   a  faint trace   of sugar.
     This   was neutralised and kept at 38° C.       for three-quarters of an
hour, but underwent no further change.
     One hour after the sterch was eaten, 38 c.c. were withdrawn.
     Total acidity    = 0" 196 per cent.
     A  very small amount of starch was present, but no erythrodex
trin or    sugar.
     This underwent        no further change after being neutralised           and
kept at 38° C. for forty-five minutes.

    Much starch was present, unchanged and soluble,              some    erythro

     From     this   we learn that even a short stay              in the stomach during
 the digestion       of  a simple carbohydrate           suffices     to   kill the ferment
 ptyaliu.       This ferment       acts with great rapidity, and the amount of
 starch     which was found in the stomach converted into dextrins
 and sugar had          probably undergone this change during the process
 of mastication        and    swallowing,       and for a short            period    after its
  entrance      into the stomach.
     In the      case  of the dyspeptic, the ferment was not killed after
 a stay    of ten minutes in the         stomach,     and was still able to continue
 its amylolytic       action    in    a  less acid      medium.            A    stay of     five
 minutes      longer, however, in the stomach, during which time the
 amount       of acid had increased,             was     enough to destroy the fer
  ment, for,      after being neutralised,          no further amylolytic               action
 took place.

104        Proceedings     of Royal Society of Edinburgh.           [sess.
   We may therefore state that the diastatic ferment of the saliva
is killed by   a  certain degree    of acidity of the  gastric contents
(varying from 0'06 to O'l per cent, hydrochloric acid), and, depend
ing on the rapidity of production of this acid, it continues active
in the stomach until this limit is reached.
   The   sugar   formed from     starch conversion during this period
must be at once absorbed       in healthy conditions, as it is not found
in the stomach at   a  later stage in digestion.

                               (Read March 2, 189(5.)
    This inquiry embraces the seventeen years beginning with 1878
and    ending with 1894, the material utilised being the weekly
mortality returns published by the Registrar-General for Scotland.
Particulars    are given in these        returns of the number of deaths
from small-pox, measles, scarlet fever, diphtheria, whooping-cough,
diarrhoea,    fever, croup, laryngitis,          bronchitis,    pneumonia,      and
pleurisy.     Some of the diseases are classed together,              viz., typhus
and typhoid        fever, croup and laryngitis,           and bronchitis,     pneu
monia, and pleurisy.          The data discussed       also embraces returns of
deaths from all causes, deaths           of infants under one year of           age,
and of persons       aged sixty years and upwards.              The deaths have
all been entered as having occurred during                the calendar weeks in
 which they were         registered,    but   as   notification  usually    follows
decease    by several     days, a slight     element     of error is introduced.
 Since the returns do not give any information as to the duration of
 the illness, we are unable to ascertain             whether specific      weather
 types are in casual      relationship to disease.         There are every week
 a number of deaths from uncertified and unspecified               causes.   These
 omissions   are subsequently         rectified, but their      presence    in   the
 returns   does    not affect    the   general    results of the investigation.
 It is our intention merely to discuss some of the broader               results of
 the inquiry,    the chief object of which is to give a first approxima
 tion to the seasonal       death-rate   of the diseases under review.            In
 discussing   the relation between         weather     and disease, it is well to
 keep in    mind the fact that different              diseases   exhibit   varying
 degrees   of sensitiveness      to weather influences,        and that climatic
 changes take some       little time to   affect the human subject.
    The meteorological data for the period under review were sup

106          Proceedings    of Royal Society of Edinburgh.               [sess.
plied to the Registrar-General      by the Edinburgh observers of the
Scottish   Meteorological    Society.   The observations were taken at
Cumin Place until 1886, when the station was changed to Blacket
Place, where they are still carried on.*           These two stations are
only half a mile from each other and at the same height above
mean sea-level,    the readings being thus strictly comparable.             In
order to supplement the information        given weekly to the Registrax-
General, monthly means of the more important               climatic elements
have been      computed for the seventeen years, thus enabling                a
tolerably   complete representation of the climatic           features to be
given.    Some of the monthly         means    have been compared with
their averages for long periods, so that some idea might be obtained
as to the departures from the normal        during the period under con
sideration   (see Table   III.).    Tables   for each    week, showing the
cumulative variability of temperature, have been computed.              These
values are found by taking       the day to day differences in the mean
temperature    t of  successive   days and adding up the seven daily
values during the week.        The variability of temperature is largely
the result of changes in the direction of the wind.           No information
is available for the period under review as to the height of the
underground water or the percentage of gases, as carbonic acid gas
and other deleterious substances in the underground air.               This is
a matter    for regret,  as  it is generally believed that the        state  of
public health depends in no inconsiderable          degree on the chemical
and bacteriological condition of the superficial layers of the earth.
    The curves which        accompany     this   paper were prepared         as
follows : — The number of deaths from           each   disease   having been
extracted for each week during the seventeen years, the values
were added up and divided           by fifty-two   in order to obtain the
average   weekly death-rate (see Table I.).         The percentage excess
or defect of each week's mean from the average of the whole year
was then calculated, and the values smoothed by Bloxam's method.
This  process consists   in assuming the      average,   for example, of the
2nd week of January to be not the actual average                of that week,
   *
     For some years after 1886, observations were also made for the Scottish
Meteorological Society by Mr Buchanan at Oswald Road.
   t The mean temperature was assumed to be the arithmetical mean of the
maximum and minimum readings.

and so on (see Table            II.).    The values thus obtained were then
plotted.        It   may be stated      that a 53rd week had in one or two
years to be introduced by the              Registrar-General        in order to bring
his returns into approximate agreement                 with the calendar.           When
the introduction          of a  53rd week was necessary the data given in
the first weekly return for the year             in question     were not tabulated.

    The characteristic features of the mortality curve, which is toler
ably constant from year to year, are (1) a period                  of high death-rate
from about the middle of November                   to the    end of     January    ;  and
 (2) a long-continued          minimum       in   summer,       extending from the
 beginning of         July to  the end of September.             During      the   former
 period temperature          falls rapidly, with       a  considerable       increase    in
 rainfall     and humidity.         The    variability    of temperature         is   at a
 maximum,         the general atmospheric conditions being thus raw and
 inclement.         During the time        characterised     by low mortality,          air
 temperature        is high, humidity     low, and temperature          variability at     a
 minimum.           The rapid fall in the death-rate         during the four weeks
 ending    with     the middle of February is of interest, as is the general
 retardation       of any further improvement in the mortality returns
 until the end of May, thus confirming the general impression that
  the easterly      winds of spring exercise       a  prejudicial influence on the
 health    of the community.

     Infantile mortality has its primary maximum from November to
 January,      a secondary     maximum due to diarrhoea               being    a marked
 feature during the month of August.                  The minimum extends over
 the   six months ending with             July, but     is not such       a pronounced
 characteristic       of the curve as the       maximum.         The absolute mini
 mum     is reached about the end of June, the absence of zymotic and
 bronchial       affections   at the time being of interest in this con
 nection.

    This curve shows the        same     seasonal    variation as that of    deaths
from all causes, the maximum fatality being from November to
January, and the minimum from July to September. The winter
maximum is apparently associated with the prevalence of respira
tory complaints,      from the attacks of which so many old people
succumb.

    This,   as regards the maximum, is rather an irregular curve,              there
being three well-defined          periods showing        a  high death-rate, viz.,
 the end of December, the middle                 of February,    and the end       of
 March.      The climatic features of this extended period            are a   rather
 low temperature,       small    rainfall, but       high    humidity, although
 steadily diminishing.        Towards        the close    of May the mortality
 greatly diminishes, the absolute minimum occurring in August.
                          Fig.   5. — Wkooping-Cough.
     This is essentially   a  complaint       of spring and early summer, the
 mortality     curve being above        the mean from the second week of
  February     to the beginning        of   July, and below it during the re
  mainder of the year.       This    disease    also  exhibits three well-defined
  maxima, the first two of which coincide approximately                    with the
  corresponding     maxima      from     measles.      The primary      maximum,
  however, occurs about five weeks after that of measles.                    Hence,
  whooping-cough is most fatal when pressure and temperature are
  high, and humidity at the annual minimum                  conditions   intimately
  connected with the prevailing            easterly winds.     The  disease is at a
  minimum in November.            The climatic features of the months when
  the fatality from this disease is small are a low temperature, con
  siderable rainfall,    and   great humidity,        with an almost complete
  absence of winds from the east.

    The curves for the above diseases being based on only ten years'
observation,      it would       be premature to draw conclusions,            further
data being required to define              the  seasonal     variations.
                                 Fig.  9. — Diarrhoea.
    The death-rate        from diarrhoea is above the mean from June to
October,    being at      a   maximum about         the   beginning of September,
when the mortality is over 150 per cent, above the annual average.
The minimum occurs in March.
             Fig.    10. — Bronchitis, Pneumonia,           awl Pleurisy.
    The curve of these three diseases of the respiratory organs closely
follows that of deaths           from all causes, being above the mean from
 October to    April,    and below      it during    the other half of the year.
An intimate relationship exists between the mortality from respira
 tory diseases and the variability           of temperature      as deduced     by the
method      described     ;  the   more   changeable      the weather the       greater
 the mortality.        This will     be clearly seen on examining         the    curves
 of mean     temperature and           mean    variability     of temperature,      and
 comparing     them with the curve of deaths from the three diseases
 under    review.      The       most   changeable      weather,    it will  be seen,
 occurs    not    during      the cold spell at        the  beginning    of January,
 but at the end of November, when the mortality from respiratory
 diseases is at a maximum.                This  is not a local     phenomenon,      the
 greatest death-rate        from these diseases in London being observed at
 this time.      In order      to show more clearly the         prejudicial  effect   of
 changeable weather, we have examined the weekly mortality returns
 for these diseases for the ten years            1 885-94.      We    have  corrected
 the values so as to allow for increase            in population,* the returns for
 each   year being thus strictly            comparable      with  each   other.     The

       For some years prior to the taking of the census in 1891, the population
 of Edinburgh      had been over-estimated, but Dr Blair Cunynghame kindly
  sent me the corrected numbers for each year.

 result of this investigation is that, when the cumulative variability
 of temperature did not          exceed      14", the weekly number           of deaths
 amounted to only 16'5, but when the variability was above 28°                         the
 deaths numbered 22-5, an increase of 36 per cent.                     The following

    It  has   been long known            that   the    mortality    from     the    three
diseases    under reviow varies inversely as the temperature.                        This
applies to all but the lowest temperatures, as will be apparent from

typhoid,    typhus, relapsing,         cerebrospinal,      simple and ill-defined.
The mortality * from the latter            diseases is so small that the deaths
from them may be neglected.               The usual autumnal rise of typhoid
is well marked,        the maximum           fatality occurring       at   the end of
November.

    Nearly all the     cases of small-pox having occurred            during only one
epidemic, that of 1894,          it is not possible to construct           a curve     for
this  disease,  but half of the deaths recorded took             place   in December

Hence, the maximum fatality from the five zymotic diseases under
review occurs earlier in London than at Edinburgh            by from two to
nine weeks.     The minimum death-rate       also occurs earlier, except   in
the case   of measles and diarrhoea,      which are both a month later
in London     than in Edinburgh.         The most noticeable feature in
London,    as compared   with this city, is the very early date of the
lowest death-rate     from   all  causes — nine   weeks    earlier   than in
Edinburgh.      This is clearly  due   to the great   increase   in infantile
diarrhoea,   which  begins in London        about the    middle of     June  ;
whereas in Edinburgh,      deaths   from this disease do not increase in
a marked     degree until about    the  end of   July,  and are so few     in
number that the general death-rate       remains   practically unaffected.

  In addition to the authorities quoted in the first part of the paper,
memoirs by Clerk-Maxwell                        and by Lord Rayleigh                      are referred    to,

  The Author then considers the more obvious defects of the
rudely    approximate                solution       of the differential              equations which
is given in Part               I.,   especially the omission of the direct gravita
tional effect on the speed, and shows how to take account of the
effect of the observed gradual              diminution of the angular velocity

  The Author stated that                    he had occasionally succeeded                      in obtaining
the kink spoken of in Part                        I.,   the projectile        being   a    humming-top
made     of very thin metal.                       He had        also     occasionally obtained              a
cusp, thus exhibiting the paradoxical                              result of    a     projectile's path
which    is   at no point concave                  downwards.

  At this meeting                    the    Author showed the kinked path to the
Society in an             exceedingly             simple        manner    ;   the projectile          being
a very large          and       thin shell of india-rubber                     which,          contrary      to
his    expectations,             was        found         to    preserve       for    a        considerable
time     the        spin       given         to     it     by    cutting       it     sharply,       in      an
obliquely      downward               direction,         with the flat hand.                   The opera
tion    is   analogous to jerking                       in golf.     This experiment                can      be
successfully         performed              with        great    ease,    and        is    a    thoroughly
illustrative        one    for the whole subject.

            Note on Centrobaric Shells.                 By Prof. Tait.
                               (Read February 3, 1896.)
    It  is   singular   to    observe     the  comparative      ease  with which
elementary propositions           in attraction    can be proved by one of the
obvious methods, while the proof by the other is tedious.
    Thus nothing       can      be   simpler     than   Newton's     proof  that  a
uniform spherical shell exerts no gravitating                force on an internal
particle.      But, so far      as  I  know,    there is no such simple proof
(of a direct      character) that the         potential   is constant throughout
the interior.
    On the other hand the direct proof that a spherical shell, whose
 surface-density is inversely          as  the cube of the distance from an
internal point, is centrobaric            is neither short     nor simple.    (See,
 for instance, Thomson and           Taifs Elements of Natural Philosophy,
§' 491.)     But we may prove           at once    that its potential   at external
 points   is the same      as   if its   mass were condensed at the internal
 point.
     For  if  an elementary double cone,            with its vertex at S, cut out
  areas K    and E, we have

     Let P      be any external          point, and take                 T    on PS (produced)                80
that
                                    PS-ST      =   KS-SE       =   62.
     Then wc have obviously, from similar triangles,
                                        SK-EP      =    SP-KT.

elementary properties               have been            proved,         almost             intuitively, in

pressly stated.           A  finite portion of liquid, viscid or inviscid, being

 Every particle of the liquid will instantaneously commence                           moving
 with the determinate velocity and in the determinate direction,
 such     that the kinetic energy of the whole is                     less than that   of any
 other     motion       which the liquid could have with the given motion
 of its boundary.*             This proposition is true also for an incompres

we confine our attention                     to    the case of inviscid liquid.
   The now well-known                    solution* of            the    minimum          problem thus
presented, when the bounding                             surface is simply           continuous,          is,
simply    :     that       the    initial     motion        of    the    liquid is irrotational.
That     the        initial motion        irrotational t is indeed obvious,
                                            micsf bo
when      we         consider that the impulsive pressure by which any
portion        of the liquid            is set in motion                is everywhere           perpen
dicular to the interface between it and the contiguous matter
around        it,   and therefore the initial moment of momentum round
any diameter of every spherical                           portion,      large or small,         is   zero.
But that irrotationality of the motion of every spherical portion
of the liquid           suffices to determine             the motion within              a   simply con
tinuous boundary having any stated motion,                               is   not obvious without
mathematical investigation.
   Whether            the boundary           is    simply continuous, or multiply con
tinuous, irrotationality               suffices        to determine the motion produced,
as we now suppose                it   to be produced, from rest by                  a    given motion
of the boundary.
   Now in           a     homogeneous liquid acted on by no bodily force, or
only by such force (gravity,                       for example)          as could not move                it
when its boundary                 is   fixed, the motion started from rest by any
movement             of    the    boundary             remains    always irrotational,           as we
know from elementary hydrokinetics.                               Hence,      if   at any time the
boundary        is    suddenly or gradually brought                      to rest, the motion of

every particle of the liquid is brought                    to rest at the same instant.
But it        is not so       with    a  heterogeneous liquid.            Of the following
conclusions            Nos. (1), (2), (3) need no proof.                 To prove No. (4)
remark that as long as there is any motion of the heterogeneous
liquid       within the imperfectly               elastic  vessel     the   liquid must be
losing energy           ;  and the energy cannot become               infinitely small with
any finite spherical portion of the liquid homogeneous.
     (1) The initial motion of a heterogeneous liquid is irrotational
only at the first instant after being quite suddenly started from
rest by motion of its boundary.                    Whatever motion          be subsequently
given to the boundary                   the motion of the liquid is never again
irrotational             Hence
     (2)   If    the boundary be suddenly brought to rest at any time, the
liquid,       unless       homogeneous throughout,             is not      thereby brought
 to rest ; and           it would     go on for ever        with undiminished          energy
if    the   liquid were perfectly inviscid and the boundary absolutely
 fixed.         The       ultimate    condition      of the liquid,         if there is no
positive surface tension                in the interfaces between heterogeneous
portions, is an infinitely fine mixture of the heterogeneous parts.*
And,       if    there      were no gravity         or other bodily         force acting on
the     liquid, the density would ultimately                  become      uniform through
out.       Take,        for example, a corked             bottle     half full of water or
other liquid with air                above it given at rest.              Move    the   bottle
and       bring it to rest again : the liquid will remain shaking for
some time.              An ordinary non-scientific person will scarcely thank
us     for this result          of   our mathematical          theory.       But, when     we
tell him that            if air and the liquid were both perfectly fluid (that
is to say perfectly                free from       viscosity),     the   well-known     shak
ing of the           liquid surface would, after            a   little time, give rise to
spherules tossed              up from the main body of the liquid                 ; and that
the shaking             of the liquid,       left to itself in the bottle           supposed
perfectly rigid,           will end in spindrift of spherules which would be
infinitely         fine    if the capillary tension of the interface between

liquid and air were infinitely small,    he may be incredulous         unless
he tends      to have  faith in all assertions   made     in the name       of
science.
    (3)   If the boundary is an enclosing vessel     of any real material
(and therefore neither perfectly rigid nor perfectly elastic), and if it
is laid on a table and left to itself, under the influence of gravity,
the liquid, supposed perfectly inviscid,    will lose energy     continually
by generation of heat in the containing           vessel,   and   will come
asymptotically to rest in the configuration of stable equilibrium with
surfaces of equal density horizontal      and increasing density down
 wards.
    (4)   With other conditions as in (3), but no gravity, the ultimate
 configuration of rest will be infinitely fine mixture (probably, I
 think of equal density throughout).        Consider, for example, two
 homogeneous liquids of different densities filling the closed vessel,
 or  a  single homogeneous liquid not filling it.       As   an illustration,
 take   a  bottle half full of water, and shake it violently.         Observe
 how you get the whole bottle full of a mixture             of fine bubbles
 of air, nearly homogeneous throughout.          Think      what the result
 would be     if there were no gravity, and if the water and air         were
 inviscid and the bottle shaken       as gently  as  you please     ;  and  if
 there were perfect vacuum in place of the air       ; or,   if for air  were
 substituted any liquid of density different from that of water.

     The sarcastic criticism         which M. Bertrand        (Coj7ipf.es Rervlus,

 solution of the fundamental problem in the Kinetic Theory of Gases,
 together      with   Prof.   Boltzmann's      very different,    but thoroughly
 depreciatory,      remarks (ib., May 26), have led me to reconsider this
 question, already discussed by me at some length before the Society.
 Both of these        authorities    declare Maxwell's investigation         to be
 erroneous     :— but,   while Prof. Boltzmann         allows   his result to be
  correct, M. Bertrand       goes further, and     bluntly calls it absurd. He
  had, in his Calcul des     Probabilith, (1888), already given Maxwell's
  proof as an example of       illusory methods.       I have the misfortune to
  agree    with Maxwell, and to hold that his reasoning, though not by
  any means complete, is         (like his result) correct.       (Trans. R.S.E.,

 desire to retract ; but they can be considerably improved ; and 1
  think that, by the introduction              of the Diippler-     (properly   the

we suppose        the spheres to collide with one another, it would be
impossible to apply any species of finite reasoning to the ascertain
ing of their distribution at each             instant,   or the distribution        of
velocity     among those of them which               are   for the time in any
particular region of the containing vessel.                But, when the idea of
mutual collisions        is introduced,     we  liave at once, in place      of   the
hopelessly    complex     question   of  the behaviour      of innumeralde      abso
lutely    isolated    individuals,     the   comparatively      simple   statistical
question of the average          behaviour    of  the various    groups  of a   com
munity.       This distinction      is forcibly impressed even on the non-
 mathematical,       by the     extraordinary      steadiness with which          the
 numbers      of such totally       unpredictable,      though    not uncommon,
 phenomena       as suicides, twin or triple births,         dead  letters, &c, in
 any populous country, are maintained year after year.
    On those who        are acquainted     with the higher developments of
 the mathematical Theory of Probabilities the impression is still
 more forcible.        Every one, therefore, who considers the subject
 from either of these         points of view, must come to the conclusion
 that continued       collisions   among our set of elastic spheres will,
provided they are all equal, produce            a state   of things in which      the
 percentage      of the whole,     which    have, at each moment, any dis
 tinctive    property      must   (after many collisions) tend towards a
 definite    numerical      value ; from which it will never afterwards
 markedly       depart.''
    "When [the final result, in which the distribution of                  velocity-
 components is the same for all directions] is arrived at, collisions
 will not, in the long run, tend to alter it. For then the uniformity
 of distribution of the spheres in space, and the symmetry of dis
 tribution     of velocity among them, enable us (by the principle                  of
 averages)     to dispense    with the only limitation       above imposed    ;  viz.,
 the parallelism of the lines of centres in the collisions considered."

     3.     [But, before seeking this, we may take another mode of view
ing the situation               :   — as follows.           It   is,   of course, nothing more than
an    illustration of the argument just given.
     Suppose,            merely for the purpose                  of examining the condition of
the       gas,      and therefore without                    any inquiry into other physical
possibilities,            which have nothing to do with the argument —                           :
     That (a) each                   particle       of the group             is    self-luminous,    and all
give out,   with equal intensity, light of one definite period.                                             (To
 illustrate the remark just made, note that this luminosity                                           is    not
 attributed       to collisions, nor to any assigned physical causes).
     ('<)     The wave-length of light reaching the eye from           moving                   a
 wurce         is   altered by an amount proportional to the speed with which
 its distance             from the eye alters.
       (<•)   The displacement of light by                             a    grating on which         it    falls

      (J) An ideal grating                 may be assumed, of any requisite regularity
 and       fineness       ;    and, again          for the sake of argument only,               it    may be
 supposed to act,                   however fine        it       be, in       the       same manner as do
 ordinary           gratings.

    These premised, the spectrum of the gas will be a band, whose
visible   breadth depends only on the fineness            of the grating and
the luminosity       of a particle.     But this band will present, at alt
times ami   from all     sules of the group, exactly the same appearance.
    Its brightness, therefore, at any given distance from its central
line, will be constant.          But this means that the fraction of the
whole number of particles which have any given speed in the line of
sight, depends on that speed alone.          The utmost    speed  of a gaseous
particle is exceedingly small compared with that of light, and the
alteration of wave-length is not affected by the part of the motion
of the luminous particle which is transverse to the line of sight.]
    4.  We have not yet exhausted the            consequences    of absolutely
perfect (average)       community.        For  every  particle,  in virtue of
citizenship, has     a right  to, and obtains, its due quota    of whatever     is
shared among the group.             Its tenure of any   one value   of x  ceases
(usually in a most abrupt way) some             1010  times per second, but
leaves  it absolutely free to have, during      each  of these brief   periods,
any values of y and z which may fall to it.               There are, in fact,
definite specifications of x, y,       z speeds ;  but they are distributed
among the particles with absolute independence of one another, in
a manner which is perpetually changing            at an exceptionally rapid
rate.    And the entire independence of         x, y, aud z speeds is shown
by the fact that, in     a collision, there is a mere  interchange of speeds
along the line of centres at impact        : —whatever   be the speeds of the
impinging particles in other directions.
   Thus the assumption, which Maxwell allowed "might                     appear
             "
precarious      (it is carefully to be observed that he did not say it
appeared so    to himself) is fully justified.    In any element of volume
of the   space diagram of velocities, the density is proportional          to

   To any    one who is     doubtful about the accuracy, or the       cogency,
of the reasoning just sketched, we may put the matter in               another

  5.       M. Bertrand          treats the above result          of Clerk- Maxwell's to the
following          sweeping condemnation               :—
      "   Il   y aurait indulgence                               cette formule trop peu de

rigueur        :   les habitudes de la Géométrie autorisent à la déclarer tout
simplement absurde."
   Comment on this would be superfluous.
   But it is          easy      to see how M. Bertrand                has       been led into this
position.           The following          is,    according      to his         information,        the
problem as proposed, and solved, by                      Maxwell —    :
      " Les molécules d'une              masse     gazeuse, étant en nombre immense
et considéré comme               infini, sont animées        de vitesses          inconnues.        On
ne sait rien sur les conditions                   initiales et sur les actions perturba
trices qui s'exercent entre elles et sur elles.
      Déterminer          le   rapport du nombre total des molécules au nombre
des celles dont             la vitesse     est comprise entre des limites données.
On n'admet rien de plus, sinon que, par l'absence                                de toute ordon
nance régulière, tout est pareil dans toutes les directions."
      No wonder M. Bertrand says that this reminds one of the question
of finding the age of the captain from the size of his vessel                                !
      The real cause for wonder                   is   that M. Bertrand, who must be
perfectly          aware       that strong       common-sense             was    as   prominent      a
characteristic            of Maxwell's intellect            as was        brilliant, and often
daring, originality,             could believe him capable of propounding such
manifest nonsense.
      6.   What Maxwell did               propose,      and solve, was           a    very different
problem indeed.                 Here     are     his words       (Phil. May. xix. (1860),
 p.   22):-
      "Prop.        IV.      To find the         average    number of particles                  whose
 velocities lie between given limits,                    after a great number                of mi
litions among a great number                     of equal particles."
      He had already pointed out that the particles are regarded as
spherical          and perfectly         elastic; and that, though collisions                       are

 perpetually altering the velocity of each, the tendency is to some
 regular law of distribution of vis viva among the group.                 I am   far
 from asserting that his paper (which, epoch-making                 as  it  was, is
 evidently a somewhat hasty and unmatured                 effort) is free from
 even large errors  ;  but  it certainly does not contain such palpable
 absurdities as those now laid to its charge.
    M. Bertrand entirely ignores the fact that Maxwell was dealing
with a " community."           And his comment on Maxwell might
justly  be retorted on himself      in  a   slightly altered form.         For   he
asserts   that  the   s, y, z speeds      are   not independent,        which     is
virtually the equivalent of the statement that when the latitude                  of
a ship at sea has been anyhow determined, its longitude is no longer
wholly indeterminate      !
    [July  6, 1896.    Prof. Boltzmann, to whom          I sent   a proof of the

besides,  I regard Maxwell's     discovery of the Law of Distribution of
Velocity   as so important a service that,        in comparison, the trifling
mistakes which appear to me to occur in his first proof are not
worthy of consideration.       The letters which      I wrote   to M. Bertrand,
who was good enough to communicate them to the French Academy,
had thus by no means the object of expressing my concurrence in
M. Bertrand's dissentient       (ahfcUHij) judgment        of Maxwell's work
on the Velocity-distribution-law.         I  wished rather to say that M.

the one objection he was able to make had already been made by
others, who agree in all essentials with Maxwell.]

On the Structure of Adinotroeha considered in relation
       to the suggested Chordate Affinities of Phoronis.                               By
       A. T. Masterman, B.A., Lecturer and Assistant Frofessor
       of  Natural History in the University of St Andrews.
                                  (Read June 15, 1896.)
    Some     little time   ago a preliminary        note upon Phoronis was read
before the      Royal Society, and therein it was stated that                a study of
the anatomy of this group had led one to believe that its nearest
phyletic     allies were to be found in the Hemichorda,                 a   group com
prising a few species         with primitive chordate characters.
    In attempting to         class   Phoronis with       these, an important         diffi
culty presented        itself.    It has been usual to define the Chordata              as
having     three essential characters in common, either temporarily in
ontogeny        or permanently        throughout      life, i.e.,   a  dorsal nervous
system, paired gill-slits, and a notochord.
    With regard to         these    features,   there can be no doubt that the
nervous system of          Phoronis is dorsal in position, and its arrange
ment is exactly comparable             to that of Balarw<jlo$sus         ;  but, on the
other hand, there are no gill-slits              in the adult Phoronis, and the
notochord       is as certainly absent.
    In   the case of the gill-slits,        we find upon critical          examination
that they are extremely variable              in extent of number and position
in the     different Cliordata, and in one species, Rhabdopleura, they
are,   according to present knowledge,               entirely     absent.     For   these
 reasons    it is well not to insist on the presence                of gill-slits  as an
 e-Hsential   character.      "With respect to the notochord a different con
 dition prevails     — the hypoblastic origin and vacuolated character of
 this organ      mark it out from all other skeletal structures, and it
 figures   more     or less prominently        in all the Chordata.           This fact,
 and the      consideration      that Phoronis has a degenerate               sedentary
 habit, with a well-developed mesoblastic skeleton of chondroid tissue
 comparable        to that     of the Vertebrata,         replacing,    in them, the
 notochord,      taken in conjunction          with   the remarkable         anatomical
 resemblances to DalanoglosMis and Cephalodiscus, seemed to                       justify

the remark    —" I    cannot help suspecting that subsequent investiga
tions   will reveal    some    trace of an organ homologous to the noto-
chord in the Actinotrocha stage."
    A  preliminary     examination       of spirit specimens of Actinotrocha
has justified     these   suspicions in such a remarkable degree that I
here purpose giving        a  short account of the results.
    Not only     does    Actinotrocha       possess    structures which are in
dubitably     of the morphological          value of a notochord, but it also
presents other features which,            I  think, must settle the affinity of
Phoronis to      be   with the Hemichorda.            As is well known, Actino
trocha     has  a   large overhanging          pre-oral   lobe and a somewhat
elongated body.          Behind the mouth          is a double row     of  tentacles,
which form an almost complete post-oral ring.
    A  partial ring of ciliated cells follows           the edge of the pre-oral
lobe, a post-oral ciliated band takes            a  sinuous course up and down
 the tentacles, and     a  third ciliated ring surrounds the anus              at the
 posterior end of the body, usually called the peri-anal band.
    Actinotrocha is thus very little modified from             a type of larva with
 three ciliated rings, the pre-oral, the post-oral, and the peri-anal,
 which correspond,       as   will be later shown, to the three segments of
 the mesoderm.
     At the front end of       the body is a thickened        plate of ectodermal
 nervous tissue,      usually    termed the apical plate.           The   coelome    is
 divided into five pouches or cavities, one unpaired, filling up the
 cavity of the pre-oral lobe, two paired cavities lying immediately
 behind the mouth and produced into the tentacles, and two posterior
 cavities filling up the trunk.
     At about the level of the mouth ventrally,                      and stretching
 backwards      to meet      the dorsal ectoderm just in front of the apical
  plate, is a  mesentery limiting the pre-oral cavity posteriorly.
     In  the immediate neighbourhood              of tho oesophagus      this  mesen
  tery envelopes the blind end of the dorsal blood-vessel, and its
  walls   are   glandular,      thus   forming       an   organ    similar   to   that
  formed in Balanofiossjis.          I cannot, however, speak with absolute
  certainty with regard to this point, for there are other structures
  connected with the pre-oral            lobe which        require   elucidation    by
  examination      of fresh specimens.           The paired post-oral or collar
  pouches    are separated from        the trunk cavities         by paired mesen

teries running from the base       of the most posterior tentacles upwards
and    inwards to meet the oesophagus,           and by paired mesenteries
from    the   pre-oral cavity running in front            of   the  first   anterior
tentacle    inwards     and    downwards      to    the.   oesophagus      (fig.  2).
Under the       apical plate, the collar walls and the pre-oral meso-
dermic    wall do not    come in contact, but leave a haemocoele space.
   The dorsal and ventral          blood-vessels      and    the   paired    lateral
vessels are also haemocoelic spaces         between the gut-wall           and the
mesoderm of the collar and        trunk.

which consist of ciliated tubes opening to the exterior on the

the collar, that             is,   the part of the gut which                 is   surrounded by the
collar       cavities, and they protrude                       into the      collar      space,     almost
coming        into     contact            with the outer              wall   at    the    apex of the
tentacular           ring.          The        most superficial         examination          of    sections
shows         that     they         cannot        be    regarded        as   glandular,        but     that
the constituent               cells        have been       metamorphosed              into vacuolated
tissue.*         The          process          of vacuolisation          proceeds from             without

part of the wall lying on the                            inside, which            had    a   number         of

not found.         The    coeca   remain in continuity with the wall of the
gut, and retain their lumen.
   An inspection of         fig. 4   will show the     close   resemblance of these
coeca   to the typical notochordal                tissue of the Chordata.          They
evidently lend support to the anterior region of the tentacular ring,
and being thus sustentative organs, developed in response                         to the
stimuli    from outside themselves, the direction of the vacuolising
process corresponds to that which would be expected on theoretical
grounds.
    I think    there can be no reasonable doubt that these two hypo-
blastic vacuolated diverticula             have the morphological            value of a
notochord.
    Their origin in the collar region corresponds to that in Balano-
glotsus, the only hemichordate form the development of which is
known, and the fact that they are paired and lateral                         instead of
medium and dorsal need not be a serious impediment                          to the com
parison     here     instituted       the difference between " paired
                                                                                  " and

unpaired is obviously one of degree rather than of kind in bilater
ally symmetrical           animals.       On    theoretical     grounds     one would
expect a skeletal organ arising            in the collar region to       be paired.
    It may      be   well not to      press   the immediate homology too far,
especially     as it is     questionable       if the    precise    homology of the
notochord in such forms as Balanof/lossue, Tunicata, Amphioxun,
and    Verttbrata       can be       maintained.       It   would   be preferable       to
make     a  general definition         of the notochordal         feature, thus     : —A
skeletal    structure      formed      by the vacuolisation        of certain of the
hypoblastic cells in definite areas determined by the special need
in each group         (in head,      collar, or tail) which        may (Vertebrata)
or may not (Hemichorda,
                                      PJioronis) be separated completely from
the gut wall, and may (higher Vertebrata, Pkoronis) or may not
(Hemichorda, Cephalochorda) be completely replaced in the adult
by a   mesoblastic chondroid skeleton.
    The    condition       of   the    notochordal      tissue   in   Actinotroclia     is
probably     the most primitive            yet    described, for two        reasons    in
particular   ;    firstly,    because     the    diverticulum      still   remains     in
 organic   continuity with the rest of the hypoblast, and its lumen
 in continuity     with that of the gut ; and secondly, because a certain
 area  of the ventral wall of the gut just opposite the heavy sac

like diverticulum,      which is invaginated from the body wall, and
later evaginated to form the greater part of the body of the adult
Phoronis, is strengthened by a vacuolisation of certain of the hypo
blast cells, which present a structure identical with that of the paired
notochord in the collar region, but do not form           a  diverticulum.
   They thus       present the most primitive form             of    hypoblastic
skeleton, the cells being metamorphosed in situ.                 The      areas     of
notochordal     tissue in Actinotroclia     present    a much more diffuse
and    de facto    primitive condition      than    is found      in the other
 Chordata.      Their subsequent fate is unknown,                but     they are
certainly not present in the adult.*
   In   the former paper was instituted         a comparison       between the
structure of Balanoglossus         and Phoronis,   the   points of similarity
being    well marked,      provided     due  allowance      be  made for the
different    environment     of   these   two   animals     and    its   effect    in
each case upon their anatomy.
   As is to    be expected, a comparison         between the larval forms
Actinotroclia and Tornaria reveals even closer harmony of structure ;
the resemblances between these two forms point to an extremely
close affinity between them.          It must be sufficient here to enumer
ate the leading characters      in common    : —
       A  large overhanging pre-oral lobe.
       An apical plate, with, in     some cases, two eyespots.
       A  pre-oral ciliated ring.
       A post-oral ring, complicated (in      some   Tornaria) by tentacular
          protrusions of the body.
       A peri-anal ring of cilia.
       Gut with    oesophagus,    stomach, hind gut, and terminal anus.
       Mesoderm      forming    five ccelomic    pouches,     one pre-oral and
          two pairs post-oral.
       Dorsal and ventral blood-vessels derived from the               hsemocoelic
          space, connected by a collar-ring.
    The only important       character in Tornaria        which,     as   far   as is
 known, has no homologue in Actinotroclia          is the proboscis pore.

is-95-96.]   Mr Masterman            on the Structure      of Actinotrocha. 135
Phoronis and       of its larval form, Actinotrocha, clearly points             to the
following : —
    Firstly, this genus is closely allied to the members of the Heini-
chordata, and Batanoglossus in particular.
    Secondly, the present structure of Phoronis                 points to  a  marked
degeneration,      due to the assumption of a sedentary life, the degree
of highest organisation           being reached     in Actinotrocha, just before
the metamorphosis which results              in  the transformation to the adult
condition.
    Thirdly,     the structure of Actinotrocha            conforms to the        henii-
chordate type extremely closely, even to minute particulars.
    The evolutionary        processes     here indicated have an exact parallel
in the relationship of the Urochorda (or Tunicata) to the Cephalo-
chorda.       In a precisely similar manner the tailed Urochorda larva
reaches     a   certain maximum of structural              complexity     not  far re
 moved,    if perhaps     a  little  above, that of the adult Amphioxiis,           and
 then degenerates to the adult Ascidian,               with   a similar loss of pre-
 oral nervous system, sense organs, and notochorj.
    Perhaps the main dili'erence in the two processes is this, that the
 larval  Ascidian      becomes fixed by the         pre-oral lobe, as also in, for
example,       the Echinodennata         ; whereas the Actinotrocha           becomes
 lixed by     that   organ which       is probably homologous with           the bud
 ding stolon of Cephalodiscus, and the permanently attaching                       cord
 of Ithabdaplcura.          This ontogenetic dillorence          is also probably of
 phylogenetic value, and would largely explain the differing types
 of metamorphosis.
    In conclusion,       I  would suggest       that these relationships justify
 the  classification of Phoronis as         a separate   division of the Chordata,
 which     may be termed         the   Diplochorda,     so that the Chordata, as
 thus constituted, would be as           follows: —

    It  has of late become the custom, especially since the appearance
of Professor Spengel's       monograph on Balanoglomus and by certain
German writers, to question the claims of this genus to vertebrate
affinities.    I would therefore point out that its close relationship
to   Phoronis,     advocated   in  this and     a  former    paper,  is   quite
independent of the validity of these claims, though of course                the
right to consider Phoronis in any way connected with the vertobratr
tree stands or falls with that of Balanor/lossm.

                                     (Read   April   6, 1896.)
     A preliminary demonstration                  on photography             and   fluorescence
was given.            A description      accompanies       the report on the communi
cation made           on 4th May 1896.
     When Professor            Rontgen's results were first made                    known the
greatest attention            was paid      to the      photography of objects which
had       previously        been    considered       beyond         the    range    of   human
vision.       It    is clear,    however, that the discoverer did more                      than
present us        with    a   new photography by             a   force differing, in many
respects,      from day or artificial            light.       In his first       paragraph      he
describes        fluorescence       on    a  prepared       screen,       and in the second
he shows         how one may           see shadows       of the bones within             a  faint
dark      shadow        of    the   hand     itself.      The       obvious     advantage        of
 being      able     to throw      shadows       of the       deep-seated        structures of
 the     body     upon      screens     cannot      be    over-estimated          for   medical
 and     surgical purposes.            The    following       experiments were            under
 taken     with      a view of contributing            something to the work in this
 direction.
      With regard          to   the salts     employed,          screens      were     prepared
 of    potassium-platino-cyanide, barium-platino-cyanide, lithium-rubi-
  iliuni-platino-cyanide,          calcium     tungstate        in    its   crystalline     form
  (Edison),     sulphide of calcium, magnesite,                    fluorspar,    &c.      In   my
  experience       it  may be said at once that the                 potassium     and barium-
  platino-cyanide         salts   were     found      to  be      the    best,   although      the
   lithium-nibidium-platino-cyanide                gave an excellent            picture.      The
   fluorescence       of the potassium         salt is probably in advance                 of   all
   others, but occasionally one seems to get at least a more pleasant
   picture of the deep-seated           structures of the body with the barium
   screen,   particularly when the latter has              a  thick coating.
       My earliest attempts           failed on account            of too little salt being
    used   on  the screen.        In order      to get a good             sharp   image,     it  is

138           Proceedings      of Royal Society of Edinburgh.                         [i
essential that a thick coating should be spread upon the material
forming the screen.          This probably indicates that the phenomenon
is not a surface        one,   but    that    the   rays    pass    deeply       into    the
salt.    In my experience, however, it is better not to crush the
crystals too much,          although      a   certain   amount of fine division
must take place before           it   can    be   properly     and evenly attached
to the surface.
    The salts may          be   placed     on    paper,    probably        black      being
better than ordinary paper          ;  or again, on muslin            screens,     or    thin
wood or vulcanite.           For practical purposes             I   find     paper more
convenient.
    To obtain the best results, the Crooke's tube should                      be enclosed
in black      paper or cloth, so as to do away with                       the    effect     of
the ordinary       light in the tube.          Moreover,      the room         should be
thoroughly       dark,    and   the spark       of the interrupter            of the coil
should also be covered.
    With regard to the          use   of the    screen    in   a  dark room, it may
 be here pointed        out that some confusion            exists, in the popular
 mind at least,       owing to the description          of Salvioni's cryptoscope.
 It  need hardly       be pointed      out    here that      Rdntgen         himself      not
 only photographed the shadows, but proved that images of deep-
 seated    structures      could   be    obtained      by   means        of    fluorescent
 screens.      All   that Salvioni has done is to arrange a small box
 so   as  to do away with           the     dark    chamber,       but     it is not        as
 efficient.     Salvioni himself admits, in his original                 paper,    that he
 has done nothing          which could not         be deduced from the original
 experiments.
    The    screens     may be prepared in different               ways, but         I    have
 found    the    following the best :— A quantity of barium-platino-
 cyanide is rubbed in a mortar until it forms a fine powder,
 and is then mixed with a solution                  of mucilage until a thickish
 yellow fluid is obtained of a consistency capable of being poured
 upon the paper, much as one would                    pour on collodion after the
 old wet plate photographic             process.      This when allowed to                dry
 slowly     gives    satisfactory results.        Another way is to stretch                  a
 piece of paper on a wooden frame, next                      to   paint     it over      with
 a solution     of gum, and through              a  metal     sieve to dust on             the
 powdered crystals of the salt to be employed.                    The coating        should

increased   by moistening the surface at the time of using.        By
means    of these  screens I have been able to see shadows of the
bones    of the extremities   with their joints, the spinal column,
ribs,  sternum, clavicle, and face.     The parts of the body which
have offered the greatest resistance to the rays, and given the least
satisfactory results in definition,  are the cranium and pelvis.   In
these two cases the rays easily penetrated the parts, but definition
was not quite satisfactory.

           Additional Notes on the Rbntgen X-Rays.
                    By    Dr John Macintyre,              Glasgow.
                                  (Read May 4, 1896.)
    The first series of photographs thrown on the screen included
the different parts          of the    human skeleton.           The   second series
illustrated photographs of the soft tissues,                 such   as   the    tongue,
larynx, heart,       and    diaphragm, all from the living subject.                  The
third series were taken with               a  view to reduction of the time in
exposure.        With    the fourth is given a description of some experi
ments upon attempts           to polarise    the x-rays.
     The apparatus now most commonly employed                    wras used     in   these
experiments,       viz., electricity      (from the main), an induction coil
giving a range of from            2  to 10 inch spark as required, a Crooke's
tube    having      an aluminium        cathodal disc, and        a  small plate of
platinum for the           positive pole.        It is now known        as   the focus
tube.      Paget xxxxx-plates were used,              as  no particular advantage
 had    been     obtained from those          specially prepared.        The follow
 ing points, amongst           others,    were    found to be of great           service
 in obtaining the best results :— Firstly, the current passing to                     the
 coil should be regulated          according to the work to be done, and                as
 little variation     as possible    should take place during the             exposure.
 Primary      batteries    are not as satisfactory on account            of this,     and
 the best source       is from the main.           Lord Kelvin's cell       tester and
 ampere      gauge were       used   in the experiments,        and any      variations
 in the current were regulated             by means of      a rheostat.      Secondly,
 the Apps or other coil or transformer must give, with                    the    present
 form     of    tube,    six   inches    or   even    more    of   spark    when       the
 deeper     tissues    of the body, such         as  the spine,    are being taken.
 Thirdly,     the vacuum of the tube should be carefully regulated and
  tested   to give the maximum results.                In the  best tubes      this   was
 done before      taking them        off the pump, and the most satisfactory
 test was the fluorescent         screen.      During    the exposure     the vacuum
 changes from time to time.              This   is indicated by an alteration            of

the fluorescence        of the bulb by sparking outside of the tube across
the    terminals, and by different sounds produced                      by the interrupter.
By gently heating with                 the    spirit-lamp         or Bunsen              burner this
difficulty     disappears        at once,     and    so   a     fairly constant               source      of
s-rays    may       be maintained for a long period.
   In taking photographs of                the deeper structures of the body, the
following       points are worthy of attention           Firstly, penetration ;
secondly,      definition   ;    thirdly, the photography of structures in the
body which          may have       other     structures placed          in front or behind
them, but which we do not desire to photograph                              :    in other words,
the selection of any particular structure within                        the body, and the
omission      of others.        With    regard      to penetration, all the tissues of
the body absorb the rays in a greater                     or less extent.                 While          the
bones absorb more than others, and therefore give the most striking
pictures of the shadows,              the soft tissues            also absorb           some of the
 rays, and by a careful arrangement                   these may be made                       to appear
 on a photographic plate              or fluorescent       screen.          The mere penetra
 tion of tissue is not a difficult matter.                 With        the apparatus               above
 described, and a current giving 12 volts 17 amperes, and a selected
 Crooke's tube, the rays were found capable of penetrating a door                                              4
 inches      thick,    and coated       with lead         colour on each side, and in
 sufficient     quantity,       after passing       through the air for                   1 1    feet,     to
 cause    fluorescence on a screen in the next room.                              Again, the rays
 are     sufficiently powerful to pass through two human                                      bodies,      or
 through       18   inches thick of pine wood; and the spine,                                   ribs, and
 other deeper structures of the body may easily be shown on fluores
 cent screens.         The rays may be generated                    in such force as to pass
 through these bones, giving such slight contrast between them                                           and
 the spaces around that the former disappear,                         and the whole                screen
 becomes        one    fluorescent      mass.        It    is     obvious,            therefore,        that
 definition     is of great importance.               While it         is true           we have          no
 method at present              of focusing in the ordinary sense, that is no
 evidence of refraction nor true reflection,                      yet correct definition may
 be    obtained in the following manner               : — If       a piece      of white paper             be
 laid on a table,          and    a   pencil held at          a    short distance from                   it,   a
 shadow       of the pencil will be got on the paper.                             The nearer the
 pencil   is   to the paper the sharper the image                    will       be.      If   the pencil
 be    now removed from the paper towards the source of light, the

    142         Proceedings of Royal Society               of Edinburgh.
   shadow will become less distinct, but              if   the    pencil be held in that
   position, and the source of light removed                     still further from       the
    pencil, the shadow becomes               again   distinct.        So it is with the
   x-rays, and we can formulate a rule that there is a definite relation
   ship between the position of the source of light, the object to be
   photographed, and the screen or sensitive plate upon which                             the
   shadow is to be thrown.            The further        the    distance of the object
   to be photographed from the               sensitive plate, the greater must              be
  the   distance between        the     object and the source             of x-rays.        In
  attempting, therefore,        to photograph the             deeper structures of the
  body or the tissues of the neck, it is evident we cannot get the object
  close to the sensitive plate, so the Crooke's tube must be removed                         a
  distance    from it.     No doubt this          increases      the   time of exposure,
  but   that will     shortly    be     overcome      with      further    improvements
  in the    tubes.     Where       it  is   possible   it is useful       to test the      re
  sult first on    a  fluorescent screen before             photographing, just as           a
  photographer       would    focus       on  a   piece     of    ground     glass     before
  exposing.
     The third point, viz.        :   How     arc we      to    photograph        particular
  objects   and   omit others that may           be  lying in their vicinity         ?   We
  can photograph straight           through the human skull and omit one
 side of the head in the         picture, and photograph the other although
 both are in the course of the x-rays,                 and      between     them and the
 sensitive plate.       This   is one of the         many advantages of the tube
 above described.        In this particular        apparatus       the cathodal torrent
 is led to the aluminium disc at one end of the tube, and is focussed
 on a small square        of platinum         directly in its course.          The x-rays
 spring from this point, and radiate in every direction                        ;   in other
 words,    form    a  cone,   the     apex    being at the platinum              plate.    It
 naturally follows that if the x-rays be not proceeding on parallel
 lines,   but diverging     from      a   point, an object placed           very near to
the source of the x-rays           will   cast an indistinct        image on the sensi
tive plate, but the structures which are near the plate                             will  be
distinctly     brought out.         Of    course,   were      the   bones of the        head
capable     of arresting all the        x-rays,    nothing would be got, but it
is only     a  matter of absorption in degree               ;  so that, when we are
photographing through the skull, sufficient rays pass through the
one side to photograph the bone                 on the      other, but the image on

that side       next     the tube is so diffuse that it never                    appears   on
the     plate.     By this      means     one can select        different bones of the
body, and so we can photograph the mastoid cells, or even                               show
the meningeal grooves or sutures on the inside of the parietal and
occipital bones themselves.
     By carefully        observing the above rules, and                 using an efficient
apparatus, many of the soft tissues may easily be obtained.                           I have
 thus been        able     to   photograph       fascia?, muscle,       cartilage    as  well
 as    bone, and        on    the   screen    you will       see    photographs       of the
 larynx through the side               of the      neck,   showing also the tongue,
 byoid bone, cartilage            of the organ        ; and in another picture the
 heart, showing the relationship               to the ribs, the diaphragm below,
  and even a faint indication of the great vessels in the neck above.
      The time of exposure          varied.      In  the earliest experiments expo
  sures of   half an hour were required, but now many such photographs
  can be token       in   the fraction of a second.            Having noticed that the
  fluorescence      of the tube was very much greater with                         a mercury
  interrupter      than with the ordinary platinum spring,                        a series  of
  experiments        were      carried out to        determine the cause.             It   was
  noticed that although the current across the terminals, before                         pass
  ing to the coil, should reach               as   high   as   17   amperes, during        the
   action   of the interrupter        it fell  to  1 ampere.        On the other hand,
   with the mercury interrupter,                and   the   same      current during the
   exposure,    it  reached as high as 7 amperes.                It  was clear, therefore,
   that a    current      was    passing     through      the primary           coil by this
   arrangement which would mean                  more powerfully induced currents
   in the secondary        coil, and consequently greater effect in the vacuum
   tube.      By this system         one could measure            the    exposure,    not by
   seconds,    but by the number of flashes in the tube corresponding to
   each   interruption in the coil.           With    one Hash, the current register
   ing 10   volts and 10 amperes, and the coil giving 6-inch spark, it is
   possible   with    a  Paget xxxxx-plate to get           a  photograph of the bones
   of the hand, and 10 such Hashes              give an excellent negative, showing
   the intimate       structures.        What the actual time                represented     in
   these    exposures       may    be   it is impossible        to   say   ;  it  must bo an
    unknown      fraction of      a second.        In any    case,   it  is safe to say that
    the photograph         is taken instantaneously.

                  Attempt to Polarise the Rontgex Rays.
      Different    views       have been           expressed about the possibility of
polarising        the x-rays by means of tourmalines                            ;    and although the
following experiments                seem     to indicate             a   negative result,           I    take
the liberty of placing them on record.
      Apparatus        employed.      — The source of electricity                      was     the main,
and the measurements across                       the terminals,            with Lord Kelvin's
cell tester and ampere               gauge, were 10 volts and 10 amperes.                                  The
spark of the coil was            6   inches, and          a    mercury interrupter was used.
An ordinary Crooke's focus                  tube, enclosed             in cardboard to exclude
all light, was excited by the                          above,       and the vacuum carefully
arranged to give the                 maximum             fluorescence by              gently        heating
the bulb with a spirit-lamp.                       Screens of barium-platino-cyanide,
potassium-platino-cyanide,                  and         lithium-rubidium-platino-cyanide
were tried.            The two tourmalines                    were got          as    nearly    alike           as
possible;        the   measurements               of    each         were : — length,          47        mm.     ;
breadth, 12 mm.           ;   thickness,      2   mm.
      First    Observation.     — On placing                  one    tourmaline          between               the
source of the x-rays and the screen, and directly in contact with
the latter, a distinct            shadow was seen, due to absorption                                of the
rays.         On placing the         second       tourmaline          parallel with the first,                   a
difference in density                of the shadow was immediately                             observed.
When the tourmalines were gradually turned                                 at   right angles to each
other, a dark square area could be seen where the two crossed.                                                  A
source                                    in this experiment.
              of error was, however, suggested                 One
of the tourmalines could not be in as close contact with the screen
as the other, and, on account of the manner in which the x-rays
pass from a point on the platinum                         plate in such a Crooke's tube,
differences were observed in the shadows of the four arms of the
cross formed by the tourmalines.    (1) For example, if the horizon
tal tourmaline were next to the screen, and the vertical one behind
it,   the two arms above and below the square dark central area were

crossed we got a darker       shadow still, it might only be due to the
difference   in thickness of the two layers.
    Second Observation.    — One of the tourmalines was broken in two
portions, and one of these was        placed parallel with, and the other
perpendicular to, the other tourmaline.            Again,   the dark square
area was seen    by direct vision.     I could  not say, however, that the
density was     greater than where the other portion of the broken
tourmaline was lying parallel         with the whole      one.    This rather
suggested that the square dark          area   was  caused   by difference of
density only.
    Third   Observations.   —These    were made      by photographs      taken
with different exposures.        One with a single flash of the tube, due
to one    interruption     of the  coil; others    were  taken    with much
longer exposures,     and in all the same difficulties in distinguishing
 between    the two conditions       arose.    In the first photograph        a
 shadow of one tourmaline       is seen, proving the absorption of some of
 the x-rays.    In  the second, of one whole tourmaline, and a portion
 of the other, a greater density     is to  be noted where     two layers are
 lying  parallel   with   each  other than where only         one   tourmaline
 interferes  with the   rays.    The third photograph shows the whole
 tourmaline    covered at one part by a portion of the broken tourma
 line lying parallel  with its axis.     The other broken tourmaline is
 placed at  right  angles,   and the question arises whether       the density
 of the square    area is greater than where the two tourmalines            are
 lying parallel with each       other.     The photographs bear out the
 observations    by direct vision, and would       appear   to give negative
 results.

On the Relation between the Hall Effect and Thermo
       electricity in Bismuth and in various Alloys. By Dr
       J. C. Beattie.
                                 (Read  July   6, 1896.)
   I   have,   in  a previous       communication*         to the Society,     given
results for    a number of alloys      ; these     I propose  to discuss from the
point of view suggested            by the title of this paper       ;  I shall    also
discuss the results published          by other experimenters, which relate
chiefly to the behaviour          of the     Hall   effect  by constant field and
variable temperature.
   In   attempting      to explain      the transverse effect,       we have two
things     to consider.     (1) The direction, and (2) the magnitude.
In  the following table the metals are arranged in a thermo-electric
series   as given by Wiedemann             ; t and in the     second    column the
direction and magnitude of the transverse effect in terms of the
rotatory coefficient R, according to Ettingshausen                \   and Nernst's
results, are given.

The two irregularities,                 so far as direction is concerned, are cobalt
and lead.
   In considering                the        magnitude          of    the       Hall        effect,    we must
remember          that different                specimens have been                    used       for thermo
electric and           for transverse            effect    purposes        ;    that slight changes in
structure and           in composition have                a     great influence on the thermo
electric position           of   a metal          ;   and that probably                    the quantitative
differences        in the transverse                  effect     in different specimens of the
same      metal are largely due to difference of structure and to the
presence of foreign matter.            Thus the irregularities in the second
column       in   those     metals which have a small transverse effect need
not surprise us.            The three metals in which                            the effect is greatest
are    bismuth, where the greatest negative effect is found, antimony,
and tellurium ; in               the latter            two the effect is positive,                       and in
tellurium it is extremely great.                               Bismuth is             at    one      end of the
thermo-electric           series, antimony and                   tellurium at the other.
      "We see     that metals with an extreme position thermo-electrically
have a correspondingly                      extreme position as regards the transverse
 effect       Without at present trying to explain                                         what       the   exact
 relation between these                     two effects        is,   let us consider how we can
 experimentally test whether or not the above general conclusion                                                is
justified in other cases.
      To do this we must examine other                                conductors, whose thermo
 electric positions are at the extreme end                             of the          series.        Reference
 to   a   number of such, alloys and various minerals,                                     will      be found   in
 the   chapter on thermo-electricity in Wiedemann's Lehre von der Elec-
 tricitat.        In    the paper before referred to, the experimental arrange
 ments and results               with       a   number of alloys               will   be found.          For the
 present purpose            it   is   sufficient to give the table in which the results
 for the whole are gathered together.

   The      plates are numbered as            in the previous communication.
   In the      second column the alloys and their composition by weight
are given.
   In the third the signs of the transverse                   effect    in the component
metals are given.
   In the fourth the values of R, calculated from the transverse
effect observed for a given field strength, are found.
   In the fifth          are given the values of            R   on the assumption that
the transverse effect in the alloy can be calculated from the values
in  the component metals.                 The values for bismuth               and antimony
are taken from the results given                      in the table    ;   for cadmium         and
zinc the values given by Ettingshausen                       and Nernst,         given in the
previous table, were used.
   This last assumption            has no application,       it will    be seen.       In Plates
I,   II., III., VIII., IX., X., XL, XII., XLTL,                     the actual values of

results given in the          above     table are all for the same field strength                  :
it is well known,               however,       that     the  value of        R for bismuth
decreases as the field increases                 :   this was found          to   be    the   case
also    with the bismuth-antimony                   and bismuth-lead           alloys    : in the
others only         a small decrease was observed between fields 5000 and
11,000; after that           R is constant.           Thus, for antimony           and Plates

VIII., IX., X., XL, XII., XII.,                           the   R given in column               4    may
be    taken as holding             for all field strengths, for bismuth and the
other alloys this is not the case,                   E    given can only be used for the
field given, for the other fields its value is quite different, being
larger for weak fields, smaller for strong ones                       ;   and in the bismuth-
lead alloys        it   has a different sign even,                 according       as     the field is
weak or strong.            Taking all          these things into consideration,                 it still
remains true that the rotatory coefficient of an alloy cannot be
calculated from those of its component metals.
      On the other hand,            a glance     at column 4 shows us that a con
ductor, with an extreme thermo-electric position, has                               a large         trans
verse effect.           So far    as the   direction of the effect is concerned,                      we
have here no exceptions.                    Thus, in Plates          XII., XII         I.,   instead of
a    negative effect due to the presence of bismuth, we have, in both
cases,    large positive effects comparable                      in magnitude with that of
pure bismuth.             With     regard      to the magnitude, the thermo-electric
position     of the Plates          I.,    II., III.       explain why       it   is     we have in
them such      a    large negative         effect.        At    the other end       of the series
beyond      antimony, we have, in Plates                        IX., X., XL, XII., XIIL,
positive    effects greater than in antimony, and in numerical value of
the same order of magnitude as in bismuth.
      Here, however, there are irregularities.                       In Plates VI II., IX.,
X. the effect       is    smaller than we might expect, and in                           XIV.       it   is
larger.
      Leduc has also observed that the transverse                          effect in an alloy of
equal     parts of bismuth and lead                  is   less than in silver.               The posi
tion   of this alloy in the thermo-electric scries                    is   next silver.
      Hall also has observed that in alloys of                        copper       and zinc the
transverse      effect     is    nearer    that of copper than the composition of
the    alloy would lead us to expect.                     The thermo-electric position of
these     alloys   is    also nearer copper than the composition would                               lead
us to    expect.
      To determine in which direction experimental effort should next
 be    directed     for the        purpose       of examining             whether        a    relation
between thermo-electricity and the transverse                         effect exists, we must
remember that the latter              is   a   function of the magnetisation and of
the temperature.            So far we have considered only                       eases    where the
temperature        was     approximately             constant and          the    field variable         ;

that      is,   we have the transverse effect as function of the magnetisa
tion    alone.        We must also consider the                case where the field   is   kept
constant and the temperature                 is   varied   :    we then get the transverse
effect      as   a    function      of the temperature, and we can compare                     it
with the thermo-electric force of the couple formed by the                                 con
ductor considered with lead when one junction                           is   kept at a con
stant       temperature, say zero centigrade, and the other                         is   given
successively the same temperatures as those at which the transverse
effect by constant field was observed.
     In   the paramagnetic metals, iron, nickel, cobalt, the magnetisation
is   also   a    function of the temperature          ;    this would have to       be taken
into consideration in experiments with these metals                          ;   in them    the
curve giving the variation                  of transverse effect with temperature
would combine the peculiarities                    of the curves giviug the variation
of the magnetisation and of the thermo-electric                           force with tem
perature.
     The only direct experiments                  made     to determine whether or not
a   relation exists between the two effects are by Ettingshausen.                              He
did not succeed                in establishing     any direct relation.          This was      to
be expected,              since,   in the material he used, the transverse            effect   is
really made up of two effects.
     Perhaps the best metal in which to compare the two effects                                is
bismuth.              We have results for different specimens of this                    metal.
Lebret* has examined the transverse                      effect at constant field strength,
through          a   long range of temperature, in practically pure bismuth.
Dewar and Fleming                  t   have examined the thermo-electric force of
bismuth-lead couples, in which one junction was kept at 0° C. and
the other given temperatures from 180° C. to 100° C.
     In the following              tables the results for two specimens of bismuth,
from the papers                quoted above, are given.             The transverse       results
are relative          ;   the thermo-electric absolute.

   The numbers given for                    Hall     effect     are expressed              in terms of the
effect   for the plate considered at 21° C.
   The general features of the two pairs of curves are almost exactly
similar.       In       Lebret's plate      I.,    there   is  a   maximum at about                - 74° C,
and in his second plate                   a      maximum           at about          - 20°    C.       On the
other hand,             in Dewar and Fleming's two specimens of commercial
bismuth the curve of thermo-electric                             force has for plate               1   a   maxi

and 242'5°        G,     there is a slight deviation                    from the parabolic form
of the curve.
      In Plate     I.,   the values       of a and         b   are 0-012G           and       -0-000034

      The fact that         E    can be represented            by such        a   temperature       curve
 suggests another way of expressing                        the results.            For, consider the

transverse Peltier effect proportional to the transverse power multi
plied by the absolute temperature, and (2) the transverse Thomson
effect proportional to the absolute temperature.
   Leduc has also expressed the electromotive            force of the trans
verse    effect  as  a  parabolic   function   of the temperature.            He
obtained the maximum value at 48-7° C.
   Hall   has examined     the variation    of transverse effect with       tem
perature by constant external field in several substances, chiefly,
however, in the magnetic metals.
   In  them, as before stated, the effect must necessarily be a very
complex affair ; with nickel      Hall has found that the curve           repre
senting the transverse effect at various temperatures bears a              great
resemblance to the corresponding magnetisation temperature curve.
The   effect   of thermo-electricity,  if it exists in this metal, is       com
pletely masked at the temperatures            Hall  has    experimented at;
what results would be given at lower temperatures, such as                 those
used   by Dewar       and Fleming in their experiments            on thermo
electricity, must be settled by new experiments.             At any     rate, it
suggests a method for the consideration         of the magnetic     properties
of the paramagnetic bodies at low temperatures.
    There are other substances which give better hopes of definite
results than the paramagnetic metals.             A  glance at the curves
published with Dewar and Fleming's            above-cited article   will   show
what these are.        Antimony, for instance, has     a very characteristic
curve ; the tangent to its         thermo-electric   force curve      is twice
parallel to the line of lead.
    Palladium and platinum have also very distinctly marked               maxi
mum values.
    Evidently much more experimental data is           necessary    before    we
can say quite generally that the transverse effect is a function of the
thermo-electric force    ; when we have these we may, perhaps, profit
ably study the exact relation between the molecular motion of heat
and that of magnetism.        At present we     are only  justified in   saying
that in bismuth and in alloys there is a very close connection between
the thermo-electric properties and the transverse effect.             Probably

I. Action of Sodium Mercaptidk on Dibromosuccinic Ether.
    Sodium mercaptide        and dibromosuccinic ether, in the proportion
of two molecules      of the former to one of the latter, were            dissolved
separately   in absolute alcohol, and slowly mixed.                A  considerable
evolution of heat took place, while sodium bromide separated                     out.
The flask was then digested           for some hours on the            steam-bath.
The    alcohol was subsequently distilled            off, and   the    residue,    on
cooling, was      treated    with   water.     An oil     separated     out.    This
oil  was    collected    by means      of   a    separating funnel,        and    the
aqueous    layer several      times   extracted with       ether.     The oil     and
the    ethereal     extracts    were    added     together     and     dried     over
calcium chloride.       Next morning       the ether was      distilled off   at the
ordinary pressure.        The    remainder was distilled          in vacuo.       Be
tween 50° and 60°         a  few drops came over, which proved                 to be
ethyldisulphide.
    The remainder came over between             150° and 170°.
    This latter fraction      was redistilled,     and a portion of it           used
for analysis.      The boiling point at 20 mm. pressure was              1603.

     Dietthiosuccinic      ether was boiled with the quantity of baryta
 required for barium dietthiosuccinate.           When      the  solution became
 neutral, only about half of the ether was saponified.           More baryta was
 added, and the solution was boiled          till all the ether was saponified.
 Carbonic acid was passed through the cooled                solution in order to
 convert      the excess of baryta into         barium     carbonate.      The gas
 evolved during the        passage of the carbonic acid        through the solu
  tion, was passed through a solution of mercuric chloride, when the
  white compound of mercuric chloride and mercaptan                   was formed.
      The filtrate from the barium carbonate           contained     a very soluble
  barium      salt,  which   did not crystallise on evaporation.            It  was,
  however,      insoluble in alcohol.    On adding alcohol to the aqueous
  solution,    the barium salt was precipitated          as a white     amorphous
  substance.

cooling, long         needles appeared in the          tube.     When        opened,      a

   On the Linear and Vector Function.                           By Prof.    Tait.
                           (Read May 18 and June 1, 1896.)
                                       {Abstract.)
    In  the following Abstract            I  refer to such Linear       and Vector
Functions,       only, as correspond to homogeneous strains which a
piece   of actual matter can            undergo.       There  is no difficulty   : —
though caution is often called for             : —in   extending the propositions
to cases which are not realizable in physics.
    The inquiry      arose from a desire to ascertain the exact nature             of
the strain when, though            it is not pure, the roots of its cubic are
all real : — i.e. when       three lines    of particles, not originally at right
angles to one another, are          left by it unchanged in direction.
    1. The    sum,     and the product (or the quotient), of two linear
and vector functions are also linear and vector functions.                     But,
while the sum is always self -conjugate if the                 separate   functions
are so (or      if they    be conjugate      to one another),      the product (or
quotient) is in general not self-conjugate : — though the determining
cubic has, in this case, real roots.             The proof  can be given   in many
simple forms.
    If sr and    (o represent any two pure strains, there are three real
values of g, each with its corresponding value of               p,  such that
                                   iSp = gmp,                                    (1)
    Assume     a>'p =  a  ; and the equation becomes
                                                  .....
    But   <i)"Jtsr(o"'   is obviously       self-conjugate.     Hence    the  three
values of g are real, and the vectors              <r form a rectangular system.
Thus (1) is satisfied by three expressions of the form
                     p = a)"'o- = (7'flf~*<T;                                   (2).
i.e. there is one       rectangular set of vectors which have their direc
tions altered in the same way by the square roots of the inverses of
each of the given strains.

    But (1) may              be written          in     the form
                                                 <ol*Tp = gp,
where                   is in general not a self-conjugate function.                                        Thus
    Two pure strains in                    succession                  give a strain which is generally
rotational, but whose cubic has three real roots.
    Conversely, when a strain is such as to leave unchanged three
directions in a body,                 it    may be regarded                            as     the resultant of two
successive            pure strains.
    These are to be found from (2), in which the values of g and                                                          p
are now regarded               as given, so that the                               problem is reduced to find

     A somewhat similar                 process shows that the roots of

     It   is easy to see that this statement may be put in the form :—
The roots of Me          = 0 are real,             provided a rectangular system                                can be
found such that

     The quaternion form, of which this is an exceedingly particular
case, expresses         simply that the roots of the cubic in                                   <j>   are all real,

      4. The results above have immediate application to fluid motion.
For, when         there is a velocity-potential, the motion is "differentially
                   "
irrotational         -.—i.e., the instantaneous change of form of any fluid
element is a pure strain             ; a particular cubical         element     at  each
point       becoming      brick-shaped without change            of direction      of its
edges.         But if    we   think of the result of two            successive    instan
 taneous changes of this character,            we see that there is in general
 at every       point a definite elementary          parallelepiped, the lengths,
 only, of whose           edges   are changed     by this complex strain.               In
 special cases, only, is a similar result produced                by three successive
 pure strains.
       In   connection      with this Abstract     I  have     now printed       a  little
  paper (read to the Society some time              ago along with a speculation
 as to      the Antecedents      of Clerk-Maxwell's Equations), which               deals
  with closely connected          matters.    It  was again        presented    as  illus
  trating some portions of my reply to Professor Cayley's paper on
  Coordinates        verms Quaternions     (Proc. B.S.E., 2/7/94); but these
  portions      were    not printed at the time, because of a letter from
  Professor Cayley to the following              effect : —
       "I   venture to suggest the omission           of the passages relating to
  Heaviside — merely          on the ground that it is making the question
  into a triangular        duel.    As far  as I   am concerned,         it is certainly
   'Quaternions,'        and not    'Anything else',      v.  Coordinates, which          I
   was    arguing about."
       The passage of my reply, which was suppressed in consequence
   of   this request (though it formed a by no means unimportant part
   of my      case), followed     the first paragraph on         p. 284    of the Proc.
   Ii.S.E. for July       2, 1894,   and ran thus :—
        "But    I   may refer to the     recorded     experience       of  a  prominent
    practical worker at electro-magnetic         theory,     l)r  O. Heaviside.       His
    testimony is specially valuable in the present question                  because he
    is  avowedly not a partizan of quaternions.                     His   case   may    be
    described, in a modification of        Prof. Cayley's Title,        as   "Anything

164          Proceedings    of Royal Society of Edinburgh.                [sees.
versus    Coordinates."     In the Phil. Mag. (June 1885) lie has               a
paper    On the Electro-magnetic Wave-Surface,          from which    I  quote
as  follows : —
    " Owing to     the  extraordinary    complexity      of the investigation
when written       out in Cartesian    form (which       I  began doing, but
gave up aghast) some abbreviated method of expression becomes
desirable,   I may also add, nearly indispensable, owing to the great
difficulty in making out the meaning and mutual connections                  of
very complex formula.          In fact, the transition from the velocity-
equation to the wave-surface      by proper elimination would,       I  think,
baffle   any ordinary algebraist, unassisted        by some higher method,
or at any rate by some      kind of short-hand algebra."
    l)r  Heaviside then considers the fitness of quaternions to supply
the want, and refers unfavourably          to my treatment of Fresnel's
wave-surface.       (Hamilton, in his Element*, highly commended          even
the first (very imperfect) form of it          !)   Next,  Dr Heaviside     de
velops    a vector-system    of his own, and with considerable labour
and at comparatively great length obtains residts which (as rendered
for me, from his Volapuk into Quaternions, by Dr Knott) are
found to be precisely what Quaternions directly and naturally give
in a few lines ! Dr Heaviside, in a semi-defiant attitude, gives
away his case by asserting that his process
                                                      " cannot  be made more
direct, or shorter, except of course      by omission of steps, which         is
not a real shortening ".       Hence, and also of course, the Quaternion
wins, hands       down,    against his new system.            Tin's particular
application (including the simple proof of the identity of the various
forms of the equations,       which seems to have given          Dr Heaviside
very serious     trouble) was made (partly by Hamilton, partly by
myself) in 1859, and is to be found in §§ 382, 385 of the first
edition of my Quaternions,        or      182,    439   of the third edition.
The change      of a few letters, to introduce the slightly wider          data
 of the new problem, is all that is required."

The Physiological Action of Eucain.                                             By M. Charteris,
        M.D., Professor of Materia Medica, University of Glasgow,
        and William MacLennan, M.B., CM.
   Eucain, like          cocaine,        is    a     methyl           ester      of      a   benzoylated-
oxypiperidine, carbo-oxylic acid. It      however,            is,
                                                     synthetic pro                   a
duct, while cocaine    obtained exclusively from coca leaves
                              is                               only,                             ;
in the exhaustion, synthesis has been introduced for the purpose
of completely exhausting the cocaine in the leaves.
   The formula of cocaine and of eucain                             is   the same.
   Eucain, like cocaine,            in water, or nearly so, but the
                                    is   insoluble
neutral salts formed by combinations with acids are soluble.
   The hydrochloric salt of eucain                    appears         in two forms.
   One         modification        crystallises          from        water in            small    shining
plates,     which     contain      a   molecule of water of crystallisation,                           and
the formula for        it   is
                                   C19H27N04HCLH20.
   It   dissolves in water to the extent of                     6     per cent.
   The      second    modification            crystallises from            a    solution in methyl
alcohol in shining prisms, which contain two molecules of methyl
alcohol in crystallised form.
   For    anaesthetic       purposes the first modification                          crystallised     from
water     is   to be preferred.        A solution        of   it    in water differs from         a   solu
 tion of cocaine in water in this                  respect,         that   it   remains unchanged,
 while the cocaine solution, after                   a   time, undergoes decomposition.
    The appellation eucain has no meaning. It     used simply to                  is
                          '              '

 mentioned.
   Eucain        hydrochlorate         is     not so expensive                  as     cocaine hydro-
chlorate.
                              Physiological          Experiments.
   Assisted by        Dr MacLennan,            I     commenced in May last                       a   series
of experiments          on the         physiological            action of solutions of the

168          Proceedings    of Royal Society of Edinburgh.                  [
hydrochlorate     of eucain, and solutions        of the     hydrochlorate       of
cocaine.
   Solutions of these salts were injected hypodermically            into guinea-
pigs of the same weight, and the results were compared.
   At first the quantity used was small, hut this           was    gradually in
creased,   until the lethal   dose of each was accurately ascertained.
   After   repeated   experiments, we came to the conclusion that the
lethal dose of      eucain per kilo body-weight        is  *09   gramme ;     the
lethal dose of cocaine per kilo body-weight is -068 gramme.
   We   also found     that the mode of death by the two substances
varied.     With the cocaine salt we observed more rotatory move
ments of the head,        more opisthotonos, more salivation          and more
laboured breathing, than with the eucain salt.
   It  was also noticed that the physiological        action produced by a
given dose of the eucain salt did not follow nearly so rapidly as
that produced by a similar dose of the cocaine salt, under identical
conditions with regard to the weight of the animal experimented on.
   Hence the action of         eucain   is slower   in    onset,   and less     in
intensity.
   As illustrating this, we may state that "0216 gramme of eucain
hydrochlorate dissolved in 4 c.c. of water, when injected into a
pig weighing     570 grammes,      caused   only a slight weakness of the
hind limbs    ; the head was not affected.
   After the expiry of      a  week an injection of the same strength of
cocaine hydrochlorate       was made into the same pig.           In  the course
of half   an hour there were seen,      in the following    sequence,     clench
ing of the teeth, rotatory movements of the head, much salivation,
quick and shallow respirations.           Shortly afterwards, convulsions
and opisthotonos occurred, which continued for an hour, after which
time recovery was gradual.          Recovery    was, however, complete at
the end of three hours.
   After   the expiry of another week the same pig had an               injection
of  '032 gramme of hydrochlorate         of eucain in 4 c.c. of water.
   In half    an hour convulsions      affecting the body, but with little
disturbance to the head, commenced, and continued for 50 minutes.
They were in no way so violent as those occasioned by "0216
gramme of cocaine hydrochlorate ; and after the convulsions ceased,
recovery was perfect in the course of one hour.

                            Local Anwsthesia.
    Three drops of a solution     of hydrochlorate       of eucain   (1  in 10),
when inserted     into the eye of    a guinea-pig, induced in 60 seconds
complete anaesthesia   of the  cornea.    The pupil was not      affected, and
there was no subsequent irritation.
    It  is apart  from the nature of this paper to enter upon the
utility of this new local       anaesthetic.     The clinical observations
upon this are as yet meagre.         But when used in operations          on the
eye, the evidence is clear that   it has no  effect on the pupil.      Cocaine,
on the other hand, dilates the pupil.        Dr Berger of Paris, in        opera
ting for cataract,   employs first a drop of a     1  per cent, solution, and
after 3 minutes a drop    of  a 2 per cent,      solution.   This procedure,
he says, causes complete anaesthesia of the cornea.
    In dental practice it is found that    5 drops    of a solution   (1  in  10)
 injected into the gum before extraction of a tooth are sufficient to
 render this operation painless.

 Lord Kelvin,      to the   Chair of Natural Philosophy in            the University
 of Glasgow, was celebrated               in that     city by Delegates from           the
 Scientific Societies of all parts of the world.                This was an occasion
 unique in the history not only of the University on which Lortl
 Kelvin's     career    has    shed    so   brilliant   a lustre,  but   also   of any
 University     in   the  United       Kingdom.         It is true that a few other
 Professors in our Universities             have   held office for fifty years,       and
 have     thus reached        their jubilee,       but never was       there    such      a
 gathering to do honour to one man.                  The felicitations then      offered

 Kelvin     has accomplished in Mathematical                  and Physical     Science,

in no small degree to the enrichment and social progress of the
world.       Since Lord Kelvin — then William            Thomson    — became      a
Fellow of this Society, fifty years ago, he has contributed to its
Proceedings and Transactions, up to 1891, no fewer than seventy-
two communications,           and we reflect with pride on the fact that
several of his most famous papers were read to this Society.                  Only
three of these will         I venture to mention on this occasion.             The
Memoirs on Thermo-dynamics, the chief of which                  appeared   in the
Transactions from           1849   to   1851,* founded on the experimental
work of Joule, and of Joule and Thomson                  together,   established
that department          of science    on a new basis.      He  was  the first to
investigate methodically and to restate the whole subject from the
 mathematical       point of view    ; he  developed the principles of Carnot
 so as   to give the views now current as to the nature of heat             ;  and
 when he showed how to reckon temperature on an absolute thermo
 dynamic scale, the dynamical theory of heat secured its position              as a
 recognised branch of physical science.           Three years later, in 1852, t
 Thomson announced the principle of the dissipation of energy, and
  showed that a part of the energy of the universe is being slowly
  but surely changed into uniformly diffused              heat,   and therefore
  ceases   to be available    for mechanical effect.      From this principle
  stupendous consequences         flow, and the consideration of these has
  had a marked        influence on human thought.           Lastly, the   papers
  on   Vortex Motion, the first of which        was read   in February    1867,$
  applied our       knowledge     to   the properties  of vortex     rings, first
  investigated by Helmholtz,           towards the conception of an atom.
  Imagining     a fluid having only the properties of inertia, invariable
  density, and perfect mobility, the motions of the fluid are submitted
  to mathematical analysis, and on this is founded          a theory which may
  not only give a new expression to the atomic theory, but may be
  applied even to gravitation.          From  these contributions have flowed
  many     fruitful   results, which no doubt will        be recorded by the
  historian of science.

    The jubilee was the climax, not the end, of a great career.                  In
the remarks        made     by Lord     Kelvin    himself   on that occasion,
nothing was more striking           than the tones     of buoyant hope that
rang through every sentence, and one felt that the speaker's                 intel
lectual     eye   was   not dim     nor   his  natural   force    abated.      The
Fellows      of this Society join in the hope that Lord Kelvin may
yet   see   many days, and that he may still be able to use his power
ful intellect and      rare   inventive   faculty in the service of science.
To this     I must add that not a few among us have come under the
spell of his personal friendship, and to us he is even more than
 the mathematician or the pliilosopher.
           Appointment       op  Delegates and Representatives.
    In compliance with an invitation, the Council appointed two of
 its members, Dr Hunter Stewart and Mr Mossman, to represent
 them at the meeting of the Sanitary Association held at Newcastle.
    The     Council    also   appointed one of its Secretaries, Dr John
 Murray, to represent them at the International                Fishery Congress
 that met last September at Sables d'Olonne, in France, a                 request-
 having been made that the Society should send             a   Delegate.
    Dr John Murray and Dr Noel Paton              were appointed to represent
 the Society at the opening of the Gatty Marine Laboratory                   at  St
 Andrews on the 30th of October last.              Wo all wish much        success
 to a Laboratory        so   advantageously placed for        the study of the
 Fauna of the      Firth of Forth.
    You will     be aware that a member         of Council, Professor D'Arcy
 Thompson, was appointed by the Government                  a   Commissioner to
 report on the aspects of the Seal Fishery in Behring's Straits, and
  on its international relations.

     I shall   not, on this occasion,    attempt to give an analysis of         the
  many important communications made to the Society.                  Suffice it  to
  say that they dealt with many subjects, — Mathematical,               Physical,
  Physiological,    Zoological, and Meteorological, and also relating             to
  Public Health.

regularly consults the astronomical works of the Library, has in
the course of last session discovered three variable stars, not pre
viously known to vary.              These are    :

                Obituary Notices of Ordinary Fellows.
      During the       past   Session thirteen of our Ordinary             Fellows and
  five of our Honorary Fellows have died.                   It  is usual on the open
  ing of   a new Session        to advert to each of the deceased,               it being
  understood that the brief records             I   shall now give are         in nowise
  intended     to    supersede     more elaborate        obituary    notices,    winch     I
  hope we    will    receive.
      The first   to be taken away was          Hugh      Miller,     the younger and
   only surviving       son of     the famous      geologist of the same name.
   Born in 1850, he was educated             at the School of Mines, to which
  he was nominated by            Sir Roderick Murchison             on account of his
   father's important       contributions     to geological science.          He joined
   the Geological Survey of England             and Wales about the year 1874,
   and one result of his researches          was a paper         on Tynedale       escarp
   ments.    He was afterwards transferred               to tbe Survey of Scotland,
   and was chiefly employed mapping                 out the old red sandstone             of
   the  Moray Firth basin.          His work,      as was seemingly appropriate,
   was   confined chiefly        to  Cromarty       and Sutherlandshire.            From
   his  father     he    inherited    literary     ability,    and    he   was     always
   painstaking      and    accurate    in scientific work.           He   died on 9th
   January   1896.
      Josiah Livingstone           was born    in Edinburgh.          Notwithstanding
   the responsibilities     of an important mercantile             business,  he took a

  prominent part in the management of numerous public institutions.
  In   1881   he    was   elected  Master     of the Merchant           Company, in
 succession     to  Sir James Falshaw.         The Merchant Maiden Hospital
 being superiors of the town of Peterhead, he took                     a  leading part
 in   the movement,        which came to a successful           issue, for having         a
 national harbour of refuge          erected at Peterhead by convict labour.
 He presided over the Edinburgh             Chamber of Commerce from                 1869
 till  1872, and ho was again          elected to that position         in   1879.     As
 Chairman, he was present          as the   Representative of the Chamber                at
 the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869.                 He    was Chairman of the
 Edinburgh       Literary Institute from        1873    till his   death.      He    died
 on 13th    January 1896.
     George Robertson          was the eldest son of the late         Hon.     Hercules
 James     Robertson,      Lord Benholme,         one    of the Senators of           the
 College of Justice.        As   an engineer,    Mr Robertson carried out             the
 construction of Leith Docks, and was well known                       in connection
 with marine       and river engineering.         He   was    admitted     a  Fellow    of
 this Society in 1859, and was          a member       of the Institution of Civil
 Engineers.        Ho died on 7th February 1896, at the age of 65                  years.
     Robert Lawson         was born at     Kirriemuir.        Connected originally
 with journalism, he left that profession, and studied medicine                         at
 the University of Edinburgh,           where he took his degree of M.B. in
 1871 and of       M.D. in    1888.     He   was successively       Assistant to      the
 Chair of Practice         of Medicine,     Assistant Medical         Officer of      the
"West     Riding Asylum,          Yorkshire,      Medical      Superintendent           of
 Wonford House,          a registered    hospital     for   the insane      in  Devon
shire,   and in      1 878   he was    appointed     a  Deputy Commissioner in
Lunacy       for Scotland.       He   was    a   large    contributor       to medical
journals, but       latterly   his writing      was     confined     to his     Annual
Reports to the C leneral Board of Lunacy on the Care of the Insane
in Private Dwellings.           He  was a man of refined literary tastes, an
extensive reader        in many departments of literature and                   science,
ami of    a  kindly    and generous     nature.      Ho died on 2:2nd February
1896.
    David Cunningham             was   born    in Dundee on the 14th July
1838.     He was educated first at the High School of Dundee                         and
afterwards at the Queen Street Institution, Edinburgh,                    after which
he served      an apprenticeship      with Messrs Blyth, Engineers, F.din

the    Portpatrick      Railway.       When     this   was completed, he was
appointed Resident          Engineer     on the Galashiels      and Peebles line.
In   1869 he was appointed Engineer to the Dundee                  Harbour Trust,
which post he held for the remainder                of his life.     .Among other
works which he executed while thus engaged                    in his native town,
he deepened         the bed of the Tay 10 feet opposite the Harbour
Works,       constructed       a   large   graving      dock,   and     invented    a
large caisson       for  use at dock     entrances.       He died on 13th June
 1896.
    The Rev. Thomas              Milvillb    Raven       studied    at   St David's
 College,    Lampeter,      and received      the Lambeth        degree    of M.A.,
 conferred      by the Archbishop of Canterbury.                He was ordained
 in 1852.        After serving in various curacies for sixteen             years, he
 was, in 1867, appointed          Vicar of St Gregory's, Crakehall, with St
 Mary Magdalene's, Langthorne.               He was made Surrogate of the
 Diocese     of Ripon in 1878.          Some years ago he built, entirely          at
 his own      expense —about £3000 — St Mary                Magdalene's      Church
 at   Langthorne.          He maintained       this    church    at his own      cost
 besides meeting part          of   the expenditure       in connection with St
  Michael's      Church, Crakehall.          His     favourite    occupation     was
  photography, in which he acquired proficiency,                 and one year he
  won    the   first prize medal of the British Photographic                 Society.
  He was a member of the Yorkshire Archaeological                      Society.   He
  died at the age of 68.
     James     Abbrnbthy,        once  President     of the Institution of      Civil
  Engineers,      was born at Aberdeen          on 14th June 1814, and was
  at first educated in      a school in that city, and subsequently, along
  with his brother         George, at Cotherstone,          near Barnard Castle,
  which is believed to be the original of Charles Dickens' description
  of Dotheboys       Hall.    Whether Cotherstone was the identical school
  or not,  the system was at any rate similar.               Fortunately,   one day
  a  clerical uncle visited his nephews, and realising their unhappy
  condition, took them to his manse              near Haddington,        where they
  attended     the Grammar        School.    In   1833    James Abernethy went
  to Sweden to investigate           a manganese mine, and remained there
  for four years.       He  was afterwards employed as Assistant Engineer
   at the  Goole Docks, the Aire and Calder Canal, and the railway

  176        Proceedings     of Royal Society of Edinburgh.                 [siss.
  between    Wakefield      and     Leeds.    In   1840,    he   was  appointed
  Eesident   Engineer    at Aberdeen       Harbour.     As Surveying       Officer
  under the Preliminary Inquiries Act, he reported, between                 1844
  and 1852, on the condition of the Clyde, the Tyne, the Eibble,
  and the Ports of Glasgow, Liverpool, and other places.             At Birken
  head his scheme of    a  floating dock was adopted, after the failure of
  Rendel and Robert Stephenson's scheme of subaqueous sluices.                  In
  1854, he took an office at Westminster,         and was much engaged           as
  a Consulting    Engineer.       It  is impossible   in this brief sketch       to
  enumerate    the various works, principally of marine engineering,
  which he accomplished in England, Ireland, and in Egypt.                     He
  was elected President of the       Institution of Civil Engineers on       21st
  December 1880.       He died     on 8th March 1896.
    Thomas Dawson         Brodie,     the eldest  son of    John Clerk Brodie
 of Idvies, C.B.,     LL.D.,    was born on 26th December            1832.     He
 attended Edinburgh         Academy       and afterwards       Harrow    School,
 completing his education at the University          of Edinburgh.       He   was
 admitted a member of the Society of Writers to the Signet on 12th
 November 1857, and afterwards became senior partner of the firm
 of Gibson Craig, Dalziel & Brodies, and Secretary to the Carron
 Iron Company.        He    acted   as Deputy-Keeper       of the    Privy  Seal
 from 1869 to 1874.        On the death of his father, about nine years
 ago, he succeeded to the estate of Idvies, and a Baronetcy was con
ferred on him in 1892.         He    was a lover of art, and was possessor
of a fine collection of ornithological        specimens.      He died on 6th
 September    1896.
    The Rev.    John Gibson Cazenovb, D.D.,            came of a family     that
claimed to be a cadet branch of the De Cazenoves                   of Guienne.
 He was educated at the Royal Free Grammar School, Marlborough,
and at Brasenose      College, Oxford,      where,  in   1841, he obtained      a
prize for the best Latin and English essays.             In his earlier   career
he endeavoured      to train himself      for the Bar, but was induced to
take holy     orders.    He was Provost        of the Theological College,
Cumbrae, from 1867 to 1875.              Dr Cazenovo      came to Edinburgh
in  1878 as Sub-Dean and Chancellor of St Mary's Cathedral.                  For
the Encyclopcedia      Britannica     he prepared the     article on " Moham
medanism,"       and among       his other published        works   is Historic

He died on 30th September 1896.
     Johx Pbndbr was born in             1816   in the Vale of Leven, Dumbar
tonshire, and studied the classics and modern languages,                 turning his
attention also to science and art.              He distinguished himself in the
drawing       classes,  and was awarded           a  gold medal for an original
design.      In   his twenty-first      year he became general manager of a
factory near Glasgow.             In  Glasgow, and afterwards in Manchester,
he established       a business as export       merchant.     His foreign connec
tions as a Manchester merchant were world-wide,                  including, in par
ticular, the     United States, South America, China, and India.                  He
 was    one of the few who perceived the practicability                 of connect
 ing this country        with America by submarine telegraphy.                 Three
 hundred      and forty- five gentlemen resolved to contribute                £1000
 each     for this     purpose.       He   became     Director of the Atlantic
 Company.          Two of their cables were lost within            a few hundred
 yards of the      Irish   coast.     About the end of       1858    one  cable was
 actually laid, but      it refused to work after the trial        messages.     The
  Great Eastern was next sent out,            with  a cable constructed at a very
  high cost, but the ship parted            with her cable in mid-ocean, and
  could not that year endeavour to recover it.                 The Gutta Pcrcha
  Companies       that were asked to supply a new               cable required      a
  guarantee of a quarter           of a million, and      Mr Pender offered his
  personal guarantee           for that amount, which was           accepted.    The
  effort now made was completely successful.                A working      cable was
  laid in 1866 ; the lost one          was   recovered.    He thereafter      became
  chairman     of the companies which laid the first cable to India and
  the   Mediterranean         lines from Gibraltar to Malta, and thence to
  Egypt and      Turkey     ;   and developed the cables to China, Australia,
  Africa,   Brazil, and the Argentine Kepublic.              The capital invested
  in this    gigantic network         of  communication      is estimated at over
  forty millions      sterling.      The eleven cables in the Atlantic alone
  cost over     fourteen      millions sterling.
      In   1888,    he received the honour of          K.C.M.G., and, in        1892,
  the   honour of G.C.M.G.             He represented Totnes in the House of
  Commons        from    1862     to   1866.    He afterwards      represented    the
   Wick Burghs from            1872   to 1885.     In  1892,  Sir John was again
   elected  for those Burghs.         It was  mainly through his instrumentality

to the Government        in respect of     a  breakwater,     which debt      had
crippled   the energies of the town.          He was elected       a Fellow of
this Society in 1869, and died on 7th           July   1896.    His   character

with finance, determined perseverance, and good common-sense.
    James Clerk Rattray was born on 21st January 1834.                         He
was educated at the High School of Edinburgh, and by private
tutors.    He took his    degree    at  Edinburgh University.          He    went
into the Army Medical           Service,   and served for       some    years    at
Gibraltar and Malta.          He retired in      1864.     He never      was in
private practice.     He   was elected a     Fellow of this Society in      1885,
and died on 22nd February 1896.
    George M'Roberts was born in             1839, and was chiefly educated
in the Falkirk Grammar             School.      For many years, in          spare
hours, and amid discouragements, he studied chemistry, more                     es
pecially in its technical        aspects,  and    in  1870   he   established     a
chemical    manufactory      at   West Quarter, near Redding.              About
 1873, he became associated       with Mr Alfred Nobel, and took          charge
of the factory established by Messrs            A. Nobel & Co. at        Ardeer,
near Irvine, in Ayrshire.         This position     he held for about fifteen
years, when ill-health     obliged him to resign.         During    these years
he laboured unceasingly in developing             the technical    methods     for
tho manufacture of explosives.           The first pound of dynamite, on a
manufacturing     scale,  was made by Nobel and M'Roberts, and to
tho latter are chiefly due the admirable arrangements at Ardeer by
which this dangerous substance can             be made     in large   quantities
 with  a maximum      of safety.     Dynamite      was   succeeded   and partly
supplanted by blasting gelatine,       a  superior explosive, and M'Roberts
brought his experience and inventive talents to bear on the mak
ing of this substance.        When illness      came — an insidious      form of
paralysis  — an illness probably in          no  small measure      due to      hi>
arduous life, his mental faculties were untouched, and he was                 able
to take  a leading part in the planning of the Government Factory                 at
Waltham Abbey,       at  which the still     more modern explosive Cordite
is now made.      A  busy life, spent in the superintendence of techni
cal details, did not leave much time for              publishing    papers,    but

him   success in life and the affection of many friends.            He died on

        Obituary     ^Notices   of Foreign Honorary Fellows.
    The following five Foreign Honorary Members                 of our Society
have   died during last Session     : —
    Gabriel Augusts Daubree was born at Metz on 25th June
 1814.     From the Ecole Polytechnique he passed into the Corps
des   Mines.    He devoted himself chiefly to the experimental side of
Geology,    and expressed     his deep obligations        to our former Presi
dent,   Sir James Hall, the founder of that branch of the                 science,
 whose two papers on the subject, published               in our Transactions,
he    highly appreciated.      Daubree       devoted himself to solving the
 difficult problems of metamorphism              by actual    experiment.       Ho
 also took especial interest     in meteorites, and carried on        a series   of
 experiments    in order to reproduce their characters artificially.            Ho
 also published     some   volumes on the phenomena of underground
 water, and     traced   the various changes which           water is effecting
 within the crust of the earth.          He held official    posts in the    Iscole
 des   Mines and the Museum           d'Histoiro Naturello.      As   a member
 of the Academie       des Sciences ho accompanied            the excursionists
 from    that body to Chantilly on the occasion of the centenary of
 the   Academy, and was welcomed by the Due d'Aumale                   as an old
 colleague and personal friend.           He presented      a copy of his great
  work    £tudes    Syntlietiques     de    Geologie    Experimentale      to the
  Library of this Society.      He died      at Paris,  at the ago of  82 years,
 on 29th    May 1896.
     August Kbkule was intended by his father to                be an architect,
 and for that purpose underwent           a  preliminary training at Giessen.
  At that town, however,        he came       under    the fascinating    spell of
  Liebig, and renounced architecture for Chemistry.              He afterwards
  went to   Paris, and there studied under Eegnault, Fremy, Wurtz,
  and Gerhardt.      After   engagements        at Eeichenau and at St Bar
  tholomew's   Hospital, London,       he returned to Germany, and started
  a small  laboratory at Heidelberg, where he carried out his work on

 the fulminates and on cacodyl.             His first call   as Professor was to
 Ghent    ;  from that University he was translated           to Bonn.     It  was
 Kekule who first       gave definite form to        Frankland's conception       of
 valency, and he applied this idea to carbon compounds.                    Out of
 the   conception of valency,          too,  grew his theory of cyclic        com
 pounds, said to have been prolific to           a  degree almost unparalleled
 in the history of pure       science.     He died on 13th     July  1896.
    Ernst Curtius          was born at Lubeck in 1814, and studied                at
 the College of his native town, and at tho Universities of Bonn,
 Gbttingen, and Berlin.           In   1837, he visited     Athens in   company
 with Professor Brandos, in order             to begin his famous researches
into Greek antiquities.           He took     a leading   part in archaeological
expeditions       to the Peloponnesus         and Olympia.       He taught      for
some    time      in the Colleges of Berlin, and           became   tutor  to the
Emperor Frederick.           In   1856, he succeeded     Hermann as Professor
of Greek at Gottingen.            Since 1870, he had been Director of           the
Boyal Museum there His best known works relate to Greek
antiquities.       His History of Greece has been translated into English.
He was a Foreign Associate of the French Academy of Belle?
Lettrcs and Inscriptions,          and was elected an Honorary Fellow of
our Society in 1889.           He died    on 11th  July   1896.
   Hubert Anson Newton was born in                 1830, and died 12th August
1896.       His reputation is largely connected with the history of             the
November showers of meteors.               His collection and discussion of     the
original accounts of thirteen           meteoric displays, distributed     over    a
period of more than nine hundred                years,  demonstrated the       per
manent character of the phenomenon.                Perhaps one is not justified
in calling him the Director of tho Yale Observatory,                  as he only
hold that position for two years, 1882-84; and he seems to                   have
preferred the position of Secretary to the Board of Managers.                  The
work that       issued   from    the Observatory       under his management,
whether it bo parallactic inquiry or stellar triangulation, placed              the
institution in the front rank of those devoted to extra-meridional
work.       I will only   further allude to his inquiry into the capture          of
comets by Jupiter or other planets, in which ho has shown that
the perturbing       action of the planets on parabolic orbits tends             to
produce elliptic orbits of short periods, moderately inclined to               the
ecliptic.      He was elected an Honorary Fellow of this Society                 in

   1896-97.]             Cliairman's Opening Address.                              181
   1886, and an       Honorary Fellow of the Koyal Society of London
   in 1892.
      Armand      Hippolttb Louis Fizbau was born in the year                   1819.
   His experimental method of determining the velocity of light by a
   rotating    wheel is known to every student of optics.                   Another
  experiment       with which his name is honourably             associated    is that
  by which he determined           the amount of drift of light-waves             in  a
  transparent      medium in motion.       He made      some remarkable experi
  ments on the number of interference bands observable                with approxi
  mately homogeneous light, and on             light in different parts of the
  field of   illumination in interference experiments.              Ho was    elected
  a  Foreign Member of the Royal Society of London in                  1 875,  and of
  our Society     in  1892.   He died September 18th, at the            age of 77.

     The following two British Honorary Fellows died during                        last
  Session   :—
     John    Russell Hind       was originally intended for the profession
 of engineering,      for which    he had  little   tasto  ;  and it was fortunate
 that circumstances permitted           him to join the staff of the Royal
 Observatory, where ho was attached to the magnetical and meteoro
 logical department.         In  1844, he   left Greenwich to take charge of
 Bishop's     observatory at Regent's Park.              At that time Neptune
 was not discovered, and           he began,     at that observatory,      to form
 ecliptical    charts of stars,     with the view of detecting the object
 that   disturbed the motion of Uranus.              The comparison of these
 charts   with the heavens led       to the discovery of a number of small
 planets, some variable       stars, and a few comets.           His facility    as a
 computer led to his selection for the post of Superintendent                 of the
 Xautical Almanac when a vacancy occurred in 1853.                     He received
the medals        of the Royal and Astronomical             Societies.    He  was a
Corresponding Member of the Institute of France, a Fellow of the
Royal Society of London,          and was elected      a  Fellow of this Society
in 1895.        He died December 23rd,        1895.
    William Robert Grove was born at Swansea in 1811.                          From
the age    of   25 to 50, Grove, though practising the profession of the
law, was actively engaged         in scientific work.        Prior to the publica

                                    day an important invention,           as  giving
high electromotive force and moderate                resistance.     The polarisa
tion of gases occupied         much of his attention, and he invented the
gas-cell,   interesting as the forerunner           of the modern secondary
battery,      lie  received    a medal      from the Royal        Society for his
Paper on Voltaic Ignition and tlie Decomposition of Water, which
formed the Bakerian Lecture for 1840.                    In 1871 he became a
Judge, and shortly afterwards received the dignity of knighthood.
He was D.C.L.          of Oxford      and    LL.D.    of  Cambridge.        He was
elected a Fellow of the           Royal Society of London in           1840, and a
Fellow of this Society in 1881.              He died August 2nd, 1896.
    When     tho Council requested        me to deliver this opening address,
they suggested that        I might occupy      a portion of it with an account
of any recent investigations that have occupied                 my attention.        It
gives    me pleasure      to act upon this        suggestion,    and   I   therefore
venture to bring         under      your   notice   a  few subjects that         have
specially interested me during the last few months.
        The Structural           and   Physiological Nervous Unit.
    Up   to a comparatively recent date, our conception of the nervous
system     was that it was        built  up of nerve cells      and nerve fibres,
 more    or less intimately         bound together by         a  peculiar    kind    of
tissue known       as neuroglia.       It  was further     supposed    that, in    the
 central nervous organs, nerve cells were linked together by pro
 cesses  passing    from one cell to another, that sensory             nerve    fibres
passed into, and        were    in their substance       continuous with, nerve
cells, and that motor fibres originated in nerve cells, and passed out
to muscle fibres.        It   was also held that the elements            of sensory
organs, such as the retina or the organ               of Corti, were organically
connected      with nerve cells in the cerebral organs.               In  short,    the
nervous system,       as a   whole, was held to       be  composed     of cells    ami
fibres closely connected         together,  so that the structure was like            a
vast web, the size of the meshos of which would vary according to
the intricacy      of the     connections      by which      the   various cellular
 elements     were   held together       by nerve fibres.       These histological

1896-97.]               Chairman's Opening Address.                                 183
conceptions were founded on the microscopical scrutiny of sections
prepared      by the older methods of hardening and staining, from the
time of    Lockhart Clarke       to nearly the present day.
    The notions of physiologists, as is usually the case, were more or
less  in conformity     with, and      were   influenced by, these histological
conceptions.        Nerve cells were supposed to          be excited by nervous
impulses,     or to originate nervous impulses, and nervous impulses
appeared to pass from cell to cell.             Many illustrations,      some fanci
ful, were culled         from    the    nomenclature       of   electrical    science.
Notions also of more or less          " resistance " in the    passage of nervous
impulses      passed  into current     use.   These notions were founded on
the     statement     of the histologists that         there   was continuity         of
nervous elements, and they were derived                 from a fanciful analogy
to the passage        of electricity along conductors.             No one offered
proof of anything similar            to resistance (in the electrical sense)
occurring in a nerve        ; and the term resistance, in nervous pheno
 mena,     was    employed      to explain      certain   cases of    delay in the
transmission      of  a nervous impulse in centros, and of an apparent
 choice of path by the           nervous impulse.        Further, there was no
 recognition    of a nervous structural or physiological unit, unless in the
 separation    of the nervous elements into cells and fibres            ;  and these
 two were often discussed as         if they were     separate   and distinct.
    In science, the invention of a new method of            research, by bringing
 to light new facts, or by upsetting             notions founded on incorrect
 observation,     leads not      only   to a critical     examination       of older
 ideas,  but the formation of new ideas.           A new    method marks        a   new
 step  in progress.     For   a  time, things seem to be in confusion             ;  old
 pathways have to be abandoned and new ones                   opened up     ;  and it
 is not   until  a fresh theory has been         devised to meet and embrace
 the  new facts that men feel they are again on safe ground.
    With regard to tho physiology of the nervous -system, we are at
 present passing through such a critical, and, it must be confessed,
 a dark period,     in consequence of       an entirely new set of facts having
 been   elicited by   a new method, now well known to histologists, in
 the  preparation of sections of the nervous organs for microscopical
 examination.        The method, first devised by Golgi, and applied
 with much success         by Ramon       y Cajal, Retzius, and many other
 observers, consists    in acting on the nervous organs with bichromate

of potash, osmic acid, and nitrate of silver.              The interaction     of
bichromate of potash with nitrate of silver results in the formation

connected     with  these.     In   this  way    numerous      fine fibrils   are
shown, most of which escaped detection by the older methods,                 and
a large number of new and important facts have thus been brought
to light.    These facts are now described in almost every text-book,
but their significance and importance have not yet been appreciated
even    by physiologists,    and still less by those who are interested
generally in physiological       science,  more especially in its bearings
 on psychological questions.       This must     be my excuse      for bringing
 a matter forward      in this address which has lately occupied            much
 of my attention.
      A nerve cell, with its prolongations       or processes, may now          be
 regarded as a nervous unit, to which "Waldeyer                  has given     the
 name of neuron.         The cell is   a mass  of protoplasm, showing        usu
 ally in its interior numerous fine fibrils, which enter it by               each
 process, and cross and re-cross      in all directions,   so as to form a fine
 and irregularly-meshed       network.     From the cell arise        numerous
 processes   or poles,    to use the old term.        With    the  exception of
 the bipolar cells in the ganglia on the posterior roots of the spinal
  nerves, and   a few others, all nerve cells show numerous            processes,
  or they are multipolar.      These processes     also   appear to be fibrillar
  in their texture, and they        are  of two kinds:— (1) Protoplasmic
  processes,  or dendrites, which, by dividing and subdividing, form
  a very fine set of twigs,    like the twigs on the branchlets of          a tree
  as seen  against a winter     sky.    This dendritic     appearance is called
   an arborization.     (2) A thicker process, of variable length, which
   is now known to be the axis-cylinder of a nerve fibre.                  In the
   cerebral nervous organs these axis-cylinder          processes may be very
   short, amounting to oidy one or two millimetres, but axis-cylinders
   may extend from cells in the anterior cornua of grey matter in                the
   cord to muscles in the limbs, and they may then reach              a length of
    many millimetres.      The axis-cylinder process also terminates            in a
    smaller kind of arborisation, by which it comes into relation              with
    (1) a motor apparatus, such as the contractile          fibres of a muscle;
    (2) a secretory    apparatus, such as the         cells in the acini of         a

gland      ;   or (3) with the dendrons of another neuron in the im
mediate vicinity of the first, or at a groat distance from it. It is
to be noted, however, that the arborization of two axis-cylinders
never como into close relationship with each other.                       Further, no
direct continuity can be established                between     neurons.     The den
dritic processes may closely approach               the   terminal arborizations of
an axis-cylinder;            and,    in turn, the   terminal arborizations of an
axis-cylinder may closely approach the                      dendritic   processes    of
another neuron, or the body of a nerve                      cell, or the cells of     a
secreting gland, or,          as   in the end plates in muscle, the contractile
tissue,      but there      is never     anatomical continuity.         If  we   could
 detach a neuron, and pick it out from its bed nothing would bo
ruptured.         Another remarkable fact brought out by the new method
 is   that both axis-cylinders and dendritic fibrils often give off at
right angles extremely fine fibrils, anil that these fibrils end in
 delicate dendritic-looking            processes by which they are brought into
 relation with other neurons.
     Further, the         researches     of Golgi, Cajal, Kolliker, and many
  others, appear to show that all the central nervous organs are built
  up    of   neurons,    each constructed       on the same type, and that the
  varying       degree of complexity of the structure of any part of the
  cerebral nervous organs depends on the complexity in detail of the
  neurons composing            it.    Thus, spinal cord,     cerebellum,    cerebrum,
  and    the nervous       portion of the special       terminal organs      of sense,
  such     as   the retina,    the organ     of Corti with the ganglion of the
  lamina       spiralis,   are all     constructed   on   the   same genera)     plan.
  They are aggregations            of neurons, arranged     with reference to each
  other in a special way.            It also appears that one portion of a neuron
   may be       a considerable distance from another.              Thus a neuron in
  one    of the grey layers of the cerebrum               may     be related,   by its
   dendritic processes, to the upper layers of the cortex, and, by its
   axis-cylinder process, and the terminal arborizations of the latter,
   to the    dendritic processes of       a motor neuron in the anterior horn of
   grey matter in the lumbar region of the spinal cord.                    It appears
   to me      that  a great     step has been taken in this recognition of a
  morphological nervous unit.
      We now turn         to the physiological side of the question.          Writers
   are,  on the whole, of opinion that nervous impulses                are conveyed

186         Proceedings     of Loyal Society of Edinburgh.                 [sess.
by the dendritic processes always towards the cell, and by the axi?
cyliuder and its terminal arborizations always from the cell.             In m)
opinion, the first statement at present rests on insufficient             proof,
and it will be noticed that, if we admit the second, it upsets                the
older notion of a sensory impulse travelling along             a sensory   nerve
from the skin ultimately reaching a nerve cell, say in the cord                 or
brain.     Further, this statement carries with it          a number of start
ling conclusions.       For   example,   if  the dendritic    processes  always
carry impulses towards the cell, the numerous            fine axis-cylinders in
an area of skin, which        supply sensibility to that part, must        be re
garded as the dendritic processes of a bipolar cell in a ganglion on
the posterior root of a spinal nerve, and the sensory filament                 we
have hitherto regarded        as an   axis-cylinder   as a   specially enlarged
division of the dendritic arrangement.            If this be so, then the axis-
cylinder beyond       the    ganglion is     the  true axis-cylinder,    and its
arborization in the cord, by which it may become related to another
 neuron, is the homologue        of the end plates at the termination of           a
 motor axis-cylinder.       Again, if we trace sensory fibres up the cord
 and   onwards to the cerebral         cortex, these     fibres  are true axis-
cylinders, and they end in fine fibrils (again homologous with the
end plates in muscle), by which an arborization is formed, bringing
them     into relation with the dendritic         processes   of a neuron,     the
body of which is in the grey matter             of the cortex, and which          is
presumably motor.
    There is also   a difficulty in understanding the true significance
of the fine fibrils, already alluded to, which pass off at right angles
from the main stems.          If  these come off from fibrils that are con
tinuations of the dendron,          as they    do in the grey     layers of    the
cerebrum,     do they conduct nervous impulses           downwards and        out
 wards to the dendrons of adjacent cells, or do they carry impulses
 from such cells to the cell from the dendron of which they spring?
and   if  they come olf from the true          axis-cylinder process, do     they
 conduct outwards, so       as to  bring their parent cell into connection,
 by terminal arborizations, with other structures?
    Again, if there is no continuity of structure, and only continuity
 of terminations, how       is a nervous      impulse transmitted from         one
 neuron to another     ?   Some     have   suggested   that this may occur      by
 actual movements        of the terminations, in a manner analogous              to

those      of the long pseudopodia found in many of the lower inverte
brates.         No one has seen such movement, and the only movement
that has been followed is that of growth.                       Cajal is of opinion that
both the dendron processes and the terminal arborization processes
actually grow outwards, like the rootlets of a tree, in correspondence
with the advancing development of the individual                              in foetal and
early life.         A   moTe     likely supposition       is that neuron may act on
neuron by an electrical excitatory process.                      It  is well known         that
such       processes    occur in contractile muscular fibres, and that one
muscular fibre set in action by                 a  nervous impulse reaching its end
plate may generate               excitatory electrical changes            which stimulate
adjacent fibres that do not possess end plates.                       Such   a process may
exist in neurons, but it has not yet been demonstrated.
      The most remarkable example of the branching arrangement of
 a    neuron      with which          I  am     acquainted occurs        in Malapterurus
 dectricim,       the Riiash or the Thunderer-fish                of the Arabs,         a   live
 specimen of which was shown to tlus Society by Professor Goodsir
 in 1855.
      In this animal        the electric organ forms a layer beneath               the skin,
 enveloping the body with the exception of the head and fins.                                 Its
  structure,      as worked        out chiefly by the          laborious      researches       of
  Fritsch of        Berlin,    is that of       a  honcycomb-likc        tissue,  in which,
  however,       the spaces are not         hexagonal, but lozenge-shaped.                Each
  lozenge has, of course, four sides, and on two of these, adjacent to
  each    other, we find an electric tissue consisting of granular proto
  plasm, and not unlike that of the electric disks in other electrical
   fishes.     Fritsch    regards      this electric tissue as       a  layer of modified
   epithelial cells.        The electric organ,         therefore,     is an altered       con
   dition    of the skin glands.          In   the epidermis     of the thunderer there
   are  peculiar club-shaped             cells,   which are forms transitional into
   true    electric    cells,   and,    towards     the   tail, lozenge-shaped         spaces
   occur    in which     there     is no electric tissue.        The number of these
   electric    cells is enormous.            After counting         the    number in one
   cubic    centimetre of the organ (a cube, each side of which measures
   two-fifths     of' an inch), Fritsch computes the total number in tho
   organ     of a full-sized fish, and brings up the total to two millions.
   Each electric cell is supplied with                an    individual      nerve   filament
   which enters the lozenge at one angle and loses itself in the electric

188           Proceedings     of Royal Society of Edinburgh.                      \
tissue.    These filaments are formed by the division of larger ones,
and, strange to tell, when the filaments of one side of the body
are traced inwards to the spinal           cord, they are all found to spring
from one single nerve filament which originates in a single gigantic
nerve    cell  or neuron.        This     nerve     cell   has     numerous      proto
plasmic    processes    which    coalesce   here and there to form               a   per
forated    plate, in the     meshes    of which capillaries            may be seen.
These giant electric cells, of which there are two lying side by side,
one   in each   lateral half of the cord, and connected by                 a  filameilt
passing    across    the   cord,   are   about     the TJ^th of an inch in
diameter.      We have thus the whole electric organ supplied by
two     neurons, a fact unique         in   science.       Further, the electric
cells of one half of the body are each supplied by                 a nerve filament,
that is to say, there are, in the periphery,                 1,000,000 individual
filaments.     These, however, all spring            from     one nerve      filament,
starting from the single neuron.              Fritsch, with praiseworthy            zeal,
measured the diameter of the parent nerve filament, and compared
it with the sum of       the diameters of the        million of filaments in          the
periphery.      He found that the ratio was            as  1  is to 364,000, show
ing the remarkable         fact of a gradual increase in the amount of
 matter forming      the axis-cylinder     as we pass from the spinal             nerve
 cell to the ultimate nerve fibril.           The singlo electrical cell, little
 more than the -rijjth of an inch in diameter, can thus discharge
 the whole battery on one side of the body.
     Recently    Professor   Gotch has had the opportunity                 of making
 observations with the capillary electrometer on the electric dis
 charges of this fish, and he has photographed the effects following one
 single stimulus applied to the axis-cylinder.               The    effect is not one
 electrical discharge, as might have been expected, but eight or                     ten,
 in  a series  gradually     diminishing     in intensity.         Here we have         a
 kind of electrical reverberation       ;  and, by   a   careful study of the time
 relations of these discharges, Gotch is of opinion that the                      effects
 are chiefly due to changes occurring            in the numerous nerve fibrils
 branching     off to the     electric    cells.    Suppose       we could start        a
  Gatling gun by      one   movement, then the barrels would go off,                  one
  after the other, as do the electric discharges given off by the Riiash.
     These new details of structure also give rise to many difficult
  questions as to the individuality of neurons.                   Is   each neuron      a

that these         new investigations                  have not made                        it   easier       but more
difficult to comprehend the mode of action of nerve centres, and as
I    examine        microscopical             specimens showing                         the neurons of the
cord,      or     the       still more            complicated            arrangement                     of     neurons
in the cerebrum, and the baffling complexity                                                of the cerebellum,
I    feel bewildered                in attempting to understand how                                      these       struc
tures     act.          "What         we now           need     is       a        satisfactory            physiology

be   glad   if these remarks stimulate younger workers to investigate

     Suppose       we introduce a telephone a into the primary circuit of
an ordinary induction coil, such as used                             in physiological laboratories,
and another telephone b into the circuit of the secondary coil, and
suppose the          wires connecting telephone a with the primary                                                     and
connecting          telephone          b     to be many yards in length                                   If    one     ob
server speaks               into    o, another         observer          will hear every word if                             b
is applied         to his ear.               Every      one     is acquainted with this fact,
 that the currents awakened                       in a induce corresponding currents in
the secondary coil,                  which    are transmitted                     to   b.        If     we substitute
for a a microphone-transmitter                           c,    and speak to                      it,    the tones are
 reproduced         by telephone             b.
     Further,       as
                     I             showed to the Society in February last,                                        if    we
suspend     a     microphone-transmitter                      over the phonograph, when the
 latter    is   in motion and giving out                       tones, the variations                           in resist
 ance     in the microphone-transmitter                        produce such alterations in the
 current flowing                  through    it   to the coils of an electro-magnet as to
 make     it    possible,         mechanically, to record these variations.
     These considerations                   led me some months ago to try the follow
 ing experiment.                   The microphone-transmitter                           was suspended over
 the    phonograph disk, and                      it   was introduced                       into the circuit             of
 the   primary coil of the induction                        machine along with four Obach's

190         Proceedings     of Royal Society of Edinburgh.                  [sbss.
cells (Q type).    The terminals of the secondary coil were carried to
two strips of platinum foil immersed in two insulated vessels (glass
beakers or shallow      vulcanite     troughs) containing     a  '75 per cent,
solution of common salt or sulphuric acid         (1 : 10  of water).     I  then
found that when the phonograph            was set in action, and when the
fingers were immersed in the vessels, an electric thrill was felt in
the fingers which corresponded to the rhythm, time, and intensity
of the tune played by the phonograph.                By carefully graduating
the strength of the induction          shocks, each note and chord of the
music can be distinctly felt.
   The experiment     at once suggested       a number of very interesting
questions.    Each variation      in resistance in the microphone-trans
mitter produced by the varying pressures caused by the waves of
sound was followed       by  a  corresponding     variation   in the strength
of the stimulus from the secondary coil, and the sensory nerves of
the skin were capable of appreciating            all  these  variations.      The
effects are most    striking when the strength of the stimulation                is
such as not to be sufficient to excite muscular twitclungs.              Only     a
"thrill" should be felt.
   In the first place, what     structures in the skin are stimulated          by
such electrical thrills?       In   the skin we have, richly distributed,
numerous fine sensory nerve filaments.            Whether     these  all termi
nate in end organs or not is a question that cannot at present be
decisively answered, but the evidence rather favours the view that
they do not all terminate in end organs.            Sensations of touch and
of temperature have been experienced and referred to small areas
of skin which have      been    excised from his own body by the ardent
experimentalist,    and in which no end organs have been                   found
by the aid of the microscope.              To the skin we refer at least
two well defined sensations, touch            (which is essentially a sense
of pressure) and temperature.           Touch is believed to be connected
with various kinds of touch corpuscles, but            no end organ has yet
been discovered    for the  sense of temperature.         Further, in   a   given
area of skin (say of the fingers)         points may be found        connected
with touch, that is to say, tactile sensations         are experienced when
pressure is made on these            points, while no sensation of touch
follows pressure on    a  point   a  millimetre or two to one side of the
tactile spot.   In  the same area there may also be detected what are

now termed " hot spots," and near                    these other spots             called    " cold
spots."      A     copper point, of the temperature of the skin, applied to
a cold spot, excites a sensation not of heat, but of cold, and, on
the other hand, the same rod applied to a hot spot excites a                                 sensa
tion of heat. So we have pressure spots, hot spots, and cold                                 spots.
These      spots        are not indiscriminately          mixed, but there are little
adjoining        areas        in which      one   of the three      kinds predominates.
Temperature spots                are insensitive     to pain, that is to say,                a    fine
needle may              be    pushed into such        a spot without              causing        pain.
Farther,      as   was shown by Stanley              Hall and Donaldson, in 1885,*
when      a metallic point conveying a current of electricity was carried
along the surface of the skin there was considerable diversity                                      of
sensation at different points, so that the authors observed cutting-
pain points, thrill points, tickle points, points                   at which the sense of
motion of        the    irritating body appeared to           be increased, and           blind or
dead points, to which no sensation was referred.                                This   is the only
observation         I   have met with bearing on the effects                       on sensations
produced         by weak electrical stimulation                   of the skin.          It   would
appear,  therefore, that a dermal sign (that    the effect in con    is,
sciousness of irritation in one way or another of an area of skin)
is often     a     mixture of feeling, and that this mixture may give                                a
characteristic          feature to each local area of skin.
   It   is   difficult to conjecture what skin elements                          are affected       by
 the rapid         induction       currents under consideration.                   They      do not
 produce pressure in the ordinary sense                  ;   so    far     as
                                                                           I      can make out,
 they do not produce sensations of temperature                       ;     and the sensations
 are    not of        a      painful character.       They may act simply                    on the
 delicate sensory nerve filaments everywhere                         abounding, and they
 give rise to sensations of             a   peculiar kind,    a    sense        corresponding       to
 electrical stimulation and to nothing else.
    So far as      I         am aware, no observations have been                    made on the
 stimulation          of sensory skin nerves except with reference to the
 production            of reflex acts. The effects of stimuli, varying in
 number, in intensity,              in rhythm on         consciousness,           have not been
 studied.        It     is    well known that        a   single stimulus applied to                    a
 motor nerve will               cause   a    single twitch,       and the characters of                a

twitch, both, in its motor and in its electrical aspects, have been
carefully investigated.           Further, it is known that if the stimuli come
after each other with sufficient rapidity, a tetanic state is produced.
The duration of        the     stimulus capable of exciting       a muscular       con
traction has also been noted.             Thus Koenig,     a pupil of Helmholtz,
found that weak induction             currents lasting less than '001 sec. pro
duced no effect, but         if the duration of the current was lengthened
to "017 to '018        sec.    a contraction resulted.       This observation, of
which     I  have doubts, leads us to suppose           that a current must last,
when applied to         a   frog's sciatic nerve, at least one-thousandth            of
a  second to produce an effect on the muscles supplied by the nerve.
    It is of interest to inquire into the action of stimuli               on sensory
nerves.       This can readily       be done.     I introduced     into the circuit
of the primary        various interrupters        (clock, metronomes, vibrating
springs, tuning      forks), varying        in speed   from  1  to 200 vibrations
per second, and the effect on the skin was noted when the fingers
were dipped into the vessels containing salt solution in which were
immersed the platinum              terminals of the secondary.           It was easy
to discriminate successive          stimuli up to about 40 to 50 per second           ;
between 50 and 120 the sensation was a                    thrill something com
parable to the effect of very rapid musical beats causing disagree
able roughness;       from 120 up to 200 the effect was of             a  more solid,
 continuous character, and was the (to me) pleasurable thrill pro
duced by a series of weak induction shocks.                      The sensation of
continuity      of stimulation       is analogous to tetanus, although          it  by
no means follows that the molecular changes                 occurring in    a muscle
during      tetanus are in the least like those happening in a nerve
centre which is the seat and material substratum of the sensation.
    As  I   have said, it is an undoubted          fact that the sensory nerves
of the skin      can appreciate electrical        stimulations corresponding in
number, rhythm, and intensity to the notes or chords of a compli
cated    piece   of music.         But the sensations experienced when              we
listen to music are very complicated.               They may, however,        be sub
divided into various elements.               There is pitch of individual tones,
duration of individual tones, intensity of tone, quality of tone, and,
in addition,     the relationship      of  tones, or  tonality.     Again, we     com
prehend music in proportion               to its rhythm.     If  it is unrhythmic
it is incoherent;        but    if it   is rhythmic,    if there    is a systematic

grouping of notes with regard to their duration, it gives pleasure.
Rhythm        has been well called          the metre of music.            It   depends
largely on appreciation of time and accent.
    The stimulation of the skin by the method devised can therefore
only give certain of the elements of music.                  It   gives no accurate
appreciation of pitch, although when stimulations are comparatively
few    in number, the sensation is rough and different from the con
tinuous       sensation     when       the  stimulations      are very      numerous.
 Quality is absent       ;  nor is there any feeling like that which leads
 us,  when we     intelligently listen to music, to be, as it were, searching
 for- the    tones that determine scales.              There is also absent that
 effort at analysis which,          it appears to    me,   constitutes     one    of the
 pleasures excited by modern music, both as regards its elaborate
 compositions        and    the    large   and    complicated       instruments      and
 orchestras      by which the ideas of the composer are given to the
 audience.       There still remain the elements of rhythm,                    and this
 includes     both duration        of successive     stimulations       and intensity.
  As to time and duration, the sensations are quite distinct.                     I have
  tested    many varieties of both            simple    and    compound        times,  as
  known to the musician, and there is no difficulty in distinguishing
  the one from the other.
      In this way, the deaf can            be led to understand           some    of the
  elements of music.           It  will, however, if    I may use the expression,
  be music      on one plane.           Several deaf persons on whom              I have
   experimented       have     appeared to be startled with              the new sen
   sations, and when         it was explained that there was something of
   this in music, they apparently had pleasure.               It   is also conceivable
   that  if spoken words fell on the microphone-transmitter,                  sensations
   of electrical stimulation         of the fingers might be explained, agreed
   upon, and afterwards understood by the deaf.
      There    is still another aspect       of the matter       I    venture to bring
   before you.       It  is known to physiological          psychologists that the
   connections      that    exist    between processes       in the brain         centres
   corresponding      to the different senses are real physiological             connec
   tions and not merely intellectual             relations.     Sensations of sound
   affect those of colour and vice versd, so          vividly in     some persons that
   they always associate          colour and sound.        Thus Joachim Raff, an
   eminent musical         composer, said that he saw the colour of the flute

to be blue, the hautboy yellow, and the cornet green.                             Again, it
is well known that          if  an organ of sense be stimulated with a feeble
stimulus, and         if another      organ   of sense be simultaneously stimu
lated, the intensity of the sensation               in the first organ is increased.
Thus Urbantschitsch*                found that sounding a tuning                 fork may
 cause a colour, scarcely           perceptible at      a distance,    to be seen more
 vividly.      Smells, tastes, touches           may influence sounds;                a  loud
 sound may appear less loud when the eyes are closed                      ;  sight excites
 the    acuteness       of the sense of taste;            smell affects sounds;           and
 tastes    influence      colours.        A brilliant illumination           of   the     skin
 increases     sensitiveness       to temperature, and a stimulus of heat or
 cold on one area of skin may affect the tactile sensibility of the
 other.      By electrically irritating         the skin with irritations that are
 not disagreeable          but     pleasurable,    with irritations         that    come     in
 proper order, duration, time, and rhythm, may wo not send nervous
 impulses to the cerebral centres              of the skin which may radiate                 to
  those of the ear and thus excite processes                   resulting in something
  like the consciousness          of sound and music        1    Possibly, also, in those
  who     once     listened     to    music   and have        become     deaf,     electrical
  stimulat ions of the skin may awaken a                 kind of cerebral       music, long
  forgotten, but still capable of giving pleasure.

      Since my last communication on this subject to the Society, in
  February, my attention has been directed to perfecting                      a mechanism
   for obtaining        a record of the vibrations              imprinted      on the wax
   cylinder of the phonograph, and               I  wish to acknowledge the              great
   assistance     derived from the ingenuity and mechanical skill of Mr
   Reid and Mr Kean, of              the, well-known firm in Glasgow known by
   the name       of " James White."            The instrument now before you,
   which    I   shall call     a  phonograph recorder, traces out, on                  a large
   scale, the curves       of the indentations on the wax cylinder                       corre
   sponding to each vibration of sound, and it does so in                       a  way     that
   seems to be highly satisfactory.              It  is now an instrument            that can
   be used by other workers in this difficult department of research, and

avocations and with calls to other branches of physiological research,
I can       never hope to overtake.
   The essence of the method consists in (1) driving at a very slow
rate the mandrill carrying the wax cylinder of the phonograph on
which             a    record has been taken.                              It    is well      to use well-marked
records, and,                 if   possible,         those taken specially for purposes of investi
gation, at the                     time carefully noting the speed of the phonograph.
The best speed                     I have        found to be as nearly as possible that of one
revolution in half a second.                                       I       now drive          the      mandrill           a,   as
shown on the plate, by means                                     of    a    small electric motor                  /»,   worked
with one or two Obach cells,                                     V     of the     Q     type, and           the speed of
revolution               is   one revolution                 in eight minutes, or nearly 1000 times
slower                than the speed at which                              the   mandrill        rotates          when the
phonograph                is       giving out tones.                       This slow       speed gets rid of the
inertia of the recording lever now to be described.

 placed as to have the narrow borders above and below.                                                            This lever
 has its              fulcrum in       a    well-made axle and pivot joint, r"1 in plate.

 the    wax cylinder, in the groove, and the cylinder moves slowly, as
 already described,                    it       will    be evident that this lever                         will    move        up
 and    down, as the recording point slowly moves over the elevations
 and depressions                     on the cylinder, and that as the long arm of the
 lever, cc"             in plate,          is   205 mm.          in length,         the       amplification at the
 point of the                 lever will bo considerable.

(110 mm.) is vertical.          In this way the movements of the first
lever are communicated to the second lever, and they are thus
amplified   a second    time.
    From the point of the            second      lever    a   thin   rigid   wire,    <7.
passes transversely 80 mm., to be attached to a thin slip of brass
bearing   a fine glass    syphon, w, like the syphon used in the 'well-
known     syphon    recorder of Lord Kelvin.                  This strip of brass
bearing the syphon is attached to an upright                     rod, h, bearing       a
circular weight at its lower end, k, delicately pivoted above and
below, and having       a fine   watch spring attached to its upper end,              *.
The syphon is placed horizontally, with the longer limb, m, towards
the front of the apparatus and with the shorter limb, I, dipping                  into
an inkpot, n.    The ink used is      a  filtered solution of an aniline colour.
It will  be evident, on looking         at the plate, that any movement of
the second lever is thus communicated                  to the syphon and that
oscillations of the syphon are controlled by the weight and the
spring already described.          The amplification          of the movement is
also greatly increased.
    The paper on which        a  tracing is taken is rolled oui below the
long end of the syphon by an ingenious electro-motor arrangement
recently devised      for Lord Kelvin's syphon recorder.                  It  will   be
remembered      that in the usual            form   of Lord       Kelvin's syphon
recorder                 electrified                                 " mouse-mill,"
            the  ink,                   by the well-known
spurts out on the band of paper, om, and thus               a  lino is recorded in    a
series of dots and without friction.            The new arrangement gets rid
 of the mouse-mill.        The mechanism, oo" (electro-magnetic), which
 draws the paper forwards at the same time vibrates up and down
 through   a  very short distance,      and thus, in short intervals of time,
brings the paper against the minute drop of ink at the end of the
 syphon.     Thus the end of the syphon does not rub on the paper
 and there is practically no friction.           The tracing appears as         a  line
 formed of    a number of minute dots, the distances between which
 correspond to the rate of vibration of the apparatus.
    The apparatus is worked by          a storage    cell, p, of about     6-8  volts,
 and it runs at such       a speed   that 20 feet of paper are rolled out
 during   the time of one         revolution      of the phonograph.          Conse
 quently, on a length of 20 feet of paper we obtain                  a record of all
the vibrations     that     were   recorded on 71th inch of surface                  of

cylinder (the circumference of the cylinder), or in a period of half a
second.      One foot of paper would therefore represent j^th second,
and    1 inch would represent              of a second.
    The amplification vertically is nearly 1000 times, but in the direc
tion of length it is only about thirty-five times magnified.                To    obtain
the tracings so as to increase          the amplification in length to corre
spond to the amplification in height, that is to say, to 1000 time?,
it would    be necessary     either to drive the phonograph thirty-six              times
slower,    or a speed of one revolution in about five hours, or to roll
out the paper thirty-six          times   faster, or about       864   feet in eight
minutes instead of about 24 feet.           Manifestly, either of these         devices
would be very inconvenient, and it is unnecessary                     to attempt          to
carry them out,         as  for purposes      of analysis it does not           matter.
In    the description of       the curves      of phonographic records             taken
by Hermann, nothing is said in explanation of the fact that                             the
tracings are not amplifications             to   scale   of the     true marks           on
the phonograph cylinder.             I show     you here (1) a tracing of the
vibrations of       a bugle    taken by my apparatus, giving an amplifi
cation about 1000 times vertically and thirty-five times in                    a linear
direction, and (2) a tracing of a few of these curves                         enlarged
longitudinally so as to have the vertical and longitudinal                  amplifica
tions equal     — about    1000 times.       It will   be observed      how     the im
 pressions     are   long    shallow   depressions,       very    shallow     at first,
 gradually becoming deeper towards the centre, and again                     becoming
 shallow     towards      the   other end.       In this     aspect    they     exactly
 resemble the grooves seen in photographs taken of portions of                         the
 surface of the wax cylinder.
     One   of the chief difficulties in earlier experiments with                      this
 instrument was to secure that the point of the first lever                      always
 was in contact       with  the horizontal portion of the short arm of                 the
 second lever, and that, on the other hand, the pressure was not                       too
 great.    If    the mechanism bo considered,            it will  bo apparent        that,
 supposing      the groove on the wax cylinder            to deepen,     as would        be
 the case    if  the sound recorded became           more   intense,    the whole        of
 the aluminium lover would fall and its point would press too heavily
 on the arm of tho second lever.              On the other hand,          suppose the
  groove to boeonie shallow, as happens when the sound is less                 intense,
 the aluminium          lever would rise,        and,   as  it is rigid,     its   point

first case, when the pressure was too great, the curves recorded on
the paper would               he less     in height than they ought                           to be, and,   if
the point of the lever came off the                          horizontal arm of tho second
lever, or touched it with                 a series      of knocks, either no curves at all
were obtained or the curves were                           not transcripts of the marks on
the cylinder.
    I    endeavoured to meet this difficulty                          by turning the screw                  </,
on plate, which raises               or depresses the arm, bearing,                           in the usual
phonographic               arrangement, the reproducing diaphragm, or, as in
my instrument,               the aluminium lever.                  Still       it   was difficult      to do
this accurately.              At last      tho difficulty          was got over                by an auto
matic device.              On the top of the screw for raising or elevating tho
aluminium             lever was fixed            a    round shallow drum,                     r,   80 m. in
diameter,        and covered, on its outer surface, with sand-paper                                    so as
to be        rough.        Then the cord passing                 from the electro-motor to tho
phonograph,            for    driving      slowly          the    mandrill           bearing the           wax
cylinder,                     brought round                            .<••,   and then transversely
                cIV, was                               a    pulley,
in front of the side of the roughened drum, r.                                            The cord then
passed        round another pulley,              t,   attached to the keeper of an electro
magnet, marked               v   in the    plate, and then back to another pulley,
passing transversely                to the roughened drum and parallel to the
first cord.           It    then passed          round      a    second        pulley, marked          v    on
plate, then round the pulley on the phonograph, and back to the
electro-motor.              "When    the electro-motor worked, the cord moved
slowly in front of the roughened drum and one portion moved in
one      direction while the other moved in the reverse                                    direction.       If
the      lower cord,       f,   touched    the roughened drum,                      it   would     be moved,
carrying        the screw with             it,   in the direction say of tho hands of
a   watch, but        if   the upper cord, tu, touched the side of the roughened
drum,        then the direction of the rotation of the screw would be in
the opposite          direction.        It will        be evident that the one movement
 would lower the aluminium lever while the other would raise it.
        In   the next place, to make the apparatus work                                  automatically,      a
 slender      platinum wire, w, was attached to the aluminium lever, about
 15     mm. from its point.             This     was caused to dip into                   a   little trough,

magnet      is   not acting, the keeper                 is   free, the lower cord touches the
roughened drum, and the latter moves in                                        a   given direction.           If,
however, the magnet acts, the keeper bearing the pulley                                             is   pulled
to one side so as to bring the upper cord against the roughened
drum, and the latter moves in the opposite direction.                                               Thus      the
movement of the screw by which the aluminium                                               lever     may        be

again by         the electro-magnet                    and     the        two cords.           Finally,       the
electro-magnet              is   brought        into action when the platinum wire on
the aluminium lever dips into the mercury.                                      This diverts        a    portion
of the current that drives the paper feeder into the                                       electro-magnet,

                                    The Curves.
     Since the apparatus       was brought to its present        condition,     I  have
been able to record the vibrations of the tones of several                      instru
ments and also the tones of the human voice both in singing and
in speech, but there has not yet been leisure for a careful scrutiny
of the records, and I shall therefore, on the present occasion, offer a
few general remarks.
     First, witli reference      to speech,   I  wisli to point out that when
 the record of a word is examined it is found to consist                   of   a  long
 series of waves, the number of which depends                 (1) on the pitch of
 the vowel constituents in the word, and (2) on the duration of the
  whole word or of its syllables individually.              There is not for each
  word    a definite   wave    form, but    a vast    series of waves, and, even
  although      the greatest care be taken,     it is impossible to obtain two
  records      for the same word        precisely the same in character.              A
  word    is  built up of   a succession   of sounds, all usually of        a  musical
  character.       Each of these sounds, if taken          individually,     is repre
  sented on the phonograph record by a greater                 or less number of
  waves or vibrations, according to the pitch of the sound                     and its
  duration.       The pitch, of course, will depend            on  the number of
   vibrations per second, or per hundredth of              a second,  according to
   the standard we take, but the number of the waves counted depends
   on the duration      of the sound.        As it  is almost   impossible     to utter
   the same sound twice over in exactly the same fraction of a second,
   or in the same interval of time, the number of waves counted                   varies
    much   in different   records.    The rate per unit of time determines
   the pitch,     the number tho duration          of the sound.       In     a word,
    these successive   sounds blend into each other, and, in many records,
    the passage from one pitch to another can be distinctly seen.                   The
    speech    sounds   of  a   man   to the   ear not consciously engaged             in
    analysis,   appear  to vary in pitch from 100 to 150 vibrations per
    second, and the song sounds of a man             from 80 to 400 vibrations
    per second.      The sounds that build up        a  word are chiefly those of
    the vowels.      These give    a series of waves, representing       a   variation
    in pitch according to tho character of the vowel sound.                 As in    the

It is    also very difficult to notice where one series of waves                                            ends
and where another hegins.     For example, in the word Con-dan-
ti-nople, the predominant sounds are those of o—a-i-o-ill, and the
variation in pitch is observable to the ear                               if,   in speaking the word,
we allow the sound of the syllables to be prolonged.                                          If we      look    at
the record of the word, we find these                               variations in pitch indicated
by the rate of the waves, or,                        as the eye may catch this more easily,
by the greater or less length of wave according to the pitch of the
sound.        The consonantal sounds of the word                                are breaks, as        it    were,
in the stream of air issuing from the oral cavity, and                                         these breaks,
owing to labial, dental, buccal, or glossal vibrations, produce sounds
that have also often the musical character of vowels.                                           Thus      at   the
beginning          of "Constantinople"                       we have, as will be observed                       on
pronouncing the syllable very slowly, the sound iikko.                                             This sound
is   represented in the record by                            a   series    of waves.           Then follow
the waves of the vowel                    o.        Next we have the sound nn (driving
the air through the nose), also represented by                                     a     series     of    waves.
Next the hissing sound                    iss,      which has first something in                     it   of the
vowel     e   or   i,   and then the                ss-s.     This sound          also    is    shown by         a
series    of waves.            Then there              is    ta, which has         a     double series of
waves, (1) those for               it,   or    t,   and the next for a.                  This      passes      into
the prolonged vowel                  6,       this into nn, this followed                     by   ti    passing
into the vowel            I,   then another nn, then                       a    long     o,   then a sound
like    opp, and lastly the sound                     ill,   a   sort of double vowel sound.                    As
so many        of these sounds have the characters of vowels,                                        it    is   im
possible by an inspection                       of the record to say where one set of
waves begins and another ends.                               There are no breaks corresponding
to the consonants              ;    the vibrations                of the consonants glide on as
smoothly as those of the vowels.                                 The number of waves producing
                                                                   "               " there

were all counted.                  This brief illustration gives                   one an insight              into
nature's method of producing                            speech      sounds, and          it    shows clearly
that we can never hope to read such records in the sense of identi
fying the curve by an inspection of the vibrations.                                                The     details
are too minute to be                of service to             us, and we must again                  fall      back

  on the power          the ear possesses of identifying the sounds, and on
 the use    of conventional             signs or symbols, such as letters of the
 alphabet, vowel           symbols, consonant          symbols, or the symbols of
  Chinese,    which         are      monosyllabic     roots    often    meaning    very
 different things according to the inflection                  of  tone, the variations
 in pitch being used in that language to convey shades of meaning.
     "When   human voice sounds are produced in singing, especially
 when an open vowel sound is sung on                    a  note of definite pitch, the
 record is much more easily understood.                    Then we have the waves
 following each other with great regularity, and the pitch can easily
 be   made   out.        Still,    as has been     well pointed out by Dr R.          J.
 Lloyd of Liverpool,            a   gentleman who has devoted much time and
 learning to this subject,*             it is impossible by     a visual inspection of
 the vowel curve to recognise its elements.                   Thus two curves, very
 similar, possibly identical            to the eye, may give different sounds to
 the ear, that is to say, the ear, or ear and                   brain together, have
 analytic powers of the finest delicacy.                  No doubt, by the applica
 tion of the Fourierian analysis, we may split up the periodic wave
into a fundamental              of the same period and          a series   of waves of
varying intensity           vibrating       2, 3, 4, 5,  &c, times faster than the
fundamental,         and     the relative amplitude          of each     of these may
also    be  determined.              If   all  these  waves      of given amplitude
and     given     phase        acted      simultaneously      on    a  given   particle,
the particle      would       describe the original curve.            Dr Lloyd, how
ever,    is  of    opinion         that   even a Fourierian analysis          may not
exhaust the contents of a vowel, as it does not take account of
inharmonic        constituents          which may possibly exist.           Hermann    t
and Pipping        J    have also been investigating the analysis of vowel
tones,    and    their      investigations       have revealed       many difficulties.

Hermann experimented           with the ordinary           phonograph,      and ob
tained photographs of the movements of the vibrating glass                     plate.
His curves     are small, not       unlike those      seen    in Koenig's       flame
pictures, and they do not seem to me to represent so accurately                     the
marks on the wax cylinder             as those    obtained by my apparatus.
In   many cases they have sharp points.                 This, however, may not
interfere with analysis.       Pipping's curves were not obtained from
the phonograph but from the vibrations of a minute membrane
made to represent the drum head of the ear.                     His curves show
large periodic waves with minute waves on their summits, and they
suggest    that the large waves may be vibrations               due to the mem
brane itself.     Not having   seen the apparatus, and as the observations
have been made        by one well aware of the possibility of this error,
I do not    venture to do more than suggest            this difficulty,   especially
as  I now show you a series of tracings on a glass plate very similar
to those in Pipping's figures.           These were obtained by singing               a
vowel into a receiver furnished           with   a small membrane to          which
a recorder was attached.         The     glass plate (smoked) moved          rapidly
across   in front of the marker.            Alongside     of  these  you    will    see
curves obtained directly        from     the recorder attached to the glass
disk of a phonograph.           In    the tracings      of another experiment,
you see waves more like those of Hermann.                      The larger      waves
in the tracing      like that of Pipping,          are,   I  believe, due in my
experiment      to the vibrator         and   do    not    represent    the glottal
vibrations.     This conclusion is strengthened by noting the pitch
of the sound, as made out by counting                   not the larger but the
smaller waves, which corresponds to that of the sound given to
 the membrane.        I therefore    think that argument should            be based
 only on records obtained          from the      phonograph       itself,  which is
 furnished   with    a vibrator     that   will not record its own          periodic
 vibrations   unless the sound be remarkably intense.                 In   ordinary
 voice   production,    and   in ordinary       singing,    the  vibrator     of   the
 phonograph     faithfully recurds only the pressures falling upon                it-
 no more and no less.
    Having made      so large a demand on        your patience,     I shall  not say
 more at present on the curves obtained from musical instruments.
    And now      I declare   the session     1896-97      to be opened.       I hope

only for a knowledge of facts but for a knowledge of causes, which,
paradoxically,          is at once one of the most satisfying and the most
unsatisfying        of all human feelings.          Having reached         one explana

   Postscript.      — With reference to the statement              on p.   1   93 regarding
the deaf,     Dr M'Kendrick           read a communication            he had received
from     Dr James Kerr Love, Glasgow, regarding the results of an
experiment with four deaf-mutes, two hoys and two girls, made in
thePhysiological Laboratory of the University of Glasgow, on 5th
December.   The children came from the Deaf and Dumb Institu
tion of Glasgow,                                Dr Love, who
                            and they were accompanied by
takes   great interest in deaf mutes, and by Mr Welch and Mr
          a
Haycock, both masters in the institution.   Dr M'Kendrick car
ried out the experiment.              One girl, aged     1   7,   who has been quite
deaf since she was 11 years               of    age, said that       the sensation she
felt when         the     fingers were immersed         in the salt solution              was
music,      and     that the feeling      recalled something to her memory.
She had accurate perception of the rhythm of the music played by
the phonograph.   The other three also experienced rhythm, and
nodded their heads in time to the music.  young lady, deaf from
                                                         A
her birth, examined by              Dr M'Kendrick        on 4th December, wrote
that she had        a    sensation like the purring of    a   cat,   with the " purrs "
long and short, and strong and weak.                  She also compared            it   to the

     The subject of the production within Diatoms of spores, endo-
cysts,      &c,   has   been   worked at by several observers,            principally
 Castracane      * in  recent years, and before him O'Meara           t  and Kaben-
horst.J        Some of these        observers  have     noted ciliated, spore-like
 bodies,     probably     parasitic   or casual    intrusive   organisms     ; others,
 notably Castracane, have recorded oval and other cysts which have
 not been figured and the characters of which are difficult to realise.
 Miquel§       has made      an experimental       examination     of the subject
 without being able to confirm Castracane's results.                    Castracane     ||
 has also recorded the presence,          as he  thinks, of " gonids      or embryo
 nal forms" within a fossil Diatom                 (Coxcinod 'incus punctatus)       in
 a marine       deposit of miocene       age.    During March of this year             I
 tow-netted       near the Bell Rock        a large quantity of Cosrinoilixrun
 concinnus      — with     many     dead   valves     separated    at    the    girdle.
 These frequently         contained not only other and smaller individuals
 of the same species, but other species of diatoms and casual objects
 as well, and the observation makes               one cautious about        accepting
 evidence of the        character brought forward by Castracane as to his
  fossil form.

becomes          a gonidium or sporangium, consisting                         of    a    cell with two
rounded ends, and a connecting                             hoop, one end being smaller than
the other                             I may mention          here that these sporangia               (if   one
may call them                    so)    of Bacteriastrum and Cluetoceros                       are very
variable in form and size, and, from having been found in                                  a   free state
in deposit or guano, have been very often mistaken for distinct
species         of diatoms by many observers."                           Again he says (p.                76),
after describing                 the ordinary           division    in   Clwetoceros,      "The           con
densed endochrome,                       instead      of     becoming      paler        and    dividing,
gradually            assumes         another      shape,     varying with          the    species,        and
secretes        a   siliceous envelope                          The contents of the        sporangium
soon escape, but                I      have not been able to follow out the further
processes           they undergo towards the reproduction of                         a    Cluetocerot."
     Castracane, in                  describing    the       "Challenger"         diatoms, found             a
form known as Dicladia                         capreolus within the frustules of                      CA<e-
toceros,        and        Mr Thomas Comber* has quite recently                               described
the        endocysts            of     Thalassiosira         antarctica.       It    appears to             be
established that in these genera there occurs                            a   kind of dimorphism,
possibly an alternation                    of forms hitherto believed                    to belong          to
different genera.
  Finally, Professor Clevet has figured, in his Diatoms    the                                      of
Arctic Sea, one Biddvlphia aurita within another. He observes
respecting          it :
                            " In      one specimen from            Greenland      I   have observed
a    sporangial frustule.                The large exterior cell measured                  0*066 mm.
in height, and              0*044 mm. in breadth, and the included cell was about
half the        size of the exterior,          which       it   resembled in all its characters."
In       the figure, however, the spines of the parent form are not shown
on the offspring.               I      have repeated one of Professor Cleve's                       figures
(Plate      I.      fig.    1)   on account         of the interest          it   adds to my          own
observations.
     Many           species      of diatoms        have been          recorded with "internal
        "
valves          as they are called,               and   it   is   generally supposed that             they
represent resting stages — or                     a     provision against         drying up —corre
sponding to           a     thickening of the membrane in ordinary cells.                            This,

however,       is a different condition from the                            one described above,
though it has an interest in connection with it.
     For several years           Dr John Murray                    has urged me to investigate
the pelagic Algae, and                in March of this year                 I    gratefully accepted
his invitation to make a study of the marine diatoms on behalf of
the Fishery         Board for Scotland, and my special thanks are due to
the Board           and    to    Dr Wemyss Fulton,                        the    Superintendent           of
Scientific Investigations,                  for    the facilities         freely accorded           me for
the prosecution of this research.                             I   spent    a    fortnight        in March
and April       and        three       weeks         in August            on the         fishery cruiser
" Garland,"                        in this work principally                     on the west coast of
                    engaged
Scotland.       The ordinary method of capture by means of fine silk
tow-nets was         employed, but                 Dr Murray's ingenuity furnished                       me
with another resource                  for employment in rough weather,                                when
tow-netting is impossible or at least attended                                      with risk         to tho
nets;      and the conditions                 of sea climate for part of last March
and    April   made me mindful of his foresight.                                This instrument was
 a   fine silk bag, shaped somewhat                     like      a large German sausage, to be
 fastened over the nozzle of the                        hose used          for washing the decks.
 The bag had a small lateral overflow vent about                                        tho size of a six
 pence (which      it is well to strengthen with an extra thickness of
 silk and a     " buttonhole stitch "), and it is useful in rough weather
 or after dark.           If    the donkey-engine is made to pump through it
 gently for     half an hour, under                    most       circumstances          a good       haul is
 obtained.          The   nozzle       and bag should be fastened                         to a stanchion
 or boat davit above the level of the bulwark, where                                      it   is safe from
 injury by the           sea.     While describing                  methods,        I    may record the
 entire success of the fixing                      and preservative fluid employed, tho
 precise    strength of which was exactly forecasted by my colleague,
 Mr V. H. Blackman.                   I carried a       number of strong tubes half filled
 with 0"5 per cent, aqueous solution of chromic acid.                                         This is about
 the same       density         as ordinary            sea-water, and           I   simply added          my
 captures      in    sea-water         to    it,   filling up       the tube.            If    this be done
 with care the cell-contents are fixed and maintain                                      the appearance
 they possessed before death.                        During        the autumn       I     spoiled several
 tubes   by adding too dense                 a     mass of diatoms,            displacing the propor
 tion of sea-water,             and   it    sufficed    to ruin the condition                   of tho cell-
 contents      in   these cases.            The process must therefore be carried out

 with    care,   and     I    warn collectors against             removing spoonfuls            of
 diatoms direct from the tow-net to the tube.                         It  is better to     float
 the whole capture in           a glass     jar, to permit the whole to settle                 for
 an hour or so,         and then to collect from the bottom by means of                           a
 dipping tube.         This method gives, without                  special calculation,       the
 right proportions of diatoms and                  sea-  water to be added to the          half-
 filled tube of chromic acid solution.                    "With such an outfit of         tubes
 secured in a rack-work box, and by clamping the microscope                              down
 to   a bench,   it  is possible       to continue work with all powers                but   the
 immersion lenses even in moderately bad weather.                           The  use of such
 high objectives       as are      now commonly immersed                is too fatiguing        to
 the eyes while the body is swaying in different time to the                            vessel,
from the difficulty of closely accommodating the eye to the                             ocular
for specially minute study requiring an uninterrupted                              stare   into
 the field.
     During     the first months of the year,                  as   Dr John Murray          has
recorded,      there    is   in all our       seas an extraordinary           prevalence        of
 diatom life, and        I  found this to be specially true of the west                   coast
 and Clyde sea area,              ft  is only necessary         to put down the net           for
a   few minutes to obtain at this season                      a dense      mass of diatoms
which nearly half fills the net with                  a yellow-brown scum of          the con
sistency    of soft soap.            Sir Joseph Hooker              (on   Sir James     Ross's
 Antarctic      Expedition)         and     the    naturalists of the "Challenger"
Expedition       have      made       us familiar       with the extraordinary           abun
dance of diatoms in the                 Southern Ocean.            South of latitude        50'

heating over      a stove,      when      a  whitish     felt-like mass was       obtained.'1
It   is not necessary to visit the Southern Ocean to see this impressive
manifestation of diatom life in the                 sea.    I  dried similar    masses over
the boilers of the
                           " Garland " in         the Clyde sea area last April,           and
the prevalent form was in all cases Skeletonema                            costatum with       a
slight mixture of Coseinodiscus                 concinnus,      Cluetoceros    borealis,   ami
other forms.           This      vast     occurrence of          diatoms is a        seasonal
phenomenon,         and they become scarcer in summer (except                       here and
there in particular           shoals),    and    are largely replaced          by  species   of
Ceratium — notably             C.    Tripos,     C. fuscum,         and    C.  Fusus.      For
example,     the prevalent           Skeletonema         of April had disappeared            in

summer, so far as my observations went, from the west coast except
in two places, viz., off Sheep Island near Oban, where it occurred
sparingly, and in Loch Etive, where it occurred in almost as great
abundance as in the Clyde in spring.              I could find   no local tempera
ture conditions to account for this — the only outstanding physical
point of resemblance was the large quantity of fresh water on the
surface of the Clyde in spring                and   in Loch Etive in August.
Only in Loch Etive and in the Sound of Mull did                     I  obtain hauls
of diatoms in summer that were comparable in quantity with those
obtained generally in the sea in spring.                This  seasonal occurrence
 may be connected,        I venture to think, with another observation of
 economic interest.         I   discovered     that   the Copepoda       and   other
 minute       Crustacea   were     living on the diatoms, both by direct
 observation       and by     examining      their   cylindrical lumps of        ex
 crement,      which consisted entirely of diatom chromatophores (main
 taining perfectly their characteristic shapes and even partly their
 hue)     and    of minute     fragments      of  the siliceous frustules — both
 chromatophores and fragments of frustules being determinable as
 those of the diatoms        in the    same haul.      I searched   daily for three
 weeks      in summer for similar evidence of their eating Ceratium,
 but in vain.        This negative evidence, however, is not of much
  value, since    the Peridiniae, from their structure, would be less likely
  to leave traces after passage          through    the digestive tract.      Every
  diatomist knows of the abundance of diatoms               in the guano deposits
  of sea birds that presumably            devoured fishes that in turn live on
  small Crustacea.       Moreover,       diatoms are frequently       found in the
  stomachs       of  Holothurise,       Ascidians,    Salpse ;  oysters, scallops,
  whelks,      and   other    molluscs;      crab,   lobster,   and     other  large
  Crustacea,    and even in those of full grown fishes.             We have     been
   able in the past to infer that diatoms and other pelagic algse formed
   the basis   of the nutrition of all sea animals, — the pastures of the
   sea, — and   I count myself fortunate to have been able to establish by
   direct observation this important           link — that the small      Crustacea,
   which themselves      are so important a food of fishes, feed directly on
   diatoms.
      In order to determine whether diatoms             are present to any extent
   in the digestive tract        of young fishes,      either from     having   been
    eaten  directly by them or inside         small Crustacea eaten by the fish,

DrWemyss Fulton          sent me some young sand-eels,           taken in tow -net,
15 miles off Aberdeen on 16th            May 1894, and preserved in spirit,
some young flat fish (plaice?) taken             off Montrose      21st May 1894,
and some very small Clupeoid            fishes taken 30th March 1889.             In
all of them diatoms were present.                In   the sand-eels four genera,
Skeletonema,     Eucampia, Mdosira, and              CJuetoceros ;  in the flat fish
Skeletonema       and    Nitzschia (in both cases Skeletonema being
predominant), and in the Clupeoids Coscinodiscus (abundant) and
Melosira.      All these were complete valves, which appears to
indicate that they were eaten directly by the fish, and not within
 minute Crustacea,       in which     case they would          have   been   broken
up into fragments.
    The    seasonal    occurrence of      diatoms has, however, its          special
 botanical    interest.    The    ordinary      processes     of reproduction     by
 simple division and the more rare formation of auxospores does not
 appear from my opening            citation     of literature     to have satisfied
 observers.     Observations, accurate or not, of other forms of repro
 duction have been in the air,         if the expression may be permitted,
 for some years,      and Dr John Murray has, with rare divination,
 always     associated    this  seasonal     occurrence with        some    mode of
 reproduction yet to be disclosed.            At his instigation, then,      I have
 made the following observations, and since the modes of reproduction
 are of diverse sorts,      though all broadly the same,             I will proceed
 from the simplest case to the others.
     In  a tow-net    haul obtained        last   April off Gigha there was a
 large quantity of Biddvlphia mobiliensis.                Many of the specimens
 were in the state      represented in Plate I. fig. 2 ; the whole of the
 cell-contents rounded off and in many cases with a large oil drop
 enclosed by the chromatophores, nucleus, &c.                   The   same was   the
 case   with Ditylum Brightwdlii, and an extreme form of contraction
 of contents in this species is figured on the same plate (fig. 6).                It
  was only on a subsequent and more detailed examination of                     this
  and other captures that the state represented on fig. 3 was                    dis

  " cyst " with a slightly silicified wall, but without the characteristic
  spines,   &c, of the parent form.                I   take   this   "cyst" of B.
  mobiliensis to correspond to the form described by Professor Clcve

These bodies interested me much at the time, ignorant                                             as      I   then
was of any observations                      of the occurrence              of endocysts in diatoms,
and I took the process                   (as indeed         it    is)   to be    a   form of rejuvenes
cence of the diatom cell.                     I      have    fortunately been able to throw
some light on their subsequent                            history.          In August       I     found the
same     bodies             extremely plentiful             on     the west          coast, outside             the
Clyde        sea area, from the Sound of                         Islay      to Loch        Hourn.             They
¦were    mostly         a     good deal longer (fig.             4)    and frequently in          a    state of
division          (fig.       5).     They     exactly           resembled         in every botanical
character the young "cysts" of spring, and there was at the same
time     an        almost           entire    absence       of        the    characteristic form                   of
Biddidphia mobiliensis.                       It   appears, then, that these reproductive
bodies possess the power of dividing and multiplying                                             to    a      great
extent before                 they assume the characteristic parent form of B.
mobiliensis.                From their abundance             I         should not         be    surprised to
hear that they have been described under                                    a   separate specific name.
     [Note.
            — During                 the first week of December the characteristic
form of Biddidphia mobiliensis was abundant on the west coast,
and the young forms observed                             in August were not to bo found.
Presumably they had developed                              in the meantime into the mature
forms. — 10th December 1896.]
   On the same plate (fig.    there                7)             is    represented        a    specimen           of
Coscinodiscus                 concinnus       with       another inside            it.    At lirst    I       took
this (and others of the kind) to be merely accidental intrusions —
the more readily that      had observed I  large number of such         a
intrusions in             a   rich haul of Coscinodiscus                 near the Bell Rock.
     After turning the                  specimen         over     and over many times,                I       was,
however, forced to the conclusion that there was here                                                 a   young
 Coscinodiscus              veritably within another.                   I       subsequently met with
many such, especially                   in Loch Fyne in spring, and                       I    naturally put
it   down,        as   in Biddidphia, to             a   rejuvenescence           of the cell.         Among
many such examples                   I    found the form figured on Plate                       II.   figs.    1,   a
and     1,   b.        It   puzzled me greatly to account                       for it.    We     have here
within the parent form two young diatoms at first sight singularly

214          Proceedings      of Royal Society of Edinburgh.                 [s
unlike   each   other.     Here, again, it was only after many turnings
over of the specimen that        I was able to convince     myself (especially
after seeing it as in    1, 6) that these two forms were actually          within
the intact parent frustule.        The larger of the two young ones has
a   very   wide    girdle-zone,    and is apparently distended in this
direction   to the utmost capacity of the girdle, giving it a drum-
shape.     The other, which in both figures presents the girdle-view
(having moved        within the parent), shows         a girdle indeed        of   a
scarcely perceptible       breadth, and apparently       so   tightly shut up
that the rounded ends of the diatom practically meet each other
at the girdle, and the figure of the whole is oval rather than drum-
shaped with convex ends.            Both have numerous chromatophores,
of the usual shape in Coscinodiscus concinnus, but arranged in stars.
This   specimen, however, interested mo particularly,         as showing      that
                   so-called " cyst could
more than one
                                      "        be produced at a time, — that
it  was not always a simple rejuvenescence        of the whole cell-contents,
that the protoplasm, in short, sometimes divided              before the pro
duction of these bodies.
    While occupied with the study of          these  forms last April,      I wa3
much struck by the abundance in the Clyde sea area, and especially
in Loch Fyne, of minute Coscinodisci presenting the characters of
 C. concinnus.      They occurred singly, but for the greater part in
small packets of eight and           of sixteen (Plate    II.  figs.  4 and      5).
Other numbers occurred, e.g., four, but the prevalent number was
eight, and less frequently         sixteen.   I  could  not    help observing
that, when there were sixteen, the individuals were approximately
half the   size  of those   in packets of eight, and it was the like          case
with those in the packets of eight and of four             (see   Plate   II.  figs.
 4 and 5).      They were held together in all cases by            a  fine mem
 brane represented in the figures.        The valve-view was very slightly
 convex, not nearly so much so as the parent frustule in fig.          1, b,  more
 like that of   fig. 2, b, but even less so, and in the packets of eight
 the young diatoms, though larger, were considerably thinner (girdle-
 view) than those of the packets of sixteen.           The instances in figs.
 4 and 5 are perhaps extreme — but there was considerable variety in
 the respects mentioned, and yet the packets were all unmistakably
 of like origin.
    While the source of      these packets remained a mystery,         I took, on

1S96-9".]             Mr    George     Murray       on   Marine Diatoms.                215
the 6th of April, a haul of the tow-nets simultaneously at the surface,
five, twenty-five, and fifty fathoms in the deep water of Loch Fyno
between          the Otter and Tarbert.               This haul was remarkable,          not
only for the large number of Coscinodisci it yielded with one each
inside, but the individuals from the surface and five fathoms very
frequently had their contents divided into eight and sixteen
rounded-off portions,             as  in figs.   2, a, b, and     3.    Mixed with these
weTe a large number of packets of young Coscinodisci and largo
 empty       f rustules.      Even down at twenty-five fathoms the number of
 packets was           almost    as great      as at the    surface     and five fathoms.
 "Where the cell-contents were divided into eight, the eight portions
 were each nearly twice the volume of those in the cells which had
 divided into         sixteen.      At  first  I  naturally jumped to the conclusion
  that the eight and sixteen rounded-off portions                       were   the outcome
 of free cell-formation, but a more minute study                        has convinced me
  that they are produced by successive divisions into two.                              The
  relative positions of the portions as shown in fig. 2, a, and                        even
  more strikingly in other instances                 I  have seen and photographed,
  point to this mode of formation.                     The association       of these with
   the packets, the correspondence                in size of the eights and sixteens
   respectively, the adequacy of these divided portions to the formation
   of the packets,       as  indicated by the undivided instance of Biddulphia
   mobUiensM,        the occurrence         of two young Coscinodisci within              a
   parent frustule, all lead irresistibly to our interpreting the divisions
   of the contents as preliminary to the formation of the packets.
       Granting this to        be the   explanation,      I next found myself in face
    of the difficulty     of accounting for the future progress of the young
    Coscinodisci.       Diatoms,       we     are   accustomed       to  be   told, go on
    decreasing     in size by the breadth of the girdle membrane                    at each
    succeeding ordinary division until a minimum size is reached, when
    the   formation of an auxospore re-establishes them at the maximum.
    This is true enough, but it is generally associated with the statement
    that,    owing    to    the rigid     silicified    nature    of their membranes,
     individual diatoms        are incapable of superficial growth.               I  am by
     no means sure      that this last statement has any greater value than
     a  likely assertion,     but   if it  be true,     how then would it fare with
     these small Coscinodisci,       launched into the world at what must surely
     be  their minimum size       ?    "Would they start       life with the formation

of auxospores       ?        Tliis remained          a   puzzle until when working over,
and verifying observations in London,                         it occurred to          me to test the
siliceous character of the membranes of                                 these   young packets of
Coscinodisci. Taking samples known to contain plenty of them
among other diatoms, and
                            " cleaning " them by burning and by
treatment with nitric acid and chlorate of potash, it was found in
every case that the packets totally                          disappeared, while the other
diatoms remained.                 The conclusion,             plainly warranted,            then     is,
that the individual membranes of the young packet Coscinodisci
are either not silicified             or are incompletely                 so, and that they are
therefore capable of superficial growth, however                                 it   may be   with
diatoms the walls of which are perfectly silicified.
    It   appears,   then, that these marine diatoms may reproduce them
selves, either by            a   rejuvenescence of the cell and the secretion of
a   new frustule within the parent (Biddulphia,                                 Coscinodiscus, and
possibly Ditylum), which, escaping on the separation of the parent
valves at the girdle, may grow, divide and multiply before                                     fully
attaining the characteristic external sculpturing and adornment                                      of
the parent (Biddulphia), or the number of the offspring may be
increased by preliminary                      divisions      of the protoplasm into             two,
four, eight, and sixteen (Coscinodiscus).
   Both last April and in August    observed in different species
                                                    I                                               of
Chaetoceros (in addition to the usual cell-division)                            a   series of succes
sive divisions within individual cells which are manifestly prelimi
nary to the formation                     of reproductive           bodies.      In the ordinary
multiplication          of   a   Chcetoceros, the cell of course divides transversely
to the axis of the chain of cells.                           InCli. constrictus (Plate             III.
fig. 3), when farther               subdivisions         of the coil-contents are destined
to take place, the first division                    is   parallel to the axis as shown             in
the upper cell.              In   the lower cell the second division, transverse                    to
the axis, has taken place.                    In   Ch. curvisetus (fig.          4)   the same thing
happens.          In both         cases   a   drop or cushion of oil separates the two
halves at the first division.                      The   second         division (transverse) cuts
right through the middle                       cell of fig.        4,    and parts the resulting
portions into two pairs, giving them the appearance                                   of having first
divided transversely, which however                          is   not the case in these species.
 In      Ch.   borealis (fig.        1)    the     first division         is    always    transverse.
 Though ordinarily all the cells of                      a   chain are approximately at the

same stage of development, not however so regularly in diatoms                        as
in the cells of a filamentous Alga, the remarkable chain represented
in fig. 1 shows three successive stages in three adjoining cells.
The uppermost cell has undergone the first (transverse) division.
In    the   second cell the contents         are divided into four portions, and
in the lowest cell        each of these is rounded off.       I  have witnessed the
processes of division up to four many times in the living Cluetoceros,
but never       the actual process of further subdivision.             In fig. 2 there
are represented two cells, one with eight, the other with sixteen
completely        rounded-off portions, and such variation of number                  in
adjoining cells is not uncommon.                As   said above,    I  never had the
 good fortune to witness the subdivisions into eight and sixteen in
 the living cells, and it was only on searching the preserved material
 in London that         instances     came to light.     In  Ch. eurvisetus (fig. 5)
 subdivisions        into   four and eight        are   shown also in adjoining
 cells.
     That    these spore-like cells of Cluetoceros are destined          to reproduce
 the parent form no one can doubt.                    But how?        Do   thoy    form
  CKaetoceros filaments by simple vegetative             growth, eaeli first secret
 ing a membrane,            siliceous   or not, like the     so-called    "cysts" of
  Biddttlphia — or like         the eight and sixteen subdivided and rounded-
  off portions of the Coscinodiscux            cell 1   In  the absence       of trust
  worthy      evidence      the    inevitable   comparison      with    Coscinodiseus
  appears     to furnish the most likely interpretation.
     That    five weeks' work at sea should have been rewarded with such
  unlooked for results         — results which     no one could have anticipated
  from   the known facts about diatoms — I explain by the fact that
  botanists      have     hitherto     confined   their   marine      studies    almost
  exclusively to shore plants.             The instances    of  a  botanist using       a
  tow-net are few indeed, and              I can only hope they         will  be more
  numerous in the           future.     The plant     plankton    of our coasts        is
  exceedingly rich in            minute Algae     other   than diatoms,        the life-
  histories    of which are imperfectly known.
      There is one object occasionally met with in the fine silk tow-net
   in autumn       in  the    lochs of Western        Scotland which        I   may bo
   permitted     to mention.        In  the Sound of Islay and again in Loch
   Hourn (though to a less extent) the adjoining hills were covered
    with heather in bloom, and            I  repeatedly captured quantities of

pollen-grains of this plant in the surface-net — objects which, among
unicellular marine Algsa, at first sight puzzled me not a little.
    In   order to attempt the settlement of various questions that have
arisen in the course of this investigation, and especially the tracing
of life-histories      by continuous observations,          I  have had two large
tanks prepared for the purpose of cultivating                marine diatoms,         with
the hope of overcoming the numerous difficulties that attend such
an experiment.
    Professor "Weiss, of the Owens College, Manchester, has informed
me in a letter that he has made observations                     similar   to some of
those recorded here.             On learning       that   I   was working at          the
subject, he generously refrained              from    competition      in priority of
publication.

courtesy and kindness of Captain                E. Campbell of the " Garland,"
it has    been necessary      to search microscopically         and to mount a vast

Whitting, and Mr Percy Highley, who have all aided me with
valuable suggestions and observations.                  I    must thank Professor

   (1) In the Cambridge Math. Journal,         p. 233, Sylvester                           ii.
 showed how to eliminate r, y, from the set of equations  z                                                        t

 His method              consisted          in deriving other three equations involving
 the variables x",               if,       z2,   yz, zx, xy, and then eliminating                                  these     six
 variables from the six equations.                                  The result obtained was

1896-97.]               Dr T. Muir              on Ternary Quadrics.                              221
raise the presumption that Sylvester had not hit upon the simplest
mode of performing                  the elimination.
  (2) Looking to the terms which do not contain x in the first
two equations, we see that by multiplying both sides of the first
equation by My +    and both sides of ;the second by az, we shall
                              Iz,
have, after subtraction, an equation consisting of terms all contain
ing    z,   and from which this factor may be removed.                               The result in
fact     is
          cMy2 + (bl        - am)*2 + (6M + - an)yz d            +     Alzx   +   AMxy   =   0
—    a   derived equation which                  is   already simpler than Sylvester's,
but which may be further simplified                           by using the second of the
original        equations to eliminate                the term containing              y2.     Doing
this we have
         (W
              - am)z2 + (bM - an)yz             +   (AZ
                                                          - em)zx    +   (AM      - en)xij = 0.
In   a   similar manner          it   may be shown that
          (nq   - mr)3?      +   (ME - lp)yz        +   (nE   - mp)zx      +   (Mq - lr)xy =      0

                                                                                                   ,
and       (pe   -   ra)y2   +   (Ec                 +            qb)zx     +                      0;
but, having obtained                 one equation, we may obtain                   the two others
of like kind by merely changing the letters in accordance with
the cycles
              T^             (T^                O               C"j                Kz_ih
this being the mode              in which any           one of the original set        is    obtained
from one of the remaining two.
  (3) Another mode of obtaining the equations of the preceding
paragraph may be noted in passing. It much simpler, although    is
less     likely to occur to          one at first.        Writing the first two equations
of   the original set         in the form
                                                              =

                             (ny     +   mz)x + (My       +   lz)y =   0j
and eliminating             dialytically we at          once obtain

    (10) The fact that the interchange
                             'am        r    b   n    p\
leaves the eliminant unaltered, gives us at once an alternative form
for (a), viz.,
                                               A             e          b

 (a) and (o') heing related to each other as (/?) and (/?') are.                 This
 does not occur, however, in the case of (y), becauso the like sub
 stitutions made there merely change rows of the determinant into
  columns.       The form (y) thus has an advantage over (a) and (/?) in
 that    it makes evident the symmetry which is known to exist.
      To prove that (a) and (o') are identical         is a good problem in the
  transformation of determinants.
                                        eliminant, with respect to the said
      (11) The symmetry of the
  interchange, can also be utilised in finding the final expansion of
  the eliminant ; because,       if any  one term of the expansion be got,
  another      can at once   be written     down by substitution,          unless,  of
   course, the term happens to be invariant           to the substitution.
      The existence of the cycles         may be made use of for the same
   purpose, as any term not symmetrical
                                                   with respect to the cyclical
   substitutions will in this way give rise to two others.
       Ordinarily,   therefore, one term when found suffices to determine
   five others, so that the terms may be arranged in sets of six.               Thus,
   if it be ascertained in any way that
                                     bnp.clq.A.p.l
   is a term    of the expansion,    we at once    conclude that it is only one
   of three, viz.,
             bnp.clq.A.p.l,         bnp.clqM.b.q    ,          bnp.clq.B,.n.c

                     is,however, another form of the eliminant which                       is
  of far greater    interest than any of the preceding. It not only bears
  on its face the peculiarities of structure which we know      ought              it
  to possess at least inherently, but      also— and mainly by reason
                                                   it   is
  of this much better suited for the calculation of the final ex
   pansion.

    (16)    A     consequence                of      this is that         if       the       determinant be

complementary minors, only two of the seven resulting expressions
require to be fully expanded in order to obtain the final develop

    The former        is        invariant         to all the substitutions                   ;   the latter by

On the so-called " Hypoiodite                   of Magnesium." By James

                               (Read   December 7, 1396.)
    The following investigation was undertaken in connection with
a  series of experiments on absorption at present being carried out
in this laboratory.
    In Gmelin's Handbook (Cavendish P'dition, vol.                     3,  p. 240)   it is
stated, on Gay-Lussac's authority, that magnesia,                   when shaken up
with a solution of iodine, absorbs the latter and assumes                     a reddish-
brown      colour.      The    production     of this    brown       " hypoiodite       of
                "
magnesium          is accompanied       by the formation of small quantities of
magnesium iodide and magnesium                iodate,   which pass into solution.
When the brown compound is boiled with water, magnesium                           iodide
and magnesia        are formed, and when         it is heated by itself, iodine is
 given   off and    magnesia     remains.
    The same compound is produced when magnesia is precipitated
in presence       of iodine, and its characteristic appearance                 makes    it
 an  excellent means of identifying            a magnesium         salt.    The test is
 described    as follows      in the Notes on Reactions of Salts, used in
 the  Practical Chemistry Class            in the University of Edinburgh.
 " When a solution of iodine in                             iodide is added         to   a
                                             potassium
 magnesium salt, and a few drops of caustic potash are added to tho
 mixture, a reddish-brown precipitate is produced                ;  excess of caustic
 potash   decolorises     the precipitate."
    The    state    of the magnesia       has apparently       little    effect  on tho
 production     of the brown          substance.     It  is   formed indifferently
 with freshly precipitated magnesia,           magnesia      dried at the ordinary
 temperature,      magnesia      dried at 100°, and magnesia              ignited over
 the  blow-pipe.       It  is true   that tho freshly     precipitated compound
 is more    active than any of the other forms,               the   difference     being
 possibly due to the loose flocculent nature of the precipitate, or
 perhaps    to its being tho hydroxide and not the oxide.                   The ignited
  oxide is least readily coloured by the iodine.

   The production of the brown substance                                seems       likewise        to        be
independent           of the          state   of the iodine.            Iodine in solution in
water, in aqueous potassium iodide, in alcohol,                                 in chloroform, or
in carbon disulphide at once unites with magnesia, staining                                        it    deep
brown.        The vapour of iodine,                  too,    is equally      effective.            If        two
watch-glasses, containing                     iodine and       magnesia         respectively,                are
placed      beneath an inverted                 glass    dish,     it will      be seen    that the
magnesia rapidly acquires a coffee-brown colour, especially                                             if   the
laboratory         temperature           is moderately           high.     The colour              is not
superficial, but penetrates uniformly into the interior of the powder.
Some other oxides (for example, calcium oxide), when exposed to
the vapour of iodine under the same conditions, acquire a super
ficial   brownish        tint, but this is by no means uniform even on
the surface, and differs greatly in appearance from the brown of
the magnesia.            Zinc oxide is stained slowly to                        a    dirty pink, the
colour on the surface differing                      somewhat from the colour                       in the
interior.         Pure white salts, such             as precipitated         calcium carbonate,
are quite unaffected.
   It    is perhaps worthy of note that the coloration                                at once takes
place when iodine and magnesia are simultaneously                                      produced               in
the same solution.                 If   to a solution of iodine in aqueous potassium
iodide potash is cautiously added until the iodine has completely
disappeared,           the    addition         of   a    small     quantity of magnesium
sulphate      will immediately produce                   a   chocolate-brown precipitate in
the pale yellow hypoiodite                      solution.      Expressed            in terms of the
electrolytic        dissociation theory the action which takes place is as
follows.          Hypoiodite ions can only exist in presence of iodide ions
when hydroxyl ions are also present in certain proportions                                     ;    if       the
hydroxyl ions are removed, the other ions react with water to re
produce hydroxyl ions, iodine being at the same time liberated.
There       is,   in fact,   a    balanced action expressible by the equation,
                             I„   +     20H'  £     I'   +   01'    +    H20   ,
and   if   this balance be disturbed by the removal of hydroxyl ions,
more hydroxyl ions will be produced, and their production must be
accompanied by the liberation                       of iodine.          Now the addition of                   »
magnesium            salt removes hydroxyl ions from the solution                                   in       the
hydroxide           which     is      precipitated,      and this hydroxide              is    at           once

coloured       by the iodine set free at the same time.            That this view
of the process is essentially correct may            be seen from the      following
experiment.         A  solution of hypoiodous         acid, made by agitating        a
pure aqueous solution of iodine with mercuric oxide and filtering,
is rapidly neutralised         with potash and        a magnesium salt added.
The precipitate         obtained    is white.        Addition   of   a   few    drops
of potassium iodide solution           will now stain the precipitate brown,
showing that the presence of iodide ions is essential to the action.
 The precipitate is also brown when                 the   hypoiodite     and iodide
 solutions are first mixed and then treated with magnesium sulphate.
      When the precipitate         obtained     from    an aqueous solution          is
 dried either at the ordinary temperature or at 100°,               it is very dark
 in appearance, being almost black,              whilst the   substance     prepared
 by colouring the magnesia with iodine in chloroform                    solution has
  approximately the colour of magnesia stained with iodine vapour.
  Regarding       the stability of the dried substances prepared by the
  various methods,        it may     be said    that they     all give off iodine
  vapour at the ordinary temperature.              The amount of iodine given
  off is undoubtedly        very small, but the presence         of iodine vapour
  may be made evident as follows.             The sample to be     tested is placed
  in    a closed space  alongside a small quantity of magnesia.               After   a
   little time the magnesia becomes          brown, the depth of tint varying
   considerably, however,        with different specimens.            This     process
    forms     a convenient    mode    of testing for the presence of iodine
    vapour, especially where the absence of moisture is essential.                 The
    material suspected to give off iodine is placed near a small quantity
    of magnesia on a white tile, both substances being then covered by
    a  watch-glass.    After 5-10 minutes the magnesia may             be examined,
    and    will then reveal the    presence    of even minute traces of iodine.
    The following       example     of   its application     may    be    mentioned.
    Magnesium iodide         as purchased      is of a brown colour.           It  was
    suspected     that this might be due to partial decomposition of the
    iodide   with formation both of       magnesia    and of iodine, which could
     then   unite to give the " hypoiodite."          A little of   the iodide was
     accordingly    brought into juxtaposition with magnesia,             when it at
     once   imparted a brown      colour to the latter, showing         that it gave
      off iodine vapour.     That our surmise        was  correct became       further
      evident on dissolving     the iodide in water.       The bulk of the solid

 dissolved, but minute brown flocks remained behind, and                       these
 were    proved    to   have   properties      identical      with   those   of the
 " hypoiodite."
    When         " hypoiodite "
            the                   precipitated from        aqueous solution was
 heated at gradually increasing         temperatures,       the   violet vapour     of
 iodine was first observed at 130°, but even at 230° the decomposi
 tion was by no moans rapid.             A quantity of         the substance     was
 introduced into one limb of      a glass tube        bent at right angles,       the
 tube being then exhausted and           sealed     otF.   The empty limb        was
 kept in cold water while the charged limb was heated in an oil-bath.
 After prolonged heating at       "230°,  very little iodine had condensed
 in the cool part of the tube,       although the violet vapour could              be
 distinctly seen.     In  the vapour of boiling         anthracene (about     350°)
 the iodine still came off very slowly, and even after many                   hours'
 heating the residue remained       almost as deeply coloured as            at first.
 A   quantitative experiment resulted            as   follows.     An   amount      of
 "hypoiodite," which when dissolved in                acid reacted    with  9'5   c.c.
of decinormal sodium thiosulphate, after twelve hours' heating                      in
 anthracene vapour required       1*65 c.c.   of the same solution to       destroy
 the iodine liberated on dissolving        the residue      in hydrochloric     acid.
Thus    17 per cent,  of the original quantity of iodine remained in              the
 magnesia,   the other portion having condensed              in the cool parts      of
 the tube.    At  a red heat iodine was given off rapidly and magnesia
 remained behind.
    Vapour-stained magnesia was still deeply coloured after               exposure
to a current of carbonic acid for several hours.
    Liquids in which iodine is soluble extract iodine from the
 " hypoiodite" only very slowly.          Thus a quantity of " hypoiodite
                                                                                     "
corresponding to 11"4 c.c. of decinormal thiosulphate was treated                  in
a  Soxhlet apparatus for twenty-four hours with carbon tetrachloride
(b.p. 75°).     At the end of that time the residue was dark brown
and required 6'Oc.c. of thiosulphate to destroy the iodine liberated
on acidification.      Accordingly,    less than half       the iodine had     been
removed    by the prolonged extraction.          A   specimen,    which had    been
prepared   in chloroform solution with igni led magnesia, was similarly
treated   with chloroform in    a  Soxhlet extractor.           After thirty hours
it was still coloured,   and still yielded      u.linc, although in very     small
quantity, when treated with       a  fresh   p  jrtion of the solvent.

    Water   does not dissolve out free iodine from the
                                                                      " hypoiodite "
either at the ordinary temperature or at the boiling-point.                      This is
probably     due   to  the   slight   solubility   of  iodine    in  water,     enough
magnesia being simultaneously dissolved to convert the iodine into
iodide and iodate.        The filtered aqueous solution at once gives free
iodine    on acidification.       A small quantity          of the     " hypoiodite "
left in water at the ordinary temperature becomes decolorised after
several    days, or disappears       entirely.     In boiling water it         loses its
colour in a few minutes.
     An  aqueous solution of potassium          iodide extracts iodine from the
"hypoiodite"        at the ordinary       temperature.        If  the    liquid is de
 canted off and the precipitate treated           with successive fresh portions
 of the iodide solution, iodine continues to be extracted in gradually
diminishing     quantity until the residue           is colourless.        In  the   last
extracts there is no free iodine, but iodine is liberated from them
 on acidification.

 compound     or not it was necessary for us to perform quantitative
 experiments,    as a study of the qualitative            behaviour of the body
 alone could lead       to no definite conclusions.            We wished in par
 ticular to determine      if the substance       were   not analogous       to the so-
 called iodide of starch, which has recently been shown by                       Kiistcr
  (Liebufs Annaltn,        1894,    283,  360) to bo no true         chemical com
  pound in the ordinary sense, but a substance of composition varying
  with the strength of the iodine solution used in its preparation.
      A preliminary set of experiments was made by shaking up
  magnesia with decinormal solution of iodine in aqueous potassium
  iodide for varying times,        in order to determine the              approximate
  amount    of iodine absorbed,         and that converted into iodide and
  iodate under these      conditions.      After slinking for        a   definite time
  the brown solid was filtered off, drained, and washed                 free from ad
  hering solution with a little water.           So long    as   calcined magnesia
   was employed,    no difficulty was experienced in filtering and washing
  the precipitate,   but when the magnesia was formed in the solution,
   as was the case   in  the   m  jority of    the later experiments, the pre
  cipitate was rather unmanageable.              A Gooch crucible with            a  fine

asbestos felt was        in   the end adopted as giving the most satisfactory
results in the filtration.             The filtrate      was titrated         with   sodium
thiosulphate solution equivalent in strength to the original                        solution
of iodine.        The quantity of thiosulphate required gave the                     amount
of free iodine         remaining in        the   solution.       The      liquid   was next
acidified in order to liberate the iodine contained in the                          solution
as iodate      and iodide, and again titrated.                 Lastly,      the  precipitate
was dissolved         in hydrochloric         acid,   with addition of            potassium
iodide to effect the solution of the liberated iodine, which                       was then
titrated with thiosulphate.
    With freshly calcined            magnesia     it was found          that the quantity
of iodine remaining in a given solution                      diminished        as the time
during which the solution was agitated increased.                             Thus 50      c.c.
of decinormal iodine solution, on being shaken with                      1  g. of magnesia,

    As    we thought that the          absorption might proceed more rapidly
and uniformly if precipitated magnesia were used instead of finely
divided calcined magnesia, a seminormal solution of caustic                               soda
was prepared,         and measured quantities of it were added to a slight
excess of magnesium               sulphate solution.        The magnesia           was thus
precipitated in a loose flocculent state and very rapidly                          absorbed
iodine, prolonged agitation increasing the amount absorbed,                           as the
following numbers show.                In the first    set the solution was filtered

    In this    as   in our other       tables   for aqueous solutions the numbers

 10 c.c.     of caustic        soda.     It  will    be noted        that the sum of the
 amounts of iodine remaining, absorbed,                     and transformed into iodide
and iodatc       falls somewhat short of the amount originally taken, the
difference being given in                the last      column.          Special experiments
 pointed to the         deficiency, which was always small, arising in the
titration of the dissolved precipitate                   ;  so   that its amount should
probably be added to the quantity absorbed.                             In  subsequent      tables
 this correction          has    been made,        so that in them            the
                                                                                     "  absorbed
         "
iodine       is really the original iodine minus the total quantity found
in the filtered solution before and after acidification.
    From the figures             given above it will be scon that the extent of
the chemical        action is considerable,          a  comparatively large proportion
 of the iodine being converted into iodide and iodate.                             In calculat'
ing the amount of iodine combined                      with the magnesia to form the
"hypoiodite,"         it   is therefore necessary          to subtract the proportion of
the original magnesia which has passed into solution on account                                  of
the chemical         transformation.           Thus, in the above example, of                   10
equivalents       of magnesia taken,           1*2   equivalents have been converted
into soluble        salts,    so that only 8'8          equivalents remain, and these
have absorbed          T42 equivalents of iodine. Ten equivalents of mag
nesia have       therefore absorbed TGI equivalents of iodine in the first
set, and 2'01        equivalents in the second.              In  the tables which follow,
this calculation has been performed, and we give                               the number of
equivalents        of iodine absorbed            by    10   equivalents of magnesia, or

      Here it is evident that both the iodine which is chemically                           trans
  formed and the iodine which is absorbed,                   fall off with         the amount
  of iodine originally            present,    but in no      case     is the iodine wholly
  destroyed     as such ;     and although the iodine in the magnesia                      of the
  first experiment is greater              in amount than the iodine originally
 taken in the fourth experiment, yet in the latter                         case  some of the
 iodine remains unabsorbed.                It  would appear, therefore,            from     a con
 sideration of these numbers,                that there is an equilibrium between
 the iodine remaining            in  the solution and the iodine absorbed by the
 magnesia,      in accordance          with the results of          the extraction experi

     Tin; only difference between the following                         set of experiments
 and the foregoing is that the magnesia,                 instead of being precipitated
 before     the addition         of the iodine, was precipitated in presence                     of
 the    iodine.      It   was hoped          that in     this way          the  magnesia         in
 process      of formation from magnesium                  sulphate and caustic               soda
 would at once saturate itself with iodine                 ;  and also that the amount
 of iodine chemically transformed would be reduced.                             The solution
 was     in   each  case     filtered one minute after the addition                       of the

Our expectations were to some extent fulfilled,                           as  the amount         of
iodine absorbed was in each               case greater     than in the former              series,
and the amount chemically transformed in each case less.                                 On    the
whole, however, the general aspect of the table remains unchanged.
An experiment in which                   the    filtration   was delayed for              fifteen

   One of      the simplest        means      of determining the nature of an

    It  is very evident from these tables that increase in the dilution
 of the reacting substances             greatly increases         the amount         of iodine
 chemically transformed.             The effect of dilution on the amount of
 iodine    absorbed       by the magnesia         is not so marked.              In    the first
 series there is an apparent              increase,    in the other series there is
 slight diminution.           If  the    iodine in the magnesia               is    estimated

directly and not by difference                    as   in the tables, the numbers for                     the
absorbed iodine become more nearly constant                               in the first       series, and
diminish somewhat                more rapidly in the others.                      On    the whole, it
may       be said      that for given             amounts      of iodine and magnesia,                    the
effect of varying quantities of water on the absorption is very slight.
If   the quantity of water and of magnesia                          is kept constant, and the
iodine is varied, there is              a   falling-off in the amount absorbed                         as the
total quantity              of iodine diminishes.                 This    is apparent            when        we
compare corresponding volumes                          in the different sets, and                 confirms
the results given               on the       preceding page.              An inspection                of the
numbers for all the series shows                         that there is no definite relation-
pi   lip between the final concentration of the iodine solution and                                          the
concentration of iodine in the magnesia.                             For    example,         in the        last
experiment of the first                .series,   the final concentration of the aqueous
solution is      12,       and the amount of absorbed                    iodine 3-04         ;    whilst        in
the first experiment of the next series, the much greater final                                           con
centration 35 corresponds                    to a smaller absorption, viz., 2"60.                        This
want of correspondence                   between         the concentrations of the iodine
in the water and in the magnesia                           renders        the results obtained                  in
aqueous        solutions useless for determining the nature of the                                     "hyp
iodite."        It   is,   however,      highly probable,           even from        a   consideration
of them alone, that the                 "hypoiodite"          is    not   a   real     chemical           com
pound partially decomposable                      by water into iodine and                       magnesia.
If   it   were so, wo should expect                    that within certain             limits the         con
centration of iodine in the water would remain the same, while                                               the
concentration in the magnesia varied (compare Walker and                                               Apple-

order to eliminate this source of error we made                               a   number          of   experi

      The      results       that     we      obtained       at     first were         very        singular,
when the substances                   employed were dried with ordinary                                precau

at    first   was    fairly rapid, but        soon     became      slower,     iodine dis
appearing       gradually from the solution day after day.                      In   a very
dilute solution all the iodine apparently passed into the magnesia,
the chloroform          being left absolutely colourless.              This pointed       to
no      true   equilibrium      existing      under      the    conditions      employed.
Again, a series of experiments in which                        the   ratio of iodine to
magnesia        was    constant, the        amount of chloroform              alone   being
varied, showed the remarkable result that more iodine disappeared
from       the   dilute than      from the       concentrated        solutions.       These
anomalies        were     evidently     due    to    some     chemical action         which
destroyed       the iodine, and        special    precautions were then adopted
for the removal of moisture from the reacting substances                            and the
vessels      which     contained     them.        It    was    found     that consistent
results were obtained          only when the magnesia employed                    had  been
freshly ignited and cooled in                a desiccator.        The chloroform was
carefully       dried    with    calcium chloride,           kept over sodium,          and
distilled from fresh slices of sodium immediately before                         use.   The
iodine from which the solutions were made                       had stood for at least
several days         over strong sulphuric acid in               a desiccator,     and the
 cylinders     employed were dried at 120° in an air oven.                        As much
 expedition      as possible, had to be used          in weighing off       the magnesia,
 otherwise      the   experiments failed.           It  was found impracticable to
 weigh off the magnesia and then                ignite it just before it was added
 to    the iodine      solution, for specimens           ignited under       as   nearly   as
 possible the same conditions gave very different results, so that no
 comparison        between     them was possible.             To preclude       any action
 of    light the cylinders         containing     the solutions were           wrapped in
 dark paper         throughout      the     absorption.        Even    when the above
 precautions        were    taken    to    ensure     the    absence      of   appreciable
 quantities      of moisture,      considerable       difficulty    was experienced         in
 obtaining      trustworthy       results.     Preliminary        experiments showed
 that after five        days the concentration of the iodine solution no
 longer       diminished       perceptibly,       and      that    continued       agitation
 appeared to have very little effect on the time necessary to saturate
 the magnesia.          The iodine in the chloroform solution was deter
 mined by shaking up a known                   volume with         a  known volume of
  tliiosulphate     solution and titrating         the excess of the latter           witli  a
 standard solution of iodine.

Here,       as  in the      case   of aqueous solutions, the concentration                         of
iodine       in magnesia         diminishes        with      the    concentration          of the
chloroform         solution, but less rapidly than the latter.                        The   actual
amount of iodine absorbed is much smaller than before, being                                       in
 the first      experiment        0-17 I2 in lOMgO, compared with                             about
 3-0 I2 in         lOMgO       from a corresponding aqueous solution.                           The
 hydroxide        is thus much more capable                   of absorbing iodine              than
the ignited oxide.
     A  set    of experiments in which the ratio of magnesia to                             iodine
 was kept constant, the amount of chloroform                           alone being         varied,
 was also made, with the following results                     : —

     Again the amount absorbed by the magnesia falls off                                    as the
 concentration of the solution diminishes,                       the decrease         being     very
 marked and comparable with the decrease                           when the total          volume
 remained constant and the amount of iodine was varied.                                          The
 second       set   of experiments cannot              be compared directly with                  the
 first, as it was necessary to reignite the magnesia.                                Other    series

was the same as that indicated in the tables                            given above.              In any
one set the          amount of iodine absorbed by the magnesia diminished
according         as the       final concentration              of the     chloroform            solution
diminished,          whether this diminution was due to                      a    smaller quantity
of iodine,        or a greater            volume of chloroform being                      taken.     The
phenomena are therefore                   much simpler than when aqueous iodine
is used, the absorption being there                       complicated by chemical action
occurring        to an equal or even greater extent.
     Taking into consideration both the qualitative and the quanti
tative experiments,               it    is apparent that wc are here                  dealing with         a
case    of absorption analogous                   to the absorption of                acids      by silk
(Walker and Appleyard, loc. cit.), and to the absorption of iodine
by starch to form the blue
                           " iodide of starch." The " hypoiodite "
shows no behaviour truly characteristic of a chemical compound,
unless the extraordinary                   tenacity with which the iodine clings to
the magnesia be accounted such.                         This, however, is not uncommon
in cases         of absorption.            It   is,   for instance,      a   matter of extreme
difficulty to remove from charcoal                       an acid which           it   has absorbed        ;
and platinum-black                 behaves      with regard        to some substances                in   a
precisely similar way.
    Kiister         cit.) found that the amount of iodine absorbed by
                 {loc.
starch       varied with the concentration of the iodine solution
employed,            though much less rapidly, and this we have found to
be the case with the absorption of iodine by magnesia. From his
observations Kiister concludes that the blue iodide of starch                                             is
neither      a   chemical compound nor                  a   mechanical           mixture of iodine
and     starch,        but   a   well-defined solution of iodine in starch.                               In
this conclusion he               is,   in our opinion, scarcely justified,

Abstract of Paper " On Intermediary Links between Man
         and the Lower Animals." By Robert Munro, M.A.,
        M.D.
                               (Read January 4, 1897.)
     Dr Munro maintained in this            paper   that, by the attainment of
the    erect posture and the consequent          conversion of his limbs into
hands and feet, man became homo sapiens, and inaugurated a new
phase of existence,         by means of which the manipulative               organs
became correlated         with   the progressive    development of the brain.
In   the evolutionary career of man two stages were therefore to be
recognised.       First, that during which his physical transformation
had been effected,         so   as   to  adapt   him    to  bipedal   locomotion    ;
second, that during which his mental organisation had become                       a
new governing          force in the       universe.    The    one,  being    readily
 effected    in accordance with the laws of morphological adaptation,
had a short duration.           The other, an extremely slow process, con
sisted of small increments to his knowledge, acquired by repeated
 experiences of reasoning from causes to effects and from means
 to ends.        The   one was      merely an adjustment of physical con
 trivances to physical ends, comparable              to that by which the bird,
 the bat, and the whale had converted their limbs to their special
 purposes.       The other had to be relegated to the mystic laboratory,
 where thought was converted into its material equivalent in the
 form of increased brain substance.            The transition from the semi-
 erect to the erect posture could not,         in point of duration,     bo at all
 paralleled with the ages during which this erect being had lived                on
 the    globe.    It   was    also   probable that this transformation         took
 place    in a limited   area,    so  that the chances     of finding    the inter
 mediary links of this stage were very small.                On the other hand,
 the probability      of finding erect beings with skulls in all grades of
 development,       from a slightly      changed    Simian typo up to that of
  civilised man,      was    enormously greater.         He   regarded    the erect
  posture as the most conspicuous line of demarcation between                   man
  and the lower      animals.      From this standpoint the Java skeleton
  would come        under the category         of human    ;  but, if this line of

distinction    was to be dependent in any degree          on mental      phe
nomena,     Dr Dubois was perfectly justified in regarding it           as a
transitional    form, because it was   a long time after the attainment
of the erect posture         that his religious, moral,   and intellectual
faculties became human characteristics.          Dr Munro believed that
many     fossil   remains    of man   were    intermediary    links  which
marked different stages in the history of mankind, and the further
back such investigations carried them the more Simian-like did the
brain-case become.        If  the geological   horizon  of the Java      man
was correctly       defined as the borderland       between  the Pliocene
and Quaternary periods, they could form some idea how far back
they had to travel to reach the common stock from which men and
the anthropoid       animals had sprung.      The lower races of to-day
were also survivals of intermediary        links which had been thrown
into the side eddies of the great stream of evolution.*

the E. M. F. of the battery employed and the resistances of the

A    Research into the Nature of the Nucleins and Para-
       nucleins of the Animal Cell. By T. H. Milroy, M.D_
       B.Sc.
                           (Read December    21, 1896.)
                                    (Abstract.)
    There are two constituents of the cell which have, during the
last few years,      attracted a great deal of attention,          namely,   the
nucleins and paranucleus.
    The nucleins    are essential constituents     of the cell nucleus, appear
ing there in different        forms of combination.         The true nucleins
possess at least three characters        in common.
    In  the first place, they have a high percentage of phosphorus.
    Secondly,    they offer great resistance to the action of peptic
digestion.
    Thirdly, they furnish nuclein          bases  on being subjected to the
action of weak acids at moderate temperatures (about 100° C).
They may be regarded as representing combinations between a
 rich phosphorus-holding        acid —nucleic acid —and albumin.          These
combinations may either be of a firm or loose character, that is to
say,   in the  case of the former it is difficult to split off the nucleic
acid from       the  nuclein    by the action       of hot saturated     baryta
solutions,     while in     the   latter   the   decomposition     takes   place
 easily.
    It  seems    probable that there are four or more different nucleic
 acids,  according as they give          on decomposition      certain  definite
 nuclein bases.      In   other words, each nuclein         base may have its
 corresponding nucleic acid from which           it is derived.   From this it
 follows that there may be also different nucleins corresponding to
 each nucleic acid.     As examples,     one may take thymus nuclein,     which
 gives in decomposition with weak acids adenin and guanin, while,
 from the nuclein of the pancreas,          only guanin has been obtained.
 This acid constituent of the nuclein          possesses the property    of pre
 cipitating proteids out of their solutions.          It has been regarded as
 not unlikely that these precipitates might be similar to the natural

1S9&— 97.]      Dr T. H. Milroy on Nucleins and Paranucleins.                    255
nucleins.       In   order to find out whether this were the case             or not,
I   examined these bodies, which           I  shall call " artificial nucleins," in
different waya
     The first     one,   which    I   investigated, was       obtained after the
following method:— A weak solution of syntonin in (V25 per
cent, hydrochloric acid was prepared in the usual way, and to it a
1    per   cent,   solution of nucleic acid in water was             slowly added
until no     more precipitate appeared.           The artificial syntonin nuclein
so prepared was filtered from the excess of fluid, then washed with
alcohol and       ether, and finally dried in a desiccator.          Portions were
analysed      before    and   after peptic digestion, and it was found in
 all   cases that the percentage         of phosphorus remained          fairly con
 stant at about      4 per cent.     It  was only after very prolonged peptic
 action that     the phosphorus percentage           of the undissolved nuclein
 began to fall, and then only very slightly.                A gradual solution of
 the nuclein, however,        took place continuously.
     The phosphorus        present    in the filtrate (i.e., the soluble peptic
 products) was almost entirely in organic               combination, in all pro
 bability in the form of albumose nucleins.
     This artificial syntonin nuclein         was also digested with pancreatic
 extract for varying periods, with the result that in all             cases a   rapid
 splitting up of      the nuclein took place, the phosphorus passing                in
 organic combination from the undissolved nuclein to the soluble
 products of digestion.         After five to six hours' pancreatic digestion,
 the percentage of phosphorus fell to 1'5.               An interesting property
 which     these soluble products of digestion possess is that of pre
 cipitating    albumins and        albumoses      out of their solutions.        This
 property is due to the presence             of an organic     phosphorus-holding
  acid, closely allied to nucleic acid.
     Weak alkaline solutions, such             as  0"25 per cent.    2sTa2C03,   also
 gradually decompose         this nuclein, though not to the same extent
 as   the pancreatic extract
     Hydrochloric      acid of the same strength         as that which occurs in
  the gastric secretion is practically without any effect on the nuclein.
     The combination between nucleic acid and syntonin is a com
  paratively firm one.       In   the same way       I have examined       combina
  tions between different albumoses            and   nucleic acid.    Such bodies
  were found to be very soluble when subjected               to peptic digestion.

256         Proceedings      of Royal Society of Edinburgh.                    [sb&,
   Nucleic acid      seems to have the power of            uniting with varying
quantities    of different     albumoses, the phosphorus percentage of
those bodies being, as a rule, higher than that of the syntonin
nuclein.
   In order     to compare     these   artificially-formed     nucleins   with the
natural    ones,   I   shall sum up very shortly           some    of the results
derived from investigations which           I  have made      into the nature of
the latter class of proteids.
   The nuclein      present in the thymus gland was found to contain
about 4-5 per cent,       phosphorus.       Even very prolonged subjection
(10 hours) to the action of the gastric juice had only the effect of
diminishing to a very slight extent this percentage.                   Here, how
ever, as  in the     case of the syntonin        nuclein, there was a gradual
solution    of   the thymus       nuclein,    the    phosphorus     appearing      in
organic    combination       among the soluble          products    of   digestion.
Trypsin and sodium carbonate              (0*25    per cent.) rapidly split up
this nuclein,     the phosphorus percentage falling after four hours'
digestion with pancreatic extract from about 4-5 to               1*8  per cent.
   A proteid precipitating body is present among the soluble diges
tion products.
   In  the case of the thymus nuclein,               the combination      between
nucleic acid and the albumin is a loose one.
   The nucleins of the red blood corpuscles of various birds and
also that of the pancreas       were examined in the same way.
   All  are    characterised     by   the resistance which they            offer  to
peptic digestion, and the ease with which the pancreatic extract
splits them up.
   The combinations between the acid and albuminous radicles                     are
in both   cases of a firm description.
   The paranucleins        can   only be defined in rather an indefinite
way.    They possess a high percentage of phosphorus, which is
present in organic combination.            We always find the paranuclein
united   in the tissues to       a  variable amount of proteid, which is
removable by the action of the gastric juice.                Examples     of  these
combinations are casein and ovovitellin.
   The paranucleins        do not offer so great       resistance to the action
of the peptic ferment as the nucleins.                They   do not, on decom
position with acids, furnish nuclein bases.

  From          some (e.g., ichthyulin                   of the carp's eggs)                 a   cupric oxide
reducing         body has been obtained,                       while in the       case       of others                it is
absent (casein, ovovitellin).
  Just as a nuclein is a combination between                                        nucleic acid and
albumen,            so      a   paranuclein may                be regarded         as        a       combination
between paranucleic acid and albumin.
  Unfortunately,                 we know very little about the acid constituent of
the paranucleins.                     That     of the paranuclein of casein                            has been
referred to by Clara Willdenow,                            Salkowski, and Hahn, though it
has never been properly described.                                 Before     I    refer to the                      acid
constituent of the paranuclein of ovovitellin,                                    it is necessary                      for
me to describe                  another acid which was formerly regarded                                    as        pos
sibly identical                 with    the        paranucleic acid           of the             paranucleins.
When        a   solution of nucleic acid in water is heated for                                             a    short
time on         a    water bath,             the    nucleic acid is split up into nuclein
bases, another              base called cytosin,                and a phosphorus-holding                             acid
— thymic            acid.        This acid — thymic              acid — still     retains the proteid
precipitating power of the nucleic acid, and is richer in phosphorus
than the latter.                 From analyses             which Kossel has made of                             it,   the
atomic      proportions                of nitrogen to phosphorus                   are as             15    :    1,    or,
according           to some of my own,                    1-6:1; while in              all       nucleic acids
the proportions are always as                        3:   1.
   This acid does not give on decomposition                                nuclein bases, agreeing
thus with the acid constituent of the paranucleins.                                              What           is    the
nature of these precipitates which                              thymic acid causes in syntonin
solutions       t     Are they           at all       comparable         with the natural para
nucleins?            These bodies        I     have examined,          and shall shortly sum up
some    of their principal characters.                          They do not possess                    so       high     a
percentage of phosphorus                       as    the nucleins,       owing to the fact that
thymic          acid        precipitates       a     greater      excess      of loosely               combined
syntonin         than nucleic acid                   does   ;    therefore,       on     digestion with
pepsin, the percentage of phosphorus                              gradually rises, showing that
the    excess         of syntonin             is    slowly      removed.      I        may           take       as     an
example of many analyses the following                             : —

That is to say, first of all, there is a removal of the                excess   of
syntonin, and        then,   after very prolonged       action, a splitting up
of the paranuclein occurs,            shown    by the fall in percentage of
phosphorus.
   Trypsin rapidly splits up this paranuclein.
   Both    after prolonged         peptic and       short tryptic   digestion,     a
proteid precipitating         body is present      in  the  soluble products of
digestion.      In    order   to compare     this    syntonin-paranuclein with
the natural ones,        I  examined one of the latter, namely, the para
nuclein of ovovitellin.          It  contains about     5 per  cent, phosphorus,
and is moderately resistant to action of pepsin, but is easily split
up on tryptic        digestion,   or from action of weak alkalies.          In all
these points     it  agrees with the syntonic paranuclein.
    We may call the organic          phosphorus-holding acid, which is split
 off from this paranuclein by the action of weak alkalies, para-
nucleic acid.        It is distinguished   —
    First, by its     great solubility   in cold water   ;
    Second,    by its proteid precipitating property        ;
    Third, by the absence of nuclein bases among its decomposition
 products   ;
    Fourth, by the absence of any reaction with Millon's reagent                ;
    Fifth, by its high phosphorus          percentage,    7-97;
    Sixth, by the absence of all reactions            common to proteids,      with
 the exception       of the biuret, whiuh it gives most distinctly.
    I have, in conclusion, to thank Professor Kossel of Marburg for
 his never-varying kindness, attention, and help in difficulties             ;  and
 especially   to Professor Rutherford,         who, during my tenure        of   the
 Crichton Research Scholarship in Physiology, did everything in
 his power to assist me with my work.
    A grant of      .£30, which    I  received   from the Dickson Travelling
 Fund, was of great assistance in allowing me to carry on a research
 which   I  was exceedingly anxious to complete.

    I  have the honour to lay before              the Royal    Society   a   short
account of some theoretical researches            on the daily change of the
temperature      of the air, made by me in 1895, and published to
a  certain extent in the Nova Acta der kaiserlich Leopoldinisch-
Caroliniscfien Academie der Naturforseher,                Band Ixvii., No.       2.
Some more       recent   investigations on the subject,         chiefly dealing
with the physical point of view of the problem,                  have    not yet
been published, but seem to me of such                 importance  as  to justify
me in presenting a brief sketch of them to the                  Society in this
paper.
    The history of the mathematical aspect of the problem can be
traced back as far as the middle of the last century, when Lambert
made the first attempt       at investigating the relation between           solar
and terrestrial radiation       and the temperaUire        of the atmosphere.
He was succeeded by a great number of famous                    mathematicians
and    meteorologists,     whose    labours,     however, though they con
tributed    considerably to our knowledge of certain              parts   of the
question, have not been rewarded,         it  must be said, with any sufficient
result; so that a satisfactory solution of the problem                by means
of  theoretical investigations has been eventually considered              impos
sible, at least in some quarters.
    There can be no doubt that, in         a  problem like this, an immense
number     of different errors affect the principal conditions of the
propagation     of heat,    which    conditions      are  supposed   to be     the
causes   of the observed      changes    of the temperature.        The clouds,
which alter the quantity of solar heat radiated            towards the surface
of the earth, the aqueous vapour continually changing its amount
in the atmosphere,      the convection currents carrying heat from the
 Boil to the upper layers of the air, and allowing colder atmospheric

                                                                                                        — all   these
phenomena, which must be taken into account, add to the                                                          diffi
culty of the investigation.                         The following sketch, however,                               may
perhaps suffice to show how, by comparatively                                                simple considera
tions, the effect            of all the disturbances just mentioned may find
expression in the mathematical solution of the problem.
     The first principal question                     we have to answer                      will   be   :   By what
means does            the lowest layer of the atmosphere, the temperature of
which is recorded by our thermometrical                                           instruments, receive or
lose heat       1     There can be no doubt that the chief cause of every
change of temperature within                                this     layer must be found in the
communication               of heat from the surface of the soil to the atmos
phere.      It       is obvious that            a   loss of heat from this surface to the
colder parts           of the atmosphere                     is,    to   a   certain extent, compen
sated      by   a     contribution          of heat from                   the hotter parts.                    There
must be     a       continuous         interchange of heat between the soil and                                          a
certain quantity of the atmosphere, of which we know neither the
height nor the distribution of temperatures within it.                                                To simplify
the question, wo suppose that there                                is   no direct radiation from the
soil into space        ;    but we are not necessarily bound to this assump
tion, because          it   is   obvious that any amount of heat supposed to                                         be
radiated into space may just as well be assumed                                                 to be radiated
against     a       further imaginary layer of the atmosphere,                                           so long as
we can dispose of the density and temperature of this layer.
     Now, let us take            a   certain element of mass, dm, of the atmosphere
at any distance from                      the       soil.     Let        <j>(\)    be the           coefficient          of
radiation           of the soil against this element,                             tk   its temperature, and
t'   the    temperature              of    the earth's                  surface.             "We     know,       from
Newton's            law,    that      the quantity                 of heat radiated                   during       the
infinitely small           space of time, dz, from the soil towards the element,
is   given by the formula              :
                                 dv'= -<j>(\)dm(t'-tk)dz*
     *
     This formula obviously includes the case of conduction between the soil
and the fiist elements     of the atmosphere    too — provided we make no
assumptions on the nature of the function <p{\).          in what follows, we          If,
simply speak of radiation between soil and air, we always tacitly refer to
the piobable existence of such conduction.

      The coefficient of radiation is not the same for different elements                                         ;
it    will certainly depend on their distance from the source of heat.
Taking              n different                         elements, we may express the corresponding
coefficients                 by

radiation,               A,,.
  Applying this consideration to the whole of that part of the
atmosphere which is influenced by the radiation of the soil, we
conclude                 that we are allowed to divide the atmosphere into an
unknown number of layers with unknown temperatures, but the
same        coefficient of radiation, A.                                 The thickness of    these layers natu
rally depends on our assumption                                              of the element dm, and the
nature           of the function                            <£(A).       But, whatever     be the differences
between these, we can always assume                                                an infinitely large number
of sufficiently                       thin layers.
      Now, suppose                                 there   be     2n     layers, » being     a   large number,
',,   /.,   .   .    -        '._,„           their respective temperatures, we obtain the total
amount of heat contributed                                      by the soil to the whole atmosphere          :
                                                             -2n\(t'-T)dz,
where           T        is          the arithmetic              mean of the temperatures of all the
layers.
      Thus, we know that, whatever be the distribution of temperatures
and densities throughout                                    the atmosphere, the amount of heat given
 by   the earth's surface                               will only depend on the          mean temperature,   T,
the    temperature of the soil,                                  t',   and the coefficient of total radiation,
~u\.            It   is              evident that            a    supposed ideal atmosphere, with the
same mean                    temperature,                  T,   and the same coefficient of radiation as
the real one,                        would produce exactly the same effect on the change
of    temperature                             in the earth's surface.

 262          Proceedings    of Royal Society of Edinburgh.                 [stss.
    Now, let    us assume    the temperature of the lowest layer of the
 new atmosphere to be identical with the observed temperature                   of
 the real one, we do not alter by this supposition              the conditions
 of heating this layer. For we can easily prove that any change of
 heat in it cannot but depend on its own temperature, the tempera
 ture of the soil, the mean temperature, T, and its coefficient of
 total radiation  — factors which    are supposed to remain       unaltered by
 the new supposition.
    We again      assume   the    substituted    atmosphere to contain         2s
 layers, the temperatures of which are as follows         :
   T + nA; T + (n-l)A; T + (n-2)A;                     T+A;      T-A;
                    T-(n-2)A; T-(n-l)A; T-nA,
 where A is an extremely small increment               of temperature.         All
 these   layers must be supposed to have the same                coefficient    of
 radiation, X, and, besides,    there exists the condition
                                   T + nA  =  <,
 where t is the observed temperature of the lowest layer of the
 atmosphere.
    Considering     two of these layers, of which the temperatures             are
 T + (n  - &)A   and   T - (n  - k)A,   we   know that the quantities           of
 heat received from the earth's surface are respectively
          -X{*'-T-(n-&)A}             and    -k{f -T + (n-k)&]          .
    But apparently the sum of          these   quantities   is not altered     by
 assuming the first layer to have the temperature,             T + nA = t,    and
the second     one,  T - nA.    Thus we    come to the general conclusion,
that we may assume          the radiation      of the soil     to be    directed
towards two masses of air with the respective temperatures,               T + nA
and    T  - nA, in all their   elements,   each of which       masses has the
coefficient of radiation, nX    ;  and that the total amount of this radia
tion is equal to the whole radiation against the real atmosphere.
    Of course we know nothing about the temperature, T                 - nA, of
the upper limit of our supposed atmosphere.                  But it   has been
shown, with some approach to certainty, by the very few                observa
tions made,     as well   as by theoretical      considerations,    that,    at a

1395-96.]      Dr J. Halm       on the Temperature          of the  Air.           263
certain     distance from the soil, the daily fluctuation of temperature
disappears.        Assuming      the upper    limit of that part of      the atmos
phere     which    receives heat from the soil to           extend as far       as this
critical distance, we naturally have the            condition —
                                 T - nA = u = const.
      So far, we have the following          result   : T)ie total amount of heat
given by the soil to tlie whole atmosphere by radiation (as well as
 by    conduction) can be considered as directed aijainst two masses
of air with the same coefficient of radiation, one of which masses
 has the temperature of tlie lowest layer, t, the other a constant
 temperature,       u.
      It is important to state that this result is obtained without                 any
 assumption        as   to the    distribution     of   temperatures     within      the
 atmosphere.          Certainly, a heated      element    of air cannot remain in
 its position     ; we    know that heat is carried upwards by continual
  convection     currents, which produce, on the other hand,             a  horizontal
  flow of air near        the earth's   surface.     But it    seems quite evident
  from what we deduced             before   that this perpetual circulation            of
  heat can only affect         our result so far as it influences the tem
  perature of the upper and           lower limits of the part of the atmos
   phere   under consideration, — that       is to say, the temperatures        t and u.
   Now, however considerable            the influence of the upward directed
   currents be on the temperatures            of the single layers, there can          be
   no doubt that at a comparatively               small height they fade away,
   and that therefore we have             not the slightest reason for altering
   our supposition       as to the   constancy of the temperature            u.    How,
   on the other hand, the           horizontal currents affect tlie changes             of
    the temperature       t from one moment to another must be considered
    at a later part of this paper.
        At first sight, it would appear rather unreasonable to have two
    masses of air with different temperatures,             without supposing that
    there exists radiation between these masses themselves.                   No doubt
     there  will  be.    Let   us suppose     the mass of air at temperature t
     radiating   heat   against the mass of air at temperature              w, — that    is
     to say,   contributing     one part of that heat which is necessary                to
     maintain    the constancy      of the temperature       u.    Consequently, the
     whole quantity of the required heat            being necessarily      the same in

264          Proceedings        of Royal Society of Edinburgh.                [seb.
all cases, the radiation        of the soil against the mass of air at         tem
perature   m  must be less than         it was under the assumption         that no
radiation exists between the two masses.               But, on the other      hand,
the mass of air at temperature t arriving at a lower temperature
by its own radiation, its power of absorption from the soil will                 be
increased at the same            time.    Now, we know that the          radiating
(absorptive)    power against the earth's surface            is equal for both
masses.     Thus,     the    same    quantity   of heat radiated by one and
absorbed by the other          will affect the earth's radiation in    each case
in exactly the opposite way. Hence, it follows directly,                first, that
the total amount of heat given by the soil to the air is the                  same,
whatever be supposed as to the communication                   of heat    between
the    elements of the atmosphere themselves ; and secondly,                      in
making the assumption that all the heat required for maintaining
the constant temperature,           w, is spent by the earth's surface, we are
bound, on the other hand, to give the soil the whole advantage of
the radiation coming from the mass of air at temperature               t.
    If  we denote by dw' the quantity             of heat radiated by the soil
during the time         dz, by dw that        radiated by the mass of air at
temperature       t,   we may represent our           result by   the   following
equations : —
                         dw'
                         -5- =
                                  - n\{t' - u) - n\(t' - t)
                         dw
                         -dz
                              =
                                  -n\(t-f).
    Apparently      these equations are true only so long as there are no
other sources of heat except the soil and the atmosphere, which                    is
the case during the night.               How they    are affected   by the solar
radiation during the day shall be pointed out afterwards.
    The equations in their present form give the total                change       of
lieat in both the earth's surface and the air.            To find the  change of
temperature wo must introduce some further considerations.                    What
we really know by the fundamental                 law of the relation between
the radiation      and the absorptive        power of a body only refers           to
the whole quantity           of heat radiated or absorbed.         But, unfortu
nately, we do not as yet know what part of this whole quantity                      is
absorbed by     a   distinct element at the surface of the body.            Taking

such an       infinitely small element, we are sure that only                                 a compara
tively small part of the whole radiation received                                       by the surface
will be actually absorbed                within           the       element,      which allows the
larger part to enter the neighbouring                                elements,      where      it   is again
partly absorbed,             and partly carried to deeper layers according to
the laws        of conduction.           Owing to the fact that radiation of                                   a
solid     like the earth must be                    a mere           action of the surface,                  the
question we have to consider                       is,   How much            heat     is   lost or gained
by    an infinitely small element of this surface                           1     All      the other heat
passing through this element                   without absorption                     is   of no import
ance to       our question,          because   it    does not change                  the temperature,
t',   of the surface.
      The general problem,             how much of              a    given intensity of radiation
is    absorbed     by    a   certain element              of    a    resisting medium,              was first
solved by Bouguer, who gave                    a   formula for representing the extinc
tion of       light in   the atmosphere.                 There        is   no obvious         reason why
the same        considerations should not apply to the radiation of heat.
Let us call a the coefficient                  of absorption for                  a    given substance,
p     its density,    dV     the volume of an infinitely small element,                                 o-   the
intensity       of radiation falling               upon the surface                   of this element,
        the quantity          of radiation absorbed,                      then we have              the well-
known formula
                                         d(j   —    —
                                                         a(Tf)d\      .
      From this formula we learn that two different bodies with the
same        absorptive       power,      but different densities,                       absorb      different
quantities of radiation in equal                         elements          of their surfaces, which
are represented            by the relation      :
                                               da.,        p2
       As the absorptive power of the soil against the two masses of air
 must necessarily be the same as the power of radiation of these two
 masses against          the soil, and vice versa, this last relation must exist
 between equal elements of volume of the soil and                                          the air at their
 surfaces.

which      may be considered as the fundamental                                  equations of         oar
problem.
    Now,   a   considerable simplification               of these equations arises from
the curious fact that the average values of the specific heat of                                      the
ordinary soil and the atmosphere are practically                                    the same.        The
well-known        value for the air by Regnault                         is    0*238, which has,         of
course,      to be slightly enlarged               on account                 of the      presence      of
aqueous       vapour        in the atmosphere.                 On the other hand,                    very
careful      observations          by       Pfaundler     have           proved       that,    for    the
mineral part of the earth's crust, whatever be its chemical                                          con
stitution,     we may assume                 the well-determined                value 0*20.          But,
in most      cases,   a    certain amount of humus                will increase this           number,
and he has found that, for average                       conditions, the value of                    0-25
to 0"28    will   be the proper quantity,                 which          is   indeed very close         to
the value for the air under ordinary circumstances.                                    No doubt       the
amount of water in the soil                  will still influence its thermal                 capacity   ;

but, considering the fact that only the outmost superficial parts
contribute     to the radiation, and that these very soon get dry by
the perpetual process of evaporation,                       this influence cannot be very
great.      However, it must exist, and it is very satisfactory                                  to find
that the observations,              as we   shall    see,     show this small difference                in
the theoretical            equations    in an extraordinary manner.                            On      the
other hand,        we must also              take into account that most of our
meteorological        stations are near houses, roads, etc., the specific heat
of the stonework of which                   is certainly less than the average, and
not exceeding          0-20.
     Hence,   if it    is permissible to speak                    of an average value of the
specific heat of the soil at all, we have                      strong reasons to suppose it
practically identical with that of the atmosphere.                                    So, putting

     The equations in this form are not new                              ;    they were given more

attempt to theoretically represent                   the curve of the air temperature
during the night.               But,     unfortunately,                 he     did    not succeed       in
giving a sufficient explanation of his mathematical                                    terms, nor was
he able     to extend the theory to the principal and more interesting
part of the daily curve, that between                         sunrise and sunset.                Never
theless, great merit is due to him for having first propounded these
equations,     which         not only represent               practically            the   whole daily
curve of temperature                after a proper application of the law of solar

     From the theoretical point of view, this equation                                             is   of    great
importance, giving, as                  it   does,    a    numerical            value of the coefficient
of radiation           h,    which was really found by Weilenmann                                        to be      a
constant for all the places                       considered and all conditions                             of    the
atmosphere,         the average value being 0-375.                                This numerical             value
seems to represent perfectly the observations                                     at all the stations              on
which     I      have founded my computations, leaving an error, which
is   certainly      below the mean accidental                              error of the observations.
     Let us now consider the important change of conditions                                             produced
by the solar radiation                  during        the day.             It   is   well known that              the
sun's rays passing through the atmosphere suffer                                      a   considerable            loss
of their         directly    light and heat by the absorptive and
                              radiated
reflective power of the air.    But   would be quite insufficient to
                                                                it
introduce          only      this direct          part of solar heat into                         our problem
without noticing               those enormous outstanding                              portions         of       solar
radiation        which at last               reach     the earth's surface after being                             de
flected once, or even oftener, from their direct course by the inter
fering particles of the air.                      We therefore bring to our aid                         a   careful
investigation of both the direct and diffused radiation of solar                                                 heat

 author deduces from             the observations          of Langley*         a  formula,
 founded on the ingenious                mathematical          researches    of Clausius,
giving the total amount of solar radiation which                       enters the earth's
surface      at any altitude of the sun.                This formula may         be repre
sented     in general terms by the equation                 :
                                     I = A cos Z - b ,
where     I   is the total      radiation      arriving    at the surface,       A  and    b
calorimetric      constants, and          Z the zenith           distance    of the sun.
Zenker's      investigations      being the best and most extensive known
to me,    I accepted     his final formula for the following deductions                 : —
     We know that if           a body be         exposed to the          radiation   of    a
constant source       of heat, there will be         produced — theoretically after
an infinite,      but practically         after a    comparatively short time — a
state   of thermal equilibrium in the body, it receiving from the
source exactly the same quantity of heat as it transfers in the same
 time    to its neighbouring           elements by radiation              or conduction.
 After once       having    established this final state, there is no more
 change     in the temperatures of the body and its neighbourhood as
 long as    we assume the source of heat to be constant. If we, for
 instance,     could suppose the sun, a short time after having risen, to
  remain    strictly in   a fixed position, we would see that shortly after
  that moment the soil as well as the lowest elements                       of the atmos
  phere    had    assumed      a    constant      temperature,       to be     maintained
  during the whole          time during which the sun is fixed in this
  constant     position.     But now, let the sun's altitude increase for
  an   infinitely    short     space    of time, then naturally               the   earth's

alter the result derived from the integral.
   At stations where the thermometer       too much protected by houses, etc.,

                                               a
a  retardation of the time of maximum temperature.         It    not difficult to                       is
find the cause of these phenomena — first, in the diminution of solar radiation
acting upon the neighbouring soil     and, secondly, in the continuous currents

   No   doubt,    we also have similar           currents at continental          stations,
and they are distinctly             shown by different temperature              curves at
different places, according             as  the  direction of the wind           is from     i
hotter or cold quarter.               But in this case it is quite       impossible         to
pronounce       a  distinct law about such currents, the probability                        of
their carrying air from colder places being generally as great                       as the
contrary, in      a   theoretical point of view.           Nevertheless, in           every
instance where a distinct convection current influences the problem,
the mathematical explanations                just given will    suffice    to represent
the peculiarities of the daily curve.
   Our deductions, so far, would bo correct on the supposition                           of a
perfectly clear     sky, — that      is to say, in the absence of visible clouds,
as well   :is  of invisible       aqueous vapour in the atmosphere.                 Unfor
tunately, we are assured              by actinometric observers,        that       even on
so-called bright and cloudless             days the solar radiation        is subject to
considerable variations, most probably caused by the continuous
changes in the amount of atmospheric                 moisture.     The observations
of Crura at Montpellier show that, for instance, in the summer                             the
intensity of solar heat at noon is about              a third of its whole          amount
smaller than it ought theoretically to be, even on days which                              the
eye judged as exceedingly bright.                Now, Langley, on whose             labours
these   considerations,         as we   have said, arc principally founded,               had
chosen    a place      for his observations,        the  atmosphere      of which         was
very much drier than that of the average places we have                             to deal
with   ; so   that the above formula for solar radiation,                 if    applied to
ordinary conditions, has to be considerably corrected                   on account of
the discrepancies          just  mentioned.
   The best method of studying this remarkable influence of                                 the
 daily changes of the moisture seemed to be to carefully investigate
the daily curve of cloudiness, which had the following result : —
In   the winter         there     is  a  distinct  decrease    of clouds from               the
morning to the afternoon, the minimum being at about                               3 o'clock
in the evening       ;   in  the summer,       on the contrary, we have a maxi
mum of clouds very near the culmination                     of the sun        ;   while        in
spring and autumn, we                 observe    two epochs,     when       there       is     no
apparent daily change at all.               These three different features,            which
are very characteristic, and which                 we believe to       give a         correct
account      of the changes            of aqueous     vapour    at the      same         time,

      "We    learn from           this curve that the maximum                             of da occurs
exactly at the time of the summer solstice.                                        We should have                  a

places considered very              distinct indications of that minimum between
December and January.                   There are two points in our curve, March
15    and October          1,   where da becomes zero                   ;    and   it is indeed        a   very
remarkable fact that the daily curves                                  of temperature              at both

      Finally, we come to the most important part of our question, the
constant        of solar radiation         o.      Theory requires that                    o must be          a
constant at       all   seasons (except winter) and                         for all    places at   a

the soil being supposed to have the average values.                                        The amount
of    heat   radiated by the sun being, of course,                                 a   function     of the
absolute        state   of cloudiness,     I           considered, by means                  of    a       great

result that      for all the stations considered the simple linear function

on the scale 0 to 10.             Theoretically,         we should perhaps expect                       an
exponential function of the form
                                                 -Bn
and   it is not at all impossible that this formula may correctly repre
sent the facts considering              the conditions              of   lieat.   But, assuming
the amount of water in the soil to be in some way proportional                                          to
the cloudiness, we have certainly                   to deal with a change in the
specific heat of the earth's crust, by which obviously the logarith
mic curve, applied to temperatures, must be bent more and more
towards a straight line.
   It   was found convenient to derive the value of the solar constant
for a mean state of cloudiness equal to 5'0, and the mean latitude
of the    places       considered 50° north.             So,   if   we call a„ the solar con

   Now, from the above quoted work by H. Wild were taken
 20 different stations in various latitudes, from which were formed
three normal places with the respective latitudes 59°                                 '4,   51°   -3,   and
 42°-9.       For every month from April                      to September am was                derived
from that part of the hourly curve between sunrise and sunset,                                          the
result being the          following —  :
   If    we combine the three places in every month separately, we
obtain    :

each   of the three stations separately, we arrive at the values             :

    There is apparently         a  distinct increase of the solar constant
towards the north.         But it is  a well-known     fact, from direct actino-
metric observations, that indeed the solar radiation becomes more
intense    in northern latitudes, most probably             a result of the lower
mean     state   of atmospheric moisture.          Thus we may undertake to
assert   that our result shows that a determination              of the solar    con
stant from observations         of the daily change of temperature may be
relied     on with confidence. We may even go so far as to say
 that these     observations may be used for testing the important dis
 coveries previously      made as to the periodic         character of the solar
 radiation.
    After the elaborate investigations           of this question by the late
 Astronomer-Royal for Scotland, Dr              C.  Picazi Smyth, founded          on
 the observations        of the rock thermometers at Calton                Hill, and
 similar researches      of Prof. Stone at the Cape, and others, there            can
 be no    doubt that a cyclical wave of the sun's heat must really exist,
 the period     of which is synchronous with the eleven-year period of
  sun spots.
     Unfortunately,      we have      not   yet at our disposal         a  sufficient
  number of stations        with hourly observations.           But we    can easily
 show that      all the   places   where only two or three observations              a
 day were made        — of which, indeed, an enormous number               are avail
  able —can also be used for determining           the solar constant.
     We have seen how regular the annual curve of the quantity da
  has proved, and, at the same           time, how constant is the angle u            ;
  now,    by introducing      the above     given values of both these para
  meters and the value         of the angle     v determined       by the equation
             1 - h2

 theoretical considerations already given, we arrive at                                                a   formula,

 the night curve, which we know to be represented                                                 by the equation          :

so    that the two unknowns of this last equation can be determined
by the minimum              temperature               and          the solar constant.                      Hence we
arrive at the result that the temperature                                       at every hour of the whole

and    for both countries.     For the   same   interval,   extending   from
1882     to 1893, we have drawn the inverted          curve of sun spots.
The agreement       between    the two curves may be considered as
perfect.     There are a good many stations the observations of which
extend     over more than 100 years.        They afford    a large field  for
research, on the probability     of secular variations of solar heat and
other important     questions in connection therewith.
    It is necessary for     me   to conclude    this   paper with a mere
mention of some       other consequences      of our theory, which       con
 tribute to the solution     of the question,   so important    in practical
 meteorology,    how to determine the corrections for reducing single
 observations to the true arithmetic       mean   of the day.     I may   say
 that these corrections can be derived      directly from the above-men
 tioned    tables for a, without referring     to normal places,      as was
 hitherto the case.    Nor will   I dwell any longer    on other interesting
 particulars respecting the daily curve thus theoretically deduced, as
  I have given a somewhat       full account of several of them in the
  paper already published.
     I  would desire to give expression to the hope that these re
  searches, so imperfectly   sketched in this paper, may induce meteor
  ologists to undertake   further investigations in this field of natural
  science.

The     Intermediate           Observing       Station      on    Ben    Nevis.
                          By T. S.       Muir, M.A.
                              (Read January  4, 1897.)
   It  has for some      time been the design of the Council of               the
Scottish Meteorological        Society to establish on Ben Nevis         a third
observing station, supplementary           to those at the summit and           at
Fort-William    ; and in the autumn of last year this design                 was
partially realised.    A site    was not acquired so easily as might have
been expected ; but, after some disappointment, the Council, on the
advice of    Dr Buchan, who in person inspected the ground,                fixed
upon the best situation obtainable in the circumstances.                  Before
the end of August the observer was in residence, but as the                baro
meter did not arrive       till the last day of the month, the         complete
record    of observations       extends only from        the 1st to the 23rd
September — 23 days in all.            The total number of readings taken
was 186,     an average       of slightly more than        8  every 24 hours.
Six of   those observations were made at the hours of 9, 10, 12, 14,
18, and 21, while additional readings ran         in  a regular series between
those   fixed periods;      thus   accumulating     a mass     of facts for all
times of the day and in various kinds of weather.                 The  gaps are
accounted for by the fact that, combined with my meteorological
duties, were the functions          of cook and      maid-of-all-work,    which
occasionally   rendered      it impossible for me to leave the          base of
operations.    Further, it was set down in my instructions               that it
was unnecessary to go out during continued bad weather, except                  at
the statutory periods above mentioned ; and that, in the event of
extra readings being required during storms, a message would                    be
sent from head-quarters.
   The instruments used were         :
   1. A Fortin       barometer       with   extended       scale,  by   Casella,
London.
   2. Dry and wet bulb, maximum and minimum thermometers.
   3. Two 5-inch    rain-gauges.

1896-97.]       T. S.   Muir     on Observing Station on Ben Nevis.           281
    Clouds, wind, visibility, and fog were estimated independently
of instrumental aid.
    The barometer was set up in the hut as far from the cooking-
stove as possible, and the thermometers                (in Stevenson screen) and
the   rain-gauge were thirty yards away on the slope above.
    The hut itself is on the summit of a slight ridge on the general
slope    of the hill, which slants         on the south to a narrow cleft — the
path     of a torrent in its drop to the glen beneath — and on the
north to a broader and deeper wedge running right into the heart
of the mountain.             Above is the Ben itself, or rather the shoulder
of it called        Cairn Dearg.        To the north-west the view is partially
blocked by a hill, which overlooks the hut from                a distance of about
half -a- mile and a height of 150 feet; and due west is the steep
descent       of the hill to the valley of the Nevis.             The station   has
 thus an open exposure to the north, the west, and the south-west.
 Its height above sea-level is 2190 feet.
     The advantages of the site are — (1)              It  is almost exactly half
 way     in height and horizontal distance between the Summit and
 Low-Level          Observatories, thus giving an indication as to whether
  the gradient of temperature is uniform.
     (2)   The slight ridge          above   mentioned,   on each side of which
  there is clear space          for the uninterrupted      descent of cold down-
  flowing atmospheric currents.
     (3) Being on a         hill side,  it possesses at least  half the advantages
  of  a  summit station.
      On the other hand, there are the            following disadvantages : —
     (1)    A    steep    slope above,      completely    obstructing  the eastern
  horizon.
     (2) The       liability of the barometer to the vibration         and sudden
  changes       of temperature inseparable from the construction               of  a
  wooden hut.
     (3) The        long continuance        of  cyclonic  weather, that   to some
  extent      defeated     the main       purpose of the undertaking.        All of
  those defects, however,             except the last, are of slight importance
  compared        with the advantages       ;  and I  venture to say that, in spite
  of the adverse weather conditions, results have been obtained such
  as    will,   if   no   more,    justify    another  trial of the intermediate
  station.

   The method adopted in the preparation of this paper                           was, first,
to construct        a   number of tables containing                the actual        observa
tions ; and, secondly, to compare the simultaneous readings at                              the
three stations.
   Pressure,        Table I. — Barometric pressure was highest,                       27784
inches, at 21 h. on the 6th, and lowest, 26 '6 17 inches, at                         18 h. on
the 22nd, the wind being calm on both occasions.                          The   range over
the 23 days was thus 1*167 inch.                   The maximum occurred in                  the
midst of a period of anti-cyclonic weather, which was pretty general
over north-western            Europe, but the dry weather of which was of
longer continuance at the middle station than over the rest of                              the
British Isles.  With the exception of a slight shower on the 3rd,
no rain fell from that day till the early morning of the 10th, and
moderate to light winds were the rule till the 9th.  The minimum
occurred during          a   period of low-pressure          general over the British
Isles.     The wind was squally from the                 east   in the morning,        bat it
died away later.              During the following night there was                    a very
heavy rainfall,          amounting    to    nearly      an      inch in    twelve      hours,
which, however, seemed             to be confined to the upper half of                      the
mountain.
   Table     II. — I have, by means of the           " Challenger " tables,          reduced
each     barometer reading to sea-level.                A    study of the differences
between the barometers at the three stations shows that they                                are
extremely variable.            For example, one would expect that when                      the
summit barometer read higher                 than the base barometer,                that    at
the middle would read a little less higher, and, similarly, in the                       case
of reading lower.             The truth     is,   that more frequently than              any
thing     else the middle barometer read lower or higher than either                         of
the other two.           It   would be necessary to obtain more numerous
data before attempting to propound                  a   general     kw, but     it   may     be
noted that out of the 22               times       that the mid barometer                read
higher than that at the base,               14 occurred          close   together during
the first four days of the month, and were followed by                       a   period      of
fine     weather;       while the remaining          8    were     scattered over           the
latter part of the month, and were extremely minute in amount.
Taking all the observations into account, we find that on the
average,    the mid barometer read 0"010 inch lower than that                                at
Fort-William, after all         necessary    corrections had been made.

   The greatest          depression was '041          inch lower at noon on the
17th,    followed by         a heavy     rainfall, which was greatest at Fort-
William and least at the summit.                    The greatest    excess was "023
inch higher          at 18    h. on the 3d,       followed by six days of fine

occurred       between noon and 16 h. on the 13th, and the minimum,
35°-0, between 21 h. on the 20th and 9 h. on the 21st.                          At  the
latter   hour the        thermometer stood at 36'9.              The range at the
intermediate        station was thus 24-5.          The 13th was an exceedingly
warm      day, with bright sunshine, the maximum for the month
being     also     recorded      at   Fort- William.       On the night of          the
20th-21st, temperature               ruled low at all three places,           the mini
mum being           observed      both    at   the   summit     and   Fort- William.

cold, but fine and rainless.

    From it we find that from 9 to 12 in the morning                         the inter
 mediate     temperature came nearer to that of the summit, and from
 noon   till   21 h.    it was closer to that at Fort- William            ;   while the
mean    day difference was as nearly as possible half of that between
 the  summit and the base.               It  is probable, however, that during
 the  night it is nearer to the summit temperature, and that the

284          Proceedings        of Royal Society of Edinburgh.                            [sm.
average     temperature for the 24 hours is lower than the mean of
the summit and Fort-William.                  As might     he expected, the differ
ences rise to a maximum ahout mid-day, and                     fall towards         evening.
That with the summit occurred at                2 p.m., and that          with      the    base
at 12 noon.
  As formerly mentioned, the slope of the hill entirely                             obstruct-!
the eastern      horizon,       thus shading the intermediate                 station from
solar action in the morning.                This, coupled with the fact              that the
summit      is open to such action, probably                 explains         the     relative
closeness    of the intermediate             and    summit     temperatures in              the
early part of the day.
  Table     IV., at the end of this paper, gives the hour                            to hour
differences in accessible          form.      As the maximum and                 minimum
thermometers were read four times a day, it is possible, where                               no
actual observation was made, to estimate the temperature at anj
given hour of the day with some approximation                    to accuracy.             Such
interpolations are marked with brackets.
   On 14 days out of the 23, the difference from the summit                                 was
relatively small in the morning and larger at night                       ;    on 6 it      was
large in the morning             and smaller at night;          on 2 it was nearly
the same ; and on          1,   the fifth, it was very small in both             cases.
   There was one occasion, on the morning                    of the 6th,            when the
temperature at the top of the mountain was higher than that                               at the
middle ; but unfortunately,              owing to an accident, no observation
was taken at the intermediate                station before noon.             According       to
the maximum thermometer, however, it could not have been                                   more
than 48°"1, and was probably much less, while the readings at                                the
summit for the hours of 9 and 10 were 46°'0 and 48°"7, dropping
within the next hour to            43°'2.
   The temperature at the middle station                  was closest to that of             the
summit — (1)          At   9 h. on the        1st   of   the month,        when it          was
l°-4 higher.         The wind was         N.E., light.     There was sunshine,              and
the station was between two fog-systems — that                      is,   fog above         and
below, with      a    clear space between.
  (2) At      on the 2nd                      wind                    N.E., light, and
             9   h.         was 2°'9 higher

in force, and station between fog-systems in sunshine.

   (4)       At    21    h. on the same             day it was                 l°-7 higher; wind E.,
very light, and station between two fog-systems.
   On each of these occasions the difference from the base was con
siderably          larger,      though     slightly       below               the mean.               It will    bo
noticed, that at each of those periods except the second, the station
was     in   a    kind of pond between two                      systems of fog, one of which
belonged          to the upper part of the mountain,                                   with    a lower   surface
varying from 2300 to 2600 feet, and the other to the lower part of
the mountain,            with     an upper surface varying                                 from 2000 to 2350
feet.        In    the       second    case    there was mist at                             the    station, and
extending downwards, probably 400 feet.
   The temperature at the middle station was closest to that of the
base    — (1) At         21    h. on the 2nd, when                       it    was            lower; wind
                                                                                            3°'l
X.N.E., light, and a small passing cloud on                                            Meall-an't-Suidho —
the hill overlooking the station — between the heights of 2000                                                  and
3000 feet.
   (2) At 21 h. on the 10th it was                            3 '1       lower         ;    wind S., calm   ;    no
fog visible, and very clear.
   (3)       At   10 h. on the 21st           it   was 3"-9 lower                  ;       wind E.S.E., calm       ;
no fog visible ; bright sunshine at the station.                                             During    the night
the minimum                  temperature was registered, and my thermometer
gave a sudden leap from 3G"-9 to                        40'9, while                    the base temperature
rose    only 2°'9.            Afterwards       there was             a   break away, and at                15    h.
the difference           was as much as 10°-7.
   In the first of             those cases there was only light passing fog about
the level of the station, but half-a-mile away                                 ;       and in the other two
there was no fog at all.
   It    is worthy of notice that, while                       the summit was once warmer
and twice           within       2°   of the intermediate, the latter was never
warmer than the base, and never less than 3° colder at any observation.
   The greatest differences from the summit temperature                                                occurred    :
       (1)   At   14 h. on the 13th when                 it    was 13°'7 higher.                       The wind
was     W., light        ;   there was bright sunshine, no fog visible, and                                      it
was the          wannest day of the month.
   (2)       At   18 h. on the 14th                it   was     110'9 higher.                      The wind was
 S.S.W., moderate                to   fresh — squally.               There was fog about                        GOO
feet above,        and passing at the lake about the level of the station,
and     thunder later in the evening.

     (3)        At   15 h. on the 20th               it was      13°-6   higher ; wind, N.W.,
very       light; bright sunshine               ;   fog 1000 feet above.
     (4)        At   14 h. on the 21st              it was    12"-6    higher   ;   wind    "W., very
light      ;    bright sunshine ; no fog visible.
     In        three of these cases there was either no fog visible, or it                           was
at   a   considerable height ; while in one case there was merely                               a pass
ing cloud, not affecting the station itself.
     The greatest differences from Fort- William temperature                                    were—
     (1) At lOh. on the 11th it was 12°-5 lower; wind calm;                                      no fog
at the hour, but passing clouds.
     (2)       At    noon on the 16th                it was    12" 6     lower; wind W.S.W.,
squally ; no fog visible               ;   passing showers.
  (3) At 15 h. on the 19th it was 12"-2                                   lower;      wind S.S.W.,
moderate ; fog about 100 feet above.
     (4)       At    15 h. on the 23rd               it was    12°-7     lower; wind X.X.W,
gusty; small rain falling                  ;   fog 200 feet above.
     The difference from summit temperature                               was also considerable.
Those facts seem to point to the following general conclusion                                         :—
That when the station was enveloped in fog or between                                          two    fog
systems, or close to the fog, the temperature approximated to                                        that
of the summit, and when there was no fog visible, or                                   if it   were    at
a   great height, it approximated                     to that of the base.
     Tablb           III. —As        regards        wet-bulb      readings,     the    question        of
humidity is still             so surrounded           with difficulties that it is             scarcely
safe to enter upon              it   on such slight           grounds.      The air        was dryest
on the 13th of the month, the minimum                                    humidity occurring            at
14 h.            The mean results show that humidity was greatest                              at 9     h.,
declined to           a   minimum at 14 h., and rose again towards                             evening.
The amount of cloud and fog was greater in the morning                                          than    in
the evening, which               is   the normal state of things.
     Table IX. — This                seems to be       a   fitting opportunity to enter more
fully into           a    description      of the fog.           The height of its           lower     or
upper surface was estimated by the help of well-known                                           marks,
the principal of which was the elevation of the station                                        itself—
2190 feet.               In   no case would the error exceed 100 feet, and                            any
height          near that of          the station          may    be     assumed      to    be fairly
accurate.

1S96-97.]     T. S.    Muir     on Observing Station on Ben Nevis.                      287
    On seven days well spread over the twenty-three, Ben Nevis,
so  far   as visible from the station, was either              all day     or part of the
day clear of fog.         (I  may remark that          I   could     see to    within   500
or 600 feet of the summit.)             There was no day, however, when fog
was not observed         at some      hour or other,        but the       13th    and 21st
were almost     wholly      clear.
    It  frequently happened            that   the station       was     like     an  island
surrounded by a sea of fog,                which    tried in vain to envelop it.
The area thus unaffected was about 500 or 600 yards long and 100
to 200 yards broad.            This   is quite a distinct          case   from thin fog.
It  seemed as    if  the station      were   between two fog-systems,               for fre
quently a view could be obtained betwixt                     them to the island of
Lismore, thirty-two         miles distant.       The cause of this phenomenon
is uncertain.       The wind was always northerly when it occurred.
Perhaps the shoulder of the               mountain served          to   give    the fog an
upward and oblique slant, which                carried on to Meall-an't-Suidhe,
thus leaving the station           clear.    There were        eight days when this
 was well defined.           Once    or twice it happened that fog coming
 down Glen Nevis, below the level of the station                        and apparently
 from the south, was met at the lake by the north wind and carried
 backwards     and upwards, or dissipated (1st and 2nd September).
 In another case, when the wind was variable and light, fog coming
 from the north,        between 2000 and 3000 feet, was met by west
 wind at the head of the corrie below and dissipated.                         It  was very
 curious to see a cloud rolling            along up to       a  certain point only to
 vanish into   thin air.
    Tablb V. — The amount of cloud,               as distinct       from fog or mist,
 was large.     Taking       a  hundred to represent           an overcast        sky, the
 mean   amount at 9 h. was 85              ;  at 10 h., 81       ;   at  12    h., 85;    at
 14  h., 88; at 16 h., 80;             at 18 h., 86      ;  and at     21 h.,    75.   The
 maximum      was at 14 h. and tho minimum at 21 h.                         It   happened
 frequently   that    a  starry night succeeded           a cloudy day.           On each
 of the three occasions        when the intermediate temperature                   approxi
 mated to that of Fort-         William,      the sky was either wholly clear,
 as  on the night      of the 10th, or almost cloudless.                   On the other
 hand,  when the middle temperature was very close to that of the
 summit, the sky was overcast,            or nearly    so.

    A comparison of the three stations shows that at               9  and 10      ax.
there was more cloud at the middle             than     at the top     ;  while for
the rest of the day there was less, and that all over there was more
than at the base.
   Table VI. — The station was not          a   favourable one for observing
winds, as the entire eastern horizon was blocked up by the upper
half of the mountain.        Consequently,       the only winds about whose
true direction one could be certain were those from the north, the
west, and the south-west.           Northerly      winds     prevailed     on eight
days, chiefly at the beginning         of   the month,        westerly      on two,
south-westerly    on four,     southerly    on four, easterly on two, and
light variable airs on three days.          The strongest wind blew from
the south-west on the night of the 14th, at             a  rate exceeding sixty
miles per hour.      It lasted for two days at slightly reduced speed,
and brought heavy showers of rain.

    The highest   mean     wind-pressure     occurred at 14 h., being about
 12  miles an hour, and the minimum                at 18 h., 8 miles an hour.
 At the summit the highest was also at            14 h.,   15-16 miles      an   hour,
 and the lowest at 9 h., 12-13 miles an hour.                   But,     as  I   have
 already said, the station is not a suitable one for observations of

this nature      ;  and, besides, the period was so short, that of wind-
pressure, at least, little can be said.

So that, while the total precipitation at the summit was only three-
fifths of an inch more than at the middle, the latter exceeded that
at Fort- William by nearly             If  inches.
      Table     VIII.     Aggregates fob          12  Hours.— Thrice rain fell at
 the     summit      and not at the other places,             but the amount        was
inconsiderable.
      Six times there was rain at the top and the middle, but none at
 the    base.
      On one of those occasions the amount                   was  the same at both
  places   ;  on the remainder the amount was greater at the summit,
 showing that the rain was confined to the upper half of the moun
  tain.
      Seven times the precipitation            for    12 hours was greater at     Fort-
  William than at the summit             ; at six of those the middle station was
  actually intermediate, and           on the seventh no rain       fell at all.
      From     9 h. on the 12th to 9 h. on the 13th the                rainfall at the
  middle station         was greater by about        \ of an inch and    ^   of an inch
  respectively than that at the summit and Fort- William.                     A glance
   at the Table shows that the barometer was lower than at either
   of the other two places, while the summit barometer read higher than
   that at the base, and the intermediate temperate was more irregu
   lar than at the other stations.
       From    9   h. to 21 h. on the 16th the rainfall at the middle was
   less than at the other two places           ;   but the wind was gusty.
       Lastly, during the night of the 22nd there was a very heavy
    rainfall on the upper half of the mountain — lTJff inch at the top
    and nearly 1 inch at the middle, but only a little over T\j- of an
    inch at Fort-William.            From Table        II.  it will be   seen   that the
    sharp rise of the base barometer was not imitated by the other
    two, at least not to the same extent, and that the temperature at
    all three places       rose  towards     evening.      The wind at the top till

290        Proceedings     of Royal Society of Edinburgh.             [sise.
midnight blew at the rate of 40-50 miles an hour from the south
east, then changed to north,      and became calm.       The heaviest fall
took place between midnight        and 7 h.  ;  on the other hand, at    the
middle   station the wind was almost          calm from   16 h. onwards.
At  21 h. there was a    light air from the north.       At Fort-William
the wind was also northerly.
   The observations having been considered separately, it only
remains to point in a word to any noteworthy connections as
shown by the Tables.        It is the rule to find any striking     change
of pressure or temperature in one     case  echoed in  a lesser degree by
the other two, but the apparent irregularities      are numerous.
   The sudden risings and fallings of temperature on the         first two
days of the month are probably due to the fact that on those           days
the station was visited by passing fog, punctuated          by gleams      of
sunshine.
   There was a wave of colder weather, lasting from the 5th to           the
8th, broken only at the summit on the morning of the 6th.              This
was during the period of fine weather.
   Thunder and lightning occurred on the 14th.              The fall    and
sudden rise of      the barometer    was accompanied       by a rise and
equally sudden fall of the thermometer,          which was most   marked
at the summit.
   Lightning on the evening of the     1 6th was accompanied by     a drop
in the temperature at 16 h., followed by a temporary rise.
   On the next day, the 1 7th, the barometer fell rapidly          as tem
perature rose quickly, and the subsequent rise of the former            was
balanced by the fall of the latter.      The wind at the middle     station
that day varied from 20 to 60 miles an hour ; while at the top,       from
14 to 19 h.,   it varied from 30 to 70 miles     an hour.
   My residence    at the intermediate    station was rendered comfort
able and almost luxurious        by the assiduous kindness and         fore
thought of   Mr Rankin, superintendent of the Observatory ; and 1
am   indebted to Professor Tait, Dr Buchan, and Mr Omond for
many valuable hints in the preparation of this paper.

Note on an Analysis of Human Gastric Juice. By
       W. R. Lang, B.Sc, F.C.S., Chemical Laboratory, University
       of Glasgow.        (Communicated by Prof.         M'Kendrick.)
                               (Read March 15, 1897.)
    In the autumn of 1895         I received   from Professor M'Ewen         several
samples of gastric        juice marked
                                            " Chalmers' Gastrostomy."            The
samples were obtained under most favourable circumstances,                     being
drawn off through an aperture made in the abdomen                    and stomach
of the patient     ;   the juice   was almost pure,       and nearly free from
suspended      matter.        My analysis      was   mainly    directed    towards
ascertaining whether or not free hydrochloric acid was               a constituent
of the fluid, and the following were the reactions              I employed      :—
    (1) With methyl violet the sample gave a distinct blue color
ation, showing the presence of a mineral acid.                     Supposing the
acidity to be due to lactic acid, this reaction would not take                 place,
as on   trying   a   dilute solution of lactic acid with this reagent               no
blue colour was produced.
    (i) On treating         an   alcoholic    solution    of   phloroglucin       and
vanillin   (1 grm.     of the former and        \ grm.   of the latter made         up
with 50 c.c.'s rectified spirits) with the gastric juice and evaporat
ing slowly on        a  water-bath,    a red   colour was produced.           Dilute
hydrochloric acid gave the same result            ; lactic acid none.
    In  the opinion of some authorities the presence               of free hydro
chloric acid is attributed to the decomposition on evaporation                       of
the chlorides present in the gastric juice by free lactic acid.                With
a  view to ascertain whether this could happen or not,               I  evaporated
solutions of chloride of calcium and lactic acid with both of                      the
above reagents        with    a negative   result.    I  also tried solutions        of
chlorides of the         alkalies   of various strengths        with    lactic    acid
under similar conditions, but in no           case  could   I detect  the slightest
trace of free hydrochloric        acid.    These experiments clearly        showed,
therefore,    that no       such   decomposition      of the    chlorides     as  was
 suggested    could account       for the reactions     given with the         gastric
juice and the above reagents; and, consequently, the presence                        of
 free hydrochloric       acid in the samples examined is clearly proved.

On a New Form of Constant Volume Air Thermometer,

   § 1. The thermometer described in the present communication is
a constant     volume one.      Its advantages proceed mainly from             a
simple arrangement whereby the total pressure of the enclosed
air, and hence its temperature, since             these  are   proportional,  is
                                        fIC   I
measured directly by the height of one column of mercury.                   The
external atmospheric       pressure  is eliminated      by the adjustment of
an auxiliary reservoir of mercury.
   § 2.  In fig.  1, A is the air-bulb,   B is the   pressure-gauge,   which is
an ordinary      barometer tube with        a   vacuum above      the  mercury

connected at its lower end to the bent stem of the air-bulb and
also by a flexible               tube to the reservoir C.                 D is      the       constant
volume mark on the stem of the air-bulb.                              The part of       the instru
ment which is filled with mercury                            when the air is at               0°    C.    is
shaded in the diagram.
     § 3.   To make an observation of temperature                              the mercury                is
adjusted to the mark                  D by raising or lowering the reservoir.                         The
height of the column in B above the level of the mark D now
gives       the total pressure of the enclosed air.                        The air-bulb               and
pressure-gauge               may be cut off entirely from external pressure                               b_v
closing the stop-cock between the pressure-gauge                           and the reservoir.
If    the absolute temperature                  corresponding          to any given value                 of
the pressure be known, we can calculate that corresponding to any
other pressure by simple proportion.
     Thus, in order to graduate the thermometer in degrees of                                        tem
perature,         it   is   only necessary      to find the total pressure              for    any one
temperature;                that of melting ice, which we may take as 273°                               on
the absolute scale of temperature,                     is    the most convenient.                  To fis
this point on the scale, the bulb                     is     immersed in melting               ice and
the mercury adjusted to the volume mark by raising or lowering
the reservoir.               The height,       h,   of the mercury column in                  B     above
the level of the mark now corresponds to 273° absolute.                                               But,
since       pressure         and temperature are in simple proportion, the                               de
grees at all parts of the scale                     are of equal length        ;    thus A/273            is
the length of one degree.
     §
      4.     It   will      be seen that the reservoir           is   merely   a   device for         sup
plying mercury at the proper pressure                             to fill up the gauge-tube,
and that          it    may be replaced by any suitable mechanical                                 device,
such as        a   cylinder       full of mercury in which                 a   piston         is    forced
down by           a    screw.     It   is   obvious that the height of the mercury                        in
B     above its level          in the open reservoir          C   always corresponds to                  the
atmospheric pressure at the moment.                           This portion of the            apparatus
is   in fact      a    barometer      if   the reservoir     C   be open, but      it   is   not in      the
least essential that             it   should be so.
     §
      5.     The atmospheric pressure                  is,   after all, merely an accident                 ;
and its constant recurrence                     in all calculations on the                     pressure

 1896—97.]    J. E. Erskine Murray         on a New Thermometer.                 301
of gases is very misleading to the student, who is apt to look
upon    it   as a factor    of a different    nature to the observed pres
sure  in the ordinary air thermometer, and hinders his realisation of
the fact of the simple proportionality           of temperature and pressure
or volume.
   § 6.   The length of    a degree   on this thermometer depends only on
the total pressure     at some given temperature          ; hence    it is clear that
the sensibility of the thermometer          may be altered to suit any pur
pose by choosing a proper pressure           at which to fill the bulb with
air at the standard         temperature.      Thus,      if great sensibility      be
required, the air when immersed in melting ice should be under
great     pressure,  making      the height      h,   which      is  equivalent    to
273°,    large ;   while,  if  a great range      of temperature be required
without great sensibility, it is only necessary              to   partially exhaust
the bulb, at the same time placing          the reservoir         Mow the volume
mark,    so  that the atmospheric pressure may be partially counter
balanced.
   The length of the pressure-gauge          tube of the thermometer may
thus be indefinitely      reduced, though of course at low pressures              the
open reservoir would require to bo placed at nearly the barometric
height below the volume mark.
   The easiest way to obtain air at 0° C. at a pressure somewhat
below that of the atmosphere is to          fill  the bulb      with air   at a high
temperature,      balancing the     reduction      of pressure      and maintain
ing the volume        constant as it cools        by lowering        the reservoir.
When at 0° C. the air         will now have      a pressure      below that of the
atmosphere.
   § 7.   In  order to obviate the necessity         for   a  correction for capil
larity on account of the difference in the diameters of the pressure-
gauge   tube and the volume-gauge,        the constant volume mark is put
at the     end of the fine tube of the stem, just where it joins the
wider tube     which forms its downward continuation.                  At this point
the tube    is conical, and its walls make an angle of about 45 degrees
with the horizontal.          Hence the mercury surface when at this
point   will  be a plane, and its surface tension           will act entirely in    a
horizontal direction.

  § 8.    Iu order      to bo able to adjust the quantity of air                 in the   bulb
while filling     it,   a   small capillary,    E,   is   drawn out from the side              of
the stem at     a   point near the volume mark.                    This allows the air         to
escape as the mercury            is   introduced.        The capillary     is   sealed before

parent simplicity by omitting the auxiliary                        reservoir and making
the    pressure     ¦tube      movable, as       in       Joly's thermometer.                 The

several    disadvantages.             It   does not do away          with external        pres

It would       also be impossible to graduate the pressure-tube                     itself,   and
hence the objectionable arrangement of                      a   scale on   a   mirror behind
the tube would have to be used.                  The clamp which supported                    the
main tube would also have                  to be in   a    more    inconvenient position

 On Photo-Chemical Action.                    By Proftesor       John Gibson.
                            (Read February 15, 1897.)
   A   chief difficulty in the study of photo-chemical action lies in its
variety,   for it gives rise not merely to changes               of   a   chemically
simple    kind,   but also    to   the    innumerable     complex changes            of
plant-life and photography.
   The difficulty is further       increased     by the extremely small pro
portion of material        substance,       chemically altered       in    a   limited
time by the action of those vibrations of the ether which we call
light.    To this,    perhaps,   more    than to any other cause, must be
attributed our continued inability to ascertain              the true nature of
photo-chemical       changes    so    constantly     observed     as    the    decom
position of silver haloids by light.
    Eepeated attempts have been made to connect particular chemi
cal effects, such as oxidation and reduction, with greater or smaller
 wave-length;      but all such       attempts    have   ended     in    self-contra
diction (1, 2).
    Now, if there be any single characteristic associating                 all photo
 chemical    actions   together,     this    characteristic   must       be    present
in the simplest      as  well as in the most complex               cases,     and the
 consideration of the former seems, therefore, most likely to lead to
definite conclusions.
   Perhaps the most striking and the most simple              case   that presents
itself is the increased      electric conductivity imparted to crystalline
selenium    on exposure    to light.
   Monkmann has shown that pure soluble sulphur also acquires
increased    conductivity     when exposed         to light,  though to         a  less
degree than selenium (3).
   Ultra-violet light (4), and also the Rontgen rays, impart electric
conductivity to the air.
   In  these cases the change is a temporary one.
   Ordinary phosphorus, under the action of light,             is converted       into
red phosphorus — a substance         possessing a markedly greater electric

304           Proceedings    of Royal Society of Edinburgh.                    [se&s.
conductivity.       Similarly,  red amorphous non-conducting             selenium
is gradually converted into the black crystalline              conducting     form,
and red crystalline       non-conducting      mercuric sulphide changes             to
the black amorphous conducting modification (5, 6).               These changes
are permanent.
    The common characteristic          in   these   simple cases is thus            an
increase in the electric conductivity         of the   substances      exposed      to
light.
            Cliemical Combination of Elementary Substances.
    It may be doubted whether, strictly speaking, any instances of
such photo-chemical action are known.
    The classical example which most naturally suggests itself is that
of a mixture      of hydrogen     and chlorine      gases.     It would appear,
however, that the presence         of water is essential to this action of
light.    It is certain that the gaseous       mixture     is much more sensi
tive to the action of light when moist.
    Liquid hydrogen chloride, according to the             researches    of Grove,
is not an electrolyte.         On the    other hand,     in    aqueous     solution
 hydrogen     chloride   has   a  very high     degree     of electrolytic      con
 ductivity.
                 Reduction of Simple Metallic Compounds.
     Here  also  it is matter for doubt whether, strictly speaking,              any
 instances of photo-chemical         action falling under         this   head     are
 known.      Nitrate of silver,     as  ordinarily prepared, blackens              on
 exposure to light, but the pure nitrate of silver prepared by                  Stas
 remained perfectly white for years, although kept in an ordinary
 white glass bottle.      That admixture with certain foreign           substances
 greatly increases the sensitiveness of compounds of silver to light
 is a familiar phenomenon in photography.
     The increase in electric conductivity of          a    film of silver   haloid
  when exposed to light, is well illustrated in the actinometer             devised
 by Arrhenius (7).
     The oxides of gold and silver are stated to give off oxygen                   on
  prolonged     exposure to light and to leave         residues    containing     the
  highly-conducting      metals (8, 9, 10).       Similarly, mercurous         oxid*

is said to be decomposed             by light into metallic mercury and mer
curic oxide     :
                                    Hg20 = HgO           +   Hg;
while mercurous chloride                  is split up into a mixture                  of metallic
mercury and mercuric chloride.
                    Oxidation of Simple Metallic Compounds.
     Lead oxide, under the influence of light, absorbs oxygen from
the air, being ultimately converted into peroxide of lead (11).
   Red lead (Pb304) and peroxide of lead (Pb02) are both, rela
tively to lead oxide, good- conductors of electricity, and with this
conductivity their use in secondary batteries is connected.
     Peroxide       of manganese          is another         instance       of    a   conducting
metallic oxide.         It   is formed when manganous hydrate is exposed
to air.     Red light is said to accelerate                  and violet light to retard
this oxidation (12).             This latter statement             is,   however, admittedly
problematical, and           a   consideration         of the difficulty          of arranging
proper     conditions    for     a   crucial experiment makes                    it   appear very
doubtful.
                    Changes      Produced in Aqueous Solutions.
     Perhaps the most important                example of this class of change
is   chlorine water.           It   is   at best   a    very poor electrolyte, but the
solution containing hydrochloric               acid, which results from the action
of light on chlorine water, has great electrolytic                         conductivity.        It
lias been stated that this reaction                is  a   reversible one, and          it   would
be   a   matter of interest to determine experimentally whether this
reversion can take place under conditions which involve                                a   diminu
tion of electrolytic         conductivity.
     Bromine water behaves               similarly to chlorine             water, while        the
very dilute solutions of iodine, which                     alone are obtainable, appear
to be    unaffected by light.
     Sulphurous anhydride            in aqueous          solution, and in absence               of
oxygen, gives, on exposure to light, sulphuric                            acid and sulphur.
Hero also increase of electrolytic             conductivity          is   obvious (13, 14).
     Gaseous    hydrogen         iodide remains quite unchanged                       if   kept in
complete darkness, but decomposes                  on exposure to sunlight.

306         Proceedings     of Royal Society of Edinburgh.                     [sess.
   In  absence   of oxygen, aqueous solutions of hydrogen iodide are
not decomposed      by sunlight (15).
   Potassium    iodide, when dry, is not affected              by light.     Moist
potassium iodide exposed to air and light is oxidised (16)                :
                     4KI  +  2H20    + 02 =  4KOH     + 2IS  .
Here the solution of potassium hydrate is           a better electrolytic con
ductor than the corresponding solution of potassium iodide.
   Concentrated      solutions    of nitric   acid are    decomposed          when
exposed to the action of light, according to the equation              :
                         2HNOs     =
                                     H20   + N204 +   0.
   The   acid acquires      a  yellow    colour,   owing    to     the dissolved
nitrogen peroxide.
   At first sight, this might      seem   an   exception to the rule,           as it
involves the decomposition of an electrolyte without the formation
of any better conductor, but it must          be remembered that the elec
trolytic conductivity of nitric acid      increases   on dilution      with water
up to a certain maximum          ; on   further dilution,      the   conductivity
rapidly falls away.        According to the determinations                of Kohl-
rausch and Grotian (17), and E. Bouti (18), the maximum conduc
tivity of nitric acid is reached when the solution has               been diluted
until it contains about     32 per cent, of    nitric acid.
   Now, nitric acid    becomes less subject to the action of             light  as it
is diluted, and   if this action   be related to increase of conductivity,
we should expect to find that the action of light would cease to be
readily observable at a dilution somewhat less than but not far from
that corresponding      to maximum       conductivity.      The most definite
statement on this point which          I have hitherto found is contained
in Wurtz's Didionnaire          de   Cliemie ; it is there stated that the
action of light on the acid is the more rapid the greater the con
centration, and that an acid having a specific gravity of 130 ceases
to be coloured by light.       Nitric acid of specific gravity T30 con
tains about 47 per cent.      HN03 ; so that in this case also the rule
holds,  as will  be readily seen by reference to the curve of conduc
tivity of nitric acid.
   Numerous other more or less complex cases might be quoted.

 It will  be sufficient for the present     to give the following     equations,
 taken   from standard works        on photography.        To all familiar with
 recent   theories of solution, the increase of electrolytic conductivity
 consequent on the action of light         will be at once apparent.

    The examples       cited so  far seem sufficiently numerous and varied
  in character to     justify  the   expectation that further investigation
  will prove the rule generally.        This  idea is further supported by a
  consideration    of the means whereby we may increase or diminish
  sensitiveness to light in particular cases.
    Photographically       speaking, sensitizers      are  essentially halogen

absorbers,    but it has to be observed that a part at least of the
halogen thus absorbed goes to produce substances                having  a greater
electrolytic conductivity      than the sensitizers employed (e.g., HC1).
    On the other hand, the addition of substances               •which are good
conductors diminishes the sensitiveness of the whole system to the
action of light.
    For instance, the action of light on chlorine water is greatly
retarded by the addition        of hydrochloric        acid, potassium chloride,
sodium chloride, &c.     ;  the retardation being greatest in the case of
hydrochloric     acid, which is also the best electrolytic conductor (20).
    It   would   be premature to suggest a theoretical explanation
of the rule to wliich        I  have called attention.         The fundamental
conceptions cannot be better            expressed than        by the following
quotation from Clerk Maxwell : —
    "We know        that the ether transmits           transverse vibrations     to
very great distances without sensible loss of energy by dissipation.
A molecular      medium, moving under such conditions that a group               of
molecules once near together remain near each other during the
 whole motion, may be capable of transmitting                 vibrations without
 much dissipation of energy        ;  but   if the motion is such that the
 groups of molecules are not merely slightly altered in configuration,
 but entirely broken up, so that their component molecules pass into
 new types of grouping,          then, in the passage         from one type of
 grouping     to  another,    the    energy of      regular   vibrations  will be
 frittered away into that of the irregular agitation                which we call
 heat."
     To this singularly      lucid    statement      I   would   merely add     the
 suggestion that, whenever molecules or groups of                   molecules are
 thus broken up, the new grouping immediately                    consequent   upon
 the frittering    away of the energy of regular vibrations               will be
 itself   always such as to oppose         less resistance to the passage         of
 an    electric current than before.          If  the vibrations     of the   ether
 which we call light       be indeed electro-magnetic,          this result seems
 to follow as    a natural consequence.
     It  is necessary,  however, to distinguish           between primary       and
 secondary changes.         It   does   not    follow that increased conduc
 tivity necessarily implies chemical stability.               The new grouping
  brought about by the       action of light, while offering, so long as it

persists,  a diminished    resistance to the passage of an electric cur
rent, may be       chemically    unstable     and    tend towards      a further
rearrangement, offering an even greater electric resistance            than that
of the original molecular grouping.

     In either        case we secure the nine independent scalar coefficients
which are required for the expression of the most general homo
geneous         strain.        But forms like         these are       relics of the early stage
of quaternion              development, and (as                Hamilton expressly urged)

     2.   A    linear and vector function                 is   completely determined           if    we
know its        effects on each of any system of three non-coplanar unit-
vectors,       say a,       fi,   y.    If    its cubic have three real roots,                 tho^e

     3.     In terms of           the three roots thus designed, we may form,                                     with
the help of three arbitrary scalars (two of them bi-scalars of the

the main result of my former paper                                :— for        it    is   obvious that, having

obvious condition                   that two such forms shall be commutative                                            in

another;           in (a) the real terms do                          so, and the whole                  is   divisible

constants,         we can produce any form of linear and vector function.
And the paper concludes with forms in which                                                 these     constants are
merged in          a   new arbitrary vector.

   §   1.   Many experimenters          have investigated        the electrical pro
perties of flames and incandescent                solids.    The methods usually
employed have been (1) to examine the electric conductivity of
different parts of the flame;* (2) to measure the difference of
potential between platinum wires in different positions in the same
flame     ; t (3) to find the leakage of a charged conductor when placed
near,      or in view of, a flame or an incandescent solid ; J (4) to
observe the leakage of           a   conductor, raised to a red or white heat,
by an electric current,            and    electrically    charged    ;§   and   (5)  to
observe the production of electrification                or diselectrification    by a
glowing wire, through which              a  current is passing, in neighbouring
insulated conductors separated             from it by different gases.       ||
    § 2.    This short communication           divides itself into three separate
inquiries: (1) to test by one of our electric filters H the electric
quality of the fumes from different flames and burnings (this
method has not, we believe, been tried before) ; (2) to observe the
difference of potential maintained between two wires of the same
metal       connected      with    a   copper plate      and a zinc        plate when

observe     the leakage between two parallel              metal plates with any
difference of electric potential when              the fumes from flames           and
burnings      were allowed to pass between them.
    § 3.  To test the electrification          of fumes from different flames
and burnings, the arrangement shown diagrammatically                         in fig.  1
was used.        The flame is kept burning             at the mouth        of a large
vertical iron funnel A, closed at its upper end              ;  and the heated air,
along with the products of combustion, is drawn oif by an air-pump
through     a  small aperture, B, near the upper end.               Before reaching
the pump the air has to pass through three circular pieces of brass
wire     gauze,   D,   1   centimetre     apart, which are fixed           across   the
funnel about       5 centimetres below the         exit tube B     ;  and through     a
worm of block-tin           pipe,  90 centimetres long, which            is kept sur
rounded      by cold water        in    a  vessel   C.    The electrification      was
tested by     a quadrant electrometer (sensitiveness of the electrometer
111 scale divisions per volt), and an electric filter F.                  The filter F
was of block-tin         tube, 5 centimetres long and           1  centimetre bore,
and    full of fine  brass filings     kept in position by a plug of cotton
wool and      a  piece    of brass wire gauze at each end.              Between the
filter and the air-pump is            a T-shaped     piece    of glass tubing with
lower end of the vertical            tube dipping      into a basin of mercury.
This served      as a pressure gauge         to indicate the difference of air
pressures on the two sides              of the filter when the air-pump was
worked.        The flame, the iron funnel,          the worm, and the case of
the electrometer are all metallically           connected.
    § 4.  The following       flames and burnings were tried          : —
          (1) Candle.
          (2) Paraffin lamp.
          (3) Spirit flame.
          (4) Portable electrometer matches.
          (5) Coal-gas (Bunsen flame).
          (6) Hydrogen flame.
          (7) Glowing charcoal.
          (8) Glowing coal.
    § 5.  The method of experimenting               was    to   place the     burning
substance     in position at the bottom of the funnel,               to insulate    the

(200 strokes of the air-pump). The results obtained are given in
the following table. In testing the electrometer matches, four
matches were stuck in holes in              a   metallic    plate, and the plate con
nected by a wire to the case of the electrometer.                           These matches,
according to a suggestion made more than thirty years ago by
Faraday, are made of white blotting-paper                    soaked in a solution of
nitrate of lead, and rolled up with paste into little rods of about
five millimetres           diameter.     The hydrogen         was generated in an
ordinary "Woulffe's bottle from zinc and hydrochloric                           acid.    The
rise of the dilute hydrochloric acid in the long vertical tube through
which         the acid was admitted,         indicated      the pressure        under     the
nozzle, above which the hydrogen was burning.

     §   6.   In   the case of the charcoal       and coal, the burning             fuel was
placed at the bottom of the iron funnel in                      a         thin rectangular
metallic vessel with small holes perforated in the bottom and in
the sides.          A   wire from the case of the electrometer passed through

 one of these holes, and was thrust into the burning fuel.                        It was
noticed that when the burning               charcoal was first put in position
below the funnel it always produced negative electrification, which
ultimately changed           to positive.     Thus,     in four experiments,          the
electrification,      which    was at first negative, became positive after 8,
 10,    14,    and 18 minutes respectively.              On investigation it was
found that                                  * was visible in the

disappeared, leaving only the red glow, the electrification                      became

               paper ou "Electrification of Air by Combustion," by Magnus
Maclean and Makita Goto, communicated to the Philosophical Society of
Glasgow on November 20, 1889, is a statement of results of many observa
tions to find the potential to which the insulated quadrant of a quadrant
electrometer is raised when in metallic connection with various kinds of flames
and fires.      It is there said: "The effect of an ordinary lucifer match
is very interesting.       While the match is burning with a flame the deflection
indicates positive electrification ; but after the flame ceases the electrification
becomes negative, the effect now being that of glowing charcoal."           The follow
ing table is quoted from that paper.          In some cases the burnings lasted so
short a time that quantitative determinations of the potential were not ob
tained.     It  is conceivable  that all of the complementary opposite electricity
separated    from that which went to the electrometer        in those experiments went
to uninsulated solids in the neighbourhood.            The experiments described in
the text demonstrate that some of it was lodged in the air and fumes proceed
ing from the fire or flame.

 funnel    till all  flame had disappeared.          Then the     vessel was put in

    § 7.   Next     an experiment       was made with the burning              charcoal
 put in position while           a flame was     visible.    The flame remained
 visible for 7 minutes, and in that time a negative electrification                     of
 34 divisions was obtained.             Then the deflection       came back to the
metallic zero         in   1  minute, and in 10 minutes more                a   positive
electrification of 87 divisions (0'78 volts) was obtained.
    § 8. Glowing coals taken from the fire and put at once in the
vessel    in position,       repeatedly gave      negative electrification        ;    but
when they were kept away from the funnel                     till all  flame had dis
appeared,      the electrification obtained was         slightly positive.        Glow
ing coals remained glowing            a very short time after all flame ceased,
and tho smallness of the observed effect is probably                      due   to    this
cause.
    § 9.  A    few experiments have also been tried to find to what
positive potential the flame must be raised so as to overcome the
negative electrification it gives to the air.             Hitherto the only         flame
tried was      a spirit flame.     The positive electrode of       a secondary cell
was put into the flame of the lamp, and the negative electrode was
joined to the iron funnel and to the case of the electrometer.                        The
results obtained are not very regular, but we found that one storage
cell was not sufficient to overpower the electrifying                   effects   of the
spirit   flame.       With    one  cell we got 45 divisions           negative in 10
minutes, instead of 109 divisions with metallic                   connection     ;   with
two cells we got 10 divisions positive in 10 minutes ; and with
six cells we got 83 divisions positive in 4 minutes.
    § 10.    The filter,      pump,     and  worm were         now removed,            and
 two plates — one of polished copper, and the other of polished
zinc — were fixed 0-9 centimetre apart in a block of paraffin, as
 represented in fig. 2.         The arrangement       was such that either plate
could be insulated, while the other was kept in metallic connection
 with the     case of the electrometer.        Observations were made to find
 the  deflection from         metallic zero with one         plate insulated,          and

from the plates passing up between them.            This may   be called the
fumes-zero.     When the top of the       flame was    within  5 or 6 centi
metres from the plates, the results were very irregular.          The results
in the following table for spirit     flame  are  in accordance with what

published    in the Philosophical Magazine for August 1890.                The
effect is of the same kind as if the plates were connected by          a  drop
of water.*

  § 11.            To observe the leakage between two parallel metal                               plates,
the zinc plate was removed, and a polished copper plate, equal and
similar            to the other copper plate, was substituted                            for it.         The
distance between their parallel planes was 0-9 cm.                                           The experi
ments were conducted                        as    follows     :   One pair of quadrants of the
electrometer, with one of the copper plates in metallic connection
with         it,   was insulated.                There was now no deviation from metallic
zero.         A        small charge, positive or negative, was given to                            it,   pro
ducing        a     deflection of about 450 scale divisions.                      This corresponds
to over            9       volts, as the sensitiveness of the electrometer now used
was 48'2 scale divisions                          per volt.       In   two or three minutes the
ordinary leakage of the arrangement was observed.                                          This did not
amount to more than one division, or at most two divisions,                                               per
minute.                Then the          flame was          lit, and readings were taken every
half-minute.                      This was done with the variations in the funnel
described in the last column of the following table, and illustrated
by fig.            3.       For comparison, the numbers in the following table
show the leakage for two minutes after the reading was 300 scale
divisions (6"2 volts) from metallic zero.                               This   gives us the        leakage

fumes retained this conductive quality, but in every case we found
that the leakage stopped in less than       a quarter of  a minute after the
flame was extinguished, or removed from the bottom of the funnel.
Closing     the top and bottom of the funnel immediately after the
flame was removed, we still found that the conductive quality of
the air and fumes ceased within       a  quarter of a minute.

On        Osmotic Pressure against an Ideal Semi-permeable
          Membrane. By The Right Hon. Lord Kelvin, LL.D.,
           D.C.L., F.R.S.
                                       (Read January 18, 1897.)
         To approach the subject of osmotic                         pressure    against an ideal
impermeable               membrane, consider first a vessel                      filled     with any
particular           fluid divided           into    two   parts,     A   and B, by an ideal
surface,            MM.        Let    a     certain      number      of individual molecules
of the fluid in A, any one of which we shall call D (the dissolved
substance), be endowed with the property that they cannot
cross       the surface         MM (the semi-permeable membrane)                            ;    but let
them continue                 to be in other respects               exactly similar             to every
other molecule of the fluid in                       A   and to all the molecules of the
fluid in B, any one of which we shall call S (the solvent), each of
which can freely cross the membrane.     Suppose now the contain
ing vessel and the dividing membrane all perfectly rigid.*                                           Let
the apparatus be left to itself for so long                               time that no further
change        is perceptible in the progress towards final equilibrium                                of
temperature            and pressure.                 The pressures        in A and B will             be
exactly the same as they would be with the same densities of the
fluid      if MM were perfectly impermeable, and all                            the molecules of
the       fluid     were homogeneous in all qualities                      ;   and    MM will         bo
pressed         on one side only, the side next A, with a force equal to the
excess of the pressure in                   A   above the pressure         in B, and        duo solely
to the impacts of              D molecules striking it and rebounding from it.
     If    now, for       a   moment, we suppose the fluid to be
                                                                                     " perfect gas,"
we should            find the pressure on                MM     to be equal       to that         which
would be produced by the                        D molecules if they were alone in the
space       A   ;    and this        is,   in fact, approximately              what    the osmotic
pressure          would be with two ordinary gases at moderate pressures,
one of       which     is     confined to the space         A   by    a   membrane freely per

be 1001    times   the osmotic pressure,           and on Q       1000   times    the
osmotic  pressure.      But if   the   fluid be       "liquid" on both      sides oi
the membrane, we may annul the                  pressure   on Q and    reduce    the
pressure  on   1' to equality     with     the    osmotic   pressure,  by    placing

article published in Nature of March                           18,     Prof. Willard Gibbs            has
shown that in the present                       ideal case the difference of pressures on
the two sides of the ideal semi-permeable                                membrane          fulfils van't
HotFs law.             But this       is   only because of the identity of character
of the       S   and   D   molecules       in all qualities except in respect to action
on the        ideal semi-permeable,                membrane        :    and    the    demonstration
essentially fails when the law of variation of pressure and density,
according to height, differs in two vertical tubes, one of them con
taining      S     molecules alone, and the other containing                              a    mixture of

    Xo molecular theory can, for sugar or common                                     salt or alcohol,
dissolved in water, tell us what                       is   the true osmotic         pressure against
a   membrane           permeable        to water only, without                taking into account
laws quite unknown                    to us at present regarding                 the three        sets of
mutual attractions or repulsions: (1) between the molecules of the
dissolved substance; (2) between the molecules of water; (3) be
tween the molecules of the dissolved substance and the molecules of
 water.          Hence van't Hod's well-known statement, applying to solu
 tions, Avogadro's law of gases, has manifestly no theoretical founda
 tion at present;           even though for some solutions other than mineral
 salts    dissolved in water,              it   may be found somewhat approximately
 true    ;   while for mineral             salts dissolved           in water        it   is   wildly far
 from the truth.             The subject          is   full of interest, which            is   increased,
 not     diminished, by eliminating                    from   it   fallacious theoretical views.
 Careful         consideration of how much we can really learn with cer
 tainty from theory (of which one example                               is    the relation between
 osmotic         pressure and         vapour pressure              at any one temperature)              is
 exceedingly           valuable in guiding and assisting experimental efforts
 for the increase           of knowledge.               All    chemists        and    physicists who
 occupy themselves               with the "theory of solutions," may well take
 to    heart warnings,           and       leading views, and                principles, admirably

ferred to the Museum of Science               and Art.       In the   case of th'-

been    enabled to clear up many points in synonymy, etc.,                    which
have for nearly eighty years remained doubtful and obscure.                      The
most important results of       the,   investigations may be summarised              as
follows : — One of the beetles has been found by               Mr Gahan,      of   the
British Museum,        to be the   type of     a  new genus, which is charac
terised in the present paper, while           the   specimen    upon which       it is
founded is probably unique           ;  it has been     found necessary       to re
name one species        of butterfly and one beetle       ; errors in synonymy
have been corrected in the case of nineteen species; and                       eight
species hitherto wrongly placed have been referred to their proper
genera.

     The Eliminant         of a Set of Quaternary Quadrics.                         By

      1.  The   "dialytic"    method      of elimination, in the       case of more
 than one variable, is not without              its drawbacks,     as   most mathe
 maticians know.          The requisite derived equations are not              always
 easily obtained, the difficulty being due as often to the existence                   of
 too many as of too few           ;   and, when this has been got over, it not
 unfrequently happens          that the order of the resulting determinant
 is alarmingly high, and unaccompanied by any hope of a successful
 guess as to the character of the extraneous factor.              The    discoverer's
                    * affords    sufficient testimony of this, and very
 original paper                                                                   little
 has been done        since  its appearance        to put matters      on a sounder
 footing.      The most noteworthy improvement, due to Cayley,t «
 more      interesting   theoretically      than practically,    his main        object
 being the detection of the extraneous              factor when there is      an over
 plus of equations.        Nothing, indeed, will bo found more             conducive
 to an understanding of the limitations of the method                 than   a careful
 comparison of the application of this process of Cayley's                      to the
 problem of eliminating x, y,          z from the three ternary quadrics
with Sylvester's original           treatment of the same problem,            and the
latter especially       as  commented         on   in footnotes by the author
himself.

advantage,         as       it    leaves         that scope for the exercise                         of ingenuity
which is half the charm of mathematical work.                                                  The variety of
forms,      too,    which              it   is    often possible            to    obtain for the same
eliminant is            a   matter of great interest, and the study of them is
almost      always certain to have an instructive result.                                            This   appears
very clearly from the                       work recently devoted to the elucidation of
one of Sylvester's cases,                        — the first     case       of all, in fact, and there
fore classical.              It    consists        in the elimination                  of x,    ?/, z      from the
equations
                                   At/ -2C'xy + Bx2               =     0

where       there       being six secondary                    variables,        x2, y2,       z2,   yz, zr,    .<¦//,   it
was       necessary          to seek         for three other equations containing                                     the
same variables and not derivable from the original three by mere
addition or subtraction of multiples.                               The three ingeniously arrived
at were
but, when they had                      been       got, the      resulting determinant                         was,      of
course, of the               6th order, and, on investigation,                            it     proved to             be
twice the square of the real eliminant.
     3.   This     same           case of         Sylvester's turns              out now              to    be most
instructive from             a    totally different point of view.                       (   In first thoughts,
it   would seem              as   if   nothing could be easier than the generalisation
of the problem from the case of three variables to four.                                                   Yet    such
is   very far from being the truth, and an excellent illustration                                                        is
thus afforded of another peculiarity of the method,                                          viz., its apparent
eapriciousness.

we    have to seek for four additional                         equations containing                       them.
Employing Sylvester's                 process,        we first eliminate            B         from equations
(1) and (2), with the result
                         - Vxyz2 + A/f-z- - Cy V               +   Yjjzx2 =        0
                                                                                   ;
and then        L    from equations (3) and (4), with the result
                        - Kzicx2      +    Gufix*     - Aw2z2 + Gwxz2 =             0     .
On proceeding, however, to eliminate                          C   from these two equations,
we find that this             will   cause the elimination            of   A       also, the result                in
fact being
                    - DxyzV          +   ~EyzxW       - Kzwx^y2 - G'rrz^y2 =                    0,
or
                                Dzw      - Ewx + Kxy - Gyz =               0   .                                  (a).
Here      the    trouble       begins.           In    Sylvester's     case the first derived
equation contained not only all the secondary variables of the type
xy, but also one of the type                        a-2,   the consequence being that, by
repeating the process                 on     a   different arrangement of the original
equations, he obtained                   a   new derived equation, and, of course,
similarly       a    third.     In    the case we are now dealing with this is
impossible of attainment, the manipulation of the original equations
in   a   diiferent order leading invariably to the same result.                                         Instead
of being,       as     in Sylvester's            case, one of     a   set, the equation (a)                         is
here unique.
     This fact        comes     out very clearly              and conclusively                    in another
way.       It   will    be observed that any one of the                            four original equa
tions    is   derivable from another of them by changing the letters                                               in
accordance with the indications of the cycles
                x                                     A                                          D

Consequently,          if     by any legitimate process an equation                               is   deduced
from two or more of the original equations, the process need not lw
repeated        in order to obtain other like deduced equations;                                        all       that

is     necessary             is a    mere     change     of lettering.               Now,     whereas      in
Sylvester's               case this letter-changing             was       fruitful, in      the new case
it is not.  The equation (a) here simply reproduces                                     itself   ;   in other
words, it is invariant to the cyclical substitution.
      4.         Instead of eight equations             we have thus only five, and cannot
therefore                proceed.     Of    course some process of derivation different
from Sylvester's                    may lead to four new equations instead of one,
but         I     know as yet of no such process.                         True, there is one other
equation outwardly                    resembling (a), viz.,
                            CDLxy - LEAjc          +    AKB:ir - BGOv                  = 0

but this,            unfortunately,         is useless for dialytic purposes                  when taken
along             with     the    given set, being obtainable from them                              by mere
addition             and subtraction of multiples, the operation which gives it
being
set  in my paper of 1892 (J'ror. Roy. For. E'Hn., xx. pp. 300-305).
 It is not unworthy of note in passing, however, that here again
 there           is a difference between            the analogues.                   The corresponding
 equation            in Sylvester's         case is accompanied                  by two others.         Here
            is   unique, being invariant to the cyclical substitution.
       5.        Such being the state of matters,                    we are apparently forced              to
 go    afield for a fresh mode of dialytic elimination.                                  One such       need
 only be            mentioned to be dismissed.
       From each of the five equations,                          (1), (2), (3),        (i),   (a), by mul
 tiplying in succession by ir, s, y,                      z,    we can derive four equations,
 and, therefore,                 can have in all twenty.                But the secondary variables
 in these           would be
                                         /\       y3,             2s,       ir:t

  his process of solution had been suggested to liim from a considera

Now    these must be derivable either from a set of six or eight of the

letters occur, viz.,

from these four.             But this              is   the very problem we have been con
sidering as the extension of Sylvester's, and                                       itis   its appearance in this
connection which at once suggests the possibility of attacking                                              it   in
the rear.        To begin with, we infer that the new relation sought
cannot be an independent relation, but must be derivable from two
or more of the            initial ten, only three of which, by the way,                                         are
themselves independent.                            Now, when we examine the ten care
fully,    we find that there              is       a    set of four              which involve all the co

   where it is clear that we have the means of eliminating             F  and  H
   and obtaining      a relation connecting A, B, C,    L, D, E, K, G.       The
    thought    therefore occurs to one, that if it were possible to deduce
   four equations like     these from the four given equations, our difficulty
   would     be overcome.      Of course, the deduced equations could not be
   exactly like these, for they could not possibly contain the letters          F
   and H.       But any quantities whatever that might occur        as  F and  H
   do occur would suit our purpose equally well,        because we only want
   them in order to eliminate them.            And here another suggestion
   comes in, viz., that as the equivalents of      F  and  H in  the set of ten
   equations, a1a2=A, etc., are
                         aiy2 + a2Vi      and        PA+6A,

                or       Ca^ + Ay,2      and
   it  is almost certain that these will suit.       As   a matter of fact, on
   turning    to the solution which was obtained (§ 6),       it will  be found
   that they     are exactly those   which were taken and found       to suit.
       8. These suggestions,      however, are not all that are obtainable
   from the vanishing of the        ten primary minors of the discriminant.

Among the remaining six relations we find two that                  are indepen
dent of   H  but are quadratics in F, and two that are independent
of  F  but are quadratics in       H.     The elimination of     F from the first
pair and the elimination           of  H   from the second      pair ought,    one
would    think, to lead us      to one and the same resultant, and ought,
indeed, to give us the very resultant obtained previously from the
set of  four relations.       On trial this is found to be the case        ;  con
sequently, we shall obtain a new mode of arriving at the eliminant
of our set of equations

if from them wc can deduce the equation
                         -                       + (BG2 +   D2L  - 4ABL) = 0

    Fortunately,      the required      deduction    is perfectly   easily  made.
 We may either,         as before, simply       substitute for D, E, G their
 values derived from the given equations, or we may improve upon
 this, as follows   : —

      Using     6  and      as   before, and taking       advantage of the cyclical
   substitution, we thus have

from     the triad in        13,    y,   8.   This   is     readily done.     To verify the
first of the pair       we have only got to substitute in it the values of
E and K          got from       the 2nd and 3rd of the triad.                  To verify the
second       of the pair we do the same,                        when it is found that the
 result is obtainable from the first of the triad by dividing by                          (3y?>,
 and then multiplying by                       -   B        •    The first of the pair is thus
 seen to be derivable from the last two of the triad, and the second
 from all three.
    As   a step   towards       a    direct mode of elimination, it may             be noted
 that the equations are transformable into
 that   is   to say, into   a   set of ternary quadrics.

    The statement            of the identity for the case of the determinant                    of
the    4th order ought to be a help in ascertaining the law of                                the
developmfnt,             but such is not the          case.     With      the two identities
before him, no reader would find it possible,                       without investigation,
to write out the identity for the case                     of  a  determinant of         higher
order.
    So far as       I  am aware, there is no other literature on the subject,
which seems indeed to have been entirely lost sight of by                                mathe
maticians, although               a very special case of the theorem             has received
considerable attention.
    Having recently been led by                  a straightforward process of            deduc
tion to what turns out to be the general theorem which include
the    two instances             intended to be stated            by Cayley,       I am in a
position, not only to remove the uncertainty above referred                              to, but
also to supply the much-needed                   proof.
    2.    First of all,       I   recall the very special         case    which   has already
been proved by several                 investigators,* and which is best known                 in
the form      : — Every       bordered zero-axial skew determinant w expremlk
as the product             of  tiro Pfqffian*.       This    is necessary      as a lemma to
what follows.               The mode        of formation        of the two Pfaffians            is
readily apparent from two examples.

         determinant and (2) a bipartite function having the same square

I         purpose here giving another demonstration, which                           I   think     has
the merit of bringing out more clearly the character of the                                  consti
tution of the eliminant, and in which                    is   followed, at the same              time,

student familiar with the theory of determinants.

On the Resolution            of Ciroulants into Rational Factors.
                         By Thomas Muir, LL.D.
                             (Bead December   7, 1896.)
    (1) If we think of the circulant C(aj, a2                      <*„_!, an)  as
the result of the elimination of x from the equations
                      l

it is readily apparent that, corresponding            to every rational    factor
of  x" -  1, there must be a rational factor of the circulant.              Thus

must have four rational factors, viz., the factor
                        «! +  a2 + as + a4 + a5 + ae
corresponding     to    the solution   x=l       of the equation 2^=1,        the
factor
corresponding to the solution x =         -   1,  and two other factors corre
sponding to the partial equations
                   x2 +    x+l   = 0,    x*-x+l         =  0.
    The main object of this paper is the determination                   of such
 factors, and the presentation of them, when found, in the most
suitable forms.
    (2) It is clear, at the outset, that when n is odd we have always
one linear factor, viz.,
                            Oj + a2 +   ....      +«,i

370           Proceedings      of Royal Society of Edinburgh.                     [sea.
and that when n is even we have two, viz.,
                              Oj + a2 +         ... +an,
                              Oj   -  a2 +      ... - a„    .
    (3) The remaining factor, in the case where n is odd,                   is readily
obtained by using along with the                 given linear equation the equa

instead of x"    -  1 = 0.    Thus, when n         —  5, we have
                      ax* + bx3 + cx2 + dx +             e = 0

374          Proceedings    of Royal Society of Edinburgh.                            [«
necessitates   that C(ax , a2             , a8) should be resolvable also               into
four factors, and further, that there also must be two of the                             1st
degree, one of the 2nd, and one of the 4th.                    For the sake of      clear
ness  it may   be well to   go through         the reasoning again, say          for the
case of the factor x* +    1 : —
   The equations concerned         are
                  OjZ7 + a<pP + dgZ5      +....+          Og

and, since in the first equation            -   1 may be substituted for .*-*,             it
follows that tho highest power of x left after the substitutions                     have
been made must be the 3rd.                That is      to say,       the final  equation
must be of the form
                         AjZ8 + AjjZ2 +     AjZ + A4 = 0         .
The     cyclical  substitution      will then give three other                   similar
equations, and the eliminant          obtained will be a determinant of                the
4th order, having each of its elements of the first degree.

Note          on the Reducing Power of the Living Animal
          Tissues.        By David Fraser Harris, B.Sc. (Lond).,

                                  (Read   April 5, 1897.)
      The    following    demonstration of the avidity for oxygen on the
 part of the living animal         tissues was made incidentally          while    I was
 injecting       the gelatine and soluble Berlin-blue           mixture (Ranvier)
 into the blood-vessels of cats and rabbits in preparation of histolo
 gical material. It is a fundamental fact that living colls must have
  oxygen continually supplied            to them    ;  the tissues    crave     oxygen,

  of yielding it       (the inspiratory     phase   of the internal respiration).
  Normally        the  HbCX yields it — the       gas reaching the cells via the
  lymph.         The left external jugular         was   chosen,    and opened        the

       The fluid traversed heart and lungs              before  reaching the aorta

   injection     must have    " failed " in certain       organs,   for the kidneys
   and liver were markedly pale — pale green                — and in     some of the
    divisions of the portal vein the gelatine               seemed     uncoloured or
    " bleached " white.       The lungs were of                               and such

    organs    as  brain and eye were blue, while there               was no      loss of
    colour where the fluid and the blood had mixed in the vessels (in
    a case in which the blood had not been lirst washed                      out of the
    vascular system).       Here we had clearly a          case   of de-oxidation       of
    the deep blue ferric ferrocyanide           (Berlin or Prussian blue) to the
    pale green     or almost colourless       ferrous ferrocyanide, winch, how
    ever, underwent re-oxidation         on exposure       to the air, for the       blue
    colour returned progressively in from ten minutes to twenty-four
    hours after.      Next morning,      indeed,   organs    that seemed empty of
     injection   showed full capillary contents.

     The chief pigment of normal urine                             is   known      as       urobilin (seeing

that this name indicates                    a

The        name for             the     chromogen             "urobilinogen"                 would          become
" urochromogen."                  Other pigments are or may be present in normal
urine,        e.g.,     the    indigo-blue         pigment         whose ancestor is intestinal
indol,        and "uroerythim"                    genetically           related,     it is behoved, to
skatol, while, according to some physiologists, traces of "patho

logical urobilin (which might be better called para-urochrome)
and even of haematoporphyrin                           are recognisable            in healthy urine.
     Certainly, in            some morbid urines, urohaematoporphyrin has been
the chief pigment replacing urobilin,                                   while, in       a     few very           rare
ones, a pigment allied to                        it,   but, according to M'Munn,                            less de
oxidised, has             appeared.              This substance, like urobilin                         and       uro
haematoporphyrin,                 is    a    proteid-free,          iron-free        pigment,               as   yet
unnamed.              I       propose       to    call      it   meio-de-oxyhaamatoporphyrin.
Urobilin    amber-coloured, urohaematoporphyrin makes the urine
                   is
of orange tint, while the rarer ally gives deep port- wine colour       ita                                        :
urines containing this last do not                          decompose         for many weeks.
I      lately encountered meio-de-oxyhaematoporphyrin                                              in the urine
from      a   case of rare skin-disease, Dermatitis                          herpetiformis                 bullosa.*
Both      these         haematoporphyrins have absorption-spectra                                    resembling
that of alkaline haematoporphyrin,                               and each, on the addition                         of
strong sulphuric acid,                 is   changed to the characteristic                           two-banded
acid-haematoporphy rin.
     In    what way             is   urobilin related              to    these     rarer and less                de
oxidised           pigments?           Let       us     dispose,        in the first              place,     of the
biliary theory of the formation of urobilin, which                                          is,   that bilirubin
or biliverdin in the intestine                         is   acted upon by nascent hydrogen,

and thereby        reduced to a body resembling the artificial                  hydro-
bilirubin which, absorbed from the intestine, traverses                     the liver,
and so, by the lungs, reaches             the arterial stream for the kidney.
Against this theory may           be urged the     following considerations : —
    1. In   animals with a biliary fistula the urine has urobilin.
    2. In   Copeman and Winston's case
                                                    * of human biliary          fistula,
where the       faeces   were    "clay-coloured," the urine contained                uro
bilin, on    some days     in  excessive    quantity.
    3. A body constantly present is made to depend upon a fluctuat
ing quantity like " nascent hydrogen."
    4. Why, if bilirubin, formed in the liver is at once excreted from
it in the bile, should hydrobilirubin pass through the liver un
changed, or pass through             it at all into the blood for           the right
auricle  1
    5. In fevers, whereas the amount of bile is diminished, urobilin
is increased.
    The fate of the bile-pigments will still further determine                 the site
of the    source     of urobilin.       The bile-pigments, acted upon in              the
intestine by some de-oxidising agent either contained in pancreatic
juice  t or acting in its presence,         forms stercobilin, the brown           faecal
 pigment thus eliminated          ;  for (1) before the pancreas         secretes we
have meconium           (thick     foetal   bile-pigment    unaltered)    ;   and      (2)
although       bile be secreted,      if the pancreas is     diseased   or its       duct
 occluded, stercobilin        is   absent    from   the faeces; (3) in vigorous
 catharsis, when bile-pigment             is hurried through the intestine, it
may be yellow (bilirubin) and not brown (stercobilin).
    [Eecently it has been suggested, from the spectroscopic affinities
 between stercobilin and pathological urobilin,             that the presence           of
 the latter in urine may be due to an abnormal absorption                        of the
former from the bowel.]
    Unquestionably         haemoglobin        via   hsematin    (normally)       is   the
 parent of both the bile-pigment and the urinary pigment, and it                        is
most probable          both are      the offspring     of hsematin of the           same
 generation.
    Thus, though the        biliary     origin of urobilin must be given              up,
there is much to point to its hepatic origin              ; that the liver        is the

chief    seat of the formation from heematin                     of the immediate ante
cedent of urobilin there can be no doubt, for —
   (1) Increased destruction of red blood-discs in the liver, such as
follows from injecting into the portal vein any substance which
liberates Hb02, leads to an increase of urinary pigment.
   (2)   In       pernicious anaemia much iron is deposited in liver cells,
and the urobilin is increased, indicating an exaggerated destruction
of Hb02       ;    in such urines the band at              F   can be seen    (without con
centrating         the urine), sometimes pathological urobilin, a more de
oxidised      pigment, is formed due to the abnormally                         intense     de-
oxidative hepatic katabolism of Hb02.
   Since M'Munn made urobilin by oxidising                             acid-haematin by
per-oxide          of hydrogen, and then briefly de-oxidising with sodium-
amalgam, he has suggested                    that    " urobilin is formed by nascent
oxygen in the tissues."               As     to the modus operandi of its formation
there are, then, two theories           (1) The reduction theory ; (2) The
                                             :
oxidation theory.                Though most probably both reduction and
oxidation occur in the formation                     of uroblin, neither is alone the
method ; and as it was unsatisfactory                      to attribute the reduction       to
intestinal nascent          H,   so   it is unlikely that nascent oxygen in the
tissues performs            the oxidation.            The living protoplasm of the
tissues craves oxygen            for itself, and fixes it interstitially.             If   the
liver is the great          source of   urobilin formation, it          is,   as we should
expect, pre-eminently            a    region of de-oxidations.
  All       other     pigments        are    artificially produced by          processes    of
more or less        complete reduction, thus —         :
    (1) Haematin acted on by nascent H Haematoporphyrin.
                                         =
    (2) Haematin (but not bilirubin) acted on by zinc H2S04                    +
           to full reduction, yields pathological urobilin, inter
                   mediate stages in this process giving             "urobilinoidin"
                   (le Nobel), the chromogen of urohaematoporphyrin.
    (3) Urobilin            reduced         yields   pathological     urobilin (para-
                  urochrome).
  From        these    facts and            other    considerations     we may follow
M'Munn in believing that the order of the pigments                            as   to degree
of de-oxidation        is   as under   :    —

         We have then to account for                 processes     of decomposition, oxida
tion,         and reduction         in the transformation                of blood-pigment              to
urinary-pigment.                 I believe   it may      be done thus         :—
         Taking the liver in health, oxyhemoglobin                            reduced is first de
composed            to haematin       by separation of            the proteid             globin;     the
hoematin           is,   by separation of its iron, further decomposed into some
antecedent of urobilin, perhaps its chromogen.
  This substance, secreted " internally " by the liver, passes on to
the heart, and thence to the lungs, where                           it   becomes           oxidised    to
urobilin (hence the urobilin band in blood-serum*), and                                        is   then
swept on into the arterial stream, to be (some of rapidly                      it)            reduced
at the moment of renal excretion                     ;   hence we are prepared to find
in urine        some      urobilin and      some urobilinogen,           which latter,          as the
urine stands, becomes oxidised to the                      pigment —          a   process    hastened
    by the acid fermentation,               or by the action of potassium perman
ganate, HC1 or              HN03 on the urine.
         In   pernicious        anaemia the        initial amount of this hepatic                   kata-
    bolism    is   increased, or     is   excessive in the degree of de-oxidation                      (as
    above indicated).             On this view M'Munn's oxidation-stage by Hj02
    has its analogy in the lungs, and his                  " brief reduction " by Na-Hg
    in the kidneys.
         But there        are    probably     other      than hepatic          sites       of urobilin
    formation, and tissues other than the liver can to                            a   certain extent
    transform        haemoglobin.          The blood of old clots (cerebral,                        aneu
    rysmal, or of corpora lutea) often shows crystals of    proteid-free,             a
    iron-free pigment hoematoidin (identical in analysis with bilirubin)                                ;

diminished reduction           to chromogen          by the relatively inactive renal
epithelium.]
    Tissue,     other than hepatic, can katabolise blood-pigment, but
urobilin     is not always the end-product — the                  initial reduction     may
not    proceed so far as that.             These      other tissues may be included
under     three heads     : —
    I.   muscles;     II.     6kin  ;    III.     connective       tissues,    with bones,

is,   it   is   a    reduction product, for oxidation causes its bands to                               dis

                                                 (Abstract.)
     In    this paper the author confines his attention to the relations of
 tlie organ, and           especially to the structure of Jacohson's cartilage,
 tbe nasal floor           cartilage, and the different developments to which
 they give rise.            From the study of                  a large         series of forms he has
 been led to the following general conclusions:— (1) That the
 organ is generally well developed in the primitive groups, and
 feebly developed in the higher forms ; (2) that among allied
 animals         the    organ   is,    as   a     rule, better developed                  in the small
 species than in              (3) that in the various members of each
                           the large;
 Natural      Order the organ    constructed on
                                            is     common type, which       a
  admits of only very slight variation                      ;       and (4) that, even when the
  organ     quite absent in certain
            is                                            members              of an Order, the nasal
  floor cartilages are constructed                        on        the    same    type    as   in those
  members in which the organ                         is   developed.
     From the very slight tendency                          there         is   in the organ and its
  cartilaginous         adjuncts to vary with                   changing habits, the author
  concludes that the anatomy of the region affords                                  a    valuable factor
  in classification.         A study        has been made in most of the Mammalian
  orders,     and the relationships and inter-affinities                              of the different
  types have           been critically           examined.
     In     the Monotremata             the       organ        is    very well developed.            The
  simple nasal floor cartilage in front gives rise behind to Jacobson's
  cartilage      and a well-developed                 outer nasal floor cartilage,                  which
  latter    passes inwards            and supports Jacobson's cartilage.                         In this
  order Jacobson's           cartilage differs from                       all other      mammals,     and
   resembles lizards in forming                  a   well-marked turbinal process.
     In     the Marsupialia            and       Edentata the organ                 is   much less de

veloped,      and    the       cartilages are more                 or less rudimentary.                  The
nasal floor cartilage is simple in its construction, and                                   gives         ri*
behind to Jacobson's                    cartilage and     a   rudimentary outer nasal                   floa
cartilage.      There is no turbinal                   to Jacobson's           cartilage, but          thee
are rudimentary indications of its former existence                                 in both      gro'jp-.
In    the    Marsupialia            the      organ almost invariably               opens into             the
upper end of the naso-palatine canal                           ;    in   the    Edentata        it    openi

     In   the Rodentia wo have a condition which                               agrees considerably
with      the Edentata as regards                   Jacobson's cartilage and the                mode of
opening of the organ                ;    but there is an additional feature present                           in
;i   peculiar development of the outer nasal floor cartilage.                                           This
cartilage, which is quite unconnected with any other, forms                                          a floor
to   part of the nasal                   cavity behind the naso-palatine canal,                         and
passing forward forms a support to the outer wall of the canal.
     In   all the higher Eutheria the organ and its cartilages are                              formed
on a common type,               with very slight moclilications.                    In this      variety
the peculiarity is due to Jacobson's                          organ opening into            the naso
palatine canal, and to both Jacobson's cartilage and the outer                                        nasal
floor cartilage sending forward                        processes         supporting       the        ducts.
The organ itself              is,   as   a   rule, rudimentary,          — at    least, when ton-
pared       with the lower mammals.
     From the consideration of the peculiarities shown, the                                      author
proposes      to divide         the Eutheria           into two groups,           — the    former        in
which the nasal floor cartilages                      are formed on the primitive                    type,
and the other in which                        the    cartilages undergo           a   peculiar         and
characteristic development.                    The former group, for which                 the name
Archmorhinata            is   proposed,        will include the Edentata,                 and, most
probably, the Rodentia.                      The higher group, for which                  the nanie
Gamorhinata         is   proposed,           will include      the Chiroptera, Insectivora,
Carnivora, and Ungulata, with most probably the Primates,                                             and
possibly the Cetacea and Sirenia.

      § 1. To test whether           or not the Rontgen rays have any electri
 fying      effect on air, the. following arrangement was made.
      A   lead cylinder 76 cms. long, 23 cms. diameter, was constructed;
 and both        ends were      closed with    paraffined cardboard, transparent
 to the Rontgen           rays.      Outside the end distant from the electro
 meter      (see  diagram 1)       a Rontgen lamp* was placed.            In  the other
 end two         holes   were      made,   one   in the    middle,   through     which
 passed a glass tube (referred to below as suction pipe) of sufficient
 length to allow the end in the lead cylinder to be put into any
  desired place in the cylinder.               By   means    of this, air was drawn
  through an electric filter          t by  an air pump.        The other hole, at    a
 little    distance    from the centre, contained a second glass tube by
  which air was drawn through india-rubber tubing from the open-air
  quadrangle outside the laboratory.
       In  one series of experiments the end               of the suction     pipe was
  kept in the axial line of the lead cylinder at various points 10 cms.
  apart, beginning with            a  point close to the end distant from the
  Rontgen lamp.
       In  every case the air drawn          through the filter was found to         be

negatively electrified when no screen or an aluminium                      screen was
interposed between the Ebntgen lamp and the near end of the lead
cylinder.      The air was found not electrified at all, or very slightly
negative, when a lead screen was interposed.
    When the Ebntgen lamp was removed or stopped, and air was
still pumped through the filter, no deflection was observed on the
electrometer.         This proved that the air of the quadrangle              was not
electrified    sufficiently to show any deflection when thus tested by
filter and electrometer.
    Similar results were obtained with the end of the suction pipe
placed    so as to    touch the floor of the lead cylinder, or the roof, or
the sides.      "Whether the air was pumped away from                   a place in the
cylinder permeated, or from a place not permeated, by the Ebntgen
rays, it was in all cases found to be negatively electrified.
    The following are some of the results obtained on December 16
and 17.       The electrometer was            so arranged as to give 140 scale
divisions per volt.
    Conditions.    — Large lead cylinder metallically                connected with
sheath     of electrometer.           Ebntgen      lamp     surrounded     by a lead
sheath, which         latter was also connected to electrometer-sheath.
There was      a  window in this lamp-sheath            2 "5 cms.  broad and 5 cms.
high.     This window could            be screened      by aluminium      or by lead.
These     screens      were    always     connected       metallically    to sheaths.
During all       the    experiments       a Bunsen      lamp    (not shown in the
diagram) was kept constantly burning, with its flame about 30 cm.
below the Ebntgen lamp.

 §    2.    We had previously                        made experiments                       with   a        sheet-iron
funnel      1    metre long, 14-5 cms. diameter:                                     and with      a     glass    tube
150 cms.         long, 3'5 cms. diameter                    ;     and with an aluminium                            tube
60 cms. long, 4'5 cms. diameter.                            Air was pumped from different
parts while the Rbntgen rays were shining along the tube from one
end, which was closed hy paraffined paper stretched across it.                                                           In
every case the air was found to be negatively electrified.
  In    those        earlier experiments                  the     air drawn                 away was replaced
by air coming in from the laboratory at the open end of the tube.
We found evidence of disturbance                                  due       to electrification                of air of
the laboratory              by brush discharges from electrodes between the
induction coil and Rbntgen                             lamp, and perhaps from circuit-break
spark of induction coil.                        These sources               of disturbance                  are   elimi
nated by our later arrangement                                  of lead cylinder                   covered         with
cardboard at both ends, as described above, and air drawn into                                                           it
from open-air outside the laboratory.
 §     3.   We have              also        found   a   very decided electrification of air —
sometimes negative, sometimes positive — when the Rbntgen rays
are directed across                 a        glass   tube or an aluminium                          tube, through
which air was drawn                          from the quadrangle outside the laboratory,
to the filter.
   A    primary         object of our experiments                  air              was to test whether
electrified positively or negatively lost its charge by the passage of
Rbntgen rays through it.                         We soon obtained an affirmative answer
to this question, both for negative and positive electricity.                                                       We
found that positively electrified air lost its positive electricity, and

in   some cases acquired negative electricity,         under the influence of
Ucintgen rays; and we were thus led            to investigate     the effect of
 Rontgen rays on air unelectrified       to begin with.
     § 3a.  The arrangement described in        §  1  was again used to test
 •whether   or not air was electrified by ultra-violet rays.         The ultra
 violet rays were produced by        an arc lamp.      This lamp    was placed
 about a cm. distant from the closed end of the large lead cylinder.
 The rays    passed into the    cylinder through     a quartz window.        The
 air in the cylinder      from the immediate          neighbourhood     of this
 window was drawn through an electric filter.              No   effect was pro
 duced on the electrometer.           An exactly corresponding arrange
 ment — §     1 — with Rontgen      rays gave    negative electrification      of
 the air.

                            (Read February 15, 1897.)
     § 4. The fact that air is made conductive by flame, by ultra
 violet light, by Rontgen rays, and by the presence of bodies at a
  white heat, has been shown by many experimenters.                We   propose
 in this communication to give        some results bearing on this conduc
 tivity of air,  based chiefly on experiments of our own.
     § 5. "We have examined more particularly the behaviour of paraffin
 and of glass.
     In  our first experiments with paraffin we used          a   brass ball of
 about an inch diameter, connected to the insulated terminal of an
 electrometer by a thin copper wire soldered to the ball.              The ball
 and the wire were both coated             to the depth of about         |th of
 an inch with paraffin.       The ball was then laid on        a block of par
  affin  in  a lead box    with   an aluminium     window, both of which
  were in metallic     connection     with the    case of   the electrometer.
 By    this means we avoided all inductive effects.
     The electrometer was      so arranged as to read 140 scale        divisions
 per volt.
     After testing the insulation     the paraffin ball was charged posi

 tively and the rays played on it.             After two minutes the electro
 meter reading was steady at 0'5 of the initial reading.                    The elec
 trometer was then           discharged by metallic        connection, and again
 charged      positively.        Its reading remained          steady    after   three
 minutes at 0"63 of the initial charge.                In   the third and fourth
 experiments the readings after three minutes were -8 1 and "90 of
 the initial charges respectively.
     The ball was next charged negatively.                   When the rays were
 played on it a steady reading was obtained after four minutes at
 "18 of the    initial  charge.      In  the second,   third, and fourth experi
ments the steady readings after four minutes were -45, -70, and -78
of the initial charges respectively.
    § 6. The paraffin was then removed and the brass                   ball polished
with emery paper          ;  whether     the charge was positive or negative,
it fell in about five           seconds    to one    definite    position,  50 scale
divisions     on    the positive       side of    the metallic     zero,   when the
Ebntgen rays were played on the charged ball.
    § 7. These experimental            results demonstrate that the Rbntgen
rays did not produce sensible conductance                between the brass       ball,
when it was coated             with paraffin, and the surrounding metal
sheath    ;  and that they      did produce it when there was only air and
no paraffin between them.               From experiments by         J. J.  Thomson,
Righi, Minchin, Benoist and Hurmuzescu, Borgmann and Gerchun,
and Rbntgen,* we know that air is rendered temporarily conduc
tive by Ebntgen rays, and Rbntgen's                 comparison of the effect         of
the rays with that of         a flame    shows that our experimental           results
are explained        by the augmentation           of the electrostatic capacity
(quasi-condenser) of the brass ball by the outside surface of its coat
of paraffin      being      put   into   conductive     communication       with the
surrounding lead sheath and the connected metals.
    § 8.   In our second experiments we have endeavoured to eliminate
the influence        of   the varying capacity of           this   quasi-condenser.
For this purpose, we placed                a strip   of metal connected to the

insulated           terminal       of   the   electrometer             inside    an     aluminium
cylinder; the space                 between        the metal and the                  cylinder was
first filled with air,              afterwards with paraffin.                  The      aluminium
was connected to                 the    case  of     the    electrometer,          and inductive
disturbances            were    avoided by surrounding                   the  copper wire         con
 necting the metal to the isulated terminal with                              a lead      sheath      in
 metallic connection with the electrometer sheath                             (see diagram 2).
      In    our first experiments with this apparatus                      we had       air, instead
 of the main           mass of paraffin, separating the insulated metal                          from
 the surrounding aluminium tube, as shown in the diagram, and we
 had only small discs of paraffin serving as insulating supports for
 the ends of the metal, and not played on by the Rimtgen rays.
 When         the metal        thus supported was charged, whether positively
 or negatively,            the   Kontgen      rays diselectrified            it in      about      five
  seconds      ;  not, however, to the metallic zero of the electrometer,
  but              "               "

  metal surrounding it.

   These results are quite in accordance with those found in                         similar
experiments by Eontgen             ;  and they show that           if paraffin is made
conductive, it is only to so            small an extent that it is scarcely per
ceptible by the method we have used.

    We next removed              a part of the wet blotting-paper                 from the
 outside   of   the      glass,   and, after       having     charged       the   insulated
interior metal deposited on the inside of the                      glass, we heated         the
 exposed part with a spirit flame, in this way making                           the glass a
 conductor.      Thus with        a  charge of + 280 scale divisions from the

metallic zero, the loss in 30 seconds, during which time the glass
was heated in the spirit flame, was 90 scale divisions ; in the next
minute, with no further heating, the loss was 20 scale divisions.
Reapplication          of heat      gave   complete     discharge in        2^   minutes.
Thus      we see that our method is amply sensitive                   to the conduct
ance produced in          glass by heating.
      "We conclude that the Kiintgen              rays do not produce            any con
ductance perceptible in            the mode of experimenting which we have
 hitherto followed.
      § 10. A similarity in effects produced by flame and by Rontgcn
 rays is brought out by the following experiments.
       Two similar sticks of paraffin, which               we    shall call A and B
 respectively,      each of       about   4  sq. cm.    cross section,     were     coated
 throughout half their lengths with tinfoil.                    These    tinfoils ought
 to be each metallically connected to sheaths.
       To obtain     a  sufficiently delicate      test for their electric state, a
  metal disc of        3 cm.    diameter was fixed horizontally to the insu
  lated terminal of the electrometer.
       The two pieces of paraffin were first diselectrified by being held
  separately in the flame of          a  spirit-lamp.      Their non-tinfoiled         ends
   were then pressed together,            and    their electric state again tested
   after   separation.       It   was found that they were             still   free   from
   electric charge.       After this B      was charged by being held over the
   pointed electrode      of an inductive electric machine.               The quantity
   of electricity given to it in this way was roughly measured                           by
   noting the electrometer           reading when the paraffin was held at                a
   distance   of  4 cm. above the metal          disc  connected      to the insulated
   terminal of the electrometer.
       The free ends of       A   and   B were    again   held together, and, after
   separation,   both pieces were tested separately.                The charged one,
   B, had suffered       no appreciable      loss, and the other,       A, induced       an
   electrometer     reading of      a few scale    divisions in the same direction,
   when held     as   near    as  possible to the metal disc without touching
   it.   This showed that        an exceedingly minute quantity of electricity
   had passed from        B  to   A when they      were in contact.
       A  was  then diselectrified by being              held alone       in the flame.
    The   ends  of   A and B        were again     put together,     ami in this posi
    tion were passed through           the flame.     They were tested with their

402              Proceedings      of Royal Society of Edinburgh.                              [sess.
ends still pressed        together, and            it was found that when held                     as
near as possible to the metallic disc without touching                                it,   no read
ing was produced             on the electrometer.                  After       this    they were
separated and tested separately               ;    and     it   was found that B, when
held over the disc, gave           a   large reading in the same direction                         as
before     it   had been passed         through         the flame, and          A     (which was
previouslynon-electrified) gave                    a    reading         of about       the       same
amount in the opposite direction.
     The   same      results were obtained when Rdntgen                         rays were sub
stituted for the flame.
     The explanation clearly           is   this   :   the flame or the Rontgen rays
put the outer paraffin surfaces of                     A    and   B     temporarily          in con
ductive communication              with the tinfoils, but left the end of B,
pressed as        it   was against the end of                A, with its charge undis
turbed.         This charge induced an equal quantity                          of the opposite
electricity on the outer surfaces of the paraffin of                      A    and    B     between
the tinfoils     ;   half on A, half on B.
     "When the application of flame or rays was stopped, this electri
fication of the outer paraffin surfaces became fixed.                             B, presented
to the electrometer, showed                  the effect           of the charge             initially
given      to    its end, and an induced                   opposite charge of half                 its
amount          on the    sides between            the end         and     the        tinfoil.     A
showed on the electrometer only                        the effect        of its half of           the
whole opposite charge induced on the                            sides    by the charge             on
B's end.
     We have      here another proof that paraffin                 is   not rendered largely
conductive        by the Rontgen rays.                 Had   it   been made so, then              the
charge given to the end would have leaked through                                     the body of
the paraffin to the outside, and have been carried away either by
the tinfoil or by the conductive air surrounding the non-tinfoiled
parts.
  To show that the induced charges were fixed on the sides, the
two sticks, A and            B,
                     were next coated with tinfoil throughout
their whole length, only            one end of each               being uncovered.               The
uncoated end of          B   was then charged and pressed                      against that of
A, and the two were held either in the flame of                             a    spirit-lamp       or
in   the Rontgen rays.         "When taken out of the flame or the Rdntgen
rays, and then separated and tested separately,                           it   was found         that

B had       retained its charge practically undiminished, and that                                          A had
acquired          a    very slight charge of the opposite kind.
   § 11. Instead of placing the two ends of                                          the paraffin in imme
diate contact, four pieces of metal of ^ of                                          a mm. thickness were
placed one at each corner of                               one of the              ends, so that when the
sticks of paraffin were placnd                               end        to end      there was      now an air
space       of        y1^   of   a   mm.       between the paraffin ends.                        When      B   was
charged and                  A   not charged,              and the two put end to end, and
then exposed                 to flame          or to Riintgen              rays,    it   was found       that B's
end still retained its                         charge, and           A's    end     acquired     a   very slight
opposite          charge.
      With        an air             space      of    !    of   a       mm.        the   same    results were
 obtained.
      With        the air space increased                      to   1   mm. the charge on            B   was less
 after the two had                    been passed through the flame or the rays.

 of ebonite, with similar results.

                                                (Read March          1,   1897.)
      §   13.    We have in                     5    to   10    described          experiments respecting
 electric conduction through air, paraffin, or glass, when Riintgen rays
 fall on metal surrounded by air, paraffin, or glass, and positively or
 negatively electrified to potentials of two or three volts.                                         We found
 that although air                   is   rendered conductive, paraffin and glass are not
 rendered         sensibly conductive when the differences of potential con
 cerned are not more                       than two or three volts per centimetre of air,
 or   per centimetre of paraffin, or per half-millimetre                                       of glass.
      We        have        now to describe               an extension of the investigation                      to
 much           higher voltages,                in which we use an arrangement of two
 (quasi)         Leyden          jars,      A       and    B,       with their inside            coatings      con
  nected         together.            The       outside coating of                  A    was    connected        to
  sheaths, the outside                    of   B    to the      insulated terminal of the electro

404           Proceedings        of Royal Society of Edhthurgh.                                  [ss*
meter.      In all   the experiments to be described,                            B remained          tl;       I
same.
  It     consisted   of   a    cylindrical            lead    can,       25 cms.      long,    4 am.
diameter.         A metal bar about               1    cm. diameter, 25 cms. long, wia
supported centrally on paraffin filling the whole space between                                           i:
and the containing             lead.         This metal bar               was    connected       by        a
wire     to the    internal     coating of A.                 To protect this wire               from
inductive effects, it was surrounded by a tube of lead connected
to sheaths.
  The Leyden A, which was placed                             opposite      the   Rontgen        lamp,
was     different according            as    we   were        experimenting           on the        dis
charge through air, through paraffin, or through glass.
  To get      a   definite dill'erence of potential, the two pairs of                           quad
rants of the electrometer              were first placed in metallic connection.
Then one terminal of             a     battery or of an electrostatic inductive
machine was connected                to the internal                 coatings of the jars,        and
the other terminal            to sheaths.             The difference of potential pro
duced was measured             by      a    multicellular            voltmeter in the         case of
differences under 500 volts, and on                          a    vertical single vane          volt
meter for higher differences.
  When        the desired difference of potential had been established,
the metallic connection of the battery or electric machine witii
the    internal    coatings of A and B was broken, and                                this   charged
body left to itself.           To find the loss due to imperfect insulation,
the pair of quadrants in metallic connection with the outside coat
ing of B was insulated in the ordinary way, and the deviation                                        of
the    electrometer reading from the metallic zero per half-minute
was observed.         To find          the    loss when the rays were acting,                       the
two pairs of quadrants were again placed                                in metallic    connection,
the Rontgen lamp set a-going,                         then the pair of quadrants                 con
nected     to the outside coating of                  B   was insulated from the                other
pair, and the        deviation         from       metallic zero            again observed           per
half-minute.
  §14. In         the experiments with air, the Leyden                            A    consisted     of
an aluminium cylinder,               16 cms.          long,      3     cms. in diameter.        This
cylinder     projected beyond                the left tube,             and was connected            to
sheaths.      The insulated metal inside                         it,   which was   a   flat strip    of

r^ame sheet as the surrounding               aluminium tube, was supported at
one        end by a small piece of paraffin so placed              as  to be out of
 Teach of         the  action of the Riintgen        lamp.     The rays from         the
 lamp       were allowed to pass from a lead cylinder surrounding                 it by
 sl small hole about '3 of a square cm. in area. They fell                      on the
 aluminium sheath transparent to them, and rendered                            the    air
  "between it and the insulated aluminium within conductive.
        We tried various differences of potential, ranging from a few
  volts to 2200 volts. In one series of experiments we charged the
  insulated        metal to  - 97'5  volts, and then disconnected the battery
   electrodes.        The lamp was then set a-going, and the electrometer
   deviation taken       each half-minute for a minute and a half with               one
   pair of quadrants insulated.           The rays were then stopped,        the quad
   rants metallically connected, and metallic zero again found. Then
   the reading during another period of one and a half minutes, with
   the rays acting,      was observed,      and so on until no deviation from the
    metallic    zero of the electrometer was found          witli  one pair of quad
    rants insulated, and          the rays falling     on the   aluminium       outside
    coating of the Leyden A.             The sensibly complete discharge thus
    observed took place in about          a  quarter of an hour.      We found that
    the   rate of deviation      from the metallic zero was the same             as   the
    difference of potential fell from           - 97'5   volts  to   about   -4   volts.
    With     differences    of potential of   - 930, -  1750, and    - 2000   volts the
    Tate of deviation was not appreciably greater than with ± 20 volts.
         This confirms     and extends,    through    a very wide range of voltage,

     is almost independent of the electric pressure when it exceeds                      a
     few volts per centimetre.
         § 15.   In the experiments on paraffin, the outside coating of the
      Leyden A consisted of an aluminium cylinder 27 cms. long, 4 cms.
      diameter, connected       to sheaths.     A  metal   bar about      l-73  cms. in
      diameter,    and 30 cms. long, supported centrally on paraffin filling
      the whole space between         it and the aluminium        sheath,   constituted
      the inside coating.       With this arrangement we made experiments
      with differences of potential of ±94, ±119, ±238, -2000, +2500,

 and    - 2400   volts.    At none of      these  potentials did we find any
 perceptible increase of conductance produced by the Eontgen rays
 above    the natural    conductance of the paraffin when undisturbed
 by them.
     § 16.  In the experiments with glass, the Leyden           A  consisted    of
 a glass   tube silvered on the inside.      The inside silvering     was placed
 in metallic connection with the inside coating of B. That part of
 the glass tube which projected beyond the lead sheath was covered
 with wet blotting-paper        connected to the sheaths.        We observed
 the behaviour of glass under the Eontgen rays at differences of
 potential of + 800, +1500,         +2000 volts.       We found   no   indication
 of increased conductance due to the rays at these voltages.
     We   are forced to conclude that the experiments described             by  J.
 J.  Thomson and M'Clelland do not prove any conductance to be
 induced in paraffin or glass by the Eontgen rays.             It  seems    to us
 probable that the results described in their paper — pages 7 and 8 —
 are to be explained by electrifications induced on surfaces             of glass
 or of paraffin in contact with air rendered temporarily             conductive
by the Eontgen rays.          (See § 7.)

    § 17.   We propose next to describe results of experiments on the
electrical effects    of Eontgen rays and of ultra-violet           light when
shone on metals, or through air between two metals mutually insu
lated; and electrified       to begin     with, by previously     producing      a
difference of potentials between platinum electrodes of an electro
meter metallically      connected with them.          In some   of our experi
ments this potential-difference was zero, and the initial ± electrifi
cations of the opposed         surfaces depended solely on difference of
volta-electric quality between their opposed surfaces.
    § 18. To investigate       the   effects  of   Eontgen   rays,    a   hollow

sheaths was used.       Along    the axis of this a metallic bar was placed,

     The Riintgen lamp was placed in                    a lead    cylinder   connected       to
sheaths.        The rays passed into the tube of aluminium through i
window in the lead cylinder, which could be screened or                         unscreened
at   will,   as described       in   § 1.
     The course of the experiment was the same with each                          insulated
metal.       The metal was charged                  first positively, then negatively;
the Riintgen          rays were then shone on it through                 the.   aluminium
cylinder surrounding                 it,   and the electrometer readings          taken     at
fixed intervals,            until    a     steady   reading on the electrometer           was
obtained.           The point at which the electrometer               reading     remained
steady with the rays acting we shall call the rays-zero.
   Finally, the insulated metal was discharged by metallic connec
tion in the electrometer,  and re-insulated   the rays were again
                                                              ;

effect obtained in this way when the insulated                       metal was     amalga

    The preceding results of the action of Rontgen                  rays   are very
similar to, and wholly in accordance             with, the results found by Mr
Erskine Murray, and described by him in                 a   communication      to the

    We    have also made       some experiments with ultra-violet           light, in
which this similarity is further brought out.                The method     we have
employed is that of Righi.
    A  cage of brass wire gauze was           made    and   connected to    sheaths.
 Inside it the insulated metal was placed on              a block of paraffin,     ami
 connected     to the insulated      terminal of the electrometer by            a thin
 copper wire protected against          inductive effects.      The light from       an
arc lamp was       then shone       through the gauze, so as to fall          on the
insulated metal perpendicular to its surface (see diagram 5).
    The experiments wero of the same nature as those with                           the

   The      insulated metal was afterwards charged positively, and then
negatively.            The rate of discharge                           was observed                      until the ultra

    The copper was oxidised by being held in                        a  Bunsen       flame.
    In   the   case     of polished zinc,            polished         aluminium,          polishal
copper,     and    oxidised copper,          both positive and             negative        charges
were discharged         at the same rate,         if    we reckon the            charge of       the
insulated      metal      from its ultra-violet-light-zero.                     The      rates     of
leaching the ultra-violet light-zero were not observed                                 for    gilded
brass and german silver.
    It must    again     be noticed that our experiments do not tell                               us
what would happen if an insulated metal,                        shone on by ultra-violet
light, were surrounded by              a metal     of precisely the same quality                    of
surface connected          to sheaths.
    § 20.   So far we have mentioned only                     experiments in which                the
rays, whether Rontgen or ultra-violet,                    fell perpendicularly              on the
insulated metal.           We   have also made some experiments with                              the
rays going parallel to the metal surfaces.
    For this   purpose a cardboard box 46 cms. long,                        19 cms.         square
(see diagram 6), lined, in the first instance,                    with tinfoil,        connected
to sheaths, was used.            Inside this box an insulated disc of                     oxidi.-ed
copper     of  10    cms. diameter was supported                    in   such     a way as to

allow         of its being       fixed at different distances         from the         tinfoil-
coated end-wall             of the box facing it.
     The       distance    between     the disc and the      tinfoil was at first      4   cms.
 Th<»      arc lamp was distant about 20 cms. from the box.                        The light
 from it shone through a slit in the tinfoil covering the                       side of the
 box perpendicular to the surface of the oxidised copper.                             The slit
  was 4 cms. long, 1 cm. broad. Its length was first placed parallel
  to the copper surface, so that the light admitted by it shone in the
  space between           the two metals in such a way as not               to illuminate
  either directly.            It was found (1) that the ultra-violet-light-zero
   did not deviate from the metallic zero when the sheet of light
   passed between the two metals               ;  (2) that     a negative    charge       given
   to the insulated oxidised copper was not discharged                    : and       (3)   that

    metallic zero.
          When     the length of the slit was placed perpendicular to the sur
     face, so that a small portion of both metals, as well as the interven
     ing air, was       illuminated, it was found that the reading deviated
     about +       1  scale division     per minute from the metallic zero.                  The
     oxidised     copper was charged        positively and negatively.              1 discharge

     The fact that in experiments (2) and (6)                                                 a   longer time was
required before                  a    steady reading was obtained, probably depended
on       the way the light fell on the surface and on variations                                                        in in
tensity of the light.
     In this table              we see that the steady electrometer reading                                            (which
we have called the ultra-violet-light-zero)                                       is    largely influenced                     by
the distance between the plates, being greater the greater the dis
tance.          This       is   a     very remarkable result.                         It     was first discovered
by Righi, and very clearly described in papers of his to which we
have referred.                   It     may be contrasted with the non-difference of
electrometer readings for different distances between the plates in                                                            a

   The      steady reading of the rays-zero was very nearly                                        reached in
«ach case in about 15 sees., but the observation was continued                                                for
one or two minutes               till we found the reading steady.
   Thus we           see    that, as previously found by Mr Erskine Murray,
the rays-zero is independent, or nearly independent, of the distance
between the opposed metallic surfaces.]
  § 23. Towards realising the case of an insulated metal surrounded
by metal of identical                      surface-quality          connected               to sheaths,       we
covered            over the oxidised copper with tinfoil.                                  The tinfoil wall
facing it was very rough, and not                       so       well polished.                 The insulated
tinfoil     was 4 cms. distant                  from the end of the box to which                              its
surface was parallel.
   When the ultra-violet                     light fell on the insulated metal alone
through         a slit,       the   ultra-violet-light-zero           was + 53 scale                    divisions
from the metallic                 zero.     A   charge given to          it,   whether positive or
negative, was discharged slowly.                         After making              these experiments,
we again observed the difference of zeros, and found that now the
ultra-violet         light reading          was at the end of the first four minutes
 + 2   scale divisions from the metallic zero                            at the end of the next

     When the ultra-violet                   light fell on the disinsulated metal and
 not on the insulated,                     the insulated           when charged                   retained     its
charge.

    With the light shining on both through             a  window      7 cms.   broad,
 13 cms. high, both positive and negative charges given to                 the insu
lated metal were discharged, and the ultra-violet light deviated from
the metallic zero by     -   152 scale divisions.
    This difference    was reduced to about        - 30     scale   divisions   when
the experiments were repeated after the apparatus had been                     left to
itself for  a night.
    S 24.  To make similar experiments with the Riintgen rays, it was
found necessary to cover the window near the lamp with tinfoil
gauze connected to sheaths, and           the   window      on the opposite side
was covered       with    non-perforated       tinfoil.      In   this   way direct
electrostatic induction        was   avoided.     We had        also   a  thin sheet
aluminium      window     between the tinfoil gauze and the Rontgen
lamp.
    When the Rtintgen rays fell on both insulated and disinsulated
metal the rays-zero was         - 5 scale  divisions    from the metallic zero,
and both positive and negative charges             fell   to this zero in a few
seconds.
    With the rays shining only          on the insulated metal the same small
 difference of zeros was obtained, and both positive and negative
 charges  fell  to the rays-zero,     though much more slowly than before,
 in about four minutes.
     With  the Riintgen    rays shining on the insulated tinfoil through
 the disinsulated    tinfoil   gauze, the rays-zero was        -9    scale  divisions
 from the metallic zero, and both positive and negative charges were
 removed in about      a minute.
     On substituting an aluminium           gauze   for the tinfoil       gauze,  and
 sending rays through it on the insulated            tinfoil,    the  rays-zero was
  + 25 scale divisions    fiom the metallic      zero.

     [Added February 6. With a polished zinc disc as the insulated
 metal, and with the same windows to the tinfoil box, the Riintgen
 rays were shed in between the insulated                  zinc and the       opposite
 wall of tinfoil from        a   slit in  a lead   screen      outside.     This slit
  was 4 cms. long by      1   cm. broad.      The distance between           the  two
 metals was    7 cms.     The rays illuminated       only part of the air space
 between the two, and also            a part of the tinfoil covering the two
 windows.

 then found the difference of zeros to be                         - 89      sc. divs., or               - 0"64       of

 was taken to reach the rays-zero after the metallic connection was

418            Proceedings          of Royal Society of Edinburgh.                              [m>s.
  We have         used      two different        methods to measure the potential
difference between two mutually                     insulated    metals when              the air
between them is rendered conductive by the presence of uranium.
The more convenient method is to take uranium                        as one of the             mutu
ally insulated metals.              To do this we fixed         a metallic         disc, 3 cms.
diameter,      to the insulated terminal                  of a quadrant           electrometer.
Opposite this metallic disc, and separated from it by air, we placed
a disc of uranium,            5-5 cms.        diameter, connected to the other ter
minal of the electrometer.                   With this arrangement               a steady read
ing, the metallic           zero,       was obtained when the quadrants                        of tLe
electrometer were in metallic                   connection.     After contact between
the quadrants was broken at the electrometer a deviation from the
metallic zero took place gradually to a point, the uranium-conduc
tance-zero we shall call             it,   depending on the volta difference between
the   two    opposed     surfaces of metals, more or less tarnished as they
generally are.           On the other hand,            if   the insulated metal had                 a
charge given to        it   of such an amount as to cause the electrometer
reading to deviate from the metallic zero beyond the uranium-
conductance-zero, the reading quickly fell to this conductance-zero
and there remained steady.                      When      no charge was given to                  the
insulated metal the steady conductance-zero was reached in about
half   a   minute.       The following table gives the potential differences

between              them,       and the deviation observed                               was       equivalent to        a
potential difference of                        - l-53     volts; that              is,   we obtained an effect
equivalent to the sum of                           the effects          we obtained when the metals
were separately insulated                            in air opposite        uranium.
     S    26.        Instead          of placing          the         uranium            directly     opposite     the
insulated             metal       in air we also observed                      the conductance-zero                 by
mutually insulating two metals in                                 air, one of which was transparent
to the uranium influence.
    For this purpose we made                             a    tinfoil     box, with tinfoil sufficiently
 thin to be transparent to                               the      uranium           influence.          The tinfoil
 forming      box wasthe                        connected             to sheaths.              Inside   it    another
 metal was insulated on                        a   glass stem, and placed so as to be parallel
 to one end of the tinfoil box.                                 This metal               was    connected       to the
 insulated terminal of the electrometer.                                       The uranium was placed
 outside the box, about half                             a    centimetre distant from the end to
 which          the insulated metal                    was      parallel.          The same conductance-
 zero was obtained with the uranium insulated, or with                                                 it   connected
 to sheaths.               The time required to reach the uranium-conductance-
 zero with this arrangement was usually four or five minutes,                                                      and
 charge given to the insulated metal                                      large          enough       to produce     a
 deviation            beyond the conductance-zero                             was         discharged          till this
 zero was reached.                     A       charge,        causing     the electrometer                  to deviate
 in the opposite direction, was discharged to the metallic zero and
 thence         on     to       the    uranium-conductance-zero,                           where      it    remained
 steady.
     With        polished         aluminium              as    the,    insulated metal, the potential
 difference          obtained was              - 0'7     of   a   volt.

  With      the second arrangement, described                                 in   £     25,   it   was possible to
  obtain     a       relative idea of the transparency to the uranium effect
  of screens           of various materials.                      For example,                 when     a    sheet of
  lead,     about      2    mms. in thickness, was placed                                between      the uranium
  and the       tinfoil, no deviation from the metallic zero was obtained.
  In other words, lead                  is     not    transparent to the uranium influence.

      To      investigate the behaviour of uranium in different gases and
  at   different atmospheric            pressures another piece of uranium 3 cms.
  long,       1 cm. broad, and        A  cm. thick, was mounted tirmly in a glass
  bulb       6 cms. long, 3 cms. diameter           on a platinum electrode fused into
  one       end    of the bulb.          The uranium in the glass bulb was sur
  rounded throughout two-thirds of its length by                         a zinc   cylinder
   1A cm.       in diameter.        This zinc cylinder was kept in position            by  a
   stiff   platinum electrode          fused    into the other end of the. glass (see

    then      bubbled      through      strong sulphuric        acid  and    drawn     over
    caustic potash,         calcium     chloride, and phosphoric anhydride             into
    the glass bulb.          The bulb was first exhausted            to an atmospheric
     pressure     of about      G  mms.    ;  then   the    gas to be   used was passed
    into it.      This was repeated          about    twenty times.       Finally it    was
     strongly heated        so as to     drive off any adhering layers of gas, and
     then    allowed to cool in an atmosphere                 of the  gas  at 760 mms.

     the depth of about a millimetre, and an air space left between the wet uranium
     surface and the opposed insulated metal, so that we had a uranium-water-air-
     rnetal arc, the rate of deviation from the metallic zero was reduced so much as
     to be scarcely   appreciable.

  on  it.     The aluminium end of the cardboard box and the outside
  coating of       the     aluminium     cylinder     were   connected       to   sheaths.

gen,     and      carbonic acid         at ordinary        pressure       at    different     volt
ages.        The    glass bulb referred to in ^ 30 and 31 was used for this
purpose.          The     voltages     were   obtained by connecting the zinc to
one     terminal of          a   battery, and the           other terminal           to sheaths.

electrometer.           While      the connection between               the battery and the
zinc was being made the uranium was put in metallic connection

rate of leak      at 4 volts and at 96 volts is nearly proportional              to the

On       a Differential Method           for Measuring Differences of
         Vapour Pressures of Liquids at one Temperature
         and at Different Temperatures.                    By Lord Kelvin,

                             (Read  January   18, 1897.)
    §   1. Apparatus for realising the proposed method is represented
in the accompanying diagram.            Two    "YVoulffe's bottles, each having
a vertical glass tube fitted air-tight into one of its necks, contain the
liquids the difference of whose vapour            pressures   is to be measured.
Second necks of the two bottles are connected by a bent metal (or
glass) pipe, with a vertical branch provided with three (metal or glass)
stopcocks, as indicated in the diagram.               Each bottle has a third
neck, projecting downwards through its bottom, stopped by a glass
stopcock which can be opened for the purpose of introducing                     or
withdrawing liquid.          The upper ends of the glass tubes are also
connected      (by short india-rubber        junctions    or otherwise) with a
bent metal pipe carrying          a  vertical branch for connection with a
Toepler * mercury air-pump.            This vertical branch is provided with
a metal stopcock         The vertical branch of the pipe fitted into necks
of the two bottles     is also connected to the air-pump as indicated          in
the drawings.
    § 2.   To introduce the liquids, bring open        vessels containing them
into such positions below the bottles that the necks project down
wards into them.         Close the glass stopcocks of these lower necks,
open all the other six stopcocks, and produce               a  slight exhaustion
by    a  few strokes of the air-pump.          Then, opening the glass stop
cocks very slightly,      allow the desired quantities of the liquids          to
enter, and close      them again.         They will not        be opened again
unless there is occasion to remove the whole or some                 part of the
   *
       An ordinary mechanical air-pump would not serve the purpose, because
its  valves would not open properly to draw out the very small amount of air
which must be removed to avoid vitiating the observations by any sensible
amount of air-pressure added to the pressure of the vapour.

 liquid      from either bottle; and, unless explicitly mentioned,              will
 not be included among the stopcocks referred to in what follows.
 It will generally be convenient to make the quantities of the two
 liquids introduced such that they stand at as nearly as may be the
  same levels in the two bottles, as indicated in the drawing.
      § 3. Operate now on one only of the liquids until it is got into
  equilibrium, with its upper level at some point in its glass tube,
  and nothing but its own vapour between this surface and the closed
  stopcock immediately above it.            To do this    proceed    as follows  : —
   Close and keep closed the two stopcocks of the liquid not operated
   on, and work the air-pump with the other four stopcocks all open
   until an exhaustion, not quite       as perfect as is possible, of the air
   over the liquid operated on is produced.
       § 4. Then close the lower air-pump stopcock, and go on working
   the pump until the liquid in the tube ceases to rise further above
   its level in the bottle.     Close the two stopcocks of this liquid.
       § 5. Operate similarly on the other liquid.
       § 6. Close now the lower air-pump stopcock, and equalise the
   pressures    of air and vapour above the liquids         in the two bottles by
   opening their neck stopcocks.           If   the levels of the liquids    in the
   two columns are lower than convenient for observation, some air
   should be allowed very cautiously to run back from the air-pump
   into the two bottles through        the    lower air-pump stopcock.        After
    doing this, repeat the operation of § 4 for each liquid.
        § 7.  The operation of § § 4,    5  must be continued       long enough to
    distil out of the upper part of each liquid, in its glass           tube, air or
    any foreign
                   * volatile substance sufficiently     to prevent any sensible
    pressure on the free surface other than that of the. vapour of the
    solvent.

    in the diagram, and the lamp under              the upper bent metal tube

two glass tubes, and let               a   little air run back from the air-pump,                          by
very cautiously and slightly opening our upper air-pump stopcock,
and        closing    it again      before    the    liquid       surface     reaches           the lower
end of its glass tube.                Then open wide the stopcock                       over      the    top
of the other            glass     tube.      After        that,   by cautiously opening and
closing our lower air-pump stopcock,                         let in a little air to the bottle?
until       the mean level of the liquids                     in the two columns rises                     to
nearly the same level                 as   it had     in the observed              positions of          § 8.
In        the    present    circumstances,         air in the upper bent metal                        tube
resists diffusion of vapour through                          it sufficiently to prevent                  any
important            difference      of temperatures              from being produced                     by
evaporation           and condensation            at the two liquid           surfaces,         and there
is practically perfect hydrostatic equilibrium                          of equal liquid               pres
sures at the tops of the two columns.

hence, if pure water be taken for one of our two liquids, the                                        mode
of experiment described                    above    determines        the vapour pressure                 of
the other liquid.
      §11. The         apparatus       may be kept day after day with the                            same
 liquids in it (all the stopcocks to be closed, except when it is not
 in use for observations) ; and thus the observations for difference
 of       vapour pressures           may be        repeated        day after day            ;   or a long
 series of observations              may very easily be made to determine vapour
 pressures           at different temperatures.                   Always      before        commencing
 observations the operation of                     ij 7   must be repeated              to remove        an

       This        copper     cylinder is provided with two outlets, one at the
top         and the other starting near the bottom.                        Ethane may, there
 fore,         either     be   taken from the gas portion, or from the                          liquid
 portion           of the condensed           substance.         The first sample was taken
 from           the liquid,        and will        be   called mixture         a.      The     results
 obtained            with this sample are contained in Tables                    III.-VL, XII.,
  tigs.      1   and 3.
        The        apparatus      employed was Ducretet's apparatus,                   a tube     with
  air      being used        as a manometer.            The full description of apparatus
   unci      method       of calculation will be found in former papers.*                          The
   only       point to       be   noticed     is    the   application of       a   little soft-iron
   stirrer        inside the compression-tube,               which is moved up and down
   by       an     olectro-magnet         outside     the    water-jacket which keeps the
   temperature              constant.       The      pressures      are  measured        in atmos
    pheres,        the volumes         in  an    arbitrary unit, but in such             a manner,
    that      the volumes         belong to equal           original volumes         (at 0° C. and
    1    atmosphere) for both               mixtures.
         The substance a behaved                like, a  mixture,     as regards      both conden
    sation      and critical        phenomena.          The critical region, an expression
     which will be explained later on, ranged from 35'25                           to 3fr7.
         A second sample was taken from the gas portion                              in the copper
     cylinder. This sample (mixture c) appeared                             to   be    accidentally
     almo-t identical with mixture a, the critical                           temperature         being
     35'7r>, and the condensation-pressures                    at the beginning and at the
     end being          only   a   little lower than for mixture a, e.g.,                />,. = 32"78
     at    1 1'95, instead of 32*91.               No further observations              were     made
     with this mixture.
         A third        sample was again           taken from        the liquid.       The results
     for this      sample (mixture h) are found in Tables                      YII.-XI., XIII.,
     and figures        2   and 3.
         The critical region for this              gas lies   between     38'35 and 39'2-T C.
         The possibility of drawing from the cylinder samples of ethane
      differing      so  widely from each other in physical properties                     confirms
      the presence of a mixture in the cylinder.

   The normal weight for ethane                                          Mould       have          been      30.        If    we
extrapolate the critical temperature of pure ethane from the values
for   c    (practically the same                       as u) and          b,   we find 31 -8°             C,       which          is
in good agreement                     with the value obtained for almost pure ethane
prepared          from sodium acetate.
   The substance                    mixed with ethane,                     as prepared              by this method,
is evidently                heavier         than       ethane.            Moreover, it lowers the                           cou-
densation            pressures          and        raises          the    critical     temperature                  (fig.     3).
All this        is    compatible            with the supposition that the admixture                                             is
butane —             a    very        probable             supposition,           when we                 consider           the
possible chemical                   reactions              taking place in the preparation.                                 The
critical constants                    of butane              are     unknown, but the critical                              tem
perature must                be somewhere                   about 150°          C,     the point for propane
being       100°         C. (Olszewski, llaenlen), and for pentane                                        about 197°C.
(S. Young).  The same substance   seems to have occasioned
Haenlen's abnormal results  higher critical temperature and   (a
 lower pressures), and possibly the same                                        is   true for Dewar's                ethane-
      Supposing that the impurity                                  is   butane,      the weights of the mix-
 tuies show               that      a and          b       contained       2'5       and       5    per    cent. butene

ethane and butane is an extremely difficult matter.                                          I   know of no
method except fractional                        distillation.       The quantity left after all
my experiments were finished was too small for the purpose.
   We will now consider the diagrams                            (figs.   1-3)    more closely, assum
ing the mixtures to contain ethane and butane.
   The       reason      why it           seemed          worth    while        to communicate           the
numerical          results and the curves which                          are based           upon them        is,
that the mixtures                form      a       type which        has not been investigated
before.        Andrews'           curves for carbonic                    acid       really       belong to    a
mixture       of    CO._,   and       a    trace         of permanent gas, say air, i.e., of                  a
substance of much lower critical                             temperature than carbonic acid.
The features of his isothermals inside the border curve                                             are well
known.         They start almost horizontally from the point where the
condensation begins (b.c), but are really slightly curved, especially
near the end (e.c), the curves turning their concave side upwards.
      The mixtures of ethane and butane, on                                 the other hand, are mix
tures of one substance with                          a   small quantity of           a    second substance
of much higher critical                         temperature and lower vapour-pressures.
 The isothermals inside the border-curves                                     have    a    correspondingly
 different shape.            The curves turn their concave side downwards,
 the curvature being relatively high near the beginning, and dimin
 ishing towards the end.                        If   air had been present in the mixtures
 as   well   as butane,          it   would have shown itself in                      a   change in curva
 ture in the curves near                   e,   as in Andrews'           curves.
      The values for         p    and      v       at the end of the condensation may be
 read with great accuracy, as the volume                                 is   small and consequently
 stirring     is    very effective             :    concordant values for those points are
 easily obtained.                This      is      not the case        as     regards the points b.c,
 especially not at low temperatures                            :   the column occupied by the
 substance         is   very large in those                  cases, and        it    is   difficult to obtain
 perfect       homogeneity                of       the mixture     ;     even        then, however,          the
 point where condensation commences       not easily determined (at is
 least not at low temperatures) owing to the difficulty of observing
 the minute quantity of liquid which                               is    formed in the beginning.
  Some of the b.c. points (in the tables XII. and XIII. printed                                                   in
  italics) have therefore been obtained by interpolation as the point
  of intersection of the two parts of the isothermals inside and out
  side    the border-curve.                     This intersection always takes place                         at     a

      The explanation          of       the shape             of the     isothermal^         inside        the
border-curve         is simple      :    the        liquid which         is formed         near b.c. is
butane with          some     ethane dissolved                  in it.     As the quantity                      of
butane is relatively small, the condensation of butane changes                                             the
composition of the mixture rapidly, and, accordingly, the condensa
tion pressure also.            But the further the                     process      is continued the
smaller the changes             in composition,                  and     therefore         also    in     the
pressures,    become.          With carbonic acid and                      a    little air it       is just
the reverse     :   the liquid condensing in the beginning is CO., with                                        i
trace of air    :    but the composition of the mixture                             above the liquiJ
hardly changes           at all in the beginning                  :   it is only in       the end that
the mixture          becomes     appreciably richer in air, and shows                             a slight
rise in pressure.
      Andrews' mixture contained so little air that the critical                                   pheno
mena, even when             tested       with       a view to detecting an influence of
the admixture, would probably not have shown any abnormalities.

    The peculiarities of the condensation           at temperatures below the
critical temperature        do not    come   out properly       in a  pv diagram.
These     phenomena,       as  deduced from Van der Waals' theory of
mixtures,     are found      in previous papers already quoted.
    Below tC (39"25 for b, 35"7 for a) the condensation is retrograde,
that is to say, liquid is formed by compression, the quantity of
which first      increases    and then diminishes        and disappears.         Just
below the critical        temperature the quantity          of liquid formed is
•only very small,       but the lower       the temperature        the   larger the
 maximum       quantity of the liquid becomes.             At last temperatures
are reached where the          " critical phenomenon
                                                           "
                                                              takes place, first at
 the bottom of the column and then at higher levels as the tem
 perature falls.      The critical    phenomenon is here meant to compre
 hend all the phenomena which are displayed when the coexisting
 phases    approach      each   other    and   finally coincide    :   they consist
chiefly in the disappearance of the liquid surface and the formation
 of  a characteristic    bright blue mist in the      substance.     The tempera
 ture at which the critical       phenomenon occurs about at the middle
 of the tube is the plait-point temperature tV (38-35 for h, 35"25
 for a). A few tenths of a degree lower the condensation is normal,
 the quantity of the liquid increasing during compression until the
 whole of the substance is liquid.            The critical phenomenon would
 be confined to the plait-point        temperature,     if it were not for gravi
 tation.     Gravitation      makes the density        and composition        of the
 mixture different at different levels, and the consequence                is a small
 range    of   temperatures (38-2-38-7 for b), at which the critical
 phenomenon takes place at different levels, the higher the tem
 perature the lower the level.
     The point indicating the end of the condensation at the plait-
 point temperature corresponds to the plait-point in Van der "Waals'
 theory.      This point    ( P in the diagram)     does not coincide with the
  top of the border curve M, as will be seen                  even   better in the
  tables, especially for mixture       b.  Evidently     P  is to the left of M, C
  being to the right of M.
     In  the pt diagram (fig. 3) are given the vapour-pressure curve
  for ethane and the two looped vapour-pressure curves for the
  mixtures.       The curve which envelops the loops is the plait-
  point   curve, the point of contact           P corresponding        to the   plait

 points   P   in figs.  1  and 2.      The tops of the loops           M      correspond          to
 the tops of the border-curves              M in   the pv figures.            C is     the   point
 where    a  loop has a tangent parallel to the                    p axis.           Above      the
 temperature       belonging to that point no condensation takes                            place,
 but the critical       phenomenon belongs to the temperature of                                the
 plait-point      which    is  always lower.              The circumstance that                 the
 plait-point      curve rises agrees with            the fact that         P      is found to
 be  to the left of M.
    It is  impossible to say anything about the exact course the                            plait-
 point curve      will follow     outside    the field of observation, except that
 the i'ritical temperature         of the second substance seems to                   be higher
 than for ethane, and the vapour-pressures                    lower.    The        diagram,      as
far  as we can      judge, agrees entirely with the supposition of                       butane
being the second substance,             but this point can only             be decided Ly
preparing butane with              a  view to determine its constants, and                     by
mixing it with        pure ethane        as prepared         by electrolysis.          If  there
was a simple law connecting the critical constants                     of mixtures          with
those of the constituents, we might calculate the constants                             for   the
second substance.           But    such is not the case.          Pawlewski's law           that
the critical temperature is proportional to the composition expressed
in weight units is very inaccurate,              the deviations being sometimes
considerable       in both directions.

Our Perception of                the Direction               of Sound.        By Albert
          Alexander Gray, M.D.                     (Glasgow).        Communicated              hy
          Professor M'Kendrick.
                                   (Read      April  5, 1897.)
      Our power of estimating                the  direction     of sound is much less
 accurate than that of estimating                      the   direction   of    light   ;    and,
 further, our knowledge            as to the way in which             this perception of
 direction       occurs   is   much      more      limited     in   the case of sound.
 "We      judge with the greatest              accuracy      the direction of       a    ray of
  light, and we know that we                  do so almost entirely by the aid of
  the      muscular     sense.      How do           we    judge   the   direction         of    a
   sound     1
       Before attempting         a  reply       to this question       it will    clear      that
   matter      up, to a certain extent, by giving                 a statement       of    a   few
   facts which have          been    found out by experiment, and                   are     well
   attested by various writers             : —
       (1) Individuals who are deaf of one ear have                       little power of
    estimating the direction of sound.
       (2) Individuals who are blind of both eyes generally show
                                                                                                 a
    power of judging the direction of sound far superior to those
    gifted 'with sight.        This    is particularly        true if the eye affection
    dates from      childhood.
        (3) The power of estimating the direction of sound depends
    upon its pitch and its quality.               A pure tone of low pitch is very
    difficult to localise    ;  with     the higher notes          this becomes           easier,
    and    with   a  compound sound it is also easy.
        (4)   The accuracy with whicli              we estimate      the direction of            a
     sound is greatest       when the sound is in the line of axis of the
     two ears, and least when         it  is in the median plane of the body.
        Now, although these statements                  are, generally speaking, true,
     yet  from some experiments which                I   have   performed     I   have      been
     led   to  believe that they must not be considered too                           exactly.
     The experiments were as follows:                —

 stretched a cord exactly                        in the median plane of the body;                                      hr
 was not allowed                    to    move the head.                   A        second cord was tied
 round the subject's neck below                                the ear.             The    sources         of sound
 used     were        a    watch and a tin whistle                    ;    and when the sound was
 produced the subject was asked to point in the direction of the
sound       ;   this was marked                   on the table, and                       the true direction
of the sound was also marked.                                   It    was interesting                to note the
different         degrees           of accuracy           with which                 the watch             and    the
whistle were localised.                        Thus, with the watch an angle formed by
the line of direction                     of the sound and the median plane of                                    the
body had          a    tangent of §£, but was given                            as   angle of tangent              f|;

the axial line of the ears it was given as angle of tangent                                                       if    ;
when held directly in the median plane of the body it was                                                       given
correctly.            With the tin whistle,                     on        the other hand,               all     these
were given                correctly ;          but,   strangely           enough, an angle of                    tan

in front.
     When        one        ear was closed the results                          of     testing        were       very
erratic, both with the watch and the whistle                                          ;   thus, the whistle
was sounded in the axial line of the ears, and opposite the                                                      open
ears;     it     was given               as   being in the axial line of the                           ears, but
opposite        the closed ear!
     From       these        experiments,             therefore,          it   will    be seen          that      the
difficulty of estimating the direction                               of   a     sound directly in front
of the head           is   not always so great             as some             writers have found.
     It   is    not uncommonly                  stated that we are enabled to                              estimate
the direction of              a     sound by the relative intensities with which                                   it
is   heard by the two ears.                       But     it   must be remembered that                           this
is   only       true       for    each        particular       sound,          but    it     is     incorrect      to
suppose         that we can localise all sound with the same degree                                                of
accuracy according to the intensity                                  with which              they are         heard
by the two ears.                 Thus we may estimate the direction                                   of    a   high
note very accurately, while at the same distance we are not                                                      able
to localise       a        sound of low pitch, even                       though          the difference           of
intensity with which the sounds reach the two ears may                                                      be the
same      in both          cases.        Indeed, this may be said to be the crux                                   of

the     whole matter.         Why    are we able to localise a high note or a
compound note having partial               tones better than a low pure tone,
a     fact which experimenters are            agreed    upon (Mach, Lord Kay-
leigh, Dr P. Thompson).
      At    a meeting of the       British Association in August          1877,   Prof.
S. P.       Thompson       read a paper in which he showed that the ear,
or,    rather, the two ears acting together, are enabled to distinguish
differences of the        phase of sound.       The    same     fact was discovered
independently           by   Lord    Kelvin a few months later.                In the
Philosophical Magazine for June 1882, Prof. Sylvanus Thompson
had a paper in which he suggested the possibility that differences
of    the phase with which a sound affects             the two ears may aid in
 determining its direction.
     Thanks       to the kindness      of Prof. MacKendrick,           I was enabled
 to try      these   experiments myself.        One of them was particularly
interesting.         I  selected   two ut4 forks, and loaded one so as to
 give slow        beats   when both were sounded.                They were placed
 several      yards from one another, and a tube was led from the close
 proximity of one into the right ear, and another tube was led from
 the other fork into the left ear.               As the original experimenter
 noticed, beats were heard very distinctly ; similarly, Prof. Thomp
 son noticed that although beats were heard yet the note seemed
 continuous.         For my own part,        I  was able to observe the same
 strange phenomenon, but in my case it required an effort of the
 will   ;   by listening very intently for the note               I was    enabled to
 hear     it absolutely continuously,        but on relaxing        the   attention it
  seemed      interrupted    by the beats.      On the other hand, the beats
  obtruded      themselves upon the mind, no matter                  how intently     I
 listened for the tone and neglected them                ;  there was      no getting
 away from them.
      Some months ago, while attempting to find out by what means
  the two ears       acting together are able to appreciate difference of
  phase,     I  discovered a peculiar fact.        Wishing to produce what
  may     be termed a continuous          positive phase      in one ear while       a
  sound      was conducted        to   the other,    I   selected     an intelligent
 individual      possessed     of normal    hearing     power.        The   tympanic
  membrane of one            ear  was illuminated        in    the usual     way    by
  reflected    light and a speculum, while          a   tuning-fork      was held    a

446           Proceedings      of Royal Society of Edinburgh.                   [ses=
few inches from the other ear.              A  fine probe was then passed
into the   meatus,    and the centre of the tympanic membrane, •with
the    handle    of    the   hammer,    was pushed        gently    inwards,       not
sufficiently,    of course,     to cause pain.      According to the state
ment of      the subject       the sound of the fork was then heard
considerably louder and more localised in the ear opposite which
the fork      was held.        Thinking    that   this   might     be due to an
instinctive    movement of the head away from the ear which was
being touched, and hence nearer to the tuning-fork,                    the experi
ment was repeated,           with this difference     :   the    fork    was    held
vibrating opposite the end of an india-rubber              tube of some length,
the other end of which was inserted into the ear ; thus                      move
ments of the head would not affect the distance of the ear                     from
 the source     of sound.      The result was the       same ; the sound was
heard louder by one ear when the hammer of the opposite                           ear
 was pressed gently inwards.
     Being surprised at the result of these experiments,                 a simpler
 and    coarser    one   was tried.      Holding the fork in            one    hand
 opposite one ear, and estimating its intensity,              the other ear       was
 then closed by the finger;          again the sound was heard louder               in
 the one ear when          the opposite one was closed by pressing                the
 finger into the        meatus.      According to the statement             of    the
 subject    experimented        on,  however,    the    difference     was not      so
 pronounced as in the case with the probe.
     The experiment was again repeated on an individual                       gifted
  with an exceptionally         good ear for music;          the result    was    the
 same.
     Using   a watch       as a   source of sound the same            results    were
 obtained.
     It  appeared to me, therefore, that there existed some                   reflei,
  hitherto   undescribed, between the two ears.               The next     step was
  to find out the path of that reflex.
     By   good    fortune    I was enabled to try the experiment              on an
  individual who had perfect hearing in the right ear, but in whom
  the malleus of the left ear was firmly adherent to the inner wall
  of the tympanum          and quite immovable,      — the result of       suppura
  tion   many     years ago.        On pressing against         this   malleus    the
  sound of the fork held opposite the good ear was unaffected                    ; te

intensity        did not vary in the least even          ¦with   repeated experiments.
 From       this case, therefore, it is evident that the reflex                    does not
 occur      through mechanical irritation             of the branches           of the fifth
 nerve       in the tympanic membrane.
       The experiment was             again    performed upon          a   brother of the
 case just narrated. He              suffered from perforation           and suppuration
 of
 I
        both ears, but with treatment the suppuration was cured                         ;  and
      prevented        adhesions forming, so that he hears well in spite of
  the     perforations.          "When    the   experiments        were      performed       on
  liim     the    same    results were       obtained    as    from    individuals        with
  normal       ears.
       It   may     be  concluded, therefore,        that stimulation         of the nerve
   within      the    labyrinth     of   one    ear   produces      a   change     in     some
   structure in        the   opposite    ear which      enables     the     latter   to    hear
   sound      more     acutely.     The next step is to consider what change
   occurs in the ear opposite              that in which the stimulus has been
   produced by pushing the malleus (and other bonelots) inwards.
       Pollak (Med. JaJirbucher, Wien, Oct. 1892, p. 308) has shown
    that when one ear is stimulated by              a sound      the tensor      tympanum
    of that    ear and also of the opposite           ear are set in action         ;  lie has
    further     shown that this reflex          is produced        better    by high notes
    than by low ones.             Another    fact of importance is that observed
    by Urbantschitsch,          that stimulation of one ear by sound increases
    the hearing power of the opposite                ear ;   in other words, binaural
    audition is more acute than monauraL                    Urbantschitsch attributes
    this fact to the passing           of auditory sensation          from the cerebral
    cortical centre       of one side to that of the other,                 and   hence     the
    intensity of the sound appears to              be greater.       In    the light, how
    ever, of my experiments above               described,    I   would be inclined to
    attribute the increased           hearing power in           the   case     of binaural
    hearing to reflex         action of the intrinsic muscles of the ear.                    In
    these experiments,         at anyrate, the increase of the intensity of the
    sound cannot be due to reflex            sensation    from one cortical auditory
    centre    to the other, because         the stimulus applied to one ear was
    not auditory at        all
       When        we   come     to the question as        to what        structures take
    part in the reflex, we have          two matters to consider: (1) Evidence
    of  a   similar     reflex    occurring between the two ears ; (2) the

448             Proceedings         of Royal Society of Edinburgh.                          [stss.
anatomical relationships of the auditory nerve.                            As regards          the
first of      these,      we      have absolute         evidence      of a similar         reflei
occurring between              the two ears as before            stated, viz., stimulation
of one ear by           a   sound causes contraction of the tensor tympani
of both ears.            It    is therefore probable that this               occurs     in     the
experiments         described.          But    we are     still left   to account      for     the
fact that pressure of the chain of ossicles inwards causes increased
perception       for all notes, low            as  well   as  high  ;  now contraction           of
 the tensor tympani alone                 will not    increase    the acuteness       of hear
ing for low notes            ;   if anything, it will diminish this power.                    "V^e
 must     therefore       seek for some other reflex besides                 this.     I   think
 such    a reflex     will      be found to account for this fact, viz., that of
 the stapedius.            We know that contraction of this muscle increases
 the acuteness         of the hearing power, and if such a reflex could
 be demonstrated               when the chain of ossicles is pressed inwards
 we would         then      be able       to account       for the whole phenomenon.
 Unfortunately            I    can    find    no description        of such      a reflex       in
 physiological         literature,       and      only   experiment upon the living
  animal could give absolute proof.                     From the anatomical relation
  ships    of the accessory nucleus of the cochlea                     and   the nucleus        of
  the facial nerves            before    they leave the medulla, and the way                    in
  which the cochlear nerve decussates, there                       is certainly,      anatomi
  cally speaking,          a    path for such a reflex.            In   the   lower animal*
  a reflex     between        the cochlea and the facial nerve              does take place
  by this path,         viz., the pricking up of the ears when the                       animal
  hears     a   sound     ;    and    I   think    it is highly     probable that        at the
  same moment             a reflex      action of the stapedius           occurs,    could we
  but   see it.     In    the meantime,          however, we must wait for             absolute
   evidence,      and      be     content at present           with    saying     that    in   all
   probability      it does occur,            while    the    reflex action between           the
   cochlea      and    the       tensor     tympani      of   both    ears   certainly      does.
   The path of the reflex                  to  the   tensor    tympani is      as  follows:—
   Afferent impulse from the cochlea                     to tuberculum acousticum,             up
   through the lateral lemniscus to the motor nucleus of                              the fifth
   nerve   ;  from there the efferent impulse passes to the otic                      ganglion,
   and thence to the tensor tympani.*
      *
        To some physiologists,           however, the above explanation of the facts will
   not appear     satisfactory,      because   it is held by some that contraction of the

Trvelvin and Prof. Thompson, that our lower                                               centres,       at     least,
are      cognisant          of     the      relative          positions          of the        two      tympanic
membranes,             and it has occurred to the writer that this may be
one of the means by which we are enabled to estimate the
direction of a sound. Thus it is evident that supposing a sound
to affect two ears in different phases, the two membranes will
not ~be in exactly the same condition at any given moment ; the
 one     may be moving in while the                                   other      is   moving out,             or    one
 may      just beginning its inward movement when the other
          be                                                                                                          is
 completing           it,
                 and so on.    It would not be safe, however,                                                         to
 assume that            such      a     supposition            is     correct,        unless   we       find       facts
 that     bear evidence                in favour of its truth.                         Have     we any such
  facts'?    I     think         the    following         may          be considered as tending to
  corroborate the theory                     advanced         :—
      (1) If      we listen to           a       sound conducted by water, and with our
  ears under          the    water, we lose all sense of the localities of the
  sound      ;   it   appears          to arise      in   the         ear.        In this      case, although
  the membranes              are vibrating               in    and      out,      yet,    as   a   whole, they
  have taken up     position very much further inwards than under
                            a
  normal conditions, because of the pressure of the water. Hence,
  in these        circumstances,                 there
                                                         is
                                                         a            state of matters in               both ears
  similar to that which                     is    produced in one ear by pressing                              in the
  chain of        ossicles with          a   probe, and               we are conscious             of   a     similar
  intra-tympanic   muscles causes diminution of the hearing power.         These
  physiologists would therefore not be satisfied witli that explanation, even
  admitting that     reflex action of the muscles mentioned does occur
                        a                                                   tiny                               ;
  would look for some other cause.          might suggest the following explana

  tion, though, of course,        purely speculative
                                       it   is        When the constant inward
                                                                             :
   pressure of the ossicles produces increased labyrinthine pressure, a constant
   stimulus passes up the auditory nerve to the nuclei in the medulla.       But
   this stimulus     not periodic, and therefore no sound
                       is                                      heard.   But sup           is
   posing    sound to affect the opposite ear at the same time, then the two
             a
   stimuli will mix in the nuclei of the medulla and we may suppose that the
                                                                         ;
   constant stimulus will add to the strength of the periodic one before the
   latter passes on to the higher centres      that is, that     stimulus to one
                                                                  ;                        a
   auditory nerve, even           not of such a nature as to produce a sensation
                                 if    it   is
   of sound by itself, may yet increase the subjective intensity of sound heard                    a
    by the other ear.  Of course, as above stated, such an explanation     purely                         is
   speculative, and must remain so, more or less, until the nature of the nerve-
   current   is   better known than at present.

sensation            in both experiments, viz., a localising of the sound                                           is
the ear.
     (2) Our power of estimating the direction of a sound is much
more     accurate for high notes and compound tones than for Iot
ones.          Now, it may be shown by a simple mathematical process
that changes              in the position              of the source            of a sound              which
reaches both ears              will in         general      produce       greater alterations           in         the
phase with which                  it strikes          the two ears when the note                       is high
than when it is low.
     (3) Prof.            Thompson has shown that the                           two ears do appre
ciate     a difference            in the nature of the sound when the phase*
are always exactly opposite                       in the two ears           ;   and it is not a very
great step to suppose that our ears                           will     perceive          differences when
one tympanum                  is repeatedly,             though not always, moving                           in     a
direction opposite                from the other.
     It   must not be supposed                    that this perception of the difference
phase          by the two               ears     is    necessarily an            auditory          sensatioD.
Indeed, in some experiments its most                                   prominent feature                is      not
of that nature,               e.g.,     if    the sound       of   a   tuning-fork             is led to in?
two ears in such                  a    way that the phases are exactly                         opposite,        the
sound          is,    in its auditory characters,                  pitch etc.,           the    same       as      in
ordinary hearing,                 but    it    seems to       come from             the    middle       of      the
head      ;    thus the peculiar feature                     in this case           is    its locality, not
its auditory character.
     Knowing, therefore,                     that by the aid of two ears we are                        enabled
to perceive differences                  of phase, and having seen that this                           percep
tion      is    not necessarily               auditory,      it   remains to consider by                     what
faculty we do perceive                        the difference.
     In       the middle          ear there           are two muscles,              the tensor        tympani
and       the        stapedius,        and     they are inserted into the malleus                               and
stapes respectively in such                      a     way that with            a   movement           inwards
of the membrana                       tympani the tensor             is   slightly        relaxed      and the
stapedius            is   rendered tense,             and,    conversely, outward                  movement
of     the membrane                   produces        an    opposite result in                 each    muscle.
By this              means,    therefore,         it       would     appear         that we         have        the
faculty         of appreciating the direction of movement of the                                              tym
panic membrane                 occurring simultaneously in the two ears;                                     or,   to
 put      it   in other       words,          we may be able              to perceive variations                   of

the    phase     of      sound-waves         which      reach   the    two     membranes
simultaneously           by means       of the muscular sense.
    If  this view of the matter therefore                    be   correct, it is evident
that we will be assisted in judging of the direction of a sound by
means      of the muscular sense.                 And further, it is probable that
not only may this sense give us information of the difference of
phase     in the       two ears, but         it may also help         us   in   estimating
differences     of intensity in the sound as heard by the two ears,
for it is plain that in that             ear   in which the sound is most intense
the strain put upon the muscles                    will   be greater than in the ear
in which      the sound is less loud.
    Thus, according to the explanation                    advanced above,       the senses
of hearing and sight have this in common, that                            the   means    by
 which we estimate direction resides in the muscular sense.
    Of   course,     other characteristics          of sound help us in estimating
its direction      :    differences of intensity           and differences of quality
with which it         is heard by the two ears.              The latter characteristic,
quality,     will     be    of especial value in enabling             us to judge       the
direction     of sounds with which our ear is well acquainted, and is
thus for the most part associative.                      These, however, are outside
the range of the present paper.
    Before closing         I  would    like    to point    out a matter in which the
experiments        described above might be put to practical                      use.    It
was shown that               when the chain          of bones      was pressed      gently
inwards,     a tuning         (or watch) held opposite the other ear was
heard louder        ;   and it was shown, further, that this was due to a
stimulus passing from the labyrinth of that ear.                         Now, in    a con
dition such       as     fixation   of the stapes         in the fenestra ovalis, it is
obvious that this reflex could not occur.                      The experiment might
therefore      be     used     for  the diagnosis of such a condition.                   On
a  priori grounds it would                  appear to be a good negative               test,
but    not   a   valuable positive one.                That is to     say,   if  a patient
heard the sound              better in the opposite ear during                the inward
pressure of the chain               of ossicles,     then we could         safely assume
that    the stapes          was    not    fixed.      But the      converse     might   not
always be true, because               the subject might not notice any differ
 ence, even though            the stapes were free.
     As this affection is usually                  difficult   of   diagnosis, the      test

452         Proceedings    of Royal Society of Edinhurgh.                 [sess.
suggested   deserves   a   trial.   The subject, however,         is one for
surgical consideration.

           fessor Fraser, M.D., LL.D., F.R.S.
                                         (Read    July    5,   1897.)
                                                (Abstract.)
      In   a       paper communicated             to this Society           I   stated that, when
introduced            into the stomach of an animal, serpents' venom pro
duces no obvious injury, even when the quantity is so large as to
be sufficient to           kill 1000 animals of                the same species and weight                if
the venom were injected under the skin.*                                 The failure of   so   highly
toxic a substance              to produce poisoning when it is administered by
the stomach might be due to chemical changes                                     produced upon it
by the secretions of the stomach and intestines, or to non-absorb
ability into           the    blood from          the stomach and intestines.                       It    is
already known that the toxicity of venom is not materially reduced
by gastric digestion. Although at first sight incompatible with
the innocuousness of stomach administration, this fact is not in
reality        a           for the absorbing power of
                   contradiction of       it,                                           the stomach
for many organic substances even for strychnine — has
                           —                                                            been shown
to be          extremely       slight,    and their            entrance into the circulation
appears to occur not in the stomach but in the intestines.
      As serpents' venom introduced into the stomach                              is   not rendered
innocuous by the stomach secretions, while,                                  notwithstanding,            it
fails to cause poisoning,                it   may be assumed              that the stomach walls
are incapable              of absorbing it.          If, like           other poisons,   it    can       be
absorbed            from     the intestines,        the explanation             of the failure           to

 ters soon after entering the intestinal           canal, and most probably,
 therefore,   by the bile or the pancreatic secretion.
    To fully explain the innocuousness of stomach administration
 would accordingly require that the effects on venom of the biliary
 and other intestinal       secretions should be investigated, and also the
 absorbability of venom through the intestinal walls.
    As  a  contribution to the settlement of the question,           I have   made
a number of experiments          with the biliary secretion     ; and whatever
may be the influence of the other secretions or of intestinal absorp
tion, that of the bile has been found to be so decided as to be
in itself sufficient      to  account for the innocuousness of stomach
administration.
    The bile from the gall-bladder of          the  African  cobra, puff-adder,
rattlesnake, and grass snake was used, and each bile was tested
against the venom of the African and the Indian cobra.*                    For the
most part, the experiments were made by mixing various quantities
of each bile with a little more than the minimum-lethal                 dose of the
venom, and then injecting this mixtirre               under   the skin of the
animal.      The object of the experiments         was not only to determine
if  the bile can render venom innocuous, but also,               if it have this
power, what is the smallest quantity of bile capable of doing it.
As bile varies much in its concentration, it            was always weighed in
the dry form, so as to remove avoidable fallacies in dosage and in
any comparison that might be made between the bile of different
animals.
    Taking first the venom of the African cobra, its minimum-lethal
dose   for rabbits    was    determined     and found to be -000245 grm.
p. kilo., but a    slightly larger    dose  — viz., '00025 grm. —was taken
as the minimum-lethal.
    The experiments were made by mixing together and leaving in
contact with each other for ten minutes this dose of venom with a
dose of bile, each     substance having been dissolved in             a  few 10th?

have received (December 1896) the bile of the puff-adder.          The rattlesnake

the animal.
     "When this was done with the hile of the same serpent, the
African cobra, death occurred when the                 dose of bile was '00008
grm. p. kilo, or less, but recovery when the quantity                  was "0001,
 •00015,      0002, or -0005.        "With rattlesnake bile, death occurred
when the quantity of bile was             "00025    grm. p. kilo, or any smaller
quantity, but recovery when it was -0003, -00035, -0004, or -0005
 grm. p. kilo.        "With puff-adder bile, death occurred when the dose
 was -0005 or '00075 grm. p. kilo., but recovery when it was '001,
  002, -0025, or -003 grm. p. kilo.
      To render the evidence still more obvious, experiments were              also
 made with       a  larger dose of African cobra venom, viz., -00026 grm.
 p.   kilo., — a  dose   which is fatal    to a rabbit   in less than eight hours.
 When mixed with the bile of the same serpent, "0025, -00225, -002,
 and -00175 grm. p. kilo, was each sufficient to prevent death, which,
 however, followed when the quantity was "0015 grm. p. kilo, or                    a
  smaller quantity.         When mixed with          the bile of the puff-adder,
  •003    or -0025 grm. p.       kilo,  was   sufficient to render this dose of
  venom non- lethal, but -002 and '001 grm. p. kilo, were insufficient.
      Similar experiments were made with the venom of the Indian
  cobra,    but while the dose taken as the minimum-lethal                was the
  same as     in  the first series    of experiments with the venom of the
  African cobra — viz.,       -0025     grm. p. kilo. — this dose really repre
  sented a larger excess over the minimum-lethal.                 The results were
  that rattlesnake bile in a        dose of -00025 grm. p. kilo, was insuffi
  cient    to render this dose       of Indian cobra venom non-lethal, but
  was sufficient      in  a dose   of "0005, -0004, -00035, or -0003 grm. p.
  kilo. ; that African cobra bile was insufficient             in doses of -00075,
    0005, -0004, -0003,       and -00025 grm., but sufficient in doses of
    002   and -001 grm. p. kilo. ; and that puff-adder bile was insuffi
   cient   in  doses    of -001,  "002,   -0025, and -00275, but sufficient       in
  doses of -00325 and -003             grm. p. kilo.
       It was thus shown that the bile of venomous serpents is able,
   when mixed        with the venom of serpents,        to prevent lethal doses of
   the latter from producing           death  ; and that the bile is indeed so
   powerful an agent in doing this that a quantity actually smaller
   than the quantity       of venom may be sufficient for the purpose.            It

 need scarcely be added that the doses of bile thus shown to                    be
 sufficient represent only minute portions of the bile stored in               th>
 gall-bladder of    a  serpent, and that a serpent, therefore, has at it-
 disposal enough of bile to prevent injury from venom introduced
 into the     stomach     in  quantities     many    times greater than        the
 minimum-lethal.
    It appeared of interest to examine in          a  similar manner the     bile
 of innocuous serpents and of other animals.
    All  serpents,  innocuous   as  well   as venomous, exhibit a resistance
 against the toxic action of venoms introduced              subcutaneously      or
 directly into the circulation, which is not dependent on their being
 cold-blooded animals.       Various facts,     some of which     are anatomi
cal, tend to show that the innocuous, equally with the venomous
serpents,    possess poison glands and secrete          venom.     The former
are innocuous      only in the sense that they are not normally              fur
nished with weapons of offence in the form of poison fangs.                Most
probably, therefore, the relative protection against the poisonous
action of venom introduced         into the circulation, which is common
to serpents, is dependent upon an effect             produced upon them by
the venom which         they all secrete,     although in    the case   of    the
innocuous serpents only in relatively small quantities.
    Experiments      that were   made      with the bile of     the  innocuous
grass   snake have confirmed          this  supposition.     When     tested in
rabbits against -00025 grm. p. kilo, of the venom of the Indian
cobra, '002, -0045, and "0055 grm. p. kilo, were found insufficient
to prevent     death, but "0065, -0075, and -01 grm. p. kilo, was each
found to be able to prevent death.             The smallest quantity of the
bile of this innocuous serpent necessary          to prevent death is there
fore considerably larger than that of the feeblest of the biles of
venomous serpents, but still is only a small quantity.
    Experiments    were also made with the bile of the ox, as repre
senting those animals which          do not secrete venom or possess any
protection against vnnom introduced            into the subcutaneous tissues
or into the circulation, while at the same time they are unaffected
by venom introduced into the stomach.                It was  found that when
mixed with -00025 grm. p. kilo, of the Indian cobra venom, this
bile failed in rabbits to prevent death in doses of              "01  and  "015
grm. p. kilo., but succeeded         in  doses of '02, -03, *04, "07, and    i5

rm.       p. kilo.     The bile of the ox, therefore, is able to antagonise
ie      toxic action of       serpents'   venom,       its antagonising       power, how-
ver,      being only about the one-seventieth                 of that of the strongest
f     the   biles of venomous serpents             that have been tested.             It  was
hown        by other experiments that the bile of the rabbit and of the
jiiinea-pig       also possesses this anti-venomous property, and also                      in
k    degree which, though feeble when compared                          with    the bile of
venomous serpents, is yet in itself considerable.
     While,      therefore,    it may now be assumed                that the bile of all
inimals        is   anti-venomous,      the     difference      observed      between     the
potency of the bile of venomous serpents when contrasted with
that of ordinary animals suggests that the anti-venomous property
must be dependent, at least in part, on some                         specific   constituent
or constituents present in different quantities in                   the bile of different
animals.          As this constituent      is most largely present in the bile of
venomous          serpents,    an endeavour         was made        to separate     it from
 their bile.        For this    purpose, absolute        alcohol was added        in excess
to a concentrated solution of              the bile of the pull-adder, of which              I
 possessed      a greater    quantity, though still only small, than that of
 any other         venomous       serpent.       liy this       means,    the    substances
 soluble      in alcohol, consisting of             the,   bile salts and of       a    small
  quantity of bile         pigments,    were       separated      in solution from the
  substances insoluble in alcohol, consisting of proteids and of the
  bulk of    the bile pigments,        and     it was hoped          also  of the special
  anti-venomous         constituent.     "Water       was then       added     to the    sub
  stances insoluble in alcohol, and the watery solution, after having
  been    centrifugalized,       was   evaporated         to   dryness over       sulphuric
  acid   in the vacuum          of an air pump.            The alcoholic solution was
  also dried, in       the   first place     on   a   water bath at         100°   F., and
  afterwards in vacuo over sulphuric acid.                    This analysis      was made
  with the whole of the bile at my disposal for the purpose, which,
  however,     weighed only        '5 grm., and from it          "45 grm.   of substances
   soluble in alcohol and -05 grm.             of those insoluble were obtained.
  The extraction of the latter with water yielded only                      "02 grm.     of  a
   ilark green       solid, representing,       therefore, about the one-twenty-
   sixth part of the original bile.
      Several experiments were made with each of the two products.
   When the product consisting of the substances                       soluble in alcohol

was tested against the minimum-lethal dose of Indian cobra venom,
it   was found to be incapable of preventing death                        in rabbits when         ths
doses of   it   were     02, -01, '005, -004, and "0027 grm. ; and                        in white
rats when the doses were '001, "00045,                              and "00027      grm. p. kilo.
The anti-venomous quality of this bile, therefore, is not appreci
ably, if at all, dependent on the constituents soluble in alcohol,
which include all the bile salts.
   When, on the other hand, the part of the alcohol precipitate
soluble in water was tested in white rats against the minimum-
lethal dose of the same venom, while death occurred with -0000OS
grm. p. kilo., recovery occurred with "00001, "00002, "000025, and
"00003     grm. p. kilo.            As the quantity of this product                      was     very
small, the       experiments were restricted to white                           rats,    for which
animals the minimum-lethal                 dose of Indian cobra venom is slightly
less    than "0003 grm. p.               kilo., and the smallest quantity of the
dried natural bile of the puff-adder required to prevent death from
this dose of venom is "00025 grm. p. kilo.                              The extremely small
quantity of "00001 grm. of this bile product                            is,   therefore, capable
of preventing death in the same circumstances as 00025 grm. of
the original bile.
     The isolation of the anti-venomous constituent                            made     it    possible
to obtain further and different evidence of the power of bile to
render venom inert.    Although the bile in its original form
possesses       much      power         in antagonising              venom     when       the     two
substances        are    mixed       together in vitro, only "0003 grm.                             of
rattlesnake bile or           "02    grm. p. kilo, of ox bile being required                        to
render     a    minimum-lethal           dose       of Indian cobra venom innocuous,
it   cannot be too distinctly stated — for the facts are also applicable
to the antidotism            between disease toxines and anti-toxines                          — that
these data are apt to give an exaggerated conception of the curative
 value of the antidote when                    it   is    administered        after the venom.
 Generally       speaking, even when no more than the minimum-lethal
 dose    of venom       is   used,      the quantity           of the antidote required                is
 from 1600 to 2000 times greater in the latter than in the former
 condition      of administration.              Although, while in the alimentary
 canal, bile     is   non-toxic,    it   is   altogether different when             it   is   injected
 under the skin or into             a   blood-vessel.              The bile salts and the bile
 pigments then act as poisons                 ;     and   if   a   dose of bile were injected

under        the skin containing    a  sufficient quantity of the anti-venomous
constituent to antagonise a minimum-lethal dose of venom received
lialf-an-hour previously, the constituents of the bile which are non-
 antidotal, but at the same time toxic, might be so great in amount
 as     to produce death.        Thus, in an experiment made with African
 cobra bile, administered, in          a dose estimated     to be sufficient,       thirty
 minutes after         a  minimum-lethal       dose of cobra      venom had been
 injected        subcutaneously,      the    animal     survived    for    four     days ;
  -whereas an animal used in a control experiment without bile died
  in six     hours.    During   the two days before death, the animal which
  had received both bile and            venom    exhibited symptoms,           however,
  which       were rather those of bile than of venom poisoning.
       It  is improbable, therefore, that the bile in its natural form could
   be used      as  an antidote except by stomach            administration         or by
   application to the wound caused by            a   snake-bite.
       The successful result of the attempt made to isolate its antidotal
   constituent has, however, rendered it possible                to test     the    thera
   peutic value       of this constituent      when it is introduced           into the
   blood of an animal which had already received                    a  lethal dose of
   venom.       The quantity at my disposal being only small,                  no more
   than one experiment could be made               ;  and for the same reason, it
   was made        on a white rat.       Thirty minutes after        the animal had
   received     by subcutaneous injection         "0003   grm.   p.   kilo, of Indian
   cobra venom, '012 grm.— equivalent to '075 grni. p.                   kilo.— of       the
   part soluble in water of the          alcoholic precipitate of puff-adder bile
    was injected under the skin of the opposite           side of the body.          Only
   slight symptoms of the action of the venom were manifested,                          con
   sisting chiefly of loss of appetite and indisposition           to go about       ;   but
    they had completely disappeared           at the end of twenty-four           hours.
    In   a  control experiment,     a   white rat of almost the same weight
    received by subcutaneous        injection    a   part of the same solution of
    Indian cobra venom, representing also            a dose  of "0003 grm.       p.    kilo.
    Grave symptoms were          produced in      a   few hours,    and    the animal
    was dead on the      following day.
       This experiment, taken in conjunction               with the       considerable
    number of in vitro experiments that have been made, not only
    supplies strong confirmation          of the evidence     given by the latter
    experiments      that bile is able to render serpents'        venom inert, but

464            Proceedings     of Royal Society of Edinburgh.
also suggests that from bile there may be produced an antidote for
snake     poisoning, which, in its antidotal value, is at least equal to
the    most powerful        antivenene       or antivenomous senim             as     yet
obtained from the blood of immunised animals.
    It  is interesting to find that serpents'           bile enters into the com
 position of the medicines most trusted in for the treatment of snake
 bite by the natives of Africa.            Several specimens of native snake
 medicines have been sent to me, which contain bile along with
 many other ingredients, such           as serpents' heads,     dried and powdered
 with the retained        venom     glands.     As   I  have    stated  in  a   former
 communication, venom           itself is used by stomach          administration      as
 an antidote, but many "snake              doctors" consider that bile         is more
 effective.     It  is employed    by them not only by stomach administra
 tion but also by rubbing it into the wound inflicted by the serpent.
 A " snake doctor," with          a   high local reputation, informed            one of
 my correspondents that bile is the better antidote, but                      that,    as
 venom can bo more largely obtained, he uses                 it in the first instance,
 and reserves       the bile for employment should the recovery                  of the
 patient appear doubtful.            When     asked to assist in procuring           ser
  pents' gall-bladders in order that the bile might be examined, he
 hesitated,    and then exclaimed,          " Oh !  they are beginning        to learn
 too much ;
                 "                                    lest his practice
                     being obviously alarmed                               should      be
 injured.
     The interest associated         with this action of bile is probably             not
  restricted   to its effect on venoms.         Analogies in composition          would
  suggest    that the same action is exerted upon the toxins of                 disease,
  a suggestion     which also receives support from the further                 analogy
  that many of these toxins — such as those of tetanus and diphtheria-
  while notoriously active when present              in the blood, are inert       when
  introduced into the stomach.             Even when circulating in the           blood,
  toxins, in common         with other organic poisons, are probably               being
  constantly eliminated into the alimentary canal, where they                     would
  at once lose their destructive power by coming into contact with
  bile, and thereby the total effective            quantity of the toxin in          the
  body would be reduced.             There are also many poisonous         substances
  generated      in   the intestinal     canal,  which      in   some circumstances
  produce poisoning.         The production of this auto-intoxication               may
  partly be due to the failure of the liver to secrete a sufficient             amount

of   healthy bile     ;  and the therapeutic value of cholagogue substances,
so     long employed on empirical grounds,              may   thus also obtain   a
satisfactory explanation.
     Bile is produced in large quantity by all animals, and it is
 present in the intestinal canal throughout its whole length ; but
 beyond      the fact that     it is an important excretion, removing waste
 products from the body, its functions            are not known to be of high
 value.       So much is this the        case, that a recent authority has re
  marked, " the bile is a         most  elaborate   secretion ; it is poured  into
  the intestine, and finds        apparently little to   do." *    To such recog
  nised functions of the bile        as the   promotion of fat absorption and
  those dependent upon its laxative and indirect antiseptic properties,
  there may now be added the additional function of rendering inert
  many organic      poisons introduced into or produced in the alimentary
   canal.

On the Electrification of Air by Uranium and its Com
       pounds. By J. Carruthers Beattie, D.Sc. With a Note
       by Lord Kelvin, G.C.V.O., F.R.S., etc. etc.
                               (Read June 7, 1897.)
    § 1.  It is proposed in the following paper to describe experiments
made to test      the electric   state of the air   in the neighbourhood of
metallic uranium, or of other metals on which               a salt of uranium
had been deposited from a solution, when these were charged to a
positive or    a negative potential.
    § 2. Method employed.           To  test the electric state of the air    the
electric filter method* due to Kelvin, Maclean, and Gait was em
ployed.      The special filter    used  in the experiments    to be described
was a block-tin pipe,       10 cms.   long and    1  cm. diameter, filled   with
brass filings.      This was insulated on two tunnelled        pieces of paraf
fin, and put in metallic connection             with the insulated       pair of
quadrants of a quadrant electrometer.             From   one of the   tunnelled
pieces of paraffin a metal tube led to an air pump           ; from the other
 a piece   of india-rubber tubing led to the place where the air to be
tested was.        This air was then drawn through the electric filter,
 and the deviation from the metallic zero of the electrometer, when
 the two pairs of quadrants were insulated, was noted.            To give some
 idea of the efficiency of the filter, the results obtained when air
 was    pumped away from the neighbourhood of the electrodes of a
 Ruhmkorff inductorium           (Apps. pattern, 10-inch spark)          will be
 given.
     When    the electrodes were near enough to admit of sparks passing
 it was found that air, drawn from the immediate neighbourhood of
 the positive electrode, gave      a positive electrification of +  1 -5 volts on
 the electrometer after one minute of pumping at the rate of twelve
 strokes per minute.        When the air      was drawn from the immediate
 neighbourhood of the negative electrode, a negative electrification
 of   - 2"5  volts in half a minute was observed.

      When the      electrodes    were drawn so far apart that sparking did
not take      place,     air drawn from the positive electrode                 raised   the
filter to a    potential of      +   *7  of  a  volt after one minute's pumping            ;
air    drawn from the neighbourhood of the negative                      electrode    gave
a reading of        -  1 -5 of a  volt in the same time.
      When    the negative       electrode     was connected       to the cathode of a
Crookes'      tube,     air drawn from the immediate neighbourhood                        of
the     cathode     through the filter caused an electrometer deviation
 equivalent to       a  potential of       - -8  of a volt.     Air drawn from          the
 immediate       neighbourhood           of the wire       connecting the         negative
 electrode to the cathode             caused a deviation       equivalent to        - "7  of
 a volt.     Air drawn from the neighbourhood of the anode or of the
  wire connecting the anode to the positive terminal of the coil gave
 a positive reading on the electrometer                   less  in amount than the
  corresponding       negative    reading.
      § 3. Electrification      of air by metallic uranium.             To examine the
   electric state of the air in the neighbourhood of metallic uranium
   charged to     a  given potential, the following            experimental arrange
   ment was      made.       A    metallic      cylinder,   24 cms. length, 8          cms.
   diameter, was constructed.               One end of this was closed with                a
   piece of the same metal         ;   in this end was     a hole    into which     a  plug
   of tunnelled paraffin was placed            ;  from the paratlin     a piece   of india-
   rubber tubing about          \h feet long led to the electric filter.                The
   other end of the metallic cylinder was closed with a disc of paraffin,
   in the centre      of which       a hole     was made     to admit air from the
   laljoratory.      This   hole   was filled      with cotton wool.         The metallic
   uranium,     5"5    cm.   diameter,      '5   cm. thickness, was         insulated     on
    paraffin inside the cylinder.              The cylinder      itself was laid on         a

468         Proceedings       of Royal Society of Edinburgh.
block of paraffin.     The arrangement will easily           be understood   from
the diagram on      p. 467.
    In  the  first instance     a piece   of lead of the same size as           the
uranium was insulated on paraffin in the metallic cylinder,                    and
was connected      to the case of the electrometer.           The metal cylinder
was also connected      to the electrometer case.           Air drawn from     the
cylinder through the filter caused no deviation from the metallic
zero of the electrometer.          When     the lead was disconnected from
the case of the electrometer         and joined to one terminal of a battery
and    the other terminal connected          to the case of the electrometer
 no electrification of the air was observed with the lead at potentials
 up to ± 95 volts.
    "When the uranium was insulated             in  the metallic cylinder, anil
 this latter was of copper polished inside, the following results           were
 obtained.
     With uranium and          the  copper    cylinder     connected  to case of
 electrometer    a positive electrification of the air was observed,         such
 that an electrometer        deviation of + -05 of a volt was produced         per
 minute, the pump being worked at the rate of twelve strokes                   per
 minute.     The uranium was disconnected            from the electrometer    case
 and joined to one terminal of a battery, the other terminal and the
 copper cylinder      being connected      to the case of the electrometer.

nected to the case of the electrometer, and the copper cylinder
joined    to       the other terminal.                   With this arrangement it was
found that there was                 a    negative electrification             of the air with the
positive terminal connected to the copper cylinder, and                                          a   positive
electrification          with the negative terminal connected to the                                    same
cylinder; the amounts of                         these   electrifications        per minute were
exactly       equal to the electrification                       of the same sign when                   the
uranium was connected to the battery and the cylinder to the case.
Thus, with the cylinder                       at + 22 volts, a negative electrification of
the air was produced, which gave                             a   deviation on the electrometer
per minute of pumping equivalent to                               - •40   of a volt.
   The    same results were obtained                         after the inside surface of the
copper cylinder had been oxidised.
   With the uranium insulated in                         a   zinc cylinder and with uranium
and cylinder             connected to case, an electrometer reading equal                                  to
 - 0-l   of    a    volt per minute of pumping was observed.                                     With an
aluminum            cylinder        and the same                 connections a slight                positive
electrification          of the air was observed.                       With    a lead cylinder             a
negative electrification of                    - '05 of a volt         per minute was found.
   The results obtained when the uranium was kept at                                             a   definite
potential      and the cylinder connected to case were the same as in
the experiments with the copper cylinder.                                   That   is,   the nature of
the metal of the vessel surrounding                              the uranium did not influence
the extent to which the air was electrified.
   In all          cases    the air           in the metallic cylinder                 was       electrified
positively when the uranium was electrified positively, negatively
when the uranium                   was         electrified       negatively, and always, for                a
given positive potential of the uranium, the air was electrified more
strongly positive than               it       was negative for          a   like negative potential
of the uranium.                  The electrification of the air attained                     a   maximum
when the uranium was charged to                                  a   potential between + 10 and
 ±22 volts.
   The uranium was next wrapped in aluminium foil and again
insulated in the lead cylinder. The air drawn away from the
cylinder       was found                 to     be   negatively           or positively          electrified
according           as     the    aluminium-foiled                   uranium   was negatively              or
positively          electrified.          The maximum                  electrification       of air was
obtained with the covered uranium charged to about                                       6   volts.      The

470          Proceedings     of Royal Society of Edinburgh.                     [s
effects were less than those obtained         with   the uranium alone.           For
example, with the aluminium-foiled           uranium kept at + 2 volts             and
the lead cylinder to case       ;  or with first to case and cylinder at           —  2
volts, the electrification of the air drawn through the filter caused
an electrometer deviation of + -11 of a volt per minute of                pumping.
With     + 10 volts the electrometer deviation was +0*05 per                 minute
with +95,      + "015    of a volt per minute.        The negative electrifica
tions of the air with the uranium kept at             - 2, - 10,    or at 95 volts
and the metallic        cylinder    to the case of the electrometer              were
smaller than the corresponding positive electrification.
    Finally,   the uranium        was placed     inside    a   paraffin    cylinder.
Bound the outside of this cylinder tinfoil was wrapped.                         With
both uranium and tinfoil connected to case, the air drawn from the
cylinder    showed no signs of electrification.              With the uranium
positively or negatively electrified, the air was found to be positively
or negatively electrified.         The amount of the electrification for any
given     voltage depended, however, on the order in which                          the
voltages were taken.            For example, after the tinfoil             wrapped
 round the paraffin cylinder          had been connected to the positively
 electrified terminal of the battery and the uranium to case, it was
 found that the air drawn through the filter caused an electrometer
 deviation of    - "235   of  a   volt per minute.       In   the succeeding six
 minutes, while the tinfoil was kept at 10 volts and the uranium
 connected to case, the electrometer deviation               was +     "7  of a volt
 per minute.        In  the next two minutes it was +            "6   of a volt per
  minute, and six minutes later it was +          "3 of a volt.      Both uranium
 and tinfoil were next connected to         case, and in the first two minutes
 there was an electrometer deviation of            - "6 of  a  volt por minute of
 pumping.       In   the second     two minutes this deviation fell to           - '13
 of a volt per minute.        With the uranium connected            to case and the
 tinfoil kept     at a potential     of +10 volts, the air was found to be
  negatively electrified, the amount of this electrification decreased in
  10 minutes     from   - "65   of a volt in the first minute to            - '2   of a
  volt in the tenth minute.         On again connecting both uranium                and
  tinfoil to case, the air was found to be +       ly electrified   :  the deviation
  obtained in the first minute was + '65 of a volt, in the 8th + '15 of

"uranium          were used — uranium acetate and uranium                          nitrate.         The
nitrate      was deposited          on a strip of platinum.                 The platinum was
then       insulated on paraffin in the copper cylinder described                             above.
The        same series of experiments were gone through, and results of
the    same nature as those                 described       in   §   3   were obtained.            The
electrifications             of air observed        were,    however,        much smaller in
amount.            The acetate was deposited              on tinfoil, and placed in a zinc
cylinder which               was provided with a mica                window.        By means of
this window ultra violet light from                      an arc lamp could be caused to
shine on          the acetate.       The electrifications of air were the same in
kind       as those      already described, and were of about the same amount
 as   those obtained with             the nitrate of uranium.                    "When   the ultra
 violet light           was shone on the acetate             the electrification of the air
 produced did not differ from that which was produced with ordi
 nary light.

         air drawn from space surrounding electrified uranium.
      In    some of our previous experiments                         with    high voltage?           we
 found       sparks to pass between                 uranium          and other metals* ap
 parently according to the laws of disruptive discharge subject to
 hut little modification by the special                     quasi-conductivity induced in
 air by the 'uranium                rays.'     On the other hand, all our experi
 ments with voltages, less than 500 or 600 volts per cm. of line of
 force in the air at ordinary atmospheric pressure                               seem to be not
 sensibly influenced by disruptive charges or by brushes                                 ;   and the
 quasi-conductivity              of air induced by uranium was the dominant
 factor.          This       is undoubtedly        the   case    in the experiments now
 described by Dr Beattie, and                  I   assume it to be          so   in what follows,
 except when             I   give express warning of possible               liability    to disrup
 tive discharges.
      The effective conductivity induced in the air by the uranium in
 fluence is of course greatest in the immediate neighbourhood of the
 uranium, but there is something of it throughout the enclosure.
 Hence       it   may be expected           that electricity of the same kind                 as    that
 of the uranium will be deposited in the air close around                                     it,   and
 electricity of the opposite kind in the air near the enclosing metal

 surface.    According      to  our   former    experiments*          the   quantity
 flowing from either the uranium or from the surrounding metal per
 sq. cm.   of its surface increases but little with increased voltage
 when this exceeds 5 or 10 volts per cm.              Now, when the greatest
 diameter of the uranium is small in comparison with distances                      to
 the outer metal surface, the voltage per cm. is much greater along
 the lines of force near the uranium           surface    than near their outer
ends on the surrounding          metal.     Hence the rate of discharge of
electricity   into   the air from the uranium            will    cease to increase
sensibly with the difference of potential between the uranium and
the surrounding metal, while the rate of discharge of the opposite
electricity from the large surrounding metal surface is still notably
increasing.     Hence    if the dimensions and          shapes     of the uranium
and of the surrounding          metallic surface are such that for small
voltages, such       as    10  or 20    volts   of    difference      between    the
uranium     and the surrounding          metal,     the   electricity    lodged    in
the air by discharge from the uranium                 preponderates over that
discharged from        the   surrounding     metal, the excess          must come
to a maximum         and diminish,     possibly even        down     to zero,  with
greater differences       of   potential  :  and     at    potential    differences
still greater  the electricity    lodged in the air from the outer metal
may preponderate, and the electricity             in the air drawn off and
given to the filter be of opposite sign to that of the uranium which
was found with the lower voltages            :   provided      the configuration*
are such, and tlie voltages are      so moderate     that disruptive discharge
does not intervene    to any   practically disturbing        extent.

On Supersaturation and its Dependence on Crystalline
  Form. By W. W. J. Nicol, M.A., D.Sc ., F.R.S.E., F.I.C.
                                           (Read May 8, 1897.)
   The phenomenon                     of    Supersaturation                  in    certain    well-marked
instances     is familiar             to every student, and may briefly be defined
as consisting in the retention                       in solution            at a low temperature of a
quantity of        a   substance sufficient to form a saturated solution at                                            a
higher temperature.                   So long         as   the temperature is not allowed to
fall below        a certain point, and the solution                               is not brought in con
tact with      a       particle       of   the       solid substance or with                  a        substance
isomorphous            with     it,   the solution          is   in perfectly stable equilibrium.
The      researches        of Gernez and many others have established this
now generally            accepted          fact, that, the temperature remaining con
stant, the sole cause which                     is   able to disturb the equilibrium                        of the
solution     is   contact with             a    crystal of the same form                     as   that which
will crystallise           out from the solution.
  In    paper
         a               communicated                 to this Society               nearly twelve years
ago,* described series of experiments on supersaturation which
        I                     a
had forced me to the conclusion that in the strict sense of the word
 no solution       is   ever supersaturated,                 a   conclusion which            I     found had
been reached by Loewel                     t     nearly fifty years before,                   as       the result
 of his investigations on the solubility of sodium sulphate.                                             Shortly
 stated, the views of Loewel and myself were that                                       a   supersaturated
 solution    isa       saturated or non-saturated                       solution of the anhydrous
 salt, the term anhydrous                   being used by me as                     a   convenient moans
 of indicating          that no definite                  hydrate      exists in the solution, but
 that the whole of the water                     is   in the same relation to the salt.
   In    the paper referred to above, and in two                                  J   subsequent ones,            I
 showed that           a   supersaturated             solution         was able to dissolve more
 salt even when            it   was as concentrated                    as    the solution obtained by

using dry crystals of sodium thiosulphate (Na.,S.203,5H2O)                              ; also,
that supersaturated solutions can be easily prepared                             in the    cold,
and therefore that supersaturation is not                        a   property conferred        on
the solution by heat,               as   many supposed       ;     and,   further,   thai,    by
evaporation at the ordinary temperature,                        supersaturated solutions
yielded crystals, not of the ordinary hydrate, but of a lower                                one
containing       less      water.        Other     experiments — for          an   account      of
which reference must be made to the original                          papers — showed      con
clusively that the physical properties of                     a    solution underwent         no
abrupt change           when it passed into the region of supersaturation.
either by fall of temperature or by increase in its concentration.
    The question whether supersaturation ever occurs in the solution?
of salts which crystallise without                    water is generally regarded              a?
undecided, while              the    many well-marked              examples to be found
amongst      organic compounds are passed over in silence, inasmuch
as   the    conditions         preclude      the    possibility      of the    formation       of
hydrates or compounds analogous                       to them,        and consequently        an
explanation        which is fairly satisfactory              in the case of hydrate!
salts is here        inapplicable.
    Shortly after the publication of the experiments on supersatura
tion referred to above, my attention was drawn to the work of
Frankenheim * on the crystalline form of potassium nitrate. I had
found in the course               of other work        that this salt was abnormally
soluble in solutions of sodium nitrate, and it struck me that                               this
was probably due to the solubility                   of the unusual, hexagonal           modi
fication     of    potassium nitrate             isomorphous          with   sodium    nitrate
being greater than that of the usual rhombic modification.                            I there
 fore repeated         Frankenheim's           experiment      :   a  small drop of     strong
solution of potassium              nitrate was placed under             a  low-power    micro
scope,     and    allowed        to    evaporate     spontaneously at the ordinary
 temperature       :    as    evaporation        proceeded,        rhombohedral       crystals
 made     their appearance,             and   in some cases continued to grow                  in
size   and number until                the   water had entirely             evaporated.       In
 other    cases,    more       usually, rhombic prisms put in an appearaneo
 after   a  time, growing with great rapidity, thus indicating super-
 saturation.         It    was    further     found that if         a  drop from which          a

number of rhombohedra          had crystallised out, which was therefore
undoubtedly      saturated to that form, was             stirred     with     a   needle
which had been cleaned by heating               to redness,       no crystallisation
of the rhombic form was induced, but               if  the   needle was touched
with    a rhombic     crystal  and again brought            in contact with            the
solution, instant separation of the rhombic variety ensued, and the
rhombohedra,        when   touched     by the      prismatic      crystals,      became
opaque and developed prisms shooting out on all sides.                        In   short,
the solution exhibited all the phenomena of supersaturation.
   This may     be taken as the crucial          experiment,        the one        which
gives us the key to all examples of supersaturation, enabling us to
state   the proximate      cause   of all such cases,        as   well as those of
supervision, as     follows: — Whenever under           the condition*       of experi
ment two allotropic      modifications of tlte dissolve/] or fused substance
can exist, then supersaturation or superfusion, as the case may he,
is also possible.      The term allotropic        is here     used     in  a somewhat
wider     sense   than   usual, as including         not only       amorphous         and
different crystalline forms of the same substance but also different
crystalline forms due to the presence              or absence of foreign mole
cules, such as water of crystallisation.              'Die above is the funda
mental condition        which  must be fulfilled         if supersaturation is           to
occur at all.       Two minor conditions limit the             range     within which
such supersaturation        can exist   :  these are concentration            and tem
perature of the solution, and are interdependent,                     though      it does
not follow that we are able to attain either limit.                       Thus, in the
case of temperature, the lower            limit may lie below the so-called
cryohydrate      point, where the conditions           are altered by the exist
ence of new phases ; but for every concentration                   there is    a  critical
temperature, and for every temperature                 a   critical     concentration,
 outside the limits of which         the supersaturation          breaks down, not
by the separation of the less stable form but the formation of the
 usual stable modification.
    It is  not my intention     in this communication            to enter     fully into
 the experimental evidence on which             the foregoing conclusions are
 based.     I  had intended       to   delay the       publication        until    I   had

between the disadvantages attending too early publication, and the
risk of finding my results published by another and independent

as succinctly      as possible the leading        experimental results on which
the foregoing conclusions are based,                reserving for      a  future com
munication       the details and the discussion of them.
   1.   Suporsaturation         caused   by allotropy    due   to the presence        of
foreign molecules, generally            water of crystallisation.
   (a.) A supersaturated solution of sodium thiosulphate evaporated
at the ordinary temperature deposited crystals containing 15 to 20
per cent, of water, indicating            the  presence   of a hydrate containing
not more       than 2H.,0.         All  results of this nature obtained with
supersaturated solutions are necessarily approximate and are always
too high, as     it is impossible     to drain off the mother        liqiior or  to dry
the crystals.       Under the microscope it is            easy to distinguish        the
crystals of the one hydrate from those of the other, and on warm
ing the pentahydrate dissolves before the other.
   (b.)   A    supersaturated        solution    of   sodium     sulphate      deposits
crystals of the heptahydrate, or of the anhydrous salt, according                      to
the temperature, the           former below, the latter above            20°  C.    The
former was observed by Loewel,                  but, so far   as   I   am aware,     the
latter had been obtained only               by heating     the   decahydrate.
   (c.)   A  supersaturated solution of borax evaporated at the ordi
nary    temperature deposited crystals containing                 five molecules       of
water,    as  already observed by Gernez.              Under the       microscope    the
two are easily distinguished, and the decahydrate dissolves much
more     easily on heating than the pentahydrate.
   (d.) A warm saturated solution of barium chloride deposits under
the microscope quadratic crystals, which become surrounded by
eight-sided plates, the rectangular               plates becoming rounded            ami
finally disappearing, leaving, however,              a mark on the new crystal
roughly corresponding to the outline of the original crystal.                       This
has   been     also   observed by Lehman n, who states                  that the first
crystals probably        consist of      a  lower    hydrate.     A    supersaturated
solution of barium chloride can be prepared only with the                      greatest
difficulty, and is extremely unstable.

     (/{.)  Citric acid.      This forms supersaturated solutions with great
 ease, and, inasmuch           as the    ordinary crystals contain        one molecule
 of water, it ought to have been included in class                   1 ; but the super-
 saturation is only partly due to water of crystallisation,                   for a long
 and careful study of the behaviour of a solution crystallising under
 the microscope has satisfied me of the existence of no less than                    four
 crystalline      citric   acids.     Of   these   four forms, one,       the ordinary
  rhombic      modification,       contains of course       one molecule of water,
 and is the ultimate stable form              ;  the others are either anhydrous
  or contain     less water       than the former, and are possessed              of  dif
  ferent degrees of stability.           As the solution       cools, the first crystals
  to appear are         prismatic     in form,      succeeded     or accompanied by
  others consisting         of   twinned      plates arranged        about a common
  centre, which slowly eat away the first formed crystals.                         At  the
  same time, the first formed            crystals are seen to undergo          a change,
  becoming opaque, and where the edges have been rounded by the
  action of the plate variety, fresh prisms shoot out, never, however,
  reaching the latter, but after a time are, in their turn, eaten away
   by it     Finally, if the        edge of the drop be touched with a crystal

   Finally, I                am        indebted     to      Ostwald's             paper        for yet another
example            under             this head,     but among                    inorganic       compounds,            —

 tions,     and        a    drop evaporating under the                             microscope          is    seen          to
 deposit rhombic plates, which are succeeded by cubes, which
 slowly eat up the former crystals. Ostwald assumes that the first
 formed crystals                 are hydrated          :   had he realised                  that this is not the
 case, he would,                 I   believe,     have arrived at the explanation of super-
 saturation            I   have given above.
       The point             here       raised    by Ostwald                 requires        examination          ;   — Is
 there      any reason                 to    suspect       that the            allotropic        forms       I     have
 observed in the                     case    of compounds              usually crystallising                 without
 water consist of hydrates?                         I      have no hesitation in answering this
 question          in       the       negative,     for         the    following             reasons   :   — All       the
 unstable modifications of hydrated salts have been found to con
 tain less water than                       the stable      forms,          and further, several                 of the
 modifications               described           by me          as    occurring with supersaturated
 solutions have been obtained by Lehmann by simple fusion of the
 dry     substance           ;   and finally, the very examples                          cited by      (   Istwald in
 support of his assumption                        that the modification of sodium chlorate
 is hydrated are arguments                          against           it,   for the hydrated forms of
 sodium chloride and bromide are formed only at low temperatures,
  and follow, not precede, the separation                                    of the anhydrous form                         as
  the temperature falls, that                       is,    as     the solution              becomes        more       con
  centrated        ;       and the observation of Lbwig, which requires continua
  tion, that sodium bromate crystallises at                                   - 4°     C. with one molecule,
  of water,        is      also an argument against                         the probable existence                    of   a
  hydrate of the chlorate when                             it    is   remembered              that no less than
  five hydrates of the iodate                       are said               to exist.
       In   the foregoing, mention has been made of different crystalline
  forms only, but                it   is    clear that what has been said applies equally

Note on the Calcutta Earthquake (June 12, 1897), as
        recorded by the Bifllar Pendulum at the Edinburgh
        Royal Observatory.               By Thomas Heath, B.A.             (With
        Two Plates    )
                                 (EeadJuly    5, 1897.)
     On   the 12th of    June  a  disastrous earthquake occurred in North-
 Kastern India.       The violence of the shock was first felt in Calcutta
 (at least, the first report of it reached          us from   that quarter), and
 spread with destructive           violence,    north-easterly   through   Assam
 along the valley        of the Brahmapootra,         and north-westerly    along
 the course      of the Ganges and the base of the Himalaya                Moun
 tains.     We may form       some idea of the violence of the shock from
 the disastrous effects produced by it.            From Calcutta it is reported
 that few houses have escaped without damage of some description,
 that part of the Cathedral          spire has fallen, and that many public
 buildings     have been injured.          At Darjeeling many       houses  were
 destroyed, and the district left without               railway communication.
 In Bengal the destruction of property            wa? apparently not so great     ;
 but in Assam the shock is reported to have spread ruin far and
 wide, and to have been attended with serious loss of human life.
     The destructive energy of         the   earthquake appears to have been
 exhausted within the area thus briefly indicated.               The undulatory
 movements set up by it in the earth's crust have, however, been
 detected at great distances from the centre of the disturbance, and
 already from three stations in Western             Europe reports are to hand
 showing      that seismographic apparatus have recorded the pheno
 menon      beyond     any    possibility    of   doubt.     These stations    are

bers of the           Society, however, that the essential                              feature of        the
instrument consists in the reflection of                                  a   ray of light from           the
surface of a concave                mirror, suspended                in a loop of fine silver         vriv<
from two points nearly vertically over one another.                                       If    the uppi-r
point of support bo moved                       slightly in         a   direction perpendicular            to
the    plane       of the wire, the mirror                      will rotate around             its vertical
diameter, and the amount of the rotation, or the sensitiveness                                             of
the instrument             for any given displacement of the upper point,
depends       on the closeness of that point to the vertical line passing
through the lower one.
     At    the     Royal       <Ibservatory           the       instrument         and its recording
apparatus are           so     placed that the plane                    of the wire lies         east and
west       when the reflected               ray falls on the middle of the roll                            of
photographic paper.                  The mirror is therefore set in motion by                             dis

securing that the mirror shall not be disturbed by the slight                                        vibra
tions of short duration set up in the rock by concussions happening
in its immediate vicinity,                 it   is   immersed in paraffin oil of the                    most
transparent kind obtainable.                         It   is    thus sensitive only to             tremors
or undulatory          movements of the rock of some duration.                                   That     this
is    so   has,   I   think,        been    amply shown by observation.                           I     have
never,      so far,     been        able    to find         on      the       photographs any         effect
arising from such causes as slamming of doors, or the fall of                                        heavy
weights within the building, or the explosions which are constantly
taking place at            a    quarry on the south of the hill, though                           I     have
noted the times of many of these explosions, and examined                                                 the
photographic record                 for the purpose                 of determining whether                any
effects were produced by them.                            On the other hand,               observation?
made by           Dr Copeland          and myself at Calton                      Hill showed       that   the

weight of    a man standing      on the rock, about 15 inches from the
centre of the instrument, at       a point north or south of the plane of
the wire,   caused the mirror to rotate towards the side at which the
weight was placed.
    The instrument was fixed in position at Blackford Hill early in
August of last year, and we have thus, so far, eleven months of its
photographic     record.     Before   this it was mounted at the Calton
Hill   Observatory from March 1894             to October    1895, but during
this period we had       no photographic       recording apparatus, and the
observations were made once           a  day by eye, and, of course, only
those disturbances, naturally        few in number, which         happened at
the time of observation were detected.               The experience gained,
however, in the working of so sensitive an instrument as this has
not   been without its use, as    I  believe it has enabled us to obtain       a
more continuous record at Blackford            Hill than  we would otherwise
have secured.
    An examination        of the    photographic      record  for  the  eleven
months just referred to shows at onoe that the disturbances which
affect the instrument      may be divided       into at least three character
istic groups.
    In  the first group     I  would    place all those disturbances which
show a widening and blurring of the photographic trace.                This   is
the least numerous class, and the best marked examples of it show
gaps in which there is no trace of effect on the paper.              They   are
evidently caused by successive        oscillations of the mirror; and when
these are of great      amplitude, the exposure to light at some points
does not appear to be sufficiently           long to produce photographic
result.
    The first of   these was found      on the photograph of August 26,
1896, which has two of them, and thero is another on the record
of Sept. 5.      All   three must, without         doubt, be referred to tho
violent shocks of earthquake which were experienced in Iceland on
these dates.      The two disturbances of Aug.          26 were also observed
 in Paris.    The next well-marked         examples of these gaps occur on
the 19th Feb. 1897, when there are again two of them, with an
interval of about three hours between them, both of which were
observed by Prof. Tacchini at Rome, and one of them by Prof.
Milne in the Isle of Wight.          The most remarkable record of all we

Calcutta.          Special interest attaches to the record of this disturbance
because of its long duration and great amplitude, and also becau?r
of the distinctness with which several of the separate oscillation;                                       of
the mirror appear on the paper.                         The duration of the earthquake
at Calcutta        is   stated       to have     been, according to one account,                    only
"some seconds,'' according to                    another " fully        five minutes."             How
ever this may be, the undulatory                       movements        arising from         it    covet

here at 11.28.            If     we put aside the              lighter tremors, and           suppose
for the moment that the first large oscillation shown here                                    was ti.e
result of the first violent shock                      at Calcutta, we have twenty-two
minutes as the time taken by the seismic wave to travel                                       through
the earth's crust from Calcutta                       to Edinburgh,         a   distance     in round
numbers       of 1970 miles on              a   great circle, or 226 miles per               minute
    At Grenoble          the record of this earthquake was registered on                             the
seismograph         at 11.28.          IfI      am right in supposing this to be Far^
mean time,         it   would correspond              to 11.19 Greenwich mean time, or
one minute later than the beginning of the preliminary                                     tremors at
Blackford Hill.
    It   may be interesting             to note        that, with the exception               of    two
very slight tremors                on the       afternoon of the 11th, there                 is   not   a

that of the 12th till wo go back us far us the 3rd June.                         Thus for
nearly eight days the mirror was perfectly quiescent.                              On the
other hand,         between     the   ramarkable disturbance of the              1 2th  and
the noon of           the   16th there     are four well-marked           tremors to be
seen,        probably    due   to readjustment          of the stratu     following      the
great shock of the             12th.
      I    have now called your attention to all the more                      interesting
 examples of         the first group of records.           The second group or class
 comprises all those records which appear to have been produced by
 u   single sudden tilt of          the  frame of the instrument, causing                the
 mirror to rotate about its vertical diameter in                    one direction only,
 without any apparent trace of rapid oscillation in the opposite
 direction. The mirror returns to its normal position after some
 hours, but        so slowly that this movement             is quite masked by being
 mixed up with          the slight swerving of the mirror which frequently
  takes place, and         is duo    probably to seasonal         changes of tempera
  ture.       Sometimes three or four of these tilts are found following
  one     another in the same direction               at intervals    of several     hours.
  More often they occur in               opposite       directions    alternately,      with
  intervals varying from several hours to five or ten minutes between
  them.        In  the case of the short intervals, they have an appearance
  on the curve like the tooth of a saw.
       An interesting example of             three    tilts in the same direction           is
   found on the record of Feb.           6 and      7 (fig. 3).   The first occurred       at
   19h 33'"     on the 6th, a second at        51' 35"' on the 7th, and the third at
   13h 20"'.       They are each towards the north, and are followed by
   u  perfectly straight line sloping towards the south.                    Probably      the
   sloping position of the lines is caused by the combined effect of the
   return movement of the mirror and the temperature swerving.                            On
   the same day records          were   found on the instruments at Rome and
   the    Isle  of Wight, but with this         class of disturbance the identifica
   tion of the records at different stations is not                so  satisfactory     as  it
   is  in   the case of the first group.         The photograph of .Ian. 28 (fig. 4)
   shows four        sudden     tilts towards the north, at shorter intervals
    than     those of Feb. 6 and 7.         Each tilt is again       followed by      a  line
    sloping towards the south.           Then-     is no evidence,     that  I  have seen,
    so   far, of    the   disturbances in        this    case   having been       recorded
    elsewhere.

sudden tilts to south, each followed                                   by an equally sudden                  tilt V
north, forming four of the saw-teeth                               I   have referred to.              Two         dtt>
later there is           a second sot            of three, very similar in character.
      In   a third group of these records we might place a large numrv
of irregular bends of the curve, which differ from the second                                                groui<
in being more                gradual in their character.                      There is no          appearance
of any sudden                effect having been produced on the mirror.
     The photograph                    of Oct. 20 (fig.                6) shows such a number                           of
those irregular bonds as to be almost bewildering.                                           I   find it     stated

Blackford         Hill       has been established for the purpose of astronomical
research         as    its       first and most important                    object, but         it   is   also    in

night      at the commencement of the night's work, and again at its
conclusion.           If     the night's work            is

reading should              also   be made.        It    has frequently been found that
 two     consecutive readings differed from one another by an amount
 which      could not be accounted for cither by temperature change in
 tlie    instrument          or by errors of observation, and                         it   has   hitherto

  Copeland had in view in establishing                                 the   bifilar       pendulum      at
  Blackford Hill            was not so much the study of earthquakes and the
  phenomena connected                  therewith,       as   the possibility of showing that
  the anomalous readings of                   the nadir          point were caused by, or at
  least had some connection with, changes                                in the direction of the
  vertical of the transit circle, resulting from undulatory movements
  in the    earth's crust such as this pendulum seems admirably adapted
  to show.         In    the case of my own observations                      just referred        to, the
  latitude results from each star would come into closer agreement                                       if,
  supposing an earth tremor to have                              taken place,             we divide     the
  observations into sets and refer them                           to the separate              nadir read
  ings, instead of using the mean of these readings for all stars alike,
  according to the usual practice.                       But     the     pendulum was not then
  established,          and, besides,         my observations were not sufficiently
  numerous to draw any inference of this kind from them.                                          As   yet,
   we    have had           no opportunity         at    Blackford Hill of putting this
   question to        a     practical test.
        Outside      the range         of astronomy, however, and in                       a   department
   of    science     which         the Society of             Psychical       Research claims            as
   exclusively        its    own, there would                seem      to    be   a      possibility   that
   instruments          very similar        to    the        bifilar     pendulum           in principle,
   though different in design, might be made use of with considerable
   hope of success.            The interesting,          if    not also amusing, correspond

Notes on the Total Eclipse of the Sun, 8th August 1896.
       By the Astronomer-Royal for Scotland and Mr A. J.
       Ramsay.
                                  (Read    July   19, 1897.)
   In the Total Eclipse of 8th August last year,                     the line of totality
began at a point to the            north of the Shetlands, passed across the
north of Norway, from Bodii                  on   the west to Vadsii in the north
east,   then     traversed     Novaya          Zemlya,       Siberia,    and  Yesso,   the
northern      island    of Japan,         ending      finally in the North Pacific
Ocean.       Both Bodii and Vadsii               are easily accessible       by the Nor
wegian mail-boats,          the former          being,     however,     some   four   days
nearer than Vadsii.             At      the    first   glance     one   would    naturally
inquire — Why
          :            was not Bodii          chosen for our station in preference
to the more distant Vadsii?                  The chief        reason   was the very im
portant     one    that at Vadsii the sun, at the time of total eclipse,
attained an altitude          of 15° above the horizon, while at Bodii the
altitude was only some           7° ;    at Vadsii, too, the duration          of totality
was 106 seconds,          as compared           with     101    seconds   at Bodo.      As
regards the chances of            a   clear sky, there was not much to choose
between the two stations              ; on    the west coast        the rainfall was re
ported to be relatively large, while fogs were said to be of frequent
occurrence at Vadsii.             Vardb,      some     40 miles east of Vadsii,        was
declared      unsuitable      on account of a still greater likelihood                   of
trouble from sea fogs in the early morning, during summer.                             Wo
therefore fixed on Vadso               as   our observing station, and communi
cated with Professor Mohn of Christiania,                       the well-known meteor
ologist, as to the best steps             to be taken        for securiug    a favourable
site for our instruments.                  We     are    indebted     to  him for much
valuable      advice, and to           Dr Caspersen of Vadsii for his very
material     help in securing comfortable                  rooms for us there.
    The chief lines of observation                   to   be   adopted     by an eel ipso
expedition      may be summed up as follows: —

   As      the photographic                 methods are at present the most likely                                  to
add       to our knowledge                  of the sun's constitution,                        we    decided to
direct all our efforts to the fitting out of                             a    photographic equipment
which should include apparatus of                               as   efficient and varied               a   charac
ter as possible.            This could            be effected with                little difficulty,         as the
Edinburgh            Royal       Observatory             possesses       a    variety of spectroscopy
and cameras well suited for an eclipse expedition.                                          The instruments
we took with us             comprised —       :
   1.     A   forty-foot         telescope         with Dallmeyer                  photographic             lens    of
              1    inches aperture.

   1.     40-foot     Mr>.<copf.
                                 — The object in employing    telescope                a                 of great
focal length          is   to obtain          large direct negatives                   of the sun,           which
require no further enlargement.                           The diameter of the sun's                          image
in this instrument               is   4      inches          But      since     it   is    impracticable,          on
an expedition at least, to mount                         a   tube of this length equatorial]}',
the difficulty of following                     the     sun's    diurnal          motion was            overcome
by fixing the tube on wooden                          trestles       so as to point           exactly        to the
place in the          heavens          which the sun would occupy at                               mid-eclipse,
the photographic             plate         being        mounted          on   a   slide which moved                 in
the proper direction                  and     at the speed            required to keep the                    sun's
image central.             This        plan     had already              been      employed with             great
success by Prof.            Schaeberle,            of the Pick Observatory, in Chili,                              in
1393, but our instrument was the first of the                                     kind tried in          Europe.

1896-97.]             Notes        o-n       the    Total Eclipsf of            the    Sun.                 491
The tube      was made of thin                         galvanised iron in 8-foot lengths, suit
ably tapered        to facilitate                  packing and fitting                together, the lower
end being        26 inches in diameter, the upper                                12 inches.           The lens
was mounted           on     a      metal carrier securely fixed on the top of                                  a
substantial wooden tripod, and was adjusted by means of                                           a   delicate
centring apparatus.                 In       order to prevent possible vibration                        of the
tube from disturbing the lens, it                          was    connected with the tube by                    a
collar of black cloth only.                            The exposing shutter at                the upper end
of the tube was opened by                          a   cord passing into the hut in which the
observer was stationed                   ;    on slackening           the   cord, the shutter closed
of itself.       At    the    lower end of the tube                         a    small dark room was
built of strong brown paper covered with waterproof material.                                                 In
this dark room         was mounted                      the slide for the photographic plates,
which is     here     shown.                 The angle between the plane of the plate
and the vertical             is,   of course, the altitude                      of the sun at totality,
while the inclination of the slide to the horizon in that plane                                          is   the
parallactic       angle plus             a     small correction for the sun's motion in
declination and the change of refraction.                                   The driving-clock, which
was kindly lent by Lord M'Laren,                                 is   so arranged as            to move the
plate at     a   uniform      speed            of T913 inch per minute, corresponding
to the apparent angular motion of the sun.                                      The operator stationed
in the dark room had sufficient space at his disposal to allow of his
putting      the plates in position during the eclipse, and was at the
same time able to see the sun's image                                 on the sensitive film.                The
 plates used were 18 inches square, so as to give                                      a   picture of   a   large
 part of the corona.                         By arranging four lead pencils carried by
 levers, we were able to use the slide motion as                                        a   chronograph for
 recording the approximate exposures made by all the observers.
    2.   The G-inch          Simms telescope, with its large prism in front of
 the object-glass, was mounted on                            a    heavy Cooke equatorial stand
 with driving-clock.                The advantage of this form of instrument                                    is
 that, in the case of              a     stellar spectrum, the source of light being                            a
 point at infinite distance, no slit or collimator                                is   required   ;   while in
 the case of the eclipsed sun the ring of chromosphere acts                                              like   a
 narrow slit of circular shape, and we obtain                                   a   series of overlapping
 rings corresponding to the varkms refrangibilitios                                     of the light given
 out by the chromosphere.                              Provision was        made        for nine exposures
 with this telescope.

aperture, achromatised for the violet rays by                  a meniscus of Iceland-
spar.       As this instrument            was designed       for   photographing        the
ultra-violet spectrum of the chromosphere and prominences, the                           use
of glass (so highly absorbent of ultra-violet light) was inadmissible.
The prism was therefore made of Iceland-spar, the material for
which we fortunately had at the Observatory.                         Prof. Tait kindly
lent us the quartz lens, and also provided the spar from which                           the
compensating lens was cut.                   The prism and         compensating        lens
were figured by Bernard              Halle of Steglitz, who         is specially skillet!
in working         the more intractable crystalline substances.                  Our full
programme included              nine pictures          with   this   camera.      It    was
conveniently           mounted      as   a   partial    counterpoise to the         6-inch
equatorial.
     4. Tlie      Dallmeyer    eclipse      camera of     4  inches aperture       and 33
 inches focus was intended for photographing the sun's direct                       image.
 The lens, which is of unsurpassed                  quality, was most successfully
 used by        Mr Henry Davis           at  Baikul, Southern India, in          1871,     on
 behalf of Lord Crawford.                This  camera was mounted on a separate
 equatorial stand provided with driving-clock and finder.                       Provision
  was made for fifteen exposures              of various lengths.
      5.  The whole-plate camera of              l\  inch aperture was attached             to
  the    6-inch stand, and it was intended that one plate should                           be
  exposed       for the whole time of totality            ; in this way, though           the
  plate    would be over-exposed             for the inner corona,        we hoped          to
  obtain      a  picture of the fainter outlying            coronal streamers.          The
  angle    covered      by tlie lens is       44  degrees.
      All   the.  instruments were mounted at Blackford                  Hill   and    care

Mr     Prebensen, Amtmand         of Finmark, we fixed our station on the
Fossefjeld,    some 21 kilometres to the north of the town and about
 120    metres  above   sea-level.    We were     most favourably        placed on
level ground, sufficiently raised to       escape the low fogs on the         fjord,
should any occur, and quite close           to the east end of the northern
base line of the Norwegian          trigonometrical      survey.    Our latitude
and longitude were thus known with great exactness.                      From the
day of our arrival until the 8th August we were busily                engaged     in
transporting and mounting the instruments ; the weather was often
 wet and trying, but happily by the eve of the eclipse we had
everything mounted and satisfactorily adjusted.                Owing    to prevail
 ing   bad weather we had much difficulty            in securing astronomical
 observations    for  the exact azimuth       of the 40-foot telescope; but
 provided with the Vadsii sheet of the excellent Norwegian survey,
 we were able at once to place          both it and the other instruments
 approximately     in position.       The    exact adjustments        were made
 later, when the partial twilight of the Arctic summer night enabled
 us to get some star observations.            To make doubly        sure that the
 40-foot tube was correctly placed,         Mr Eamsay computed the time
 at which the sun should appear in the tube on several mornings
 preceding the eclipse, and found, to our great satisfaction, that the
 sim's image appeared      at the right time and in the right position on
 the plate-holder.
     In  accordance with    a scheme     already worked out in Edinburgh,
 each member of the party had a particular              instrument     allotted to
 liim.    Mr Ramsay,      as our photographic        expert, was in charge of
  the 40-foot, my son managed the 4-inch camera, MTherson looked
  to the 6-inch prismatic      telescope,   while  I  was responsible for the
 ultra-violet  spectroscope    and the whole-plate        camera.    Late    on the
 evening before the eclipse         Mr Ramsay filled all        the photographic
 slides, and arranged them in the order in which they were to be
 exposed, in accordance with the indications of              a chronometer and
 a  loud-beating metronome.         Early the next morning we were again
 at our posts      with the covers        removed from         the instruments.
  Deferring for the present         the   attempt to describe        the    general
  impression produced by the great natural phenomenon,                I  shall first
  tell you how we fared with our various cameras.
     With   a sky almost covered      with clouds,    one edge of the sun       just

494           Proceedings      of Royal Society of Edinburgh.                 [sbsk.
peeped    out at the time of first contact, but unfortunately                it  was
not the edge on which the moon was at that moment entering.
Hence nothing was seen of the first contact.               This was the begin
ning of our troubles.       From this moment until the end of the total
phase we alternated between hope and fear as we caught occasional
glimpses of the sun's diminishing          crescent, but barely long enough
to  verify the setting of the equatorial instruments.                As the     time
of totality drew near the darkness increased rapidly, until at the
very last it seemed to fall from the sky, as indeed            it really did,     the
moon's shadow first darkening           the air above       our heads and then
reaching the earth's surface.          Forty-five    seconds    before totality      I
gave   Mr Ramsay the signal         to start his driving-clock,        but at that
time the sky was completely clouded.              At the beginning of totality
he exposed     the first plate, but seeing no image on the moving plate
he continued the exposure         for 36 seconds,    in the hope that the sky
might clear.       He then tried two other plates, giving                34  and     7
seconds respectively, by which time the total phase was over,                  with
out any trace of the sun's image being seen on the film.                    On the
next plate, however, he had the satisfaction of seeing              a  slender line
of light, whereupon he steadily exposed plate after plate until he
had secured      five pictures of the crescent sun, with exposures of
 9, 9, 5, 5, and 9 seconds respectively.         [Three of these were shown.]
 Nothing whatever being seen of the total phase, no exposures were
 made    at that time with the other instruments,               except with the
 whole-plate    camera.      Immediately     afterwards, however, when             the
 thin  crescent   was seen, exposures were at once made.                  The nega
 tives taken with the prismatic cameras showed nothing, the clouds
 near the sun being so bright        as to  overpower the spectra.          Several
 photographs      secured at this time by my son              with      the  eclipse
 camera serve merely to show the clouds near the sun and to                  certify
 that the instrument       was correctly focussed.          At the last contact
 the   sun was again completely obscured, so that we had not even
 the consolation of determining         the exact time when the moon left
 the   sun's disc.
     We knew that all      was in readiness and        still had   a  few hours      u>
 spare    wherein    to  rest.    But our     sleep   was   broken      by anxious

thoughts about                  the prospects of seeing anything                at the critical time.
About          1       a.m.    down came            a    heavy shower      of rain, and matters
looked        desperate           ;   but by the time we started off for our station at
2.30,     the          sky had partly           cleared.       A light westerly wind             caused
the clouds               to   drift in such     a   manner that, if fortune but favoured
us,     the total phase                might eventually be seen through one of the
clear     patches             visible in the north-west.              As we trudged        up the now
familiar pathway carrying our large chronometer with us, it seemed
as if all Vadsii was making its way to the heights above the town.
A     strange excitement pervaded the very atmosphere, and everyone
spoke in a lower voice than usual.                               On reaching our station wc
found it surrounded by                     a large crowd composed               of widely different
elements           :    there was, of course, the usual type of British tourist                              ;
but, besides English,                   Norwegians, and Finns, there were the Laps,
looking picturesque in their gaily-coloured,                               blanket-like         jackets.
As the darkness gradually fell over                              us a hush         seemed       to    pass
through            the        crowd, rendering           almost unnecessary the precaution
taken      by our guard of twenty                         Norwegian      blue-jackets, who kept
the people well back, so that we might have no difficulty in hearing
the beat of the metronome.                               Absolutely    nothing     of the sun was
visible as the critical moment approached.                               At   last down came the
unmistakable                  darkness of totality with startling                suddenness.         For,
precisely at the predicted instant, towards us rushed the vast shadow
with     a speed              of nearly 5000 miles an hour.                   Sharply rounded in
front,    as       if,   one might fancy, the better to cleave its way,                    it   quickly
broadened,               till at length    a   wide band of darkness covered the earth.
Still   no signs of             a     break in the clouds, and all the             time;   the merci
less metronome hammered away the precious seconds.                                          We       were
helpless   ;           all we could do was to look around us and gaze on                                a
scene that             will never fade from our memory.                    To    the south we saw
the outlines of the lofty heights of Siid-Varanger showing                                           clear
against    a           bright orange-coloured horizon, which                     looked strangely
weird beneath the overhanging                             masses of     inky, blue-black clouds.
Looking along the line of totality all                           was     shrouded in darkness,
but as the eye travelled                       northwards,       there again was that weird
ochre- coloured sky.                  with the dark lowering canopy of                  those    guilty
clouds.            And even            as we     looked, as     if     by magic, the darkness
faded away as suddenly                      as      it   had come, and left us almost too

dazed to realise that all was over, and that the great eclipse                of
1896 had come and gone.          If  anything could have consoled us         for
our great disappointment, it was the universal expression of             sym
pathy that we met with, not only from our many friends and
colleagues, but also from the kind-hearted Norwegians who had
followed all our operations with the keenest interest, and furthered
our endeavours in every possible way.
    After  the  eclipse was over we took several photographs of the
instruments in situ, some of which will be handed round and may
help to show the arrangement of the apparatus.              By the afternoon
of the 11th August everything          had been transported to the town
of Vadso, and on the 13th we began our homeward journey                    ;  as
we had been the first astronomers to arrive, the considerable             bulk
of our impedimenta caused us to be the last to leave.             That night,
at  Vardo, we had the great pleasure of welcoming Dr Nansen and
Lieut.   Johannsen    on their    return   from    their famous expedition.
Journeying by way of Trbndhjem and Bergen, we reached New
castle on the 24th August.
    One result of our expedition        has been to confirm Prof. Schae-
berle's experience that the fixed long-focus telescope with movable
slide is really one of the most valuable forms of eclipse apparatus,
and,   if suitably arranged, is      one   of the easiest to manage.         Mr
Ramsay's success in obtaining          pictures of everything     that was to
be seen, under very unfavourable            circumstances, abundantly con
 firms what has just been said.          One suggestion we should like to
 place on record here    : if a direct-vision prism of suitable dispersion
 wore made to slide easily into position in front of the object-glass,
 the same long-focus telescope       could be used for securing spectro
 grams as well as for taking         pictures    of  the  corona and promi
 nences, devoting    half the plates  to one method and     half to the other.
 In  this way   a  single instrument      could be made     to yield  the best
 results in the two most important branches of eclipse photography.

      In     a   paper read to the Society on March                           1   (ante, p. 310)             I spoke
of    the application            of some of its results to the solution of equa
tions involving an unknown                           Linear and Vector Function.                              These
results          depended chiefly upon the expression of the function                                               in
terms of its roots, scalar and directional                              ;    and       I    now give a few
instances of their utility, keeping in view rather variety of treat
ment than complexity of subject.                                The matter admits of practically
infinite development,                   even when we keep to very simple forms of
equation, and is thus specially qualified                                   to show the richness in
resources         which is       so characteristic              of quaternions.                But it will          be
seen also           to be strongly             suggestive of             the extreme                 caution       re

 Though no longer linear, this equation                                    is   in some respects analogous
 to (1).         It thus             imposes        the condition               that      %   and     its conjugate
 shall have the same directional roots.                                         If   all three be real they
 must     therefore             form    a     rectangular system.                      If     two be imaginary,
 the vectors of their real                         and    imaginary parts form a rectangular
 system         with        the      third.        Thus          ^    may       be   any      pure    strain, or            a
 rotation associated with                     a pure         strain symmetrical about the axis of
 the rotation.
    A simpler mode of dealing with (4) is suggested                                                     by       the   last

   That the complete admissible value of x is what we have already
found, and contains only the one scalar indeterminate A, is easily
verified by expressing x as a linear combination of the operators 1 ,
CT'VaCT-', CT'aSaCT-*, which are suggested by its relation to <p<£'_1,
and are obviously                     commutative               with         one another;                   and indepen
dent, in the sense of not producing                                        any new operator by their
combinations.               Then the required relations among the coefficients
are     determined by comparing                               term by term the expressions for
<t>x
       and   x_14> .
   9. Finally, we may treat (5) by a method similar to that adopted
for (1).  Let a now be a directional root of       so that \'a = £/<«•                       x',
Then       we have
                                                      X<f>a=        -<t>a.
  But        the     cubics of            x   and       x'    are necessarily identical,                           and thus
their common numerical                            roots can            be no           others than                 \,g, \jy.
Also, since          <j>   is       assumed       to be real,         ;/   is    imaginary, for                   <p   changes
the    g   directional root of                x'      to the        \jg root of             x, and conversely.
  But,      if   we operate               by the conjugate of (5) upon a, we get
                                                  X<£'a= -<^'o.

Thus the directional roots of x                             are treated alike                 by       <f>       and   by     «£.
and must therefore belong to                                <£"'<£'.         So those          of       x        belong to
<£<£'"'.        Thus we                                       but
                               are again conducted to the previous                                           result    ;
this third method gives us great additional information as to the
intrinsic nature of the strains involved, and the relations which
exist among them.

 Notes on some Earthquakes                                        in India.               By    J. W. Ingiis,
                                                   Mem. Inst. C.E.
                                                 (Read    July   19, 1897.)
          July we had the pleasure of listening to the paper on
      On 5th
the "Calcutta Earthquake
                         " of 12th June 1897, by Mr Heath, B.A
     It       occurred to me that the Eoyal Society might be pleased to
have          a   narrative account from one of its Fellows, by following up
the subject.               There is nothing                   scientific       in this paper, and              it    is
brevity itself            ; at the same time                   it may        be interesting,          as the facts
are       from         personal        experience             of some          earthquakes            during my
residence in India of nigh quarter of a century.
     Mr Heath observed casually that                                   a portion      of the spire of the
(Episcopal)             Cathedral              at Calcutta        had fallen, and from the news
papers            I   read that many of the public buildings, such as the High
Court of Judicature, the Museum, and many others, were badly
injured.  If any one would like to see photographs of these build
ings beforo injury took place,                            I   thought        it might          be of interest to
place         my albums at the disposal of the President                                        ;   so that, after
the meeting is over,                   I       could,    if required, turn up the                   pages
     But,         to my subject.
     After the            lapse       of forty-one            years,     I   read    in    a    paper recently
that the centre of the volcanic                                disturbance which has caused                         so
much destruction in different parts of Bengal is definitely ascribed
to a spot in the Bay of Bengal.                                    I    have always hoped that an
experience which                  I   had many years ago might some day be made
clear     :       that pleasure,           I   think,     I have       at last attained.
     During            a long voyage to                  India in          1856,     which          occupied   US
days, one of not              a       few wonders              on the deep was experienced on
21st October, when we were greatly alarmed by the ship suddenly
receiving              two or three severe                    bumps          (it   was in the forenoon).
I   can well recall the circumstance, for the sensation was exactly                                                 as
if   the vessel           had struck              a      sandbank      !      All    hands were at once
summoned on deck                  ;    most of the passengers                       (we were about fifty

1896-97.]      Air   J.  W. Inglis on      some    Earthquakes in India. 507
in number) rushed up             to inquire     the cause, for we thought the
ship was stranded.           Heaving the lead and other nautical examina
tions were duly         made,    after which Captain         Consitt    came    to the
conclusion      that it was from the result of an earthquake at sea (or
what    I called a "seaquake").            Our position at the time was about
Lat.    9° S., Long.       30°   W., our      course   being in the run of the
" Brazil    current."       The circumstance         made a great impression        on
me.     I  therefore wrote it down at once, and on arrival in Calcutta
in January 1857,         I  sent it to my much esteemed          friend Sir David
Brewster, in St Andrews, where               I  was educated.
    2.  During my        service    in India     as an    engineer officer in the
" Public     Works Department,"          I  remember some very severe shocks
of earthquake and exceptionally alarming atmospheric disturbances,
such   as  tidal waves and storms.
    In  1858 and 1860, during residence             in Calcutta,    I vividly recall
to memory two terrible            shocks of earthquake.         I  have no note of
all the   damage done, but one of them             I remember,      which occurred
a few days after one of these             shocks.      It was on   a  Saturday that
St James' (Episcopal) Church entirely collapsed.                      Many of the
 congregation were unaware of the fact, for on Sabbath, when they
 drove up to the forenoon service, the church was                a  ruin   !
    It  was in August 1858         I  witnessed the total eclipse of the sun,
 and the alarming          inundations     caused     subsequently      by rain and
 high tides from the ocean.
    3.  In   1863, while      on duty at Lucknow,          I remember an earth
 quake which caused the steeple of the Eoman Catholic Church to
 settle on the south side, but after          a few days, one night it collapsed
 eastward, and levelled the entire church in its fall.
     My next experience in Oude was on 25th May                          1S66,   being
 20   odd miles from          my headquarters         at  Sultanpur.         It was  a
 terribly hot day, the kus-kus tatties working and punka vigorously
 being pulled.        Feeling feverish and out of sorts,        I  was lying down
 at noon and scantily clad, owing to the great heat and dust.                     Now
 and again     I  felt being rocked, and fancied that the          " punka- walla "
  was amusing himself          at my expense by pushing            the    legs of the
 couch    with his     feet.    Remonstrance       having failed,     I  jumped up,
  and immediately         heard the roof creaking.           My orderly, in the
  greatest alarm, rushed       into  the  room and doclared " that it was all

                                        "   On my exit into the verandah,
 up, as the last day had arrived      !
 I  cannot express the feeling of awe when           I  saw the surface of the
 ground.     To describe the observation clearly, it        was   like the gentle
 undulations of the surface of the sea in calm weather.
     My brother-in-law,     who was one of my assistant engineers, was
 50 miles away, and was spending the day                with  a  number of civil
 and military friends        at Pertabgur,    when,      almost within a few
 seconds,  they experienced the same phenomena, and immediately
 took shelter under trees.         A  few hours later we experienced             a
 terrific thunderstorm       and a deluge    of rain.
     4.  During special duty in Eangoon, one night in August 1867
 (the house in which we resided being built of wood), we thought
 there were dacoits in the verandah, so I quietly got my revolver,
 but before long found that the continuous vibrations were caused
 by earthquake.       The only   damage   which    I   can now remember was
 that the arches of some of the masonry buildings in the town were
 fissured.
    5.  In  18G9,   while engineer officer in charge of works in the
 Tenasserim Province of Burma, during the hot season, we experi
 enced several shocks of earthquake.          It  was in August of this year
 there was   a total eclipse of the sun.      For eighteen days it had not
 ceased to rain   : I  recorded a  fall during that period of 68 inches.
 Standing on the platform of the great pagoda, which is built on the
summit of a hill, on ordinary          occasions five rivers can be easily
 seen running    their respective courses      before they united with the
 Maulmain     Kiver.     By the inundations      these    became one immense
expanse of sea, and remained in that condition                  for many days.
Perhaps    it may not     be out of place to say         that   I  had hopes    of
taking some photographs of this great eclipse at Maulmain,                   as  I
was fully prepared.        At Tavoy    and at Mergni two of my assistant
engineers were also in readiness, but the heavy and incessant rain
prevented any work.          Even Colonel Tennant, R.E., who had been
sent by Government          to the Nicobar     Islands for the purpose of
taking observations, was greatly disappointed by bad weather.
    6.  During professional residence at Delhi, in 1872;                at Agra,
1875,    and Cawnpore,       1879,  the shocks of earthquake           were also
very severe ; and at such seasons         I  always found         that thunder
storms and very heavy falls of rain invariably accompanied such

disturbances.       I  am told by a friend who has just arrived from
India that     the   heat this season has been exceptionally high, 97*
being an average        in most stations  ; but at Bangalore, just before
the earthquake was experienced, the thermometer recorded             1 00°.
The highest     I have    heard of was 127° at Jacobabad.
   7.  We have heard of the terrible destruction          to railway com
munication in Assam.          As one of the engineers in the construction
of  the first railway    in Bengal, many years afterwards    I was invited
by   a brother officer to visit the site of a bridge under construction
on the Port Canning Railway, of which the ironwork and masonry

     The President, on presenting the Prize, said                :   —
     The various results of        l'r   Knott's investigations on                 Magnetic
Strains have           been communicated from time to time to the Royal
Society of Edinburgh,           and   are embodied in five               papers,    four of
which are published in the Transaction/:.                  The fifth is now          passing
through the press.            A sixth will     be communicated to the Royal
Society this evening.

      In    these     papers      many new          facts in the subject of magnetic
 strains      are recorded.            The chief points are             :   the    coordination of
 the Joule        and Wiedemann              effects   ;  the discovery and             explanation
 of    a   maximum twist in                nickel,    although there is no rnasimum
 elongation, in moderate fields                ;  the observation of the Wiedemann
 effect in cobalt          ; the effect of tension             on the Wiedemann                effect,
  and therefore,         by inference, on the Joule effect                   ;  the nature of the
 hysteresis in the Wiedemann                      effect as either of the magnetising
  forces is taken through              a complete        cycle   ;  the curious difference           in
  the amount and occasionally in the direction of the twist according
  to the order in            which the magnetising forces                       are   applied    ; the
  magnetic polarity produced                  by twisting wires             conveying currents         ;
  the reversal with          the   current of the polarity acquired                    by twisting     ;
  the residual character               of   this polarity        and      its remarkably high
  value, etc. etc.

      V. Part II.        read    June     7, 1897     (not yet published).
      A   novel line of research is followed out in these communications,
  which have to do mainly with the effect of magnetism                                  in altering
  the internal volume of tubes of iron and                          nickel.        The effect was
  first   noticed      in May          1891,     in   Japan;          and the         results    were
  communicated          to the Royal          Society of Edinburgh                 in July of that
  year (see       Proceedings,          vol. xviii.       pp. 317-9).             The subsequent
  experiments, for the carrying                out   of   which      tubes     of  iron, steel, and
   nickel, of suitable        form and various            bores, were specially prepared,
   were    all made       in the Physical           Laboratory         of the University            of
   Edinburgh.
      The most important experiments are those, that have to do with
   the   behaviour       of    a   series   of tubes        of each metal             of gradually

  520          Proceedings      of Royal Society of Edinburgh.                       [sbs.
  widening     bore, — the tubes being, in fact, produced by successive
  borings from the same original bar.
     Broadly speaking, the tendency in the                case of the    first   set of
  iron and steel tubes was to show decrease of volume in low fields
  and increase of volume in moderate and high fields                   ; but in        the
  last set of iron tubes studied, decrease of volume was obtained                        in
  high fields also.
     The nickel      tubes all agreed       in showing        large diminution           of
  volume in most fields, with slight increase of volume in very low
 fields.
     As  a rule, the wider the bore of the tube the greater the maximum
  change of volume.          There   are,  however,      curious deviations from
 this rule, which are shown in Part             II.  to be due to the fact that
 the volume change        is  a differential   effect, being the resultant of            a
 change of length       in the direction of magnetisation, and             a change
 of area     transverse thereto.         These     longitudinal     and   transverse
 dilatations    tend to be of opposite sign, and experience interesting
 variations    as the bore of the tube is made wider and wider.
     The volume changes measured in               these    experiments are      much
 greater than those       shown by iron or nickel            rods, and indicate         a
 very complex condition of strain, the investigation of which                   seem?
 to be beyond our present powers of analysis.
     For   these    novel   and    highly interesting       results,   obtained      by
 experimental      investigation    carried on through          six years with       re
 markable ability and perseverance, the Keith Prize, for the                   period
 1893-5, has been awarded by the            Council    to  Dr Cargill G. Knott
    The Makdougall-Brisbane            Prize for 1894-6         was presented         to
 Professor   John G. M'Kbndhick, for numerous Physiological                  papers,
especially in connection with Sound, many of which have                    appeared
in the Society's publications.
    The President, on presenting the Prize, said : —
    During the last four years Professor              M'Kendrick       has devoted
himself     with persevering      zeal and enthusiasm to researches in             the
physiological     and dynamical actions concerned in the perception                 of
sound.       The    admirable      model    with which         he   explained     and
demonstrated by actual working, a mechanism in accordance                        with

Helmholtz's theory of the mechanism of the                   ear for recognising
different musical      notes, is a valuable contribution        to science       and to
scientific teaching.
    A   first instalment     of his work on the phonograph, given at the
request of the Council,        as the  sole business of the meeting of the
Royal Society here on the 27th of                   November           1894,    is still
remembered         with lively interest by all who heard it.                   Farther
investigations followed, and        a general account of results is published
in the Trans. Roy.        Soc.  Edin. for  1896 (vol.    xxxviii. part        4).   His
later work      on the  Fourier analysis of curves obtained by mechanical
magnification of the traces on the wax cylinder of the phonograph,
 from the different         vowel sounds,    has already       given       interesting
 results, and is well adapted to aid in the discovery of the real
 character of that marvellous system            of varieties of sound which
 constitutes speech.
    For    these   important    and interesting     researches       on   Sound, and
 the    Physiology of tho Perception            of   Sound,      the Makdougall-
 Brisbane       Prize   for    1894-6    has   been     awarded         to   Professor
 M'Kendrick.
    The Xeill Prize for 1892-5        was presented to    Robert Irvine, Esq.,
 for his     papers   on    the action of Organisms         in    I lie Secretion     of
 Carbonate       of  Lime and Silica,       and    on   the    Solution       of these
 substances in Organic Juices.            These are printed in the Society's
  Transactions and Proceedintjs.
    The President, on presenting the Prize, said : —
     The Council of       the   Royal Society of Edinburgh has awarded

      Liun. Soc, N.S.W.         ;  Corr. Mem. K.S. Tasm.            By   William
      Henry Pearson, Knutsford.
                            (Read December     16,   1895.}
   Dr Carrington       was born on     January 18th,        1827, at  Lincoln, and
received his early education in the neighbourhood                 ;  afterwards he
was articled     at  Liverpool    to Dr M'Nicoll, with whom he lived for
some years.
   Dr M'Nicoll       was an enthusiastic      naturalist      and a  great lover of
poetry   ;  under his influence probably was created or developed the
love of natural history which the subject of our memoir was famed
for.   From Liverpool he proceeded to Edinburgh University.                 Whilst
studying there he wrote       a  monograph of the British Grasses, and illus
trated    it with   a set  of specimens,     with dissections of the minuter
 organs so beautifully and accurately prepared that they won for him
the admiration of the leading botanists of the University.                 Here he
 made the acquaintance of Greville, Hooker, and Balfour, and no doubt
 his life's devotion to cryptogamic          botany was influenced originally
 by Greville and Hooker.           For the former he had the         most profound
 admiration.
    He was     a  thorough naturalist.        There      was no object in nature
 but excited his curiosity and attention           :  the more minute, the more
 carefuL     For   some time he practised at South port.          Whilst there the
 annelids occupied his attention        ; and a paper on the Southport species,
 read before the British Association            at one of its meetings, shows
 the intimate knowledge he had of them.                  He contributed    papers to
 various magazines,       and assisted specialists in this branch of natural
 history, and one species         was,  I believe,    named in his honour.       He
  had an intimate acquaintance            with the British Flowering Plants,

   '
ii               Proceedings       of Royal Society of Edinburgh.
and freely helped other botanists with his knowledge                         ;  also an
accurate knowledge           of   the    British Lichens, adding          several    new
species    to   our Flora,      corresponding        with Lcighton, Mudd,             and
other contemporary           authorities.        His knowledge of the British
Mosses made him           a   no mean,       though friendly, rival of Wilson,
Spruce, and other leading               authorities.      He contributed          several
papers    to the Phytologutt,        Proceedings of the Botanical            Society    of
Edinburgh,      and other scientific journals, his most important papers
being on the British Orthotrica.
   It  will, however,     be by his devotion to the study of the Hepaticae
that his name will especially be remembered.
    He practised first at Radcliffe, near Manchester                ;   then in succes
sion at Lincoln, Yeadon, Southport, and Eccles.
    In 1861 he visited        the south of Ireland, his chief object being,
as he says (after the renovation              of his health), the collection          and
study of the Hepatic*.             The results of this visit        was the appear
                                 " Gleanings
ance of his interesting                           among the Irish Cryptogams,"
published in the Trans. Bot. Soc. Edin. in 1863 ; an extensive list
of lichens,      mosses,    and hepaticae,        with   valuable notes        on   many
species,    especially    of the latter        order.    It  is illustrated      by two
beautiful plates, which indicate the skill he had attained in the art
of delineating       cryptogamic plants.             Another result of this visit
to Ireland was         the rich       contribution      he  made      to Rabenhorst's
Bryotlieca      europece,    and     Gottsche        and   Rabenhorst's        Hepati-rir
europece,    one   part of      the    latter   being    almost composed           of the
doctor's collecting.
    In  1862     appeared      Miall    and    Carrington's     Flora of       the   We*i
Riding, for which        he compiled the         list of cryptogams.
    About this time         he    began    to   prepare a work on the British
Hepaticae,    corresponding with all collectors and those interested in
this group    :  De Notaris, Gottsche, and Liudberg on the Continent                      ;
Wilson, Hooker, Spruce, and others here.
    In 1874     appeared    the first part of what promised to be the most
important work since the publication               of Hooker's magnificent British
Jungermannice, in 1816.             Three further parts were issued in 1875
and 1876.         The fourth had           an   ominous     note appended,          which
stated that in consequence            of the indisposition        of the author the
letterpress was some pages short.                For  some   time he continued in

                              Obituary Notices.                               iii
a very low state of health, and ahout the years 1880 and 1881 had
to undergo several painful operations, under which his friends were
afraid he would      succumb.       Thanks,     however, to the skill of        a
Manchester surgeon, in whose care he was, and for whom he had
the most grateful regard, he rallied, and was for several years longer
able    to  pursue his    favourite   studies, but never with the same
ardour; and what with difficulties            with his publisher,       and his
enfeebled health requiring        conserving to continue his professional
duties, he seemed to shrink from the task of completing his beauti
ful and valuable work, although friends had proffered             to assist him.
    In    1876  he spent some       time   in  the    neighbourhood       of the
 Trossachs, and there made what Dr Spruce describes as one of his
 happiest finds, Hygrobiella myriocarpa.            This   he published,    with
 several other new species,      in the Trans. Bot.     Soc.   Edin., vol. xiii.,
  1879.
    In   1878   we issued the first part of our Hep.           Brit. Exsicc, in
 the preparation of which       Dr Carrington      took great delight.      Four
 fasciculi were issued, representing        nearly all the British species,
 and between 17,000 and 18,000 specimens distributed.
    In   1886 two Manchester       botanical friends, who had gone to tho
 Antipodes —-Mr Thomas Whitelegge to New South Wales, Mr R.
 Bastow to Tasmania — sent large collections of liepatica?, which we
 studied together.      The results were published      :  those of  Mr White-
 legge's collection  in Pro. Linn. Soc, N.S.        W., illustrated   by twplve
 plates, the cost of which was generously defrayed by the late Sir
 William MacLeay      ;  those of Mr Bastow in the Proc. Roy. S»c. of
 Tasmania for 1887.        These were the two last papers published by
  Dr Carrington.
    In the   same year he was elected a Corresponding           Member of the
 Linnean Society of New South Wales and of the Royal Society
 of Tasmania.      On the resignation of the first President,          Mr John
 Whitehead,      he was   elected President      of the Manchester Crypto-
 gamic Society, which position he held         till his death.
    In 1874     he was    elected   F.R.S.E., and he was          at  one   time
 F.L.S.
    The following British Hepaticse were either found or identified
 as  British by him   : —

 mouth, May 1877.
     Rirria  sorocarpa,   Bischoff, collected      by B. M.     Watkins    on Great
 Doward Hill, near Koss.
     One of our rarest and most beautiful hepatics was named in his
 honour by the late Professor Balfour           ;  and   Herr   J.  B. Jack, in his
 monograph       of the    European Radidas,         named     one   of the rarest
 Radula     Carringlonii after him.           The      late  Professor     Lindberg
 founded    a  new genus, which he named Carringtonia.
     About twelve months before he died, his valuable collection was
 acquired for the        Manchester       Museum        by the Owens College
 authorities, and      under the care of Professor F. E. Weiss it has
 been arranged,      and is now accessible      to students.
     Dr Carrington        was   a widely-read       man,    passionately fond of
 poetry,    his favourite authors being Keats, Shelley, and Words
 worth, having        no mean     skill himself in       the accomplishment          of
          but the "
                                                                   "
  verse,              nice backwardness afraid of shame               withheld him
  from publishing       more   in this field     as  in scientific ones.       Of    an
  extremely     retiring   disposition,   meek       and gentle      in  spirit,   the
 memory     of him will be treasured by all who were fortunate                enough
 to have known him.
     On the 18th of January 1893, his sixty-sixth                birthday,   he died

                       Professor John Stuart Blackie.
                By the llev. Walter C. Smith, D.D., LL.D.
                                  (R.-ad February 3, 1896.)
    John Stuart Blackie             was certainly the          most outstanding figure
in Scotland          as the     19th     century drew          to    its close.     His    fine
features      and plaided form              were     familiar     to   Scotchmen all        the
world over, recognisable               also    by Englishmen           and Germans who
took nny interest in the literature                   of our country.         We     were all
proud of the veteran               scholar and author           ;   but our love for        the
man      was     more    than our pride in his attainments, for his                        was
a  character that attracted the                   affection of all         who knew him
intimately.         In  spite    of   a strong lighting propensity, leading                him
to denounce         snobs    and     West-ends, and to run tilt                 at our self-
satisfied    ignorance,     and in general          to   hit out    at anything, however
respectable,       which he did not approve                of, yet essentially his was         a
very loving nature,         and he was in consequence                   very greatly loved.
It   is not inconsistent with this that he sometimes,                       in the heat       of
the    moment,       unthinkingly        touched men's sore points, and                 pained
them,      when he        did not         mean      it.   But     he    never deliberately
wounded any one, or spoke                 a word inconsistent with            "  the charity
that    thinketh       no   evil."      His singular purity of mind                  also was
almost      feminine      in    its sweetness           and   delicacy;      yet there     was
nothing effeminate            about him        :  he was every          inch  a   Man.      His
patriotism was perhaps, at times, somewhat                        effusive,  yet it   was not
 blinded      by prejudice, for he             could     see,  and     did not     spare,   the
faults of his countrymen             ;  and    if he loved a Scottish song above all
 others,    he     was not      without        a   good     reason     for his    preference.
 Altogether, he was           a   frank, outspoken, right-hearted Scot,                  whose
 virtues and blemishes            were     both equally manifest;            but the    former
 were of high excellence,             and the latter, at the worst,           were but      the
 follies of    a  rather "old boy,"          as he was      wont to call himself.
     It  is not     easy exactly to define            what were the grounds             of  the

                                  Obituary Notices.                                           vii
  high position       he    had    assuredly        attained      as     representing        the
  literature of Scotland during           these     latter days.         There were        more
  than one of his fellow            countrymen          who had reached a higher
  eminence than he        ;  but they had migrated to England, and were
  counted among its celebrities.             His work, however,              was all done in
  the city which Scott had made                 so illustrious,        and where Jeffrey
  had sharpened his pen, and not many remained now to vindicate
  its former   name.     Wilson had departed,             and    Aytoun followed him
  soon   ;  but for eighty-six      summers Blackie             lived       on,   his restless
  and versatile genius standing almost alone.                      That naturally drew
  special attention     to him, though           it will not account for the              place
  he held in the hearts of the people.                  Nor is it        easy    to say what
  was the root of that reverence which gathered so many thousands
  from all parts of the country to witness his funeral, and to sorrow
  at his departure.       Though he filled          a  Professor's chair for so many
  years,    he was not a great scholar either of the                        English,    or the
  German, type      ; but had    a  great scorn for mere niceties of grammar,
  and would have rollicked           in boisterous fun at the idea of being
  the man who knew the mystery of the "enclitic St."                              Yet  he was
  familiar with the great classics and loved them                    ;   and    if not many
  thorough     Grecians came        from his classes,         not      a   few men       found
  there what is of more moment,             a  genuine taste for letters, and the
 fine sense of cultured thought.              Though lie wrote and spoke not a
 little    on political  questions — on intricate            land-laws,         e.g. — yet   he
 was no politician,         and hardly        ever read      a    newspaper unless            it
 happened      to   contain    in     its   columns        a   letter       from     himself.
 Aristotle's   Politics  he knew, but,         I   think,   he had given no heed to
 the history of English political thought.                 Yet   he touched, now and
 then, with a gleam of true light, questions of deep concern to the
poor, and made them feel that,              if   he had     no    precise      plan for the
bettering     of their lot, he was, at least,               deeply concerned about
their sufferings.       Again, though his views latterly were nowise in
harmony with the Evangelical Theology of the Scottish people, yet
he had once come under its influence, and that spell continued                               to
hold him to the end, so that he never found any other worship
that gave eqnal expression to his deepest                    feelings, and he never
i-eased to glory      in the heroic history             of its covenanted martyrs.
Probably the heterodox opinion                   was    condoned          by the historic

enthusiasm.        At aiiy        rate,    the    Professor's        Theology       was     never
taken so seriously as It is admiration                   for all that was heroic in            the
Fathers      of the       Scottish       Church       from     John        Knox    to Richard
Cameron.        Blackie had it in him to be a considerable                         Lyric     Poet,
for some of his songs contain lines, and even verses, with the                                true
ring of    a mini's    heart     in them.         But he had not patience to point
mill  polish them        :   the gem was there, but              it   was not cut so as          to
bring forth its perfect lustre.                  Probably       he himself        would      have
rested his claims to be remembered                      rather on his philosophy than
on his poetry       ;   for though he had none of the Scottish love of
metaphysics,       and       had   never      mastered       the systems         of Hume,        or
 Hamilton, or Kant, yet he spoke                     many a wise and true word to
his countrymen, not merely                  in his book on Self Culture and his
 Four    Phase*     of Morals,          but in almost every one of the many
lectures he delivered on all kinds of subjects.                         These, indeed, were
often    marred     to those        who had not heard                 them     by the almost
boyish freaks which,               down       to   the last,       he    indulged      in when
addressing      an audience,          and which were always carefully reported
so as to make      him often look liker a mountebank than a philosopher.
 He used to complain of this occasionally,                      and    I   had to tell him      he
had only himself to blame, for he spoke more sense and also more
 nonsense     than any other man               I knew.        But    away from the excite
 ment    of public meetings,              in   the quiet hour, e.g., of             a   Sabbath
 evening,    such     as   I  often    spent     with him in his latter days, it              was
 good to listen to his subdued and chastened                              thought, lit up by
 many an apt quotation from Aristotle,                     or Goethe, or the Bible, and
 one could easily understand,               at such times, his claim to be reckoned
 a   philosopher.          In   those quiet hours his natural                   eloquence was
 very impressive,        for    he was      a   born orator      ;  and if he could          have
 been kept from            skipping and romping away                    from his      theme,    at
 other    times,    he      could not have           failed to win           the   brilliant, if
 evanescent,     honours of         a   great public speaker.               Take him for       all
 in all, he was      a man      of fine gifts and versatile powers, genuine                   ami

V»y "speaking       unadvisedly with his lips," and yet there was in his

recall him     to-day,  I  seem to be    dealing with        a  lot of contradictory
elements,     which    nevertheless      were   all   sweetly harmonised in         a
 generous     and   beautiful    and    loveable     personality.       A deft and
 nimble thinker,       he    was  yet profoundly           serious,   and  constantly
 brooding on the weightiest concerns.             Careless       of conventionality,

  travel, in wintriest weather,      a  hundred miles, that he might speak

  his sun went down amid tender               regrets     of affection    and regard
  from all his countrymen whom he had loved                 so  well, and who repaid
  him also with the love which was his due.

        James Dwight Dana.               By    Prof. James Geikie.
                              (Bead July   6, 1896.)
    The subject of this notice     came of good      New England stock, his
father, James Dana, having removed from Massachussets to Utiea,
in New York, where his           son   was born on February          12,   1813.
Young Dana       appears to have early indicated a decided taste         for the
pursuit of science.      While    a boy he studied         chemistry with his
schoolmates, and made        frequent excursions in search of minerals
— a training which, no doubt,          was largely instrumental       in deter
mining    the line of investigation       in which     he subsequently    distin
guished himself.        At the    age   of seventeen      Dana entered Yale
College, where he came under the influence of the elder Silliman,
and finally determined to devote himself             permanently to science.
In   1833 he accepted    an appointment        as instructor   in mathematics
to the midshipmen        of  the U.S. Navy,         and while    thus engaged
enjoyed    a delightful cruise in the Mediterranean.         Among the fruits
of this excursion was      Dana's first paper — " On the Conditions            of
Vesuvius     in 1834."     His leisure hours       on shipboard he seems       to
have employed in working out, by special methods, certain pro
blems of mathematical crystallography,            some account of which       he
published     in the following year.        In  1836 we find Dana again at
Yale, acting as assistant in chemistry to Prof. Silliman, and busy
with the preparation of his first important work, the                System    of
Mineralogy, — a volume of 580         pages, which was issued in        1857  —
surely    a  remarkable     achievement      for   a  youth   of twenty-four     !
Next year he      was so fortunate as to be appointed mineralogist           and
geologist to the Exploring Expedition to the Pacific and Southern
Oceans    under the command of Commodore Wilkes.                  The Expedi
tion, consisting of five ships, sailed in August 1838, and proceeded
first to Madeira.     Thereafter Rio Janeiro was visited, and the ships
passed down the coast and through the Straits of Magellan,                where
one of the smaller vessels was lost      in  a storm, and the ship to     which

young Dana       was attached made a narrow escape.              He then visited
in succession Chili and Peru, and subsequently               crossed the Pacific,
touching at the Paumotus, Tahiti, and the Navigator Islands, on
his way to New South Wales and New Zealand. From New
Zealand the voyage was resumed to the               Fiji Islands, the Sandwich
Islands, the Kingsmill Group, the Caroline Islands, and thence
north to the coast of Oregon, where Dana's ship was finally
wrecked.       He then accompanied the party that              crossed the moun
tains    and passed down the Sacramento Valley to San Francisco.
 Here the wanderers again           set sail, and made       their way home by
the Sandwich Islands, Singapore, the Cape of flood                  Hope, and St
 Helena, arriving at New York on 10th June 1842.                    It is needless
to say that the experiences of these four eventful                  years  made    a
 profound     impression upon Dana, and influenced all his subsequent
 life.    For the next thirteen years        he was    fully, occupied in study
 ing   the materials brought home by the Expedition,               and in prepar
 ing his reports.         His geological observations        are contained     in  a
 large quarto of 746 pages, accompanied by             a folio  atlas of 21 plates
 (1849).      Besides this great work, he prepared a Report on Zoo
 phytes    of similar     extent, with an illustrative atlas of 61 plates
 (1846), and a Report on Crustacea, which occupies 1620 pages, and is
 accompanied by an atlas of 96 plates (1854).             Nor were his energies
 during this period confined to the elaboration of these reports,
 for we find him at        the same time issuing      three successive     editions
 of the System      of Mineralogy     (1844, 1850, 1854), and two editions
 of the Manual          of Mineralogy     (1848, 1857), besides       many papers
 communicated         to   various   scientific   journals.      Not    a  few    of
 these    appeared     in the American       Journal     of  Science,   of which,
 in 1846,     Dana had been made an editor, associated                 with Prof.
 Silliman, whose assistant         he had     been   in 1836-37,       and whose
 daughter he had married            in   1842.     In  1850    he was    appointed
 to    the   chair    of Natural      History    in   Yale    College —the title
 of the chair being subsequently changed to that of Geology and
 Mineralogy.
     The enormous amount of work accomplished in the few years
 after Dana's return from abroad testifies to his abounding zeal and
 enthusiasm.       Unfortunately,      as his son Prof. E.    D. Dana remarks,
 "  he was but    little restrained by     the thought     that injury to health

"xii         Proceedings     of Royal Society of Edinburgh.
was possible."     But   a few years    after the last of the Expedite!
Reports was published his health broke down, and he never                 quite
recovered   his former strength.        Henceforward, he was subject          to
the severest limitations as regards work and mental labour            ; bnt   by
avoiding excitement and husbanding his strength, he was enabled
to accomplish a wonderful        amount of scientific work.        Thus, in
1862, he issued his Manual of Geology, in 1864 his Text-Bo'jk of
Geology, and in 18G3 the fifth edition of the System         of Mineralogy
 — his last and most important contribution        to that department of
science.    Notwithstanding      all his care, the preparation of this
great   work proved too much for his strength — his health again
gave way, and was only slowly restored.          With advancing    recovery,
he gradually     resumed    his course    of quiet labour — doing        much
work in the field    as a geologist, attending to the duties of his chair,
and   writing   a number of      important     papers   and  books.       Xew
editions of his Manual        of Geology    appeared   in  1874 and 1880,
and   of the   Test-Book of Geology in 1874 and 1883.               He also
found time to write a new work entitled Coral* and Coral Island*
(1872), and yet another geological         volume — The    Geological    Story
briefly Told (1875).
    Dunn had so far regained strength in 1887 that he was tempted
to take a long journey.       The accounts     of an eruption of Kilauea
in the Sandwich Islands had greatly interested           him, and  he deter
mined to revisit that region,        the acquaintance     of which     he had
first made in 1840.        Accordingly, he set out with his wife           and
youngest    daughter, and the result was all that he or his friends
could desire.     He greatly enjoyed himself, every incident            of the
visit, his sun tells us, being entered into with the enthusiasm           of a
mind which years could not make old.            On his return he     wrote    a
number of papers descriptive of what he had seen, and in                    the
winter of 1889-90       prepared    his work on Volcanoes,     which,    along
with a new edition of Corals a?id Coral Islamls, appeared             early in
 1890 — the prefaces     of both books     being dated on his 78th birth
day.     In the autumn of the same year,         however, his health      once
more gave way, and for several months his busy pen was laid              aside.
But   he could not long     endure complete     rest; and, by-and-by,       was
able   to dictate a small work dealing with the geology of the New
Haven district, which was issued in 1891.            His duties as professor

he had no longer strength to continue, but with partial recovery
he resumed work on the fourth edition of his Manual                  of Geology.
 We are told that from this time          till the end he seldom worked
 longer than three hours a day.
                                          " To himself, and still more to
 those about him," his son remarks, " it seemed many times as if
the completion of this great work would have to be left to others ;
 but with the self-control born of      a strong will and long experience,
 and with the never-failing watchful care of his life-long companion
 — without which his labours could never have been so productive,
 nor have been continued so long — he worked on slowly, doing
 each day only what he had strength for, and finally the labour was
accomplished."         He finished it in February 1895.               When we
                              —
 know that the volume a large, closely-printed octavo of 1036
 pages  — was re-written and re-arranged throughout, and necessarily
 involved the critical consideration of many new facts, theories, and
 hypotheses,    we shall be ready to agree with his son, that the work
 is a remarkable performance for       a  man of eighty-two.         He did not
even now rest.         Work of some kind was for him a necessity               of
 existence.     A month after his manual         was   finished, he had com
 pleted the manuscript        of a new edition      of his Geological Story
 briefly Told, and then commenced          work on     a  new edition of his
 Text-Book.      But   the end was    now at hand.         On    April 13th   he
 was able to go about as usual, and was             as   bright and vigorous
 of mind     as  ever.    In the evening, however,            he   did  not feel
quite well, and next morning he did not rise.              The uneasy feeling
seemed to be passing away,         but towards evening it returned, and
after a very brief period of unconsciousness he quietly                 breathed
his last.
    It is impossible, in a few words, to sum up the results achieved
by this laborious and indefatigable student of science.               He  was an
acknowledged      master in at least three departments           — Mineralogy,
Geology, and Zoology        ;  and the broad generalisations          which  are
encountered in his works          prove him to    have had "      a  profoundly
comprehensive view of nature as a whole."             His earliest investiga
tions, as we have seen, were mineralogical        —the     first edition of his
System of Mineralogy       having appeared      so early as 1837.        In this
work    he displayed    that anxious desire to do full justice to his pre
decessors   and contemporaries which distinguished              his subsequent

 xiv           Proceedings of Eoyal Society             of Edinburgh.
labours in this and other fields.             In all   the later issues      of this    great
work he shows the same astonishing knowledge of the literature                               of
mineralogy.        Side by side with this critical compilation                   of    facts,
however,      we find abundant evidence            of independent research                and
thought.        He was at all times less interested in the study of indi
vidual mineral species than in the broader questions suggested by a
review of the whole science — such as the classification of minerals,
theories    of crystallogeny, and the morphological relations of species.
Mineralogy was his first love, but eventually it became displaced
in his affections       by its sister Geology.           He found in this science
greater     scope for his activity.           The interesting phenomena with
which     it dealt, and the many problems which it suggested, natur
ally fascinated      a  mind like his, and he turned from mineralogy,
which he often spoke of as               "a department of limited              ideas     and
principles," to devote        his best energies to geological             investigation.
His Manual of         Geology, which        has passed through           four editions,
has long been recognised          by geologists     in all countries       as a masterly
work.      It  not only sets forth, with admirable clearness,                the facts of
the   science,     but everywhere displays the                critical    acumen,        the
breadth of view, aud originality               of a truly      philosophical mind.
Dana was not only an active               and persistent observer           in the field,
adding much         to our knowledge of crystalline               rocks and glacial
phenomena,       but   a generaliser     of the first order.         Hence it      is that
we find him turning         from first to last to such grand questions                    as
the origin of continental areas and oceanic depressions,                   the problems
of mountain-making, and the phenomena                     of volcanic action.          We
must remember also that the work he accomplished in Zoology                             was
of great interest and importance.                  His extensive       reports     on   the
Zoophytes and the Crustacea,             obtained during the Wilkes' Expedi
tion, contain descriptions of upwards of 700 forms new to                         science,
while his discussion of the relations of species, and his development
of the classification, are held in the highest estimation by biologists.
Dana began his zoological studies                with    a  belief, then general,         in
the   special    creation   of species.         It  was    not until many            years'
reflection    that he came eventually to accept the principle of                    evolu
tion by natural variation.            In   the   last edition of his Manual oj
                                     ''
Geology (1895), he writes          :    It  is perceived that the law of nature
here exemplified is not        'like    produces     like,' but like with an         inert-

meat or     some addition                to the variation.                   Consequently, the law of
nature,    as    regards kingdoms of life, is not permanence but change,
evolution.       .    .   .     The survival of           the fittest is a fact               ;   and the fact
accounts, in part, for the geographical distribution                                      of the races of
men now existing and still in                       progress ; but not              for    the existence of
the fittest, or for the power that has determined survival."                                              Again,
referring       as an         example to the giraffe, he remarks that the elonga
tion of the anterior pair of legs has the                                same purpose as that of the
neck — high-reaching in quest of food.                                    " How should the
                                                                                             giraffe
have had         to run to make its fore legs                            grow faster than the hind
leg?, and what kind of antics would have started the change in the
neck?       It    has to be supposed                     that          the    requisite       argumentative
variations       were somehow begun, and that, under                                          interbreeding,
accelerated growth                  went forward.                      But the origin of variation
is without explanation.                   And       so   it   is is,
                                                                       for the most part, throughout
the kingdoms                  of life.       Enough                    known      to encourage            study."
Finally,        the       closing        paragraph            of       his   book    runs          as    follows   :
" Whatever the results of further                                  search,    we may feel assured,                in
accord with "Wallace,                .   .   .    that the intervention               of      a   Power above
Nature      was at the basis                     of man's development.                        Believing        that
nature      exists            through     the will             and ever-acting                power       of     the
 Divine Being, and that all its                          great          truths, its beauties,             its har
 monies,        are       manifestations            of His              wisdom      and       power,       or,    in
 the   words          nearly        of Wallace, that                    the whole         Universe         is    not
 only dependent on, but actually         the Will of one           is                                    Supreme
 Intelligence, Nature, with man as its culminant species,                                          is   no longer
a   mystery."
    Although Dana has so recently passed away,          not                         it   is            too soon to
 judge of his position in the roll of scientific worthies.                                              The    mere
 mass of facts and data                   which      he has added to the several depart
 ments of science in which he laboured would suffice to procure for
 him   a   prominent place amongst his fellows.                                     But    it     is   the general
 suggestiveness of his writings, the originality of his views, and his
 far-reaching             philosophical           generalisations, which                   have most im
 pressed     his contemporaries, and which,                                  we believe, will continue
 to influence his successors.                      No     one who            is   at all conversant with
 Dana's work need hesitate to accord him                                      a   high    place among            the

leaden of scientific thought in the century which is hastening  to a
close.
   Personally  Prof. Dana was one of the roost amiable and genial
of men,   beloved by his friends,    admired  and venerated by   his
pupils.   He leaves behind him    a reputation of which his fellow-
countrymen    may well be proud —a reputation which continued     to
increase up to the very close of his long and fruitful life.

                                           By D. Bruce Peebles.
                                   (Read May 17, 1897.)
     In   the latter half of the seventeenth             century    a   farmer of the
name of Sang lived in Aberdeenshire, of whom little                          is known.
Rut      we know that he had a family,               and   that his youngest son,
Robert, was born in 1700, and in course of time married Margaret
Mitchell, who was an exceptionally clever woman. There is no
record of what position he occupied or what business he followed,
 "but very likely it was farming or gardening.                   He died in 1793,
 aged     93 years.       His   son,   David, was born in 1749.              He   was a
 gardener, and married Mary Chalmers,                 a daughter of Dr Chalmers
 of Stonehaven.
      Edward,      one    of his sons,      left home    when quite young, and
  settled in Kirkcaldy        as a   market gardener.       He gradually extended
  his  business,    and ultimately became          a nurseryman and seedsman.
  In   his spare hours he managed by himself to acquire a good know
  ledge of Greek and Latin, and the difficulties he must have met

  having     a   good    teacher.      Business prospered        with    him, and      lie
  married Jean         Nicol,   a relative,    of Nicol   whoso    prism is so well
  known.         While giving attention          to  his business,      he must      have
  token    a good    deal of interest in municipal affairs,        as he was elected
  Provost      of Kirkcaldy,      a  position he held for      a  number of years.
  His    son,    Edward,      our late     Fellow,   was    born   on     the   30th    of
  January       1805.      When     he got to the age of seven            years   it  was
  thought that he should be sent to school.                    But     there    were   no
  schools     in Kirkcaldy       of very high standing at that time,                  and
   Provost     Sang, along with other gentlemen, started                a  subscription
   school   in    181*2,   and     engaged      Edward     Irving     as    headmaster.
   After doing       so  it was natural that they should do what lay in
   their power to provide pupils for the new school,                  so we    find that
   three of the Sang family, David,               Edward, and their sister, were
   placed   with Irving.       The promoters were not wrong in their choice
   of  a teacher,     for Irving was       a  thoroughly    able and      conscientious

 Sheriff of Fife and Kinross,                    speaking of Irving, says that "Lis
eloquence,        earnestness,         and     high ideal aims had been             known       fa
 Kirkcaldy, where it            was remembered that he took his                  pupils   to the
sands to watch the stars."                    It  may be mentioned,          in passing,     that
in 1816 Thomas Carlyle                    came     to  Kirkcaldy,    so   that we find        two
 men who were to become                   famous, and       a boy who, in his own           war,
 was    to    rise    to   eminence,         living in close proximity.              The     boy,
 young      as   he was, no doubt felt the                influence of his teacher, and
possibly of Carlyle also             ;   for two such       spirits in a small place like
 Kirkcaldy could not fail                 to stir up old and young who                came in
contact with them, especially those who had any leanings toward
science and literature.                The boy Sang must have been deeply im
pressed with          Irving's method of          teaching,    for in after years he used,
 when occasion served, to give at the meetings of the Royal Scottish
 Society of Arts vivid descriptions of his school life at Kirkcaldy.
 He told how Irving              made       the   boys   throw down their books and
 go off with him to field or sea shore to work out problems                            in land-
 surveying,        astronomy,          and      navigation.      To young and ardent
 minds no method of teaching could be more                               fascinating.        The
 pupils were fortunate in having such a teacher.                            Of   the progress
the boy made during the first two years of his school life we may
judge by referring              to     a   prize    he  then obtained.          We find       the
following inscribed on              a   copy of Vince's Hydraulics : —

 Subscription School for his progress in the Higher Class of Mathematics.

     Sang was not much of                   a  letter-writer, so that there is little in
 the way of correspondence to weave                         into such      a   notice as    this.
There is one letter, however, the first he wrote, which is peculiarly
 interesting,      as   it  gives a good idea of what he, a lad of eleven years
 of age, and       bis     brother,     a little older, were thinking about.                The
 letter is addressed,            " Mr David Sang, Brucefield, Dunfermline,"
and is as follows           : —

Here     we have a boy eleven years of age — an               age at which many
boys are scarcely out of the nursery           — getting     a  prize for his pro
gress   in  the higher    class   of mathematics, and evidently busy with
mechanics, astronomy, French, and Latin.                 Continuing his school
life, and no doubt working hard, he obtained another prize in 1817,
on which was inscribed         : —
    " This  book was presented to Edward Sang by the Patrons of the Kirkcaldy
Subscription School as a reward for his diligence, and a testimony of his
success in the study of Mathematics during the Session that closed this day,
the 1st November 1817.                       (Signed)       "Edward Irving."
The book       was   Legendre's     EUments     de GSometrie.        The boy was
then twelve years of age.           Before leaving the story of his school
life,  a  short extract from      a letter written by the Rev.        Dr Martin a
number of years after may be read.                  He    says  : — " Mr Edward
Bang has been known to me from his infancy.                        He began very
early     to show     an uncommon         inclination toward         mathematical
science,     and  a   peculiar   aptness for it.      As    an   amateur of that
science,    I  had my attention       drawn    to his talent for it while he
was, with some of my own family,              a  pupil in    an academy in this
town in which mathematics were then taught with remarkable
success.      I still remember the surprise excited by the acute and
comprehensive        solutions he gave of the problems, theorems,             and
questions presented to his class."
    The Subscription School was broken up in 1818, and in the first
year of his teens the boy joined the University of Edinburgh under
Professor Leslie, and had to take the second class for mathematics,
there being no third or advanced class for that session.                   He was
small for his age, and on his appearance in the class-room he was
greeted with laughter by his fellow-students, big fellows, who no
doubt wondered what such a youngster was to do in such a class.
But the laughter       soon gave place to surprise and admiration.           Next
session    there was still no advanced class, and he had again to take
the second mathematical           class, under Professor       Wallace.    During

     After leaving     college   he  commenced      and continued for some
                        of surveyor and civil engineer,       and then became
 years the practice
 a teacher of mathematics       in Edinburgh.       In 1828    he was elected a
 Fellow of    the   Koyal Scottish Society of Arts,        and during his    long
 connection with that body he brought before it some of his most
 valuable papers.        We have here a list of his writings, 112 in
 number, on      a   great   variety of subjects connected         with Mathe
 matics,    Natural    Philosophy,     Horology,    Astronomy,     Engineering,
 etc., besides   his great work on Logarithms.             A glance over these
 gives one an idea of the diversified character of his studies, and
 suggests the query as to whether his work as a whole would not
 have been more valuable had he confined himself to a few, instead
 of dealing with so many subjects.           It has been said that there is
 plausibility   in asking, " not if     a man can do many things             well,
 but   if ho has done one thing supremely."            There are some minds —
  minds of    a high order, too — fitted to attack and stick to special
  work, and it would be a wonder and               a   disappointment    if  then-
  work was not supreme.          Sang was not one of those       ; nevertheless,
  he did many things supremely, but could not be a specialist                 The
  variety of his papers       shows that clearly     ;  and while there is no
  time even to read over their titles, a few may be noticed in their
  order as having been received with marked favour and approbation.
  In  1829 he published a small work containing an account              of  a new
  method    of solving numerical- equations,      the first of the many works
  that came from his hands.             About    1830    Professor Wheatstone
  exhibited a very beautiful series of curves, produced by fixing                 a
  polished ball on the end of a wire and causing it to vibrate.               This

                                 Obituary Notices.                                xxi
was shown in Edinburgh, and attracted Sang's attention.                     He went
into    a consideration of the subject,          and made the discovery that
every wire, no matter what may be the form of the hole through
which it     has been drawn, has one direction in which the flexibility
is greatest, and another, at right angles, in which the flexibility is
least.      He tells that he was startled by finding that theory led him
to believe    that,  if  the rapidity of vibrations       in  the one direction be
double of that in the other, the common parabola should be the
 result.     He then drew out curves         according to theory, and manu
factured wires of the proper proportions             as indicated by the theory,
 and found     a perfect    coincidence between the actual and computed
 phenomena.         In    1831   he exhibited      before     the   Royal Scottish
 Society of Arts these wires, with their silvor knobs, and the beauty
 of the curves      was much admired.           They never ceased to charm
 him, and he often brought them out to show to friends.                    In  1889,
 after a lapse of fifty -eight years, he again brought the subject before
 the   Society of Arts, and         exhibited    a  new set of wires ho had
 recently made.         In  1838 he read     a   paper to the Society of Arts,
 describing    a  Dioptric    Light  erected at    Kirkcaldy,      and he also gave
 a  description and exhibited drawings of the apparatus he used for
 cutting the annular lens to the true optical figure.                For that  paper
 he was awarded the           Keith Medal, value         20 sovereigns.      In  pre
 senting the medal,         Sir John Graham            Dalziol    stated  that " no
 opportunity had hitherto occurred since the Keith fund came into
 the possession of the        Society for awarding that prize.           Now, how
 ever,   it  was highly     gratifying   to find one of the          most  scientific,
 useful, and meritorious of all who had been connected with the
 Society, Mr Edward Sang,             entitled    to   this eminent distinction.
 His skill, his labours      and unremitting exertions in various scientific
 departments, were too well known              to be embellished by any com
 mentary."       In   18 tO   he was presented        with   the   Society of Arts
 Silver Medal,     value   10 sovereigns,   for his papers on the " Construc
 tion of Circular Signal Towers," on the
                                                     " Ejects of the Curvature
 of Railways," and for his valuable essays on Life Assurance.                  For   a
 period of several years he lectured on Natural                Philosophy,    and in
 1841 he became Professor of Mechanical Science in the Manchester
 New College.        Shortly after, he wont to Constantinople to assist in
 establishing schools of civil engineering, and in laying out railroads

in Turkey.         He   assisted   in  the    erection of ironworks       at   Zeitra
Buruni, and       was afterwards       engaged     in  several colleges  completir:
the courses      of education.       In addition      to this work, he proceeded
to compile treatises        on the    Method of Co-ordinates, on the Differ
ential and Integral         Calculus, on Mechanics, Hydrostatics,             and   the
Elements of Physical Astronomy.                   This   arduous   task was    accom
plished by means of oral lectures in the Turkish language,                  of   which
full   notes were taken by the pupils, and these notes were extended
by the students and compared.                 By this    means accuracy     of idiom
was secured, and the          precision of the technical terms taken from
the Arabic was ascertained.
    Sang never let an opportunity slip of helping truth or correcting
error, and he took advantage            of an approaching event which led             to
this, and also gave him a chance of dispelling fear and removing
superstition.       The solar eclipse of 1847 was close at hand, and was
to be annular, and almost central              as  seen from Constantinople,         so
he computed its details          with    great   care, and prepared large draw
ings, with     a  descriptive notice in French.           These were presented       to
the    Sultan through his Excellency              Lord Cowley.        Notices     were
also given in the       Turkish and French          newspapers,    accompanied by
lithographed drawings on            a  smaller scale, while prints were freely
distributed with an explanation              in Turkish.       "With a great roll of
these     prints under his arm for distribution,              Sang often went to
out-of-the-way places and into the bazaars.                   The priests were the
worst to deal with, and were most unwilling to touch the prints,
saying that no man should meddle with such matters,                          as   they
belonged      to God alone.       But many of        them listened to reason, and
a   little sensible     talk helped generally to overcome            their scruples.
 The excitement was great, and the preparation of pieces of smoked
 glass was carried on most vigorously by large numbers                  of the    com
 munity     as the  predicted time of the eclipse approached.               In   those
 days the uneducated classes            looked upon eclipses with terror           and
 consternation,      as   in many places        the}-   still do.   There    are few
 amongst ourselves,        even   now, who are free from awe and wonder
 when there is a total eclipse, and the weird and unnatural darkness
 sends bird and beast         into seclusion, and brings about           a deathlike
silence.
    The Sultan had made great preparations for the coming                       event.

"With telescope and chronometer at hand, he waited for the second
which Sang foretold that the commencement of the wonderful
phenomenon would take place.               And, sure enough, the very-
moment which was predicted saw the beginning of the interference
with the sun's light.      The firing of guns, the blowing of trumpets,
the beating of drums and shouting now began, that being thought
the only way to bring back the sun's light and prevent the disasters
which it was believed would certainly follow.           The Sultan at once
sent out his officers to stop all that, and the end of Sang's labours
was accomplished by the dispelling of superstition and the quelling
of the alarm which had always accompanied the natural but un
common deviation from the daily gradation of light and darkness.
This   was a triumph     of science which had      a  lasting effect on the
population    of Constantinople,     for it not only removed in         a  great
measure    the superstition of the people, but also excited and stimu
lated the students to such a degree       that it led to the details of the
next eclipse of 1851      being computed and prepared by Sang's fifth
class, at the  Imperial College, Muhendis-hana Berri.
    In 1849 he was elected      a  Fellow of this, the Koyal Society of
Edinburgh, and there were few, perhaps, who took a keener interest
in its proceedings. In 1851 he was invited by a circular of the
 British Association,    sent at the instance of the secretary of the
 Boyal Scottish Society of Arts, Edinburgh, to proceed to Russia
 for observing the total eclipse of the sun. The shortness of the
 notice, and the calmness of the weather during              the voyage, pre
 vented   him   from   reaching    farther   than   Sevastopol,      where    he
 arrived just when the eclipse       began, so that he could do nothing         ;
 and the only result of the trip was to intensify       a  longing to return
 to Scotland.    There are few Scotsmen who go abroad but are at
 Bome period of their     exile seized with nostalgia, and sometimes          in
 such  a fashion  as not to be conquered.      It  was so   in this  case.   He
 resigned his situation, greatly against the wish of Fethi Pasha, who
 would   not give his formal      consent.    Nevertheless      Sang returned
 to Edinburgh in 1854, and resumed his former                 occupation as    a
 teacher of mathematics.
    During his residence in Constantinople he won              the respect and
 esteem of all the various nationalities with whom            he came in con
 tact, notwithstanding      the  differences of religion        and  race,   and

remembrance         in the colleges in which he was professor.                 In    1889,
shortly before his death,         a  young Turkish gentleman being in                   this
country, could not leave it without             finding out and coming to                see
the kodja    — the     teacher — of whom      he had heard so much, and wb:
was always spoken of with admiring respect and affection.
    In  1856 he read a paper on the Gyroscope in relation to his sug
gestion of a new experiment which would demonstrate                        the rotation
of the earth, and he claimed that he had clearly proved this by
experiment in 1836,         — eighteen    years before       Foucalt performed           his
experiment at the meetings of the British Association in Liverpool.
In connection with this, Professor Baden Powell, in a letter to Pro
                                         "
fessor Piazzi Smythe, says : — I have just received,                         I presume
through you,       a copy   of Mr Sang's    paper on
                                                         '
                                                            Rotation.'      Pray thank
him from me         if you  have an opportunity.          It   is extremely interest
ing to find how completely he anticipated the idea so long                           ago."
Professor Chevallier also wrote to          Smythe, saying : — "        If poor     Arago
                                                                         '
were still alive he would, as a Frenchman, feel himself                    like  a wood
cock    caught in his own springe,' for he always held that                      a paper
 communicated to a recognised           public scientific society, and regularly
 entered    in their Proceedings, was to all intents and purposes                          a
 publication      to   the  world of an invention.               Mr Sang       must be
 no ordinary man          to have    conceived     so  clearly the solution          of so
 difficult a question      by mechanical means.            I   hope that his       claims
 will now    be made generally known."
    In   1862     Provost Sang, one of the promoters of the Kirkcaldy
 Subscription       School, died, aged       91   years.
     In  1879 the Institution        of Civil Engineers, London, awarded                  to
 Sang the Telford          Premium     for his paper on           " A Search      for the
 Optimum System of Wheel Teeth."                    The paper contains         elaborate
 and intricate       calculations, undertaken with           a   view to discover       the
 best form of wheel teeth           to adopt as a standard, in order to avoid
 the   lack of uniformity which had              so  long existed.         Another      im
 portant paper was read by him to the Society of Arts in                        1861 on
  " The Determination of         the Form of a Ship's           Hull by    means of      an
 Analytic Expression," its object being to improve naval                    architecture
 and substitute         a scientific method, instead of rule-of-thumb                  and
 guesswork,      in hull construction        The Society referred the           paper to

a     committee,           which reported most                favourably      upon      it,   stating
that "         the author deserved great credit for the analytical                       skill    and
ingenuity           he had displayed in the investigation, which                       must have
cost him much thought and great labour in computing from their
equations, and tracing                a   large number of curves, in order to obtain
the requisite familiarity with the use of the formulae, and also for the
purpose of constructing the model which was shown."                                    This paper
was awarded the highest prize the Society could give, viz., the
Keith Prize,             value    30 sovereigns.              On the 8th December 1873
he read         a   paper giving      a   description of      a   new machine for the hand-
spinning of rope yarn.                    The machine was shown in action, and the
work           performed by its beautifid                    compound motion was much
admired.             Any length of              rope    could be spun without                 having
recourse         to the long rope-walks                 commonly used.            In    188G this
Society presented                him with         the     Maedougall-Brisbane           Prize      for
1882-84 for his paper                 "On       the Need for Decimal Sub-Divisions                     in
Astronomy and Navigation, and on Tables therefor."
      Our learned           Fellow,       Lord M'Laren, who was in the chair,                          in
making the presentation,                  said    that " Dr     Sang's paper covers           a   wide
range of inquiry, embracing various branches                             of pure mathematics,
mechanics,           and    optics, as well as the applications of these sciences
to practical astronomy,               chronomctry, and naval architecture.                         No
considerations,             save zeal      for the advancement               of science and            a
    benevolent       desire to lighten the labours of future computors,                        could
have induced               Dr Sang         to    undertake        such   a   gigantic task,            or
have sustained              him through the wearisome                    mass of mechanical
detail which overlaid the more interesting parts of his occupation."
Time      will      not permit of noticing more of his work,                      a    fraction of
which has only been touched                      upon, but enough            to show what the
man was and what he did.                         Everything he gave his mind to                   as   a
philosopher           was undertaken             with     an honest,       conscientious,         and
single-minded              devotion to science          ;    and everything        he     put his
hand to as           a   craftsman        was marked with            a   beauty   of design,           a
faultless        precision    and delicacy of finish, of which the most skilled
workman             might be proud.              It    may    be added       that accuracy             in
    workmanship was insisted on by him to an extent that to many in
    times past      seemed useless.             In this   he surely anticipated what was
    comincr,    for the marvellous development                    of automatic    machinery —

  xx vi         Proceedings       of Royal Society of Edinburgh..
  especially in America, in which accuracy is a sine qua non — shows
  how true his instinct was, and how correct his views were regard
  ing the designing and construction of tools.            Even in small matters
  his love of accuracy crops up, for he had his drawing-pens                  fitted
  with screws having divisions on their milled               heads    representing
  lines of different breadths, to which the pen could at once be set.
  He was     a beautiful draughtsman, and was never at a loss,            with pen
  or pencil, in making clear even complicated pieces of mechanism.
      The man of      science goes to nature and asks pointed questions.         To
  these, up to a certain limit, he gets answers of precision ; but           philo
  sophers are not       inclined to stop there, and they     go on asking ques
  tions to which they can get no possible solution.             Why 1 is ever on
  their lips  ;  and when there is no answer, or one which is unsatisfac
  tory, belief in the existence of a Supreme Euler and Governor is apt
  to vanish,      and Doubt sits down in the empty chair from which
  Faith has been driven.           Sang was not one of that class.        He never
  obtruded his opinions on such matters, but his belief in              a Supreme
  Ruler was strong and unequivocal.              If he alluded to the subject it
   was always in the most reverential spirit.             In an address he gave
   at the   Jubilee of the Society of Arts in           1867,    he said :—
                                                                             " The
   exquisitely-carved        shell of the minutest     diatom    reveals arrange
   ments and contrivances infinitely beyond all that man has done or
   ever  will do ; and we place our hands upon our mouths, our faces
   in the dust, in the       presence  of a wisdom that we cannot begin to
   comprehend, of         a goodness   that overwhelms us."        In   a paper   he
   read in 1884 he        concluded by saying : — " Of     the  untiring goodness,
   the unfathomable wisdom evident in all that passes around us, even
   in the mysterious complexity of human life, let             us recall what has
          said, — He

   laws.'
          "     On    a large telescope     which he mounted himself for the
   Wray lens       he got from      the Institution of Civil Engineers, he in
    scribed that precious motto in golden characters in Turkish and
    English; and when, in          times   of depression, from which few are
    exempt, he felt that his labours were not rewarded as they should
    have been, we can fancy him getting comfort and inspiration from
    such a motto.         But he was       a busy   man, and the busy man is
    generally   a  happy man.        Reason rather than memory was what he
    valued and appealed to in connection with his pupils.              Parrot- work

he hated, and the palaver of a dilettante he met with ridicule.                  He
received a grant of £100 per annum from Government                     as a recog
nition of his valuable scientific work            ; and the associated     Scottish
life assurance offices, feeling that some substantial recompense was
due to him for his logarithms             and actuarial tables, at a meeting in
1878 resolved to recommend to the offices                    the payment of an
annuity of £100        . .   .  .  for the remainder of his life, which was
agreed to and subscribed                by  the offices.     His great work      on
Logarithms,     faultless as     it is believed   to be  for accuracy, is  a monu
ment not only to his mathematical skill, but to his tenacity of pur
pose and love of science.            There are few who for forty years could
have, with what may be termed intermittent                 continuity, persevered
with such     a colossal     work     ;  and the pity of it is that forty -seven
volumes of such valuable matter for astronomers, navigators, and
others should be lying uncared for and useless.                Such a work surely
demands the care of Government or some of the learned societies.
In   1881  he was made corresponding                member of the Eoyal Tunis
Academy.       In   1883 he was honoured by being made an                 LL.D.   of
Edinburgh University, and in 1884 he was made an honorary mem
ber of the Franklin Institute, Philadelphia. In 1889, feeling his
advanced age telling upon him, he resigned the post of secretary to
the Society of Arts        ;   and his last paper to this Society, on
                                                                             " The
Extension    of Brouncker's          Method," was written in       1890, and read
by Professor Tait on the 15th December.                  For  some months before
this he had been failing in bodily health, but his mind was clear
and undisturbed.         Four days before his death he dictated letters,
 and also wrote some himself; but the end was near, and on the
 23rd of December he died, within a few days of reaching the age of                  .
 86 years.    A   long-lived      race   were the Sangs — Eobert reached          93
 years, David 88, Edward of Kirkcaldy                 91, and    Edward, our late
 Fellow,   86, giving    an average         of close on 90 years      for the four
 generations.
    The mourners, who were honoured in having been chosen by
 himself to attend and pay the last tribute of respect at his funeral
 were all sincere friends, who grieved over the loss they had sus
 tained in the departure of one whom they loved and deeply respected,
 not only as a man, but also for his great and varied learning.
    Few have lived with such                an  enthusiastic    and single-minded

devotion to science, and his rewards in a worldly sense were far
from commensurate with his great and valuable labours.                              In writ
ing this paper a free use has been made of the Transactions of the
Royal Scottish Society of Arts, a short autobiography, and informa
tion kindly supplied by the Misses Sang.                    It     may fitly be closed
by   a      quotation from one of Miss Sang's letters.                  Speaking of       her
father, she says            :—
                               " To   investigate, to endeavour if possible to reach
the fundamental               principle, and so be able to build           a     firm super
structure on a sure foundation, was a passion with him in which he
found         a   happiness few could realise, and lie was always ready to
communicate to others from his own stores."                       Let    us hope that     the
promise of his favourite motto is being amply fulfilled in another
sphere,           where he now finds how          true it   is,   with reference to a
Supreme Euler, that
                    " He rewardeth                 the searcher and the keeper              of
